pleased better caliphronas burst out laughing putting hand behind head leant back against trunk of elm do hear friend sir said to rector think that prefer that dull smoky town to country why athens be too narrow for love open land plain mountain sea up in city of yours be weary spoke to priest of friend oh cried will die of want of air in place take to wood where can breathe see sun so gave that

glance at maurice then observed in indifferent voice when do what be requested to do men looked steadily at one seemed to maurice a though there be certain amount of menace visible on face of caliphronas such look speedily passed away bounded lightly across turf to where cat be sitting to surprise of rector maurice let stranger take up in arm smooth fur dear dear said rector in astonished tone what power do posse over animal world count cat will not let one touch a rule oh animal take to replied caliphronas lightly letting cat down gently on ground can do anything with horse dog

childish soul meanwhile maurice who have be thinking over matter came to conclusion that must ask caliphronas to stay at grange for few day at first sight seemed rather injudicious when remembered high character of man who vouched for respectability of greek scruple vanished besides caliphronas be such peculiar character that desired closer acquaintance with above must not hope anywhere to find such perfect model for endymion taking then fact into consideration speedily made up mind to ask count to be guest did so without delay count said politely be afraid will find that inn very uncomfortable so must be glad to see at grange for week so where think will find in more civilized quarter count eye flashed with what looked uncommonly like triumph dropped lid over rapidly for

intended to ask caliphronas to be guest be rather startled by maurices precipitancy on whole be not ill pleased for two reason first being that did not much care about burdening with eccentric foreigner second that be delighted that during stay of count at grange maurice must take to modelling again by way said maurice turning suddenly to count do know one called crispin creespeen repeated caliphronas with foreign accent know name be gentleman who be staying with replied roylands carelessly a be pretty well acquainted with part of world thought might have met greek smilingly denied that

asking to grange still archdeacon letter to carriston be sufficient guarantee that be not swindler so will chance must now say good by said caliphronas to rector thank for kindness of course will see soon again oh yes must come here a often a can will not be much if be to sit for artist laughed caliphronas turning to maurice good by sir will see to night at six oclock turned away gayly left garden followed by admiring eye of two men especially of maurice who congratulated on good fortune in obtaining perfect model meanwhile caliphronas be walking swiftly in direction of royland arm good muttered to in greek first step be taken so have fear now chapter v crispin be puzzled ive seen before where forget yet somewhere of yore ive seen before meet once more strangerand yet ive seen before where forget up down long terrace in front of grange walked crispin from rapt expression of face must seem a though be composing poetry a matter of fact be thinking about eunice course of true love did not run smooth by mean for mr dengelton having found daughter in company of poet have marched off former in order to lecture about latter substance therefore having be taken away crispin be left with only shadow in other word from speaking to eunice be reduced to thinking of eunice be not by mean so pleasant position of affair uncomfortable state of thing be due to discovery made by mr dengelton that daughter have previous evening be engaged in moongazing with poet fact astute parrot extracted with wonderful dexterity from reluctant daughter mr dengelton have talked good deal about family romance a related to rector maurice whereupon eunice having be asked question concerning same be forced to admit that have be absent during recital mother at once pounced down on damaging admission like hawk pressed poor girl so mercilessly with question that be obliged to tell of pleasant half hour on terrace in company with crispin on making discovery mr dengelton be too wise to reproach daughter thereby run risk of making deaf to voice of charmer ie resist mother desire in connection with matrimony no elder lady said nothing about what considered to be act of madness privately determined to keep crispin eunice apart by mean in power be on watch morning having finished daily papersfor mr dengelton prided on universal knowledge of what be going on in worldwent out to look for eunice who have disappeared a expected found in company of poet whereupon made ladylike excusemrs dengelton be adept at telling white liesand took eunice away to room where kept busy with letter writing crispin therefore deprived of company of inamorata be by mean in cheerful mood regretted that eunice have not sufficient strength of mind to defy mother end trouble by marrying without delay have very impulsive nature must have liked to sweep away obstacle by sheer force of insistence that marriage must take place at once impulse be in great measure restrained by experience in school of world saw that must be wiser to watch wait already be seriously thinking of ending visit returning to town in order to enlist great friend lady bentwitch on side a such fashionable personage might be able to talk mr dengelton into assenting to marriage in spite of strength of character be reluctant to leave eunice even for short space of week so like as between two bundle of hay must not quite make up mind course to take when saw maurice coming leisurely along terrace conversation ensued between enabled to at once settle future movement when master of roylands reached side crispin be struck with unusual vivacity of face gloomy look generally wore have quite disappeared in place be alert eager expression showed that maurice be deeply interested in important matter dear roylands cried crispin in astonishment why transformation yesterday be plunged in gloom to day romeo on way to juliet looked not so happy who be enchanteror will say enchantresswho have worked miracle rector

be knight of rueful countenance now eunice cela va sans dire said maurice leaning elbow on balustrade oh look so astonished monsieur cupid be not so blind what can see how thing stand between psyche take credit to yourself when none be due replied crispin significantly mr carriston drew attention to position did not see for be true enough how did guess that rector told because be too much wrapped up in to notice unhappy lover unhappy lover yes love eunice affection be returned there be obstacle prevents marriage obstacle be mr dengelton want eunice to marry there always two to bargain said maurice grimly dont want to marry eunice oh dont love a cousin yes a possible wife then there be chance for must say there be chance for remarked roylands in friendly manner be young famous know one go everywhere be adored of gentle sex so what more can eunice mother desire eunice desire nothingexcept a for mr dengelton think be poor oh be poor on contrary be very well off then why dont place perfection before dear aunt persuade into consenting to match dont want to do soyet said crispin with hesitation why mystery can not tell just now may be certain there be nothing wrong about mystery

surprise dear roylands be not very sudden friendship be not friendship at well when man asks to house to stayto be introduced to relativesit be uncommonly like friendship be not so conventional a most englishman said maurice impatiently therefore act by rule daresay must have made inquiry about past of greek before asking to house a far a go be riddle yourself crispin sallow cheek flushed at home thrust have great self command replied quietly enough be rather hard thing to say of thought be friend pardon old fellow said roylands penitently did not mean to be so rude have abominable temper must be kicked for saying thing in own house will let off kicking replied crispin recovering good humor a very truly say be riddle will explain soon still count caliphronas do know name have faint idea have heard before in greece most probably know isle of greece very well ah be that quotation from byron pointed remark in other word be serious chance shot latteri only quoted from don juan why do ask

speech without moving muscle strange look came into eye have ever read strange story by lytton asked abruptly yes several time replied maurice somewhat astonished at irrelevancy of question then doe man resemble margrave hero of book in what way in way except mysticism be ardent lover of nature doe talk lot about classical time be impulsive utterly selfish a to last quality have not yet have opportunity of judging for rest have described exactly caliphronas murmured crispin in pondering manner do know crispin did not answer at once seemed to be making up mind a to what must say at last turned to maurice with enigmatic smile on face shrugged shoulder not a far a can recollect description have given a applied to margrave must suit good many greek be mostly handsome especially among island from living so much in open air imbibe great love for nature naturally a have modern glory to talk about boast of ancient time ancient heroism be impulsive so see simply described greek at large not one in particular have described exactly tell description suit greek a have explained then dont know man know one of name of caliphronas replied crispin with slight emphasis on last word maurice did not notice quibble with cheerful good humor dismissed subject from mind a after mystery with enveloped count might turn out to be unworthy suspicion plenty of greek come to england one more le did not matter must trouble head more about man who have dropped from cloud into dull little village make use of a model then say good by to with best grace in world once left grange be unlikely must ever cross path again a maurice have not slightest intention of going to greece looked forward to humdrum life at roylands for next few year how little did know what be in store for that from appearance of count caliphronas dated new era in life meanwhile crispin who in reality knew good deal more than chose to tell be watching keenly must not relapse into gloomy fit again said laying hand lightly on friend arm intend to replied maurice cheerfully now see excellence of rector advice take interest in life will be happy be taking interest in wooing of eunice in caliphronas why caliphronas because be endymion in flesh be going to create wonderful statue crispin like of have not be seen since day of canova a to riddle of caliphronas will solve together perhaps solution may be easier than think crispin know something about man nonsense tell know one called caliphronas name may be assumed said maurice shrewdly be sure have met owner of one before meet so many people replied crispin carelessly be probable may have seen really can tell nothing about himyet ah then will day dear roylands said crispin impatiently caliphronas past life be becoming quite mania with dont know man from description fancy have met though a said before such description must apply to dozen of other levantine greek when see will tell if recognize what then may be only casual acquaintance therefore will not know history if mistrusted look must not have asked to grange dear fellow be on account of look did ask be endymion remember be right be making mountain out of molehill still there be excuse for unique specimen of humanity like caliphronas doe not appear day in village like roylands so be natural must be curious about there will say no more about brother mystery be going to have interview with bailiff may thank star friend be poet not landed proprietor maurice sauntered away laughing looking by mean kind of man to overburden with work crispin remained leaning over balustrade of terrace gazing absently at silver spray of fountain glittering in sunlight thinking deeply wonder what want here thought poet with frown on expressive face man like doe not come down to quiet village for nothing can be to see be impossible a must not know be here curious never saw in london for must have be there at same time a unless indeed have just arrived in england have scheme in head be certainif must only see alone fathom motif oh fox cunning a be will foil be good be after friend im sure of that walked forward few pace still pondering then resumed soliloquizing in muttered tone roylands said caliphronas be coming over about six oclock be staying at royland arm so think will walk over there see will attract attention wish to tell roylands nothing yet will send note will not do ah have will wait at park gate speak to before come up to house one will know can find out reason of presence here decidedly poet be remarkably mysterious person not only a concerned own personality also a regarded brilliant stranger who be so equally enigmatic if maurice found life dull now evidently be not going to be so for length of time although knew not element of romance have come into in most unexpected way in person of crispin constantine caliphronas having made up mind poet thought more about greek strolled round side of house to see if eunice be at window knew that mr dengelton especially affected small boudoir in left wing of grange window of be only slightly raised above terrace at window crispin felt sure eunice must be fortunately for be right in conjecture for on arriving in sight of casement saw eunice sitting at in dejected attitude evidently expectant of visit from lover miss dengelton said cautiously not knowing that dragon might be within hearing therefore adopting society manner have gone out of room for few minute said lady in frightened whisper do go away what when coast be clear not if know expect back minute very well till arrives can talk about even when doe can surely chat about weather heard laughing with maurice yes be quite gay to day have found model for statue of endymion village bumpkin greek gentleman greek pray what be greek doing down here crispin shrugged shoulder im sure dont know will see to night so dont fall in love with why must be very handsome dont care for handsome men be so conceited humph be not compliment to well be not conceited be handsome be handsome enough for at event said eunice coquettishly what charming compliment replied crispin gayly for will give rose hush here come mother crispin ala have not heard warning having plucked finest rose must see returned to window to find confronted by gaudy figure of parrot whose beady eye sparkled maliciously a approached what rose for dear mr crispin said stretching out hand in crispin be unwillingly compelled to place flower how kind of young men of to day be gallant after look eunice be not flower charming almost a charming a be mr crispin rose of sharonoh shirazyou see ive read book now have time to talk dear mr crispin so must go away for present at event will meet at luncheon if be very good may bring in rose mr dengelton having thus vanquished enemy disappeared with daughter shut window upon poor crispin walked away in rage old cat said be certainly neither polite poetical chapter vi sub rosa secret absurd leading to woe only be heard under rose maiden refuse lover propose just a choose under rose how scandal spread nobody know for be said under rose when anything marvellous occurs in real life wiseacre shake head say wonderful extraordinary truth be stranger than fiction when novel contains incident out of common same inconsistent people refuse to believe on plea that fiction be not stranger than truth entirely forget fiction be reflection of real life that man can imagine nothing merely reproduces what see around sceptic will objectfairy tale well dear doubter how do know that fairy tale contain germ of truth there may have be fairy in earlier age of world if so chronicle of fairyland be a authentic a of englandperhaps more so seeing history be tinctured more le with partisanship who must have believed in mammoth have not huge beast be reconstructed by cuvier in moa have not skeleton of gigantic bird be discovered in new zealand nay there be doubtless much truth in extravagant travel of marco polo sir john mandeville such like wanderer middle age be time of improbability not of impossibility for little be known of geographical world well of nineteenth century have discovered possible continent assume that know everything such be not case for though may have exhausted geographical world know comparatively few of secret of nature pebble parable of sir isaac newton will here occur to many mind applies a truly to time a to own earth sky water be full of secret many of yet defy effort to learn catalogue century have be prolific of discovery even add hundred year of fresh revelation nature will still give riddle to solve out of exhaustless store therefore when coincidence occurs in fiction though may be improbable be not impossible who take trouble to keep eye open mental a well a physical eye will in nearly case find counterpart of ideal in real here then be two mysterious individual who masquerading under name of crispin caliphronas meet one in most unexpected manner in most unexpected place wiseacre will at once say impossible going on theory set forth a before such meeting be not impossible probable fate destiny fortunewhatever be name of power guide circumstancesdelights in surprise quite a much a doe novelist therefore why must believe first doubt second be inconsistent therefore if who read be wise in generation broad in view of probability will see nothing impossible in unexpected meeting of poet adventurer caliphronas be adventurer pure simple of course a regard vocation a free lance not a touching moral physical quality have come to england with distinct end in view already have made first step to accomplishment of end whether intention be good bad remains to be seen if dear reader can not tell quality of design from character of man a before described must perforce remain in ignorance even a crispin remained for truth to tell that astute individual be for once in life really truly puzzled knew caliphronas in greek water under name having have considerable experience of character be quite confident that have object in view for thus making appearance at roylands with determination of finding out that object thwarting if couldfor crispin have very great love for greekour poet walked down to park gate between hour of five six with intention of having interview with mysterious stranger in own mind be by mean certain of identity of caliphronas with person thought be doubt must only be solved by personal view of greek description given by maurice so tallied with image of certain individual that crispin felt sure that conclusion have arrived at be correct one in order however to end doubt on subject wanted to personally interview count before set foot in roylands grange have with considerable dexterity carried out plan without exciting suspicion thing be anxious to avoid if possible pleading headachethat convenient excusehe have managed to give friend slip though truth to tell took more trouble over securing such secrecy than be absolutely necessary for maurice fired by idea of recommencing work have retreated to studio remained there afternoon mr dengelton still kept watchful eye upon daughter on one plea kept away from too fascinating poet so in reality crispin be left entirely to own device therefore utilized such good fortune by seeking important interview with unknown greek so hot have be day that crispin felt certain sense of relief when coolness of night approached lingering under mighty oak bordered avenue luxuriated in delightful twilight be wholly of night day partakes equally of air be still warm there be pleasant shade over sky a night gradually drew dusky veil across glaring blue from east to west shaft of crimson light shot through wood through dense foliage crispin must see at time rosy flame of setting sun still vocal be bird for be now singing good night to day in short time nothing must be heard occasional chirp from belated thrush until with moon came divine nightingale to flood thicket with song restless gnat be dancing in front of face a strolled down avenue at time bat must flit noiselessly through warm air while mellowed by distance chime of roylands church rang musically on ear six oclock said poet to glancing at watch suppose caliphronas will be here shortly roylands sent dog cart if be man imagine will send on trap in charge of groom walk over to grange on perfect evening at moment heard noise of approaching wheel shortly afterwards dogcart drawn by fast trotting mare flashed past containing only groom luggage finding conjecture thus prove correct crispin did not trouble to go farther on way to seek caliphronas a gentleman be bound to meet in avenue so lounging against mighty trunk of oak lazily waited approach of individual concerning whose intention entertained such doubt will crown with rose to meet thee beloved why dost thou fly at sight of wreath hot sun hath withered truly heart be burnt up by thine eye dead heart dead rose love undying caliphronas be singing word in greek crispin at once recognized voice of singer recognition immediately confirmed suspicion a to identity of gentleman will live in wood beloved berry will be food on berry kiss must live always till fate destroyed robbed of berry kiss life forever ive heard singing that song at melnos muttered crispin quietly to be what can be doing here at moment singer came in sight walking rapidly up avenue with springy step swinging stick to fro a sang be indeed sight worth looking at a bounded lightly over earth antus like drawing fresh vigor at pressure of foot on ground yet undeniable beauty excited feeling of repulsion in breast of crispin who now knew only too well be strange contrast two men poet small dark unhandsome fire of intellect in eye adventurer splendid animal with nothing physical perfection to recommend caliphronas did not notice poet leaning against tree came on carelessly singing a walked what will do for thee beloved oh will do many deed of daring will slay turk in pride head will be wedding gift behold here stopped suddenly catching sight of crispin instead of being astonished at unexpected meeting a poet expected simply stood still leaning on stick laughing at look on others face ah ah creespeen said in greek with smile did not expect to see in place certainly did not retorted crispin in same language marvelling at self possession of man ive doubt meeting be unexpected on side not with oh that priestthe papa saw morning told be here friend also informed of presence what be doing here ah be long story good creespeen replied caliphronas coolly one choose to tell have design in head assuredly said count mockingly must not come to cold island for pleasure ah see be a great scoundrel a ever caliphronas laughed seemed in wise offended at scornful tone of other for such epithet englishman must have struck utterer caliphronas did not even frown only notice took of crispin rudeness be to raise eyebrow in mocking surprise have still bad opinion of see very worst what truly good young man be said count sardonically regret that must be forced to keep company with scamp a be be afraid will have to make up mind to orgo away will certainly not do latter until find out reason of presence in place then dear friend will have to stay here forever be going to stay here forever be down here on business with rectorwith roylands with whom count looked at with provoking smile flung on grass at foot of oak against crispin be leaning perhaps with perhaps with now listen to caliphronasas be name choose to go by mr carriston mr roylands be friend of mine if have come down here with bad design in head against of will make business to thwart do so by mean if can can do so by very simple mean though seem to doubt said crispin quietly brought excellent letter of introduction to mr carriston though how came by know have made friend with roylands who be simple fellow by consenting to be model for endymion very good model too interrupted caliphronas looking at complacently dont deny outward goodlinessit be pity mind be not in keeping to come back to what be saying have made friend with gentleman speak of perhaps such friendship be necessary to plan if so will end how will manage said count coolly with nasty glitter in eye simply by telling who be what be will not do will if design be bad how do know design be bad because to man of nature goodness be impossible must not go so far a to say be impossible said caliphronas with sneer agree with that be improbable to mind goodness be weakness one dont posse im afraid do wish to posse replied count insolently may not draw attention to fact that be long past six that roylands dines at seven be terribly hungry can call attention to fact retorted crispin promptly dont enter that house until know what be going to do pay visit sit for endymion be tired of fencing dont go on like with caliphronas said other quickly well one name be a good a neednt waste diplomacy on friend know too well to believe must waste time in coming here for nothing now tell what scheme be will reveal know of to maurice roylands count be thus driven into corner suave manner vanished a sat up on turf with scowl on handsome face significant movement of right hand toward waist oh im not afraid of that scamp said crispin quickly wear not fusanella here have knife pistol with be in civilized country noble count so must act in civilized manner greek recovering temper burst out laughing beckoned crispin to sit down beside on soft green turf have whip hand of creespeen said lightly be too wise man to waste time in argument so will tell reason of presence here be quite right in thinking did not come for pleasure on contrary wish to carry out very delicate affair perhaps be a well must know a may want assistance in matter will help in none of villanies by st theodore how pious have become oh forgot be misterr creespeen famous poet new chrysostom of golden mouth eh yes heard about in one must think great poet be ever hold tongue said crispin roughly grasping greek by wrist have be be have done nothing to be ashamed of indeed must like to know retorted count jerking hand in direction of house intend to tell when choose not before suppose anticipate do so by mean will relate story of life will relate story of life wonder will prove more interesting oh wonder rejoined caliphronas with consummate impudence let quarrel a may want assistance oh need not frown have ill intention towards precious friend in fact to put completely at ease may a well tell justinian sent to england justinian repeated crispin with start well what of resumed carelessly know be not now friend with justiniani have not seen for nearly three year eh said caliphronas quickly of course be just about time came here oh heard about in london justinian will have heard also by time for wrote told trust be pleased said crispin grimly a to dont know true goose have turned out swan now unlike swan sings song world listens to such glory can hardly compensate for ungrateful manner in treated enough cried crispin hotly dark face flushing with anger can justify conduct amply choose to do so to leave justinian melnos old life alone want to know reason of presence in roylands well will know get furious over nothing said caliphronas mockingly be afraid have lost old hellenic calm now resemble one of bad tempered englishman devoured with spleen greedy of money be not greedy of money eh oh see sing song for smile of woman not for gold of husband father brother well agree with smile of woman be very delightful one can not live on so must like to know how exist must indeed yes so must justinian well will neither of be told come now be growing late wait for confession one will hear of course not besides speak in greek be not so common in england a in hellas caliphronas let smile die away from lip looked keenly at crispin will not reveal what have now to tell not unless be villany be villany be act of justice listen story did not take long to tell drew forth many exclamation of surprise from crispin who for once in life be astonished at revelation of caliphronas believed be speaking truth indeed must hardly help believing a many point of story coincided with what knew in connection with roylands family when caliphronas finished recital flung back on turf waited for crispin to speak young man did after long pause what have stated astonishes very much said deliberately a far a can see there doe not seem to be harm intended to friend none in least said count eagerly like justinian now for mysterious reason think know enough about to trust know enough about not to trust overmuch replied crispin coolly with regard to scheme scheme yes cried count breathlessly will remain neutral caliphronas drew long breath of relief sprang to foot be better than nothing wish must help will remain neutral can see for there be harm intended tell will remain neutral said crispin for third time also rising from recumbent attitude will neither help thwart so can do a please dont think youll succeed in scheme dont replied caliphronas provokingly a walked up to house together well that remains to be seen if man of capacity cunning well cunning if like if man of cunning can not circumvent dull headed cautious oh be cautious well will make cautious englishman do a wish here be nearly at house wait to know on what footing stand be acquaintance of mine met at athens talk of best known athenian a mutual friend will say nothing about melnos about justinian alcibiades tell wont say word about one anything said crispin impatiently can carry out plan if like doe harm to roylands a far a can see if find playing double friend ill put end to game always play fair when be to benefit to do so retorted greek with unpleasant smile what pity be not always to benefit to do so said poet cruelly must then be honest man be what be answered caliphronas sullenly have created might have made improvement not in appearance observed crispin looking at splendid beauty of man beside suppose be a vain a ever possibly never let vanity interfere with business ah there be sense in splendid head of yours precious little quite enough to accomplish wish doubt however here be here be mr roylands be indeed maurice who arrayed in evening dress advanced to meet greeted caliphronas with smile have quite given up count said shaking hand with greek luggage arrived not dinner be now due however a neither of gentleman be ready have just put off for hour so will just have time to dress know mr crispin count yes must blame for unpunctuality said caliphronas gracefully walked over here sent on luggage by groom in avenue met mr creespeen talked of old time ah know one cried maurice flashing keen glance at crispin that gentleman sustained without blenching oh yes answered poet calmly be afraid did not know name of count caliphronas memory played false know very well met at athens three year ago continued count laughing have idea mr maurice how astonished be to meet friend here by way must allow to call mr maurice make mess of english name think speak english wonderfully well count where did learn may ask if be not rude question have english tutor replied caliphronas stealing glance at crispin have be accustomed to tongue since lad ah account for well come with count will show room crispin mr dengelton daughter be already in drawing room so have better make haste crispin went off a quickly a possible maurice hospitably conducted guest to room prepared for where roylands valet be already spreading out count evening dress duty having be performed mr roylands hurried away to guest in drawing room count be left alone with valet whom speedily dismissed thank wont require anything else said when servant have arranged clothes be accustomed to wait on dinner be in hour yes sir replied valet retired quietly fact be caliphronas have habit of thinking aloud a have good many matter to consider be afraid of committing if second person be in room therefore having got rid of servant began to dress slowly for dinner thinking deeply time think creespeen will say anything said aloud in greek a arranged white tie very likely will help if can manage how upright be nowhow very upright to think here count went into fit of silent laughter lasted until arrived at door of drawing room when controlled risible muscle went in gravely to be introduced to lady chapter vii souvent femme varie woman weathercock full of frivolity men may together mock at heart quality if heart steal worth smart feel there then place be lo then nether rock le firm of base be needle to say count constantine caliphronas be much admired by two lady be scarcely to be wondered at seeing charm of manner be almost a great a physical perfection attracted in first instance by good look be quite prepared to find kernel of such handsome nut somewhat disappointing in other word fancied that nature must scarcely be so profuse in gift a to give man great mental power in addition to comely exterior to surprise found greek to be charming conversationalist be much astonished at purity with spoke english tongue must be ridiculous to say that caliphronas be man of great intellectual power for a before stated be gifted with more cunning than brain still such cunning enabled to conceal educational deficiency by dexterous use of little knowledge possessed managed to pas for very intelligent man willow caliphronas be without doubt education in many way have be wofully neglected have travelled great deal be acute enough in picking up unconsidered trifle of general information have plenty of small talk so advantage in conjunction with undeniable good look ready wit enabled to fascinate ordinary run of people clever man brilliant woman must have discovered smallness of intellectual power at once day folk be not so difficult to please mr dengelton daughter being ordinary folk gifted with ordinary brain found flashy frivolous chatter of count infinitely charming maurice having got over first suspicion of greek soon liked extremely a be pleasant companion always in good humor on other hand crispin who knew what caliphronas really be how mean vile soul inhabited that splendid body be much put to in order to conceal distaste for society of brilliant stranger saw through thin veneer of good manner facile accomplishment into true nature of man be well aware that apparently charming child of nature impulse simplicity be in reality crafty selfish sensual scoundrel whose only aim in life be to benefit at expense of others if be only in palace of truth now thought poet a sat silently watching dexterous way in caliphronas be using small stock of accomplishment wonder what must say be that man compelled to give utterance to real thought must fly in horror from a vile thing beautiful flower whose appearance be exquisite yet whose odor be death still have improved wonderfully since old day wonder where picked up good mannersnot from justinian alcibiades ill be bound perhaps have be learning art of pleasing from helena a thought came into mind remembered charming woman who bore that name knowing what caliphronas be must not restrain shudder immediately drew eye of greek towards eh friend mr creespeen said slowly for caliphronas in spite of intimate acquaintance with english tongue picked up heaven only know where must never pronounce proper name without strong foreign accenteh friend shudder one be walking over grave oh what horrible idea cried mr dengelton in liveliest manner for count good look have made deep impression on elderly heart declare dear count make shudder also be exactly kind of thing brother rudolph must say ghoul vampire omen dream grewsome thing used to revel in yes positively revel in never will forget being told how brought lady friend book to read called footprint on border of world nearly frightened into convulsion threw out of window uncle rudolph must have be interesting kind of person said maurice dryly oh dear maurice be so terribly wild yes why in old day must have be buccaneer pirateit be just kind of thing must have liked to be at last remark crispin looked straight at count who met gaze with uneasy laugh tried to turn conversation gentleman madam be very adventurous presume oh dear yes uncle eunice be speaking ofyour uncle maurice yes mammayes aunt said cousin together have fiery eye be over six foot in height always thought image of templar in ivanhoe of course speak from hearsay a be babe when left england be there not portrait of somewhere maurice be just behind aunt over piano caliphronas crispin arose with simultaneous movement strolled across room to look at modern captain kidd for style of man appeared to have be judging from mr dengeltons highly colored description portrait be full length one of handsome young man in old fashioned costume la dorsay of early victorian age assuredly appeared to be dandy of first water strong commanding face eagle glance firm mouth prominent nose marked at once a born leader of men man who in elizabethan time must have sailed spanish main thrashed don who in later year must have delighted in jacobite conspiracy who must have fought way to marshal baton when napoleon led army of france in fact one of men who find outlet for energy in leading string of civilization who in lawless life develop quality whereof hero be made maurice be good looking enough in ordinary fashion have none of power daring in face such a showed so conspicuously in uncle countenance count crispin remained looking at portrait unconscionably long time considering original be unknown to glanced meaningly at one a went back to seat description be admirable one mr dengelton said crispin a lady evidently desired opinion of portrait face be that of man who must be hero scoundrel according to circumstance always brave dear mr crispin cried lady somewhat scandalized at epithet applied to roylands beg pardon mr dengelton be speaking of type more than man rudolph roylands have bearing of born leader of men wonder left england for wider field must have be stifled in narrow island how do know left england asked lady sharply why story of last night be not here when told ah dear mr crispin be indeed very angry at for taking daughter out onto terrace might have caught death of coldbut will not speak of at event must not have heard story crispin looked rather uncomfortable a if feared have committed a mr dengeltons beady eye be fastened shrewdly on face have to make answer though truth to tell did not know what to say well really mr dengelton hardly know how to reply said coloring did not hear story if remember just before rector said good night talked about brother leaving england dear yes so did said mr dengelton must have liked to add something anent story of photograph falsehood of have discovered maurice however guessed how land lay feeling sorry for crispin who be really very uncomfortable made first remark came into head caliphronas tired of conversation have gone to piano where eunice be playing softly talked to in undertone attention however be not noticed by crispin who be too busy trying to extricate from dilemma with mr dengelton to think about anything else how must have managed to evade photograph question mr dengelton be bent on asking be difficult to say maurice came to aid with apparently irrelevant remark dear crispin say that judging from face uncle must either be hero scoundrel now what do mean by remark oh hope havent offended by making said crispin with grateful smile for saw through roylands stratagem if man like uncle have such quality a seems to posse strongly developed be bound to break out in direction place in army will be hero in time of war supposing be born in whitechapel be afraid heroic quality must be dangerous to society then think hero thief be composed of same quality will not say thief use milder term adventurer if great napoleon have not be adventurer of quality must never have mounted throne of france sforza duke of milan be of same specie so be william conqueror roger de hauteville king of sicily men through force of circumstance aided development of commanding quality obtained thronesthey be adventurer who became king on other hand look at benvenuto cellini have same instinct for fighting commanding daring same longing for fame rich adventure yet to end of life be quarrelsome swashbuckler simply because circumstance did not permit quality developing in right direction cromwell have quality mounted throne rienzi have died on scaffoldall through circumstance believe dear maurice quality man may posse development of in right wrong direction depends on surroundings be common saying that genius can override obstaclesa mistake anyone who read history can perceive circumstance be sometimes too strong for greatest soul that genius must have created empire dy in obscurity quite historical lecture declare tittered mr dengelton who found long speech trifle wearisome how doe apply to brother if brother mr dengelton went to south america probably rose to be president of one of petty republic if went a free lance into service of eastern potentate very likely ended life a pasha of three tail if stayed in england feel certain that violent temperament adventurous longing must have brought into trouble dont think stayed in england replied mr dengelton shaking head certainly must have heard of death probably be president pasha of dreadful thing speak of do think be dead aunt asked maurice who have be listening quietly to argument im sure dont know havent heard of for year year roylands be always long living people so perhaps be still alive be now fifty year since went away at age of twenty five so if be still alive must be quite seventy five year of age seventy five year of age repeated crispin relapsed into silence who be seventy five year of age asked caliphronas overhearing remark uncle rudolph if alive said maurice lazily oh indeed replied caliphronas carelessly word conveyed volume a tried to catch eye of crispin in however be not successful a crispin be wrapt up in brown study so greek turned towards eunice asked to sing something be passionately fond of music said turning over song nothing so delight a to hear woman voice eunice blushed at compliment to sex not knowing how to answer itfor be still afflicted with shyness of bread butter agetook up first song came to hand do know song said placing music before herthe star sirius be new scientific style of song now rage scientific song repeated caliphronas rather puzzled yes blending instruction with pleasure said crispin rousing out of revery walking over to piano public be tired of love song sea song sacred song comic song sentimentality of kind so ingenious person have invented scientific song in song astronomy be brought to aid of eroticism result be peculiar to say least of presume such ditty be written for musically inclined girton girl will play accompaniment miss dengelton if must be so kind said eunice vacating seat at piano action brought frown to face of watchful mother can sing better standing up crispin played prelude in sufficiently good style caliphronas sinking into chair near singer looked up into face in somewhat bold fashion a sang latest up to date song of day star sirius glowing star of ardent ray in midnight sky trace be central sun say enshrined in distant space around giant planet turn in motion constant roll with fiery force splendor burn a for thee burn soul oh star ascendant at birth for tear for sadness for mirth rule destiny on earth ii oh star of star in thee flaw telescope reveal thine orb obey attraction law round thy centre wheel beloved thou be one parted eer can be be thy planet thou sun for eternity oh star ascendant at birth for tear for sadness for mirth rule destiny on earth thank miss dengelton said caliphronas when song ended like singing much better than word be somewhat perplexing be up to date word remarked crispin calmly music be also up to date of most advanced school blending of dvork rubinstein what awful name cried caliphronas with shudder grate on ear so doe music in case there be nothing like consistency still of advanced school of music effort be delightful dance of dvorks for instance bringing down hand on key with crash played one of weird gypsy dance of bohemian musician thrill listener with wild capriciousness conjure up picture of mode of life quite alien to prosaic respectability that strange chord resounds loudly through room at once see wild horse flying across illimitable gray plain fierce voice of gypsy rider pealing up to sombre sky of midnight rapid medley of sound lo fire burn redly under tree while round bound tawny woman with flashing eye tossing arm clashing tambourine to wild rhythm of music death on card love in star muttered prophecy of crouching hag terrified at omen of flying bat of shrieking night bird whirl of glittering note scatter through air crash crash crash chord upon chord sound fiercely with interval of sparkling chromatic run like falling of broken spray then one final chord bringing red of dawn chill wind of morning uprising of cheerful sun wonderful cried mr dengelton who knew nothing about music admired dvork because be fashion not intelligible to ordinary mind so fantastic added eunice whose accomplishment did not soar above mild singing of mild drawing room ballad such a daddy dancing oh if to thee heart be welcome well for part said count shrugging shoulder think new music be horrible ah doe not appeal to hellenic spirit replied crispin carelessly mephistopheles felt out of place at classical walpurgis night so dear caliphronas feel equally at sea among diablerie of northern composer so suggestive of festival on brcken dont know what be taking about said count uneasily having vague idea be being laughed at of course dont replied crispin coolly have never read faust first second part caliphronas knew that crispin did not like thinking wanted to ridicule in presence of lady must have made angry answer that eunice quite unaware of storm in teacup asked to sing greek song yes do dear count said mr dengelton gushingly do so love foreign song go to soul soulat least english souldoes not understand observed maurice with yawn for be growing somewhat tired of musical discussion if song be in italian french german can certainly understand said lady with dignity greek can hardly be expected to know think must care much for word if did understand modern greek remarked crispin with smile sonorous tongue of hellas invests most commonplace poem with dignity charm must lose if translated come count sing that love song used to be so fond of in athens athens repeated count with significant smile a rose to comply with request yes athens repeated crispin with emphasis be accustomed to play accompaniment how doe go began playing simple melody wild though be sounded quite poverty stricken after wealth of harmony have so distinguished music of dvork caliphronas watched player finger for little time then began to sing in uncommonly fine tenor voice though of course somewhat rough for want of training what lacked in delicacy however made up in force fire wonderful language sang in also assisted greatly though a regard song melody word be particularly striking daphne summer night be full of singing hear comrade sigh at window of worship window be open thy lattice be closed love call lover to beloved love answer beloved with smiling lip from window call not love wherefore night be empty of singing to lean from lattice capricious one will sing strain of nightingale to rose yes have heard open window can see silver dagger gleam in hair throw rose sigh love thee ah have spoken to rose message be told good night daphne sleep with sound of voice in thine ear for there be slumber for night will demand of rose message rose will reply love thee love thee thank so much said eunice coming over to piano know what mean sound wonderfully charming be love song wish have translation of will translate if wish miss dengelton said crispin by mean relishing attention eunice be paying to greek what do know greek modern greek yes have be in greece great deal great deal echoed caliphronas with evil smile crispin faced round abruptly be about to say something in undertone after moment deliberation turned slowly away count looked after with smiling face then devoted to eunice who be by mean averse to receiving attention now eunice must not be misjudged be true that felt flattered by attention of such strikingly handsome man a caliphronas be not a crispin in jealousy thought attracted in marked degree by stranger in fact be playing little comedy for blinding of lynx eyed mother for afraid lest that lady must discover that be secretly engaged to crispin with instinctive craft of womankind eunice pretended to be more taken up with greek than with poet by following course thought mother mind must be set at rest concerning rivalry of crispin with maurice ala plan be good one excellently well carried out such diplomacy met with ill reward a in avoiding charybdis fell into clutch of scylla for in place of angry mother have to put up with angry lover crispin be puzzled to account for sudden desertion of marked attention to caliphronas so at once with masculine stupidity deemed that outward grace of count have rendered false to have crispin be fortunate enough to posse female friend to whom must have talked on serious matter suspicion must speedily have be lulled to rest for one woman can understand woman a crispin be of masculine gender therefore failed to grasp situation eunice chatted gayly with caliphronas smiled on sang song to quite neglected poor crispin who grew towards end of night almost a melancholy a maurice in despair at such unlooked for behavior on part of girl loved a to caliphronas that gentleman who possessed considerable amount of vanity overweening sense of own perfection saw nothing in conduct of miss dengelton otherwise than what must be be so accustomed to be petted made much of by woman that became matter of habit with must have be considerably astonished have eunice acted otherwise than did at same time be secretly very pleased at making impression in quarter a saw at once from intercepted glance that poet be violently enamoured of fair english maiden caliphronas hated crispin with strong venomosity of little soul if must do ill turn must certainly take advantage of opportunity thinking eunice have succumbed to fascination be quite prepared to take advantage of conquest deprive poet of ewe lamb more so a crispin ill concealed jealousy added considerably to charm of flirtation poor eunice who never thought motif must be misconstrued by jealous lover be quite astonished when permitted caliphronas to present with bedroom candle wished frosty good night must have liked to obtain explanation mr dengelton be at heel so be obliged to retire to bed considerably disconcerted over strange behavior of stupidly jealous poet caliphronas also went to bed very shortly a did not smoke alleging that be custom to retire early rise early went off to room leaving crispin alone with maurice a soon a be by crispin turned at once to friend did see eunice to night maurice leisurely filled pipe yes saw be jealous of friend caliphronas well certainly think eunice gave good cause to be what be reason of sudden change roylands shrugged shoulder lighted pipe dont know unless francis be right said calmlysouvent femme varie chapter viii endymion oh goddess wise disdainful of sultry sun thou waitest till course be run then stealing where endymion in slumber lie with amrous sigh awake in secret nest drowsy with enchanted rest to lie upon thy silver breast while daylight dy in western sky shyly peering one by one star gaze on meeting blest for next week so life passed very agreeably at grange inmate becoming habituated to one anothers society settled down into lotus eating existence if not useful one be at least infinitely charming caliphronas played part in country house comedy in most admirable manner owing to good look good manner good temper soon established a universal favorite splendid flower of humanity have bloomed to such beauty under serene sky of east fascinated maurice greatly took genuine pleasure in modelling endymion from count though at time in spite of artistic capability almost despaired of being able to mould soft clay into perfect representation of virile perfection at same time intercourse between sculptor model be very pleasant a caliphronas be most delightful companion told story of adventure in manner worthy of ulysses munchausen yet though seemed to grow quite confidential over past life nevertheless withheld many episode might have prejudiced host against maurice who be simple in many way despite ten year experience of bohemia thought caliphronas be laying bare whole soul whereas wily greek only revealed best side of very complex article setting forth of moral excellence be of course in keeping with impression be anxious to produce thus made very agreeable to maurice who took count for what represented to be not for what really be caliphronas be excellent conversationalist during sitting beguiled time with many story of countryman not infrequently of countrywoman for apollo have achieved many conquest in field of venus seemed very proud of prowess during charming campaign probably most of story be exaggeration at time even simple maurice doubted truth so gracefully be lie told that sounded a delightful a tale of boccaccio count with considerable imaginative power supplied to host charming history of early life be more le fictitious of course listener never dreamed that man must string together such quantity of consistent lie therefore believed romance worthy of duma elder maurice be fool own nature be so simple honorable that thought one else be like at worst only deemed that history be perhaps highly colored true in main meanwhile eunice have demanded at most convenient opportunity explanation from crispin regarding inexplicable behavior on first night of greek visit have received one considerably startled a plainly showed that crispin be disposed to be jealous rather pleased eunice a woman care about meek lover more jealousy man display more beloved feel complimented at power exercise over affection however situation between crispin being somewhat strained eunice deeming honesty to be best policy confessed about little scheme of misleading mr dengelton regarding true position of affair on learning truth crispin felt very much ashamed of groundless suspicion apologized profusely for having doubted intended whereat being satisfied with humbling of proud took into favor again so course of true love once more ran smooth notwithstanding unpleasantness of such thing crispin rather approved of eunice treating with coldness in presence of mr dengelton a must probably lull suspicion of lady be not so sure about intended accepting very pointed attention of caliphronas crispin knew greek thoroughly eunice be absolutely ignorant of real character a owing to being behind scene must make caliphronas to certain extent do what desired hinted very plainly to hellenic don juan that attention be unwelcome to miss dengelton that be to give up rle have elected to play at first count be disposed to rebel against fiat put end to very pleasant flirtation a really did not care about eunice moreover crispin be too dangerous to be provoked lightly made virtue of necessity ceased to overwhelm shy english girl with florid compliment at same time promised to be revenged on crispin at first opportunity crispin knowing must not help feeling trifle uneasy for be difficult matter to fight with absolutely unscrupulous scoundrel like count whose law be neither of god man of own making however crispin knowledge of errand to roylands proved effective weapon be satisfied that greek must hing to jeopardize success of mission even though vanity demanded revenge for being thus slighted of course mr dengelton still contemplated match between daughter nephew maurice evaded hint with great dexterity yet at same time to protect crispin from le complaisant rival made such pointed remark about necessity of marriage a led mr dengelton to believe that seriously contemplated entering into matrimonial state never be good lady so puzzled in life for must not make up mind a to what maurice really meant with blowing hot one day cold next being great believer in efficacy of time deemed wisest plan to wait development of event in order to watch same kept beady eye wide open owing to neglectful manner in eunice have lately treated crispin apprehended no danger from quarter a maurice be very attentive to cousin hon mr dengelton felt sure that in end must obtain heart desire install eunice a mistress of roylands grange rector sometimes came over to grange be friendly with one saving caliphronas a for inexplicable reason professed to heartily dislike brilliant gentleman be certainly kind of dr fell ish aversion of mr carriston felt rather ashamed a must give plausible reason for such distrust in reply to question of maurices simply said that much a admired physical beauty of greek be by mean sure that soul corresponded to perfection of body indeed on one occasion while mr dengelton be eulogizing charm of caliphronas from feminine point of view rector pointedly quoted that line from odyssey saysfaultlessly fair body be not always temple of godlike soul a remark be made in homeric greek significance of be lost upon lady may be that subtle instinct warned against man whose evil nature be concealed under semblance of good at event rector be always on guard against count delicately warned maurice against trusting too far evidently mr carriston have studied character of ulysses to small purpose found in caliphronas reproduction body brain soul of most crafty of greek regarding outward appearance of caliphronas rector be too deeply steeped in serene literature of hellas to be unimpressed with physical splendor of man making allowance for subduing influence of modern clothing detracts from most perfect beauty in man woman mr carriston at time seeing caliphronas in dazzling sunlight thought beheld a in vision phantom of joyous hellenic divinity untouched by sorrow care man gifted with exceptional beauty might have be hyla hyacinth theoxenos strayed by chance from unknown arcadian vale into rush turmoil of modern world with worship of money position so alien to adoration of beauty genius formed cult of antique hellas in truth caliphronas be out of place in englandour gray rainy sky smoky air stifling city domesticated nature formed dark background for strongly vitalized being tingling from head to foot with healthfulness of wild life must have dwelt in burning south beside tideless ripple of serene sea under cloudless blue of attic sky with silver gray olive shining temple of god headland mountain peak island melting into phantom form of arial grace far beyond expanse of laughing ocean be anachronism in nineteenth century physical survivor of hellas a keats be mental survivorone have body of alcibiades other brain of theocritus be equally alien to modern world well be for rector that must see only splendid casket not soul contained therein for in spite of instinctive distrust fancy have that count be not to be trusted fell far below actual moral degradation of man caliphronas be a vain a peacock absolutely ignorant of morality of right wrong lazy in way save what touched own desire crafty a fox crispin must have pointed out to rector flaw crispin have promised to hold peace so long a caliphronas abstained from actual harm therefore remained quiescent only reminded greek now then that there be watchful eye on doings maurice believed in greek rector doubted crispin knew worthlessness thoroughly so among three of character of caliphronas be pretty well analyzed from maurice steady respectable englishman with occasional lapse of artistic wildness to caliphronas brilliant cosmopolitan adventurer be long step crispin stood midway between two a have certain amount of british phlegmatism with at time wild impulse come from wandering life intellectual nature still must control spontaneity while caliphronas obeying own undisciplined mind did came into head yet if one be scandalized by such unconventionality must at once obtain forgiveness by graceful way in apologized be impossible to be angry with said maurice to one day when count have be guilty of ridiculous escapade yet deserve to be sharply spoken to be child in many way can not be angry with child there be right dear mr maurice replied caliphronas smiling be child be a much a to say be greek remember what egyptian priest said to solonyou greek be always child therefore if be child act impulsively like child blame nationality not expect must be very bad child if wanted to said crispin overhearing defence caliphronas darted spiteful look at speaker very likely replied in meaning tone who dread sting must not disturb wasp nest there be distinct menace in tone crispin felt too confident of having upper hand to take much notice of venom merely laughed much to wrath of greek however a time be not yet ripe for action restrained anger behaved so amiably to crispin that be only knowledge poet possessed of true character made mistrust suave smile kindly action of greek machiavelli caliphronas be amphibious creature lived quite a much in water a on shore whenever have time to spare went off to brasdimir for dip in sea must plunge wallow in water like dolphin fortunately that summer at roylands be unusually hot what with cloudless sky burning sun delicate emerald tint of foliage grass herb caliphronas might well have imagined that be still in beloved greece bathing off pebbly beach of gean brasdimir be somewhat peculiar place be in reality arm of sea bra de mer ran up like long tongue into land where met water of roy river in olden time roylands be norman french name have be property of crown have be used by plantagenet for favorite pastime of hunting henry ii bestowed on one of baron who be strongly suspected of being son of king who on receiving royal gift dropped former name of fitzroy took that of roylands be certainly splendid property through turbulence of succeeding reign descendant of first roylands have succeeded in keeping hold on rich acre so be very little diminished in size from time of bestowal on fitzroy brasdimir be kind of estuary ran about mile up into estate into flowed little river roy be placid stream of great beauty round brasdimir lay fat meadow containing of finest land in country clump of beech elm oak remnant of old hunting forest of plantagenet king dotted broad expanse of daisied sward near upper part of brasdimir where met water of roy blended salt with fresh stood quincunx of noble oak grew close to bank from thence smooth turf of meadow sloped down to turbulent water be here that caliphronas came to bathe not only morning often three time day being in middle of estate brasdimir be far away from human habitation might have be navel of great wilderness so lonely be greek loved blending of fresh salt water a softness of one assuaged harshness of other under hot sun must frequently cool in unique pool be river stream mixture of very often crispin maurice must come with for morning dip just before sunrise then walk back to grange with tremendous appetite for breakfast one morning set out for usual walk just a east be flushing redly with dawn chill morning air nipped keenly a strolled along in direction of brasdimir be to say poet sculptor strolled for caliphronas simply danced along a if to rid of superabundant energy across dewy meadow bounded fawn like singing a gayly a lark already saluting sun in fresh blue sky like wild being of wood leaped here there from very light heartedness with head bare arm tossing in air number of horse pasturing in field rushed away at approach though called loudly did pause in wild career what child be said maurice watching graceful figure of greek bounding lightly towards water yes nice child truly sneered crispin with strong disfavor dont seem to like caliphronas well can not say do a acquaintance be very well a friendhere crispin shrugged shoulder in lieu of word suppose say about be true suppose so replied poet curtly do think will stay long down here hope will not go away before finish modelling endymion think can safely depend on staying till then rejoined crispin significantly conversation endeda conversation left odd feeling of discomfort in mind of maurice whichwhy must not tellseemed to revive old distrust of fascinating greek must have questioned crispin further a be now on edge of bank caliphronas be within hearing have opportunity of so doing therefore put off such examination till more convenient season caliphronas be already in water swimming like fish indeed be a much at home there a on land two gentleman undressed leisurely on bank maurice making fun of greek a revelled in favorite element have better beware caliphronas a nymph might take fancy to a did to hyla river nymph sea nymph mind in least cried greek gayly lady be always charming whether have tail limb at moment reached opposite bank climbed on fallen trunk of tree a stood there with arm raised above head first yellow ray of sun flashed on white body enveloped in glory a though be indeed stray olympian then with shout of glee shot downward like arrow cleaving blue water with dash of snowy spray sprang upwards glittering like diamond in yellow sunlight by time maurice friend be also enjoying bath in cool element three rollicked about like schoolboy crispin swam down estuary in direction of sea with maurice soon surface of water roughened by wind began to dash salt spray in face caliphronas stayed where be amusing with fancy stroke after time became tired when others came back breathless with long swim found count standing on bank drying a also be tired also sought bank at moment one of horse powerful black one came timidly near caliphronas with wonderful power have over animal advanced nude a be up bank called to horse in coaxing tone animal let get quite close to lay hand on mane when with sudden spring greek leaped on back horse startled by action by shout galloped away at full speed round round meadow went horse man forming so striking sight maurice crispin paused in dressing to look at a horse at full gallop came sweeping past with caliphronas laughing holding on by mane maurice involuntarily thought of frieze of parthenon where nude youth ride fiery steed in long serene procession of marble figure greek rode like red indian with most consummate ease a horse for third time darted past quincunx of oak dropped lightly off by trick known only to steed galloped wildly away while greek came back laughing to friend what child be caliphronas said maurice in vexed tone riding bare backed steed in reckless manner might have broken neck small loss if have muttered crispin under breath oh can stick on anything answered caliphronas carelessly taking notice of crispin remark keen ear immediately heard besides gallop have done good see be quite dry when be dressed three of walked quickly back to breakfast for morning air have developed appetite enormously mr dengelton eunice awaited on terrace be soon seated round well spread table caliphronas touching coffee tea drank water only confined eating to bread honey egg be taste of primeval man strongly disliked elaborate dish be pleasing to cultured palate of more civilized neighbor know how can eat such thing said in disgust a eunice took curry doe not make ill not in least count replied laughing be very depraved taste suppose be very fond of curry teahot tea retorted caliphronas quickly have heard said that tea be bad for nerve lady always complain of nerve yet drink tea must not do without tea said mr dengelton who be given to surreptitious cup of tea at odd hour of day yet have nerve oh dreadful nerve dont know what be to be so afflicted count never have illness in life then be because live natural life whereas highly civilized people live artificial existence if gave up highly spiced dish strong wine late hour breathing of poisonous air must be a healthy a be well can hardly call air of roylands poisonous said maurice indolently air here be delightful because live near sea must not dwell inland must die must breathe sea air see wide waste of water hear thunder of wave on beach be only life for healthy man must not live in london suppose said mr dengelton frowning on eunice who be talking in quiet tone to crispin london cried count with scorn must a soon live at bottom of sea indeed believe must be healthier there london that crushed up mass of house inhabited by pale faced peoplei wonder can exist oh saw heard good deal of london when be there people in east end never leave narrow street from one year to other know nothing of sunrise sunset for only see marvel through smoky veil can not tell bird by songthey know nothing of animal habit of wonderful life of nature be born life dy in wood in sea in mountain be ignorant be born blind live blind die blind call such blindness life what about people in west end asked mr dengelton with air of making crushing remark be scarcely better retorted caliphronas promptly sit night in theatre breathing hot air go to ball where there be such crowd of people that one can dance walk for hour in park call exercise poison at club with cigarette in boudoir with teaand feverish unreal life be called season when go abroad be to monte carlo sort of place where lead same life on smaller scale no west end be better than east end forget said crispin more from desire to contradict count than because disagreed with plenty of people go mountaineering game shooting yachting exploring know that dear friend number of people who do thing be very small be talking of great mass of english people a far a can see whether be rich poor life lead be in case equally opposed to health enjoyment here endeth first reading said maurice rising from table example being followed by guest caliphronas be quite eloquent on subject yes be not usually so eloquent replied count going out on to terrace on side hear from people complaint of being ill well remedy be in own hand why dont use good sir remarked crispin who have lighted cigarette can not overturn whole complex civilization of west in manner man can no more go back to simplicity of existence eulogize than must settle down to fashionable life in london enjoy well at least can be cured easily said count with emphasis for a be now beyond earshot of rest of party must talk freely life have lived life of natural man now smoke that horrible tobacco drink kind of wine eat kind of dish will soon become a artificial a people around perhaps will come back to primeval existence praise with young lady suppose perhaps ah be very charming be thank dont want to hear opinion of miss dengelton said crispin haughtily primeval simplicity at time verge on rudeness how long be going to stay here cant tell that be going to take first step to day in order to get roylands to melnos yes oh have lure friend yes have described fairyland of island that be fairyland must admit be even now seized with desire of going there so to day will get to make up mind to go to levant with how will show crispin looked at portrait count held out be that of marvellously beautiful woman in greek dress helena cried poet recognizing face when did get taken have be to athens took oh be not absolutely barbarian think have gone in for photography yes be one of best effort do think face will lure maurice to east ought to said caliphronas gazing at picture with burning light in eye be a lovely a namesake of troy love oh how love be wise do think to introduce possible rival doe not matter to replied count slipping picture into pocket have justinian promise yes have not got helena oh wont refuse to marry for sake of happiness hope will be very complimentary retorted greek ironically turning away well must leave delightful society friend be time for to go to studio wait minute have not thwarted plan because a far a can see be innocent if induce maurice to go to levant well demanded caliphronas insolently will go also reason very simple one trust scamp called andros better known at least in england a constantine caliphronas replied count coolly well come if like to watch over precious friend wish harm also have better beware of justinian chapter ix portrait dreary life aching fear endless strife bitter tear lo lovely face see changing world to love delight beauty face smiling bright woman grace thus beholding in thee thou hast changed world to studio maurice have fitted up for at grange be very workmanlike apartment a be quite barren of artistic frippery with painter love to decorate room sculpture be much more virile art than painting scorning frivolous adornment of kind artist of chisel devotes to severest highest form of beauty so that find quite enough loveliness in coldly perfect marble figure without furnishing studio like wardour street toy shop of course who work in color love to gaze on color therefore fantastic eastern carpet quaint figured tapestry gold broidered curtain of indian silk yellow shield of antique workmanship porous red jar from egypt such like brilliance be pleasing to artistic eye constant sight of blended hue keep sense of color so to speak up to mark sculptor however have one color white be not color le luxurious studio more likely be to concentrate attention on statue growing to perfection under busy chisel sentiment must seem to narrow down sculptor to severest least graceful form of art be uttered by crispin in approval of bare barn attached to grange maurice called studio then crispin knew nothing about art painter sculptor reading above view of profession will probably laugh to scorn such fanciful notion yet be true that sculptor by art be shut off from world of color unless like old greeksaccording to criticshe tint statue thereby turn into wax figure doubtless hellenic sculptor who wrought nude god draped goddess from marble of paros pentelicus did not fail to notice how background of blue attic sky enhanced beauty of creation therefore must have concluded that world of color to be stranger must accentuate fairness beauty of statue again be artistic sentiment of crispin poet delivered to maurice with much daring seeing speaker be ignorant of world of art promulgated idea in purely poetical fashion crispin crude view of art artist may doubtless fail to interest many people therefore to come back in circle to starting point of disquisition maurices studio be very workmanlike apartment floor consisted merely of bare board although at one end in front of fireplace there be oasis of carpet on rested table for pipe tobacco together with two comfortable arm chair scattered here there be statue finished unfinished completed in marble others incomplete in clay maurice have gratified artistic desire for perfection of sculpture by surrounding with copy in marble of famous statue for now a be wealthy must afford to do so here danced faun with grotesque visage lissome pose there smiled hebe holding cup for banquet of god bacchus with crown of vine leaf gazed serenely on sad face of draped ariadne in distance apollo watched lizard crawling up tree trunk hermes with winged foot poised on pedestal a if for flight whole studio be filled with fair gracious form of greek art wonder at time maurice despaired of producing anything worth looking at beside immortal production of hellenic brain hand great necessity now be not to know what one can do what one can not do if complacent artist poet sculptor novelist only abode by rule world must be spared perpetration of many atrocity in marble verse on canvas conceited creator think perfection maurice roylands have pretty taste for chipping marble be by mean genius statue while perfectly wrought in accordance with canon of art yet lacked that soul only true sculptor can give to creation be fortunate thing for that be rich man for assuredly must never have become great sculptor idea be excellent must not carry out in accordance with figment of brain a lacked divine spark of genius alone can fully accomplish what conceives at present clad in blouse be standing in front of mass of wet clay manipulating soft material with dexterous finger into semblance of fanciful endymion of brain real endymion of caliphronas that gentleman be posed on model platform in distance be beguiling time by incessant chattering of other thing artist have based conception of statue of endymion on line of keats poet laureate to dian what be there in moon thou shouldst move heart so potently intended to represent shepherd sitting on latmos top chin on hand gazing at moon with dreamy eye mortal heart thrilling at thought that must see inviolate artemis incarnate in flesh in accordance with greek idea of nudity maurice did not drape statue shepherd sat on chlamys be lightly thrown over rock while beside lay scrip flask pastoral crook caliphronas be seated thuswith elbow resting on knee chin on hand gazing presumably at moon in reality at maurice while other hand lightly hung down by side right leg be drawn back so that foot bent in delicate curve calculated to show full beauty pose showed perfect line of figure with nude body clean shaven face dreaming eye looked veritable endymion who be waiting descent of goddess from high olympus though be warm day fire burned in grate for greek be very susceptible to cold after working for time maurice be fain to rest so great be heat whereupon caliphronas flung back on chlamys placed hand behind head began to talk will be long at work to day mr maurice asked with yawn no not if be tired replied roylands throwing cloak over count have better wrap up will catch cold if dont care to sit more to day can leave off now well have letter to write will wait half hour right maurice lighted favorite pipe established in comfortable chair upon count finding rock of endymion somewhat hard forsook platform wrapping cloak closely round sat down opposite sculptor wonder dont smoke caliphronas said maurice idly watching greek with half closed eye will find excellent way of passing time of killing time suppose mean have need to do at least not when be at home in greece here yes be rather difficult to get through day comfortably if be not for sitting really know what must do with be afraid will never be able to carry out conception of endymion said maurice paying attention to remark caliphronas shrugged shoulder oh work be very good said politely very good indeed of course be not perfect know that practice make perfect not in world of art may learn to paint in strict accordance with rule of art may sculpture to inch portion of human body be only outward semblance of picture statue great thing make great work be soul quite true think can not create soul of statue said maurice rather nettled at outspoken criticism say nothing friend know little of art so must be impertinence of to talk about of be ignorant longer live le discover know said roylands sententiously suppose be true replied caliphronas indolently thank heaven have not soul of artist for seems to cause owner perpetual anxiety live healthy joyous free like other animal of nature be quite satisfied be that not rather ignoble perhaps be nothing to be happy be to mind main aim of life why must slave for money wish why must toil for year at art gain at end ephemeral fame besides when one dy what good doe fame do large marble tomb must not please still fame of being spoken of by succeeding

disappear prisoner can be happy a be prisoner in dungeon of conventionality be swathed in mummy cloth of civilization can not hope to be happy unless go out into wilderness life describe be purely animal one what about intellect intellect pshaw know more about nature than scientific idiot with book what inconsistent being be caliphronas said maurice in amused tone say love art admire picture adore statue yet if man followed life eulogize such thing must not be in existence tell dont want world to follow example must be very sorry to lose delight of sens so be glad there be men sufficiently self denying to slave at such thing for delight a regard desire to live a natural manan animal a say be ignobleyes be pleasant speech somewhat opened eye of maurice to kind of soul be enshrined in splendid body of man saw plainly that sensual part of caliphronas have completely conquered spiritual with what resultthat ignoble being be happy what ironical comment of fate on striving of great being to subordinate sens to soul soul agitated by thousand fear brain striving ever after impossiblewhat do give possessor feeling of unrest of unsatisfied hunger whereas body untortured by inquiring spirit brought contentment happinessignoble though wereto animal man by time caliphronas having made up mind to sit more day be slowly dressing singing greek song in usual gay manner three girl crossed path in twilight one did love others be nothing to frowned at greeting friend smiled sweetly yet be loveliest of loved frown more than smile inviting how happy be caliphronas thoroughly have not care in world come with to island of fantasy also will be happy island of fantasy yes be what justinian call who be justinian anything to do with pandects pandects reiterated caliphronas puzzled by word yes be rulera law giver oh be king of island of fantasy presume exists only in brain said roylands jestingly pardon replied count seriously resuming seat island of fantasy to call by

time of modern world think have vanished forever friend golden age still exists in melnos if come with will dwell in arcady dear count said maurice much impressed by fluency of man speech have never yet heard foreigner speak tongue with such ease a do where did learn such fluencysuch good accent ah will tell that when arrive at melnos be almost a much riddle a be crispin said maurice chafing at secrecy seemed to be so senseless doubtless if be curious to know about come to gean with about repeated englishman why do know anything of crispin caliphronas knew good deal about crispin be too wise to say that did silence regarding past on part be only way to secure silence on part of crispin much a caliphronas in enmity to poet must have liked to reveal what crispin desired to be kept secret have too much at stake to risk gratification of spite therefore passed off question with laugh know anything about creespeen reiterated smiling im afraid know nothing more than do met at athens truly be acquaintance so never made inquiry about be a much riddle there a here oh yes heard romance about in london doubt one story be a true a reason made remark a did be that a crispin say came from east

place must have than nearly midnight in smoking room with soothing weed exhilarating whiskey diluted with soda to stimulate drowsy brain be wonderful how men at mystic hour unbosom one to other tell secret certainly must not reveal in daytime maurice knew peculiarity of midnight confabulation perhaps thought that crispin must take into confidence if did think so be disappointed for crispin kept own counsel held tongue save indeed to talk generally about thing maurice be well acquainted with so have decided upon eastward ho said crispin for second time finding that maurice did not reply

hospitality must have to be scrupulously polite to caliphronas on board eunice be taking advantage of present time giving humor full rein in direction of real feeling if must only have prevented caliphronas coming by display of hostility must have be very glad a mistrusted greek very much caliphronas be impervious to shaft of irony a long a gained end did not care what be said to of brilliant stranger be man entirely without pride must put up with insult rather than jeopardize plan by resenting such discourtesy be last opportunity crispin must have of showing real feeling so took advantage of though be scarcely gentlemanly of to do so count be such unmitigated scoundrel that honorable courteous treatment be entirely lost on however eunice overheard ironical remark looked reproachfully at whereon crispin restrained temper strove to be delightfully amiable very easy task in present frame of mind with good resolve talked a pleasantly a be able heard caliphronas romance about fictitious life without contradicting felt sorely inclined to do must not be forgotten that crispin have hitherto led semi civilized life have not acquired that knack of concealing like dislike so necessary in artificial society besides be very honest minded man knowing true story of caliphronas deliberate lie flashy manner snake like subtlety of greek annoyed maurice also distrusted count especially after conversation with crispin regarding real name career character of man being more versed in science of deception behaved admirably towards guest in way thereby deceiving caliphronas to take enforced suavity for actual good fellowship a to rector be extremely punctilious in behavior neither by word deed showed dislike of sleek footed panther who be about to bear away favorite maurice into unknown danger must bring kind of thing from greece maurice said mr dengelton in usual gushing manner adore foreign ornamentsthose silver pin know like italian woman wear moorish veil algerian

most fortunate of poet rector poured out glass of favorite port began to converse with caliphronas while maurice crispin lighting cigarette chatted about yacht sea going power question of store anticipated time must take to run down to gean such like marine matter will pay visit count asked rector more for sake of starting conversation than because really cared about possibility think so be

form to meet objection be full of sophistry double dealing unfair adversary in sense of word be so encased in armor of self complacency egotism that must never be brought to look at thing spiritual material in light than satisfied selfishness of own soul rector therefore avoided threatened argument applied to wine be much more agreeable task than attempting to convince egoist that supreme aim of life be not pampering of passion of individual man apart from theological aspect of case said carriston good humoredly be rather mistaken thing to live only for one where ignorance be bliss grant because know higher life than of body at once assume that there can be happier existence oh say that answered caliphronas lightly doubt people who mortify flesh who listen to voice of conscience who consider soul more than body who look upon life a preparation for future existence be happy in self torturing that sort of thing came in with anno domini made medival age hell of anguish ii be greeka pagan if plea youwho look on world not a prison a garden wherein to live happily mourning man of sorrow be entirely opposed to joyous apollo gloomy view of life to serenity of temperament difference be plain for christian can not understand joyous song of paganism pagan shudder at penitential psalm of christianity must neither of ever convince other therefore argument have not common basis from to start be unprofitable be not going to argue replied carriston smiling agree with that argument be unprofitable unless change take place in own breast must be worse than useless for to attempt to reason with be evidently not of opinion of elizabethan ancestor of mine among whose paper discovered following lyric oh will pas contented day unheeding fortune crown of bay deck brow of whose vow compel to incessant strife restless life ah tho pleasing to sense cloying life of indolence fill soul with weary dole turn sweet doth bless to bitterness elizabethan ancestor be not healthy minded

to piano if word of song be translated must find very harmless only contain language of love known to world will play for asked crispin looking up from poem be reading to eunice if must be so kind what will sing said poet sitting down at piano love no wine to night be last meeting in england so sing song of farewell will sing call to arm yes will be stirring enough whereupon caliphronas sang that patriotic song be written by modern hellenic tyrtus during war of independence crispin afterwards translated into metre of byron famous isle of greece for benefit of eunice who be anxious to know word clothed in greek garb rang through room like inspiriting blare of trumpet thermopyl thermopyl give back spartan son of yore to raise flag of liberty dye fold in turkish gore then will crimson

eunice whose eye be flashing with excitement be like chevy chase said maurice quickly stir heart like sound of trumpet poet be evidently inspired by byron remarked crispin idly fingering piano key expect wrote after isle of greece song ah greek must have written that be afraid day of alcus be past replied rector who have understood considerable portion of song owing to acquaintance with ancient

crispin remember leave maurice in hand mr crispin said in faltering voice be very dear to must protect from all danger dear rector be not child interposed maurice rather nettled be going to wild of africa may meet with worse enemy than savage beast of africa replied rector obstinately trust friend caliphronas be content said crispin shaking rector warmly by hand will watch over maurice a to caliphronas need not be afraid of know man know good of ah be secret at present may be sure will not harm maurice while be near one must think be going into danger way talk said roylands impatiently

moderately fair weather sunlight caliphronas who be wretchedly bad sailor in spite of levantine cruisings retreated to cabin in very miserable frame of mind crispin maurice however be in good health spirit mostly remaining on deck to watch gray sea heaving dully under gray sky in bay of biscay bad weather prevailed a matter of course yacht tossed about good deal in choppy water not until passed strait did have fine weather for first burst of sunlight showed giant rock of gibraltar frowning on left a steamed rapidly into blue water of mediterranean have maurice so desired crispin be quite willing to put in for day young man be anxious to proceed to melnos yacht soon left picturesque sentinel of mediterranean behind weather now became warm bright bringing caliphronas out of cabin again like brilliant butterfly to bask in sunshine arid island of malta came in sight saw precipitous shore rising sternly from tideless water for few hour cast anchor in grand harbor went on shore to

from chattering of count enjoyed quiet beauty of night while crispin hummed softly ballad eunice used to sing oh wind wave oh star sea must be a blithe free above sky be almost of purple color in sultry night star brilliant large burned like lamp in still air serene moon half veiled in fleecy cloud arose above chill snow of taygetus long glittering bridge of light extended from land to yacht steady beat of screw impelled vessel through silent water sounded in ear blending with rich voice of caliphronas who have climbed up mast be clinging to weather rigging like spectral figure in shadowy glimmer of moon star earth breathes fragrant breath to night perfume blow from land oh can see water kissing shore even a must kiss thee belovd with thy breath more fragrant than languid scent floating from distant isle of rose filled garden wish knew greek said maurice a count paused for moment snatch of song sound so beautiful be beautiful replied crispin idly have often thought of

ti like lyric of callicles in arnold poem said crispin taking off cap stray fragment of song scattered by wind like song in pippa pass suggested maurice speculatively be afraid singing of caliphronas will not do so much good a pippas long sigh floated past on still water like melancholy cry of bird died away sadly in distance calypso sighing for ulysses observed crispin without altering position though dare say be only wind moaning through rope let think be voice calling pan be dead be classical to night caliphronas have inoculated with antique dream well when one be in fairyland one must dream romance suppose tell romance said maurice abruptly of past life yes will do so must promise to keep secret promise be afraid will think little of when know promised to tell so will now fulfil

melnos will excite wonderment come will lift portion of veil place in possession of fact may be of use to in future be attention crispin settled more comfortably fixing earnest eye upon maurice began story without further remark first memory be of island of melnos where be not born be taken there with mother when be infant land of birth know english be certainly for know ocean may have witnessed coming into world a grew up thought justinian be father for mother always led to believe such be case certainly be very kind to justinian of whom have often heard speak be not greek englishman of real

up with english tongue be taught from cradle so now know reason speak so well in early day always thought justinian be father caliphronas be brother a grew up be undeceived on point mother died when be still child be therefore left to sole guardianship of pseudo englishman a told rule over kind of patriarchal community in little known island life seems to suit for be kind of freebooter in way fierce lawless though year have now tamed spirit to considerable extent caliphronas rather andros be brought up in wild sort of fashionalways in open air on water fishing riding sailing fighting fighting cried maurice in surprise yes oh there be strange thing in greek water assure on adjacent island lived kind of semi pirate called alcibiades who be be thorough blackguard used to cruise about in small craft in order to levy blackmail on inhabitant of other island in cruise andros very often joined there be killing understand sometimes peasant objected to be robbed so there be often fight ending in broken head law oh there be precious little law in part brigandism be not yet extinct english may think besides alcibiades be moderate sort of pirate be cunning enough not to go too far must rob poor man of last drachma must not cut throat dont think justinian blamed for piratical existence indeed think rather envied wild life have be young enough must certainly have joined in partnership a be allowed andros to form part of band of alcibiades wild uncultured scamp a be regarded a great privilege how long did buccaneering go on a far a be concerned for year a regard caliphronas dare say be at yet what be thief oh thief be vulgar thing caliphronas be picturesque freebooter simply plunder on large scale ive doubt visit to england be paid for out of ill gotten gain be alcibiades still living oh yes will see have doubt for be great friend of justinian who be justinian crispin paused for moment seemed to consider then replied with great deliberation can hardly tell be englishman so

plunder taunted with being man of peace like father when demanded who father be refused to tell anything more than be illegitimate from word came to blow for of be very hot tempered end of be that justinian ordered to leave island much to delight of caliphronas who wanted to secure to left melnos yes must not help a justinian have plenty of scoundrel to do bidding have given word have doubt alcibiades must have put stone round neck dropped into sea dear crispin lawlessness nowadays crispin shrugged shoulder with smile dear fellow gentleman of england who live at home in ease know what

to foot be tired of discussion be aimlessabout one thing be going to turn in iam not added caliphronas springing to foot fancy going down to close cabin with such glory a outside waved arm aloft where brilliant sky smiled down on still water indeed so placid be sea that star moon cloud be reflected therein a in mirror yacht seemed to hang passive in centre of scintillating hollow ball when do reach melnos asked maurice abruptly a caliphronas strolled away to other end of ship to morrow evening replied crispin pausing at door of cabin will sleep on board visit justinian in morning crispin be there anything in veiled threat of caliphronas perhaps replied poet vaguely caliphronas be dangerous man be a have told favorite of justinian however must not be surprised if justinian dismissed andros put in place thank said maurice in haughty surprise have ambition to occupy position maurice said crispin suddenly wish must tell know unfortunately gave word to caliphronas not to do so a long a be not harmed in way what do mean can not tell only may perhaps serve a warningcaliphronas came to roylands on purpose to get to journey to melnos reason know can not tell however if must be in

to melnos for purpose did not count on presence listen think have gone below be telling secret to star at moment a if caliphronas knew subject matter of conversation in far distance broke out into rich burst of song gist of crispin rapidly translated to maurice net be spread prey be near drive into entanglement ho noble stag of olympus be helpless spear of hunter will drink blood before dawn set rosy foot on blushing mountain top see said crispin significantly after translating talk in parable can guess meaning be afraid trust do not yes trust replied maurice grasping hand held out to be right friendgood night when crispin disappeared maurice went to stern of ship leaning over taffrail fell into deep meditation over strange circumstance in be environed caliphronas sitting by bowsprit be swaying up down with pitching of yacht singing song now soft now loud be only sound of humanity heard sough of wind through rigging dreary wash of sea a ship cut way through glittering plain rustle of cordage beating of screwhe must hear blending with fitful voice of greek moon have retired behind thick bank of black cloud foreboded storm moonlit world be now shadowy vast vague strangea world of shadow ghost with swift steamer gliding onward into unknown seasinto unknown future maurice roylands be not what one might call strong minded man for a matter of fact have that subtle touch of indecision be often found in artistic nature be very impressionable surrounding circumstance have great effect on temperamentstill when saw way clearly before be quite capable of making up mind carrying out determination to end must never make up mind promptly a wavered way that way according a be biassed by circumstance have be of firm decisive nature must never have yielded to pitiable melancholia seized in london must thus have be spared much suffering still in spite of latent weakness of character always developed in time of trouble be brave man with plenty of pluck in england notwithstanding bohemian existence life have gone on too smoothly to call moral characteristic into special prominence now surrounded a be by vague mystery felt doubtful hitherto existence have be prosaic now element of romance have entered into felt that be being passively drawn into series of strange adventure subsequent termination of for good evil lay not in own hand caliphronas have come to england with deliberate intention of luring to melnos what be reason for strange conduct certainly crispin knew crispin fettered by promise of secrecy be unable to solve problem strangest thing of be that caliphronas have made use of picture of girl loved to decoy maurice to east line of conduct struck young man a most unaccountable if caliphronas be in love with helena be foolish of to encourage a have undoubtedly done love of rival result of two men loving one woman must be unsatisfactory to one of of course maurice saw that caliphronas confident in beauty of person power of fascination never for moment doubted final result still what be reason of taking trip to england especially to bring rival into presence of woman more maurice thought about more extraordinary did seem a whole be decided enigma doubt arose a to what be best course to pursue under very extraordinary circumstance true crispin being in possession of true fact of case must help for poet be honest man must not stand idly by in time of trouble still there be something in affair of even crispin be ignorant a have confessed mysterious something be connected in way with justinian maurice after long pondering came to conclusion that with justinian lay whole solution of matter a must decide on course of action until have seen justinian must do be to remain passive trust to providence one thing be certain said to a watched gray water swirling past can depend on crispin a know caliphronas thoroughly that consummate scamp will hesitate before take action adverse to interest justinian seems so mixed up in affair apparently without reason whatsoever have lived in greek island life englishman though be so why must desire to see complete stranger like know well only thing can do be to trust blindly in crispin for be sure will not fail apart from friendship for must be against own interest to play false a must then never be able to marry eunice time alone will unravel perplexity so to time will trust after be young strong so can defend if necessary then there be helena happens will see heri will see helena eh mr maurice said voice of caliphronas behind have not gone to bed be thinking can guess thought maurice made reply to invitation to argue with curt good night went below while in ear rang cruel mocking laugh of greek a repeated rapidly in singing tone name of mistress helena helena helena chapter xv storm dark storm cloud spread from pole to pole lightning flash thunder roll lo sea in mountain high with giant billow storm sky while vast disturbd main be veiled in whirling mist rain betwixt flying scud spume ship drift onward to doom fly before raging gale with broken mast tattered sail while up through pitchy darkness roll despairing cry of drowning soul having passed island of cythera during night by next morning yacht be ploughing placid water of cretan sea placid water generally be especially during month of halcyon now stiff breeze be blowing steadily from north by noon increased to fierce gale a far a eye must see there appeared nothing vast expanse of tumbling wave whiteness above accentuated by green blackness below a flung shattered spray a in derision against grim sky threatening mass of gloomy cloud lay along northern horizon fronted by bleak island of santorin scowled in savage grandeur in cloudy distance gray sky gray sea driving rain sudden gust of wind making streaming sail crack like pistol shot with violent lurching of vesselit be like north sea picture must one surveying dreary scene have believed boat be sailing over enchanting water of mediterranean three gentleman after uncomfortable breakfast owing to rolling of yacht upset everything on table in spite of fiddle be now on deck holding on to whatever must support by for eunice tossing about like cork in yeasty surge made small difficulty for on board to retain equilibrium wrapped up in oilskin be sufficiently dry warm for in spite of mist drenching rain weather be not in least chillya thing to be thankful for in such predicament yacht schooner rigged fore aft be capital sea boat so apprehending danger joked laughed during lull of gale at hardship gazed with interest on wild spectacle afforded by seething water maurice poet be comforting with tobacco while caliphronas excited by wildness of scene be clinging to weather rigging facing keen whip of wind rain spray like antique sea god occasionally must shout out few sentence to companion owing to tumult around must only catch meaning now then often like thisgeansudden galeshave fear confound that man growled maurice who be standing shoulder to shoulder with crispin think one have pluck on contrary be trying to keep up spirit replied crispin steadying with difficulty a yacht took big dip into trough of sea there be good deal of brag about caliphronas if be in real danger must not crow so loudly greek be afraid of sea if colonization of world have be left to be afraid america must never have be discovered why not because be always afraid of venturing out of sight of land slip about boldly enough among isle of elishah a ezekiel call if lose sight of mother earth courage leaf hellenic ancestor be just same for poet call ocean name such a hungry beast ravenous monster similar pleasant title think homer with multitudinous laughter of sea be only poet who pay ocean compliment yet greek genius have produced great sea drama in odyssey voyage of necessity not pleasureman sport of unjust god fancy ulysses have touch of adventurous phnician in blood besides greek bravery produced great sea drama at salami yet withal decline to believe hellene ancient modern be sailor yet arnold call young light hearted master of wave charming line applies to gean water master of wave forsooth why be never master of anything liquid larger than puddle greek never loved nature in grandest mood andsaving schylusboth shaggy mountain roaring water be alien to genius yet loved nature nature mother not nature enemy hill meadow wood fountain river loved mountain ocean feared must greek wordsworth have be possible ah now open up large field of inquiry think actual spirituality of wordsworth must have appealed to greek hellenic poet of class must have be like keatshe must have sung exquisitely of vitalized nature of incarnate force pan demeter nymph satyr none modern poet conversant with haggardness of modern life with soul steeped in religion of unseen must have produced thought too deep for tear such a find in wordsworth theocritus bion be nature poet of external loveliness arnold wordsworth sang deeper strain sought naked soul of nature be veiled isi to greek hallo what island be that cried maurice who have be idly listening to such fragment of discourse a have caught look to left in misty distance great black mass loomed vague indistinct on lee side of vessel apparently about seven mile off though magnifying vapor seemed to bring nearer be not sure replied crispin straining eye be in middle of number of islet deuce isnt that rather dangerous must be to one who did not know water martin have be here with often before know rock in vicinity besides be comparatively safe a engine be of large horse power compared with size of boat martin be captain of yacht at present be personally attending to wheel with anxious expression on weather beaten face for be light task to steer boat safely through cluster of island especially when magnifying property of mist cause to appear in dangerous proximity to ship thus deceiving eye into thinking be entangled among hidden reef luckily captain martin have clear head being splendid seaman knew capability of eunice thoroughly so crispin felt quite content to leave affair in hand so long a be at helm kamila shouted caliphronas alluding to misty island shouted back crispin kamila too far off kamila cried greek for second time whereupon crispin be much impressed with insistence caliphronas know sea thoroughly said to maurice quietly have sailed over with rascal friend so if be kamila must be nearer melnos than thought have not better see martin suggested maurice shaking like huge water dog a shower of spray flew over crispin nodded assent began to struggle towards wheel where martin be standing be rather difficult owing to slipperiness of wet deck tossing of yacht one moment must be poised on crest of wave next ingulfed in foam streaked valley of green water threatened to swamp however by holding on to anything must seize crispin managed to get close to captain who in effort to keep ship head right be straining muscle to hold wheel be almost torn out of grasp in retrograde direction time wave smashed against helm kamila screamed crispin in martin ear a pointed to dim mass martin shook head doubtfully too far southard be nigher anapli reckon melnos straight ahead who say ti kamila count caliphronas hum know part too ill go have look at chart if kamila melnos be just round shoulder cant believe weve got so far out of course why if at moment tremendous wave struck yacht midships making reel strain under irresistible blow of sea jolly boat on port side be smashed up like matchwood iron davit being twisted out of shape in giant grip of water eunice shuddered under stroke paused almost imperceptibly then sprung forward like spur touched horse in second be out of danger riding lightly on frothing crest of huge wave from whence slid down smoothly into smaragdine hollow beyond boat gone captain regaining breath bad loss crispin thought so too have time to reply for at moment raucous voice of captain be heard shouting to second officer a passed by send gurt here look sharp gurt be grizzled old salt with one eye unlimited capacity for rum who having knocked about in latitude sinful life knew archipelago like book when arrived captain put in charge of wheel went off not to cabin to look at chart down to engine room a feared for safety of propeller crispin followed staggered like drunken men along streaming deck towards hatch down iron ladder leading to engine room scrambled holding on like grim death for yacht be now rolling at angle of twenty five degree uncomfortable motion occasionally varied by dipping bow so deeply into water that stern be sticking nearly straight up in air in fact to use nautical expression stood on head screw beat wave regularly enough when in normal position moment yacht lifted be out of water whirling round round with tremendous velocity coming down again with resonant smash threatened to snap off short huge fan of propeller to obviate danger martin spoke to chief engineer who at once recognizing perilous position took station beside throttle valve immediately yacht dipped nose shut off steam so that when plunged stern again into water down stroke be not so dangerous to motionless blade enormous steel bar of crank shining with oil in dim lamplight arose fell irregularly owing to pitching of vessel one moment slowing down to half speed next beating air a rapidly a wing of swallow round round swept giant wheel with noiseless speed nothing must be heard lash of wave thrashing side of yacht intermittent throbbing of machinery sharp hiss of escaping steam moment engineer put hand to throttle valve in instant screw already spinning like top hung motionless until with recurring lurch great piston again began to slide smoothly in out of cylinder be wonderful to see absolute command one man have over colossal mass of machinery worked rested a let on shut off steam at plunge of ship a martin poet returned to deck heard smashing of dish in pantry subsequent bad language of steward eunice groaned creaked strained shrieked like living being a strove to make headway against furious blast right yelled crispin when be once more on streaming deck right enough a long a be in open sea retorted martin gloomily lord help if touch of darned reef island of gean be very dangerous to ship a ragged reef running out to sea like root can scarcely be noticed save in calm weather when thin line of white breaking on smooth surface of water betrays hidden teeth below be of treacherous reef captain be afraid a in such furious gale there be chance of ship striking in spite of utmost care being taken to navigate properly fortunately with helm screw be to a bridle be to horse eunice must skirt peril with greatest dexterity real danger lay in chance of running on sunken rock not set down in chart martin doubtful a to island on lee side went off to cabin for chart knowing must safely leave steering to gurt who indeed be better than chart knew more of sea than admiralty put together crispin returned to maurice reported have be done much to roylands satisfaction for however brave man may be be not pleasant to think that moment may be hurled into eternity caliphronas be still clinging to weather rigging face be graver than of yore for too knew danger of water good ship though eunice be unknown rock piercing bottom must sink rapidly while furious wave dashing against thus firmly held must not leave enough of stout timber to make cigar box afternoon continued beating about in weary sea near island of kamila for kamila proved to be on examination of chart much to vexation of captain martin who be considerably startled to find be out of course however such ignorance be not unpardonable a divergence from course arose from fact that owing to captain being constantly at wheel only hastily glancing at chart when be able did not notice sufficiently constant sagging of vessel have therefore unknown to drifted more to south than fancied contrary to expectation gale instead of abating increased in fury great mass of blinding rain came sweeping down in torrent on ship while gusty wind straining wet sail to utmost tension tautened weather rigging like bar of steel crew be picked men forty in number captain be first class sailor engine powerful boat stanch yet must avail little against colossal force of wind wave seemed resolved to conquer brave little craft struggling so gallantly against titanic force meal day have none for be impossible to sit at table steward cut sandwich with in conjunction with brandy water be able to sustain even caliphronas quite contrary to usual custom be so overwhelmed by peril of position that took spirit brought color back to pale cheek maurice be not at afraid having plenty of british pluck for helena must have cared little if unhappy life be ended by seething mass of water raging on side owing to cloudy sky incessant rain absence of sunlight darkness fell sooner than usual with sudden transition from day to night no more enchanted twilight of previous evening calm sea silver moon glittering star nothing pitchy gloom with roaring wave rising in liquid mass to black sky black sky raining down torrent on roaring wave while between welkin spume flew eunice like stormy petrel keeping afloat only through dexterity with be managed at time jagged flash of lightning gleaming blue a steel divided solid blackness with sabre like stroke succeeding thunder loud a be hardly added to deafening clamor of storm stunned ear of human being fighting so determinedly for life against appalling force of nature now must give thousand furlong of sea for acre of barren ground quoted crispin grimly a clung to stout rope faith dont think be born to be hanged maurice do think there be danger creespeen cried caliphronas whose teeth be chattering in head rather might go to bottom moment replied maurice who despite peril of position must not help smiling at cowardice of greek be man caliphronasyou arent afraid of death suppose oh ami be shivered count in abject fear to leave world love for know not what oh what come after god said crispin solemnly god echoed greek in tone of despairing conviction what be god know nothing beyond seewhat feelnothing else say there be godthere be god oh what will say to ask own conscience conscience cried caliphronas with sneer ill became ghastly face what do know of conscience have be wicked worse than neighbor after be death thenannihilation be that fearto longer see sun feel wind life in vein life be so glad death so terrible will undo of work that saint call wicked yes will tell mr maurice reason brought to melnos oh tell tell cried maurice eagerly brought here to did not finish sentence for at moment gust of unexampled strength tore past with shriek snapped mainmast by board crashing downward with tremendous force falling over side impeded yacht course brought gunwale dangerously near water black smoke poured in volume from funnel screw beat water with enormous power heavy mass huge canvas entanglement of rope held back down on one side to great imperilling of safety ax roared martin in voice of thunder cut away rope look smart lad for life if pitch to windard brings mast against bilge davy jones for sure sailor flew to do bidding though owing to perpetual pitching of vessel must not work continuously yet in space of hour managed to clear away wreckage fell over into boiling water while yacht righted like trembling deer man at wheel of course kept set course indicated by captain engine being slowed down during clearance episode ship sagged gradually to leeward until drifted dangerously near to rock of kamila be so busily engaged clearing away wreckage that new peril be unnoticed until moon half obscured by flying scud shone out palely on wild scene attracted by glimmer of planet martin looked up suddenly from work only to see towering cliff of island near at hand cap of sea rising like fountain of spouting foam over cruel looking rock roaring to pas word to engineer to give inch of steam be worth in order to shoot far enough ahead to clear rock martin sprang with one bound to wheel wrenched out of sailor hand put helm hard down so that yacht head flew up in wind just in time to avert frightful catastrophe immediately on increased speed of vessel plunged forward into wave on board feared that new dive into rough sea must be last for shipped sea freely ton of water swept deck fore aft at last fearful dive there be sound of sudden snap a if boat have touched rock shuddered through whole length after engine have whirled for minute with inconceivable velocity suddenly stopped god cried martin guessing reason of stoppage propeller have gone god help now fortunately way ship ran through water shot to windward sufficiently to clear kamila reef a must not be kept ahead to sea owing to fury of gale have again to be kept off so that remaining sail must tend to steady from violent lurching time steam be blowing off then fire being drawn sooty inhabitant of engine room like so many cyclops poured on deck to do what must in saving vessel during time be clearing reef moon have withdrawn light now shone forth in full splendor through rent in cloud whereupon sight be revealed struck terror into heart of on board melnos cried crispin greek in one breath over said martin gloomily screwonly one mastwell never clear that island maurice straining eye through glimmer of moon star half obscured by flying cloud saw high conical shaped mountain rising sheer out of sea at distance of about three mile snow of summit gleamed pale in moonlight below be darkness at base of peak spouted fountain of white surf on jagged rock running seaward kingdom come gentleman said captain with grim smile a looked at sky piercing peak looming hugely in vague light boatsbegan caliphronas who be quite pale whereupon martin turned on sharply boat sir what boat must live in sea jolly boat be gonethe steam pinnace be pretty well smashed up so there be only gig lifeboat to save forty five life youll try to launch boat at event said crispin quickly oh yes can be done will be done can depend sir poor look out with dispiriting word captain went away to see after life belt served out one to man gave at least chance of floating to land martin neglected chance of saving ship put helm up whereon fierce wind filled remaining canvas drove eunice slowly ahead for fully hour drifted to leeward now being quite unmanageable owing to loss of screw mast straight ahead lay melnos with fierce surf thundering at base ship unable to be guided be drifting slowly surely on to rock maurice with considerable forethought took crispin with below filled travelling flask with brandy meanwhile crew utterly demoralized by hopelessness of situation made for spirit room captain placed in front of with revolver swore to shoot first man who came forward still a men be weary from work wet cold with long exposure ordered rum to be served out reconciled somewhat to prohibition of too much drinking die like men not beast said martin thrusting revolver back again when crew be more manageable there be still chance of saving life by boat will be gone if drink be in by time yacht be so near island that must hear roar of surf see white tongue of wave running up black rock overhead heavy mass of cloud be moving like battalion across sky rain have ceased at interval moon shone out gave small comfort a enabled to see only too clearly peril awaited wind be still furious sea rolling mountain high huge billow topped with ragged fringe of foam glimmering in fitful light kept sweeping over deck several men be swept overboard into trough of sea assistance must be rendered by on board with despairing cry sank in furious water crispin pitying terror of caliphronas in spite of dislike for wily greek took below gave brandy count be just raising glass to lip when be levelled by tremendous shock made ship tremble from stem to stern god have struck cried crispin tore up stair a hard a be able followed by caliphronas who be now nerved by despair eunice have struck about quarter of mile from shore so fierce be wave between land that seemed a though boat must live in hell of water however a last hope captain ordered lifeboat to be lowered be accordingly done moment touched water discipline be at end for men seeing mean of safety rushed in tumultuous crowd to take advantage of in few minute lifeboat be filled with black mass of human being in spite of captain effort to maintain order cutting rope made for shore hardly have boat left ship when caught by huge wave capsized wave be black with shrieking mass of humanity o god o god groaned crispin hiding face will be drowned so be for in spite of life belt wave griped drowning men with irresistible force dashed mangled corps against rock of crowd of living breathing creature have gone off few minute before not one remained alive survivor felt that fate must be same lower away gig shouted martin going up to where boat be hanging if coward rush ill shoot freely cowed by revolver be covering with six deadly cartridge men did a be ordered placing boat in charge of mate captain made get in in orderly fashion now gentleman said martin to three who stood near get in quickthe yacht will soon be under water duty to stick to ship said brave old man if go down go downif doesnt there will be hope of safety will be last to leave there room in boat called mate quick for life caliphronas needed urging sprang into boat then either from treachery terror cut rope held to yacht with knife have in hand there be shout of execration from crew act be irremediable gig plunged away into darkness last seen by four survivor on deck being caliphronas furiously fighting with two of men who be trying to hurl overboard yacht be now nearly under water on deck stood martin maurice crispin gurt only one hope cried martin furiously shaking fist at retreating boat climb up mast flew to weather rigging maurice crispin gurt managed to climb up just a martin be springing for rope heavy sea swept yacht fore aft be carried overboard heard despairing cry a went down into trough of sea there be time to say anything for with one final plunge yacht went down three human being scrambled up rigging a fast a must followed by water seemed loath to surrender prey fortunately eunice have sunk near shore so when finally settled down about thirty foot of remaining mast be sticking up out of water to clung three survivor in desperate anxiety expecting moment to be shaken off into depth below at moment mast might break off roll of submerged yacht send into water so with terrible dread in heart three human being clung madly to only refuge below raged fierce water around be darkness above clouded sky veiled moon while amid horror hung three

into cloudless blue arose giant peak of melnos lofty summit swathed in snow already bathed in heavy yellow beam of rising sun below white cap appeared green mantle of foliage quite hid bare rock with profusion of myrtle plane tree arbutus ilex branching heather lower still red tint of rugged cliff black chaotic bowlder of beach scattered in huge mass in out of white thread of surf like fairy lacework far away to north arose island of kamila faint cloud like in midst of blue sea on murmuring water played gentle breeze breathing fragrant balm robbed from aromatic tree be scene of unexampled beauty even three unfortunate clinging to mast must not withhold admiration in spite of discomfort from be suffering once be on shore said crispin with confidence will take into interior of island where will be well looked after by justinian have island interior asked maurice sceptically for saw nothing huge mountain resting on azure sea of course did not tell be island of fantasy therefore full of wonder first thing be to get to land what do say gurt swim sir feel too stiff said crispin shaking head must not swim yardand maurice be in same plight replied roylands whose joint be aching with exposure to night if question of swimming will have to remain here till doomsday kin swim gentleman said gurt stoutly bless ye aint nothin aint why ive bin wrecked in norard precious cold be kin get ashore safe dunno bout sir gurts face assumed rapt expression of one who be thinking out deep problem maurice knowing inventiveness of sailor did not interrupt having confidence that mariner must hit upon plan of extricating from dilemma there be plenty of rope suggested crispin hopefully if right yare sir said gurt energetically one eye flashing with satisfaction ill tie together swim ashore fust ill tie rope t th mast then t th beach two kin skip along like monkey dye see sir sooner be plan thought of than energetic gurt proceeded to put into practice spliced rope must get hold of being

thus revivified gurt with rope round waist scrambled down into calm water be soon striking out boldly for shore maurice poet watched black head bobbing up down in blue kept paying out rope carefully lest entanglement must hamper swimmer thank heaven he right cried crispin in tone of relief a saw white figure of sailor clambering over black rock now turn in order to swim freely gurt have stripped naked so two left on mast have to carry clothes to shore thing easy enough a gurt wore be shirt pair of blue serge trouser crispin took one article maurice other waited for gurt to signal from shore that rope be made fast soon saw waving hand shouting to intimate be right whereupon examined knot of rope to see that be fast to mast then slid down into sea rope be pretty well taut a ran from mast to shore so crispin maurice holding on to struggled along towards land limb ached with pain owing to long exposure to night air drink of spirit put new vigor into wearied frame after toilsome journey aided by rope managed to reach beach up scrambled with thankful heart right sir asked gurt dressing rapidly stiff replied crispin ruefully feel a creaky a old door aint used t grinned gurt shifting

construction on motif how dare question andros be master here be helena be free to marry if wish a far a be concerned must rather be drowned in sea than become son in law count went alternately red white a justinian spoke when speech be ended tried to answer rage be such that must say nothing so with choking cry of anger turned on heel darted out of court while king much agitated walked up down hurriedly white robe sweeping pavement what doe boy mean muttered angrily like veiled threat melnos be well defended mistrust androshe be too much friend of rascal alcibiades bah have feartreachery for treacheryand if andros dare paused abruptly raising hand shook impotently at sky then resumed seat with frown boded ill for caliphronas in event of double dealing on part being discovered peacock

roylandsnarrated beginning of voyage arrival in greek water storm loss of yacht subsequent treachery of caliphronas daring recital justinian with compressed lip listened to in silence only uttering smothered exclamation of rage when heard how caliphronas have cut rope left on board yacht to perish thank crispin said when poet brought narrative to close story be worthy of being told by ulysses at

apology restored portrait a andros gave will not deprive of mr roylands said politely shortly hope to present to original now asked maurice eagerly must go sleep afternoon replied justinian authoritatively also crispin after danger of last night must be quite worn out well bath meal have done wonder said crispin yawning must say few hour sleep must complete cure when will see helena

to lie sluggishly in bed sun be hardly above eastern horizon before justinian household guest be seated at breakfast helena be not present having already gone out in deliciously fresh morning air on expedition connected with flower so meal be strictly masculine one four men made plan for day crispin caliphronas decided to remain at acropolis a be already well acquainted with lion of island one to write letter other to await return of helena over whose movement kept watch with jealous solicitude of doubtful lover maurice in company of justinian went down to valley in order that englishman might be shown wonder of unique place white indoor robe of previous evening be now discarded in favor of serviceable costume similar to worn by rough cretan mountaineerslong boot of brown leather loose blue

tassel on white lock maurice be supplied with large gray felt shade of be very grateful island king looked truly regal in picturesque dress with long gray beard sun tanned skin fierce black eye reverend lock lithe active a young man carried burden of sixty five year with greatest of ease a walked beside maurice with light springy step sculptor began to think that companion must have discovered secret of perpetual youth walked leisurely along mulberry avenue in direction of entrance to tunnel enjoyed exquisite coolness of morning for sun be not yet over shoulder of mountain cup be still in comparative shadow notwithstanding however air be warm balmy with scent of aromatic herb delightful temperature rather puzzled maurice a did not agree with marked absence of sunlight for greater part of morning mentioned to justinian certainly get much of sun in morning owing to mountain answered old man stroking silver beard in middle of day most of afternoon beam be very powerful for at noon be right above head western side of melnos peak be so low that until near sunset ray stream on valley pointed to west maurice saw that high peak fell away into kind of low semicircle enabled from position to catch glimpse of blue sea distant island on side of gap however jagged summit stood up stern rigid snow clad against delicately blue sky girding valley at same height round save at western side before mentioned still said maurice pertinently sun be still below eastern side of mountain yet air be quite warm can not temple to hephaistos solve riddle oh mean that island be volcanic yes be crater of extinct volcano extinct for thousand of year for even when temple be built fire must have died out builder must hardly have placed on inner side of crater be volcanic character of melnos make so warm fertile see slope be covered with corn vine olive in profusion while date lemon orange tree citron such delicate plant grow wild without cultivation valley be veritable horn of plenty so lauded by hellene if be to believe ancient historian said maurice gravely a looked at fertile side of mountain so admirably cultivated be also case with crater of vesuvius proved to be still active what do think melnos will break out again observed justinian with shade of thought on fine face indeed have earthquake occasionally not much to speak of fancy island of north be more of volcanic centre than still volcano may break out againin that case be afraid work will go for nothing be island entirely work bit of answered old man emphatically forty year ago came into

flight of red limestone step led to valley below be truly amazed at engineering science displayed by man beside flight after flight now to right now to left stretched down gentle slope of mountain mighty stair be carefully finished with heavy balustrade of same material neatly joined together at certain platform statue of white marble pedestalled on red block stood up in proud beauty seeing guest eye fixed on heroic form justinian laughed be bit of antiquarian mr roylands explained a descended over island pay men to dig among ancient ruin for statue do best to restore then place here apollo for instance said a paused before life sized nude figure holding lyre be found at delos brought to true greek government claim thing see why must not secure if possible be sure look better in

there be danger of attack being made be not so sure about king george government be more feared by scamp than be king otho though majority of have disappeared there be still left who must like to storm melnos alcibiades what do know of alcibiades asked justinian sharply nothing more than that be equivocal character caliphronas told so much andros yes be far too friendly with scamp of alcibiades who be excessively dangerous man trust andros know so out of sheer anger may urge alcibiades to assault island enemy without traitor withinit be very dangerous if distrust caliphronas why dont turn out have proof against yet fancy have scheme in mind believe mr roylands if have stomach for fighting fancy there will be plenty of opportunity for to indulge in shortly oh a for must like

foot of grand staircase to blue lake distance in being about quarter of mile on side between pathway road ran two line of elm tree foliage of formed pleasant shade while house built in tropical fashion with wide veranda be gay with flower helena have evidently inoculated father subject with love for flower a on side eye be dazzled with profusion of bright tint at lower end of street be wide semicircle facing lake planted with line of beech elm plane tree while in middle of pleasantness stood tall pedestal of white marble bearing huge bronze zeus seated half draped with thunderbolt eagle beside indeed statue of god goddess be so frequent that maurice began to think eccentric host in order to complete revival of ancient athens have re established hierarchy of olympus with a pontifex maximus evidently face betrayed thought for seeing eye fixed on garland decorating base of statue king laughed in amused manner mr roylands be not pagan in spite of presence of god said with smile people belong to orthodox church have priest sacred building everything necessary for such religion be also of greek church be renegade replied justinian haughtily at same time be not what must call christian trust religious principle be not of caliphronas believe in working for good of others a can see morally speaking be what call agnostic though truly believe in supreme power erect altar to mr roylands strive to propitiate by helping fellow creature conversation now becoming rather delicate in trenching on religious belief maurice turned dexterously by remarking on number of mulberry tree

people in street in similar dress to ownthat be men for woman be mostly arrayed in graceful greek dress of cretan consisted of full white trouser reaching to ankle brightly colored tunic embroidered jacket gaudy handkerchief twisted round head long white veil though latter be assumed for festive occasion men woman be very fine looking with oval face olive skin somewhat pointed chin aquiline nose gait be remarkably graceful with stately bearing of free race adult saluted justinian respectfully acknowledged greeting with haughty condescension although unbent somewhat towards child who crowded round with cry of kalli imera kyrion be a populous a hive of bee said maurice a walked down to lake soon island will be too small not for many year hope trust answered justinian casting look round at now sunny side of mountain encircled like cup there be plenty of room yet for colony in spite of forty year be only yet in infancy lot of room yonder for dwelling soil be fertile affords plenty of

be very fond of have goat of course also sheep though be afraid goat be more numerous indeed have imported here of rare cretan breeda kind of ibex grows to great size of course will not allow to be killed for food have plenty of smaller wild goat such a exist in many place in greece particularly on summit of olympus probably forget have goat flesh for supper last night lake sir artificial purely sea water oh dear level of valley be considerably above of sea must be sorry be otherwise a be lower might run chance of being swamped by influx of water be sure alcibiades friend must be delighted to drown like rat if must lake come from snow yonder snow precisely have have reservoir constructed far below snow line shoot into from summit of mountain at certain interval send men up who detach great mass of snow send down shoot into reservoir there heat of sun soon melt to water from thence water be taken down to lake water always rise to own level hence think valley must be entire lake there be danger of such catastrophe happening a reservoir be filled in purely artificial manner take care to keep within bound pipe also down to lake be contrived so a to regulate influx of water therefore there be fear of flood now must come see theatre theatre have playwright actor here playwright date from old hellenic day be called schylus sophocles euripides actor be greek sometimes crispin writes play bearing on local event satirizes after style of aristophanic comedyat least did so when lived here since departure have fallen back on hellas for play how often do give performance only once year at vintage feast oh follow old custom closely here hope to show veritable dionysiade before leave have three day festival of simple mirth without of coarse element be introduced by later hellene first day have vintage festival second play on third there be olympian game with what prize a of yore laurel wreath be particularly anxious to keep up game a make greek athlete hardens by muscular exercise else in lotus eating valley must be apt to become indolent then where must melnos be without brave men to defend be perfect spartan believe in spartan training to great extent think body must be trained exclusively mind neglected therefore have tragedy performed be unknown to sparta spartan be fine nation of materialist be right said maurice earnestly one must never let material nature overpower spiritual speak warmly a be taught mother be religious woman trained carefully one can not rid one self of youthful teaching may forget for time always force before mind sooner later not always also be taught a forty year of solitudecomparative solitudeand pondering have turned into what aman agnostic so mother be good woman be alive died many year ago father be also dead be orphan relation in worldat least none care about justinian gazed at young man a if must read very soul then turning away with half suppressed sigh entered theatre be modelled on of athensa large semicircle hewn out of volcanic rock with seat of red limestone so frequent in stage faced mountain have altar beautifully sculptured in front of life sized statue of dionysius phbus on side be temple of thespis said justinian a stood in centre of semicircle be at moderate distance from stage see be not very large suitable to size of island number of population so a actor can easily be seen need cothurnus mask play be afraid be not so gigantic a of ancient hellas there be one advantage face be seen greek be wonderfully expressive in revealing feeling by countenance melnos seems to be built of red stone yes get from cliff of island tint be pleasing warms up landscape be sorry can not see ocean from theatre a be very fond of sea shut in by circle of mountain of course be impossible now must go see silk factory after have gone through thoroughlyfor justinian insisted upon maurice taking notice of detailthe king showed hot spring just outside village bubbled up from earth amid rugged block of black lava streaked fantastically with sulphur spring be full of medicinal property be useful for cure of many disease said a watched light cloud of steam rising of melnos be so healthy that rarely use plenty of work plenty of physical exercise careful attention to birth fresh air water in abundance keep whole population in splendid health be case of quality not quantity have poet painter sculptor not yet true sometimes rude song be made rude picture painted be afraid century of slavery have crushed creative power out of hellenic race however be free here have city of refuge in island so in future who know what melnos may become second attica have plato sophocles phidias will take year to develop genius said maurice a once more began to climb up staircase be afraid so dread who may come after be old can not live long so when die unless successor be actuated by same desire to found miniature attica a have be may turn place into nest of robber in case be afraid king george government must interfere aspiration of melnos to revive hellenic culture must be at end who be to be successor that know true have daughter need man to manage greek took crispin andros in order to train up a heir crispin have become wealthy prefers to live in england while andros a now call caliphronas be nothing scamp if succeeded work must go for nothing must be tyrant robber selfish seeker after pleasure who must destroy simplicity of melnos break law transform into nest of criminal surely have clever men among people clever to serve bad to rule none of have administrative power required for even so small community a to succeed must have englishman be dominating race fit to rule glance round world will show colonizing capability by cool head firm hand have transformed barren island into centre of prosperity if successor only follow policy in few hundred year little unknown island may become centre of great intellectual power athenian know be small in number yet see intellectual effect produced in world history greek of mine be descendant of ancient hellene spark of genius nearly trampled out by century of turkish misrule be still within place plant in dark grows not give plenty of air sunlight first green leaf appear then bud lastly flower be green leaf have placed in light let be tended looked after who know what glorious flower may be produced be splendiddream dream may yet turn out truth answered justinian with energy see how well have prepared ground people here be physically perfect morality be much above what be to be found in island of gean have taught to love work loathe idleness island dwell in contains beauty of nature in small space infinite rich in little room to quote marlowe be starting fairly under guidance will develop a prototype of athens into keen cultured intellectual race who may give modern world a splendid gift of genius a did father of old plant need fostering gardener ala be growing old so when die who will attend to delicate flower of artificiality what want be to find successor who will do a have done will be difficult to find fear so unless here justinian paused abruptly walked rapidly along mulberry avenue in be now maurice waited to hear speak said nothing until stood under graceful corinthian capital of temple pillar when suddenly came to full stop looked at maurice keenly mr roylands do know what think sir that must be excellent thing for to give up country gentleman life in england come here for what reason to be successor maurice stared at in open mouthed astonishment in moment justinian vanished chapter xx difficult question if question strange decide way way at pleasure surely can not be denied if question strange decide fate prerogative defied thus may grudge self won treasure if question strange decide way way at pleasure certainly maurice felt in somewhat embarrassing position on hearing of justinian offer to instal a future king of melnos hardly knew what decision to make in matter at present affair be so unexpected bewildering that hardly grasped fact of reality remained where be leaning against pillar wondering if be asleep awake have come to unknown island of gean sea therein have beheld miniature civilization of most unique character in by very fancifulness be enough to unsettle calm reasoning power when lo man who have created vision of dead classicism proposed to bestow on a gift there be something singularly tempting in offer especially to man of roylands artistic temperament for here in sea girt island must lead life of dreamy seclusion work at art amid rejuvenated hellenic time breathed serenity calm necessary to foster craving soul of genius in riotous modern world of england have often felt like alien work imbued with modernism seemed feeble meretricious after masterpiece of greek art still remain to remind of supremacy of attic sculptor in delineating human figure devoted to art have maurice be asked by fairy to name desire must certainly have demanded to be placed in kindred circumstance calm untroubled serene to masterly athenian creator who adorned parthenon with god like form lo without intervention of unseen power wish have be unexpectedly gratified yet now that boon long dreamed of be gratified hesitated a to advisability of accepting be difficult for to make up mind from very contrast of two

fascinating dream involved straining of nerve to attain thankless end on other hand be year of quietness of dwelling in modern paradise under serene sky with incentive to awaken foster artistic soul reconstruction of calm attic existence seemed so far off mist like beyond stormy water of medivalism modern restlessness maurice always impressionable to surroundings felt a did ulyssean sailor in lotus land when be loath to leave drowsy island for fruitless toilings on main thought serene existence of melnos unvexed by tumult of nation be perfect yet ambitious spirit of nineteenth century

for beauty truth be marred by fatal scepticism blighted genius of heine have faith of one doubt of other drawn strongly way by opposing force paused irresolutely between two first must accept live old hellenic life then must refuse lest such life must lack sharp salt flavor of modern existence as between two bundle of hay be maurice unlike animal knew that bundle contained what other lacked greedy of doubtful of afraid of be quite unable to make up extremely unstable mind man in such embarrassing position always make up otherwise wavering mind to one thing be to ask advice though in nine case out of ten never mean to take when given maurice be not sure if must accept advice yet nevertheless went to seek crispin in order to lay matter before ask what thought be best course for to pursue crispin be wise crispin be friendly moreover have tried ancient modern mode of existence a youth have be spent in melnos early manhood in civilized europe so surely crispin with knowledge of side of question be best to decide for one other morning crispin have be hard at work on formidable looking epistle to eunice in told peril adventure departure from southampton voyage down mediterranean wreck

to write separate letter to eunice full of passion then slip into epistle by maurice whom intended to get to write to rector mr carriston be friend to lover must doubtless be able to deliver letter unseen by dragon thus mr dengelton must be thwarted must try to destroy eunices affection for poet by keeping back letter near crispin sat gurt at open window chewing quid of reflection looking excessively dismal a found semi classical existence somewhat dull moreover true seaman a be viewed prolonged sojourn on land with much disgust brightened up however when maurice came in twisted

justinian desired to succeed said crispin in tone of wonderment even have known hardly think thing must have gone differently be poet not ruler napoleon be made of stronger stuff than mere bard piping idle song letting world go by justinian never hinted at thing always thought that favored caliphronas a heir to island throne caliphronas echoed maurice in tone of deep disdain justinian be too keen judge of character to mistake greek goose for swan told that doe not trust caliphronas more than suspect of having understanding with rascal alcibiades regarding capture of melnos deuce yes may well be astonished from what have seen of caliphronas believe be quite likely to happen more so a handsome greek vanity will receive severe blow when be refusedas certainly will beby helena well can see justinian will not have caliphronas to succeed on island throne so two candidate for purple being thus disposed of yes asked crispin curiously a roylands hesitated want to ascend throne when vacant be not astonished crispin twirled cigarette in finger looked thoughtfully at red tip a if consulting a oracle then made slow reply yes justinian evidently see in clear headed man who must carry out

unfortunate who have be cast up on beach of melnos now in company with three young men surviving sailor went to sea shore in order to give corps decent burial conducted by body of greek bearing torch went down through tunnel speedily arrived at outer entrance from sandy beach sloped down to harbor not that be exactly harbor justinian have aided nature to form one by erecting breakwater from end of jutting promontory breakwater built of huge undressed stone ran out in curve into tideless sea thus embraced calm pool of water sufficiently protected ship at anchorage beyond ocean at time be rough enough at stormy season dashed white wave over rocky mole within charmed circle there be danger smallest boat be a safe there a must have be on serene water of mountain lake be work of english engineer who have planned carried out piercing of tunnel maurice must not withhold admiration at perfection of whole scheme for without breakwater must have be impossible for sized craft to cast anchor off craggy coast of island have two harbor of kind said justinian a looked at small boat felucca caques filled pool one see other be on opposite side of island a face to west of course suffers more from storm than one built in order to facilitate escape in time of trouble must tunnel be taken by assault hardly understand there be only two way of getting into interior of melnos one be by tunnel other be pas cut through western side of mountain where fall away in semicircle a showed owing to height of peak around ruggedness being covered year round with snow be impossible for outside enemy to climb over tunnel western pas be only mode of ingres egress a have explained must tunnel therefore be forced find unable to defend island have to do be to retreat through pas told of down to harbor on other side where there be plenty of boat ready to take to place of safety of course trust in courage of greek difficulty enemy must encounter in capturing tunnel so hardly expect contingency a flight by western pas must occur still be always a well to be prepared for emergency have thought of everything said maurice admiringly danger sharpens man wit replied justinian coolly when first came to melnos be surrounded on side by rascal of alcibiades type alcibiades be only smuggler observed caliphronas who be listening to discourse alcibiades be pay best retorted king in great ire be only fear of king george government keep from hoisting black flag making island of gean nest of iniquity believe be filibuster at heart andros greek laughed consciously did not contradict old man be like alcibiades sir said at length go in for what pay bestmr maurice there know sentiment regarding life do very bad sentiment be wonder what must say to view of alcibiades may carry view more into practice than do retorted maurice warmly defy to be worse justinian laughed at blunt way in maurice spoke so caliphronas having own reason for keeping fair face to old man discreetly held peace trudged along beach towards place where body of ill fated sailor lay mast of eunice be still above water yacht lay far below blue sea where must probably remain until there remained nothing of save engine must of course defy time ocean until between mighty destroyer rusted to nothing from position in lay general calmness of water be probable yacht must have be set afloat again greek of cyclades have not sufficient energy for such task underwriter must doubt rather pay insurance money than waste more in attempt to raise wreck from depth below twelve body have be thrown up by sea rest of crewwith exception of ten sailor including gurtwere buried deep in ocean far up in sheltered nook under red cliff twelve graf have be dug in soft sand in be ill fated seaman laid martin body be not among doubtless lay in sailor grave nigh island encircled by sand seaweed many colored shell funeral ceremony did not take long a justinian refused office maurice undertook task of chaplain with voice full of emotion read beautiful burial service of church of england over remains of dead sailor be then covered up roughly made wooden cross placed at head of humble grave with name of date of death carved thereon present stood bareheaded during ceremony even melnosians who be gentleman enough not to offend prejudice of stranger wrecked on rugged shore everything having thus be done in order to show respect to dead justinian party returned to entrance of tunnel dick smart young boatswain before mentioned attached to maurice for whom have great admiration dick have received education much above of average british tar maurice found very companionable fellow one who bore great hatred for caliphronas a seemed to think lively greek be cause of misfortune have overtaken eunice kind of jonah sir said dick in whisper for caliphronas be walking just ahead of with justinian if wed chucked overboard dont believe boat must have gone ashore come dick can not say count have anything to do with storm well dont know sir replied dick doubtfully dont believe in one bit why sir cut that rope on purpose know did dn muttered boatswain in tone of suppressed rage why dont have out with sir cant very well dick doubtless cut rope a say on purpose be so overcome by terror that might not have known what be doing he coward sira miserable coward wasnt overcome so much by terror a not to save own life how long do stop here sir can hardly tell mr crispin have sent to england for new yacht will proceed to athens expect will be here at least month lord bless sir dont mind jolly sort of place though

own opinion a to who be beauty of island of course did not impart such information to dick who after respectfully saluting fell back among brother sailor began to tease one eyed gurt about zoe proceeding have little effect on hardened mariner boat be going to syra day be now lying in harbor ready to start justinian went on board to give final order to captain while crispin also accompanied in order to place bundle of letter in charge of skipper have told justinian about proposed purchase of yacht proceeding of astute ancient much approved a if of anticipated trouble came to pas yacht must be useful to bring soldier from syra to aid in defending island sailor can stay here until new boat come out said justinian thoughtfully for if caliphronas a call play traitor will require a many men a can to defend alcibiades have not army alcibiades know scum of levant have doubt can get few hundred scamp together have fear of government for if stormed took melnos after plundering island must only have to dissolve again among population in order to escape one must accuse of teacup war have weapon for men asked crispin with considerable trepidation justinian smiled grimly when go back to acropolis will show armory have plenty of gun pistol of most modern construction many of greek be good shot too oh havent neglected useful for ornamental assure be looking at alcibiades alcibiades cried justinian with roar like lion looking towards shore where number of men be standing among heavy looking fellow talking eagerly to caliphronas so be wonder brings rascal here must get away from melnos at once crispin roylands get into boatthere be time to lose active old man rapidly delivered final order to captain georgios then hastily scrambled down to boat followed by two young men be speedily pulled ashore justinian springing on to rock strode up with frowning face to group surrounding alcibiades caliphronas pushing men on side with haughty roughness now then captain alcibiades what do want at melnos maurice looked curiously at celebrated individual of whom have heard so much beheld squat heavily built man with fiery eye evil countenance long black beard be clad in usual dress of greek sailor consisting of rough blue trouser jacket boot of untanned red shirt tasselled cap of same color to mark rank however wore handsome gold embroidered belt round waist in be placed rusty looking knife brace of pistol then be renowned captain kidd of water who have lived fifty year earlier must have be declared pirate who now owing to establishment of new hellas have to carry on rascally calling under pious guise of smuggling peaceful trading with rough dress squat figure tangled black beard formed great contrast to slender form of caliphronas with clean shaven face dandy costume of albanian palikar yet in spite of difference in good look two men have same cunning expression in shifty eye there be little doubt that rough blackguardism of one be only refined into astute scoundrelism of other well alcibiades demanded justinian imperiously stamping foot what do want with kyrion justinian said smuggler in cringing manner landed here to see kyrion andros about cargo of wine wish to obtain for crete will pay good price for a grape of melnos be much thought of at khanea justinian on receiving diplomatic answer ran finger thoughtfully through silver beard pondered a to what answer to give be never averse to turning honest penny by trading knew alcibiades must pay good price a wine of melnos be much liked by cretan on account of resinous taste for insular greek a rule preserve vintage in way be peculiar to mainland how much do want said abruptly two hundred skin replied alcibiades glibly named what considered fair price do think desire to make present of wine retorted justinian scornfully double offer kyrion impossible cried alcibiades throwing up hand with look of dismay on crafty looking face wont get for le alcibiades cast stealthy look at caliphronas considered few moment effendi will do replied with air of one who have made great sacrifice will be ruinedyes ruined justinian nodded curtly turning on heel went towards tunnel followed by maurice of course have not understood word of preceding conversation conducted a be in greek even crispin found speech of alcibiades little difficult at time a piratical individual be in habit of mixing up own tongue with turkish french italian sometimes scrap of english crispin walk with mei wish to speak to said justinian poet having obeyed command maurice be left in congenial company of alcibiades count captain alcibiades kept casting curious glance at maurice for caliphronas have told about rich englishman agreeable old pirate be wondering in guileless way if must not be possible to kidnap wealthy foreigner hold in own little rocky island until such time a relative paid good ransom alcibiades be genuine brigand of type described by m about that have fallen on evil time of peace quietness must doubtless have risen to high rank in adored profession with view to satisfying personally a to wealth of traveller alcibiades guessing maurice did not know greek spoke to in french with maurice be sufficiently well acquainted to enable to hold interesting conversation with accomplished cut throat monsieur be staying here asked alcibiades blinking little eye for timeyes aha monsieur be friend of dear andros so to myself be also dear friend lay at foot monsieur very kind of retorted maurice who be not at pleased by implied friendship monsieur be rich whats to do with eh faith be angry monsieur englishman be rich be common delusion with foreigner englishman be not rich alcibiades shrugged shoulder spread out hand in french fashion monsieur be disposed to be witty by time have arrived at entrance to tunnel justinian who have be in earnest conversation with crispin turned round sharply to alcibiades will wait here said imperiously will not men come up in order to carry down wine said alcibiades looking a black a thunder at peremptory order will send men down with can pay money to andros here effendi enough have spoken holy st elmo will not let visit island farther than retorted justinian significantly know proverb captain alcibiadesill to who show treasure freely turned back on baffled cut throat ascended stair followed by own men while alcibiades ruffian remained below evidently mad with anger at having admittance refused rumor said melnos be full of treasure crafty smuggler wanted to convince of truth of with own eye so prohibition against passing palisade made very wrathful king however paid attention to black look resumed journey with crispin maurice on side of caliphronas on weak pretext of asking alcibiades question about wine remained behind fact be at once noted by lynx eyed justinian traitor growled in deep voice stroking beard a be habit when angered fox to fox ah well know two rascal be hatching plot against if think so why do want caliphronas to go with alcibiades can not see crispin will never make diplomatist will tell roylands here be sure will discover reason roylands be going to deliver wine to alcibiades although know doe not want why doe buy then because thought must be good pretext to get into melnos spy out weak point of defence oh know be so else must not have given price so freely knew plan moment agreed to give what asked be very large price one honest trader must afford to give andros also know of scheme can guess how found that out yes because alcibiades looked at caliphronas before agreeing to price exactly said justinian with great satisfaction roylands be quicker than dear crispin when refused to sell wine unless at own price look to andros be one of inquiry answer be give what asks will not see interior of melnos rascal know scheme will baffle yet with propose to send caliphronas on trip with alcibiades when will be able to bring plot to head said crispin impatiently blind blind poet forget andros have not yet made up mind on side to be if give helena make successor will betray alcibiades a readily a must betray if refused well only way to meet treachery be by treachery so intend to lead andros to believe will do what wish will then send to cruise about with alcibiades quite devoted to interest alcibiades thinking andros be on side will tell about plan number of army when proposes to assault island of good andros will repeat to once have information andros will find out that trust like that will have child island on hearing treacherous scheme justinian fell in estimation of maurice who true englishman a be liked everything to be done openly whereas greco briton partook more of ulyssean craft than honest fair fighting punic faith said at length not knowing quite what remark to make punic faith with punic neighbor retorted justinian a paused at gate if dont baffle andros by turning own weapon against chance be that will side with alcibiades one fine day melnos will be attacked unawares will have throat cut still mode of defeating caliphronas be hardly english good sir said old man with quiet irony englishman in time have have to do just such underhand work forget lord clive false treaty with hindoo omichund bound that slippery rascal to british interest at time of battle of plassy promised everything before battle gave nothing after be punic faith be necessary in such case straightforward honesty doesnt pay in water well do what think best sir replied maurice who saw justinian be right case of when greek meet greek suppose then come tug of war finished crispin gayly dear maurice will be happier in actual battle than in statecraft lead to hope statecraft will avert struggle said justinian sombrely with enemy like andros to deal with fear for worst what be waiting for here asked maurice seeing still lingered at gate for andros replied justinian quietly alone posse key gate be never left unlocked ah here be carthaginian now two gentleman go on leave to andros punic faith maurice poet followed by english sailor entered gate resumed ascent while wily justinian waited with inscrutable face to entrap equally wily caliphronas who time however have found master in treachery what do think of justinian maurice asked crispin when be once more in open air standing at head of staircase watching sailor descending to village below to speak frankly like justinian in spite of punic faith a for replied maurice coloring little necessity know law caliphronas be such consummate scoundrel can hardly blame justinian for trying to beat with own weapon justinian be serpent of wisdom said poet reflectively taking off sombrero can have idea how dexterously manages slippery greek have wholesome respect for a well may have seeing that not one of have ever yet have better of king of melnos used to speak bitterly of justinian crispin be opinion changed yes must admit have changed for better what told other day about justinian desiring for successor have opened eye be fear of losing that made refuse to tell real name for thought must forsake go back to kinsfolk well have certainly forsaken yes dont think regret a see be not made of stuff necessary to rule colony of serpent so now have further reason to keep in dark will feel sure tell what wish to know before leave melnos said justinian thought be not brave enough so did so doe fancy be indebted to dear friend count for in expedition with alcibiades justinian be absent so must not have personally seen fighting can only think that caliphronas to oust out of possible throne told about be sure be not coward said maurice warmly dont think be replied crispin equably fancy if justinian have seen storm must have changed opinion about caliphronas a to hope yet to right in eye of old man be glad have good opinion of maurice dear fellow cried roylands grasping by hand have best possible opinion of in way always have even when be mystery yes though own be puzzling at time be coward in one way crispin poet flushed redly maurice hastened to finish sentence in presence of mr dengelton must be bold man who felt fear in presence of lady answered crispin face clearing again here come caliphronas with smiling face sign justinian have succeeded greek advanced towards with merry laugh looked triumphantly at maurice who bore insolent self complacency with wonderful composure will not see two gentleman for few day said gayly be going on cruise with alcibiades more piracy perhaps answered caliphronas mysteriously good by for present must go down to look after wine if go back to acropolis tell helena will see before go with jeering look at maurice duped scoundrel sprang down step snowy fustanella fluttering in breeze glittered down descent like brilliant falling star fool said voice behind turned to behold justinian with complacent smile on face well have succeeded sir observed maurice doubtfully have caliphronas think have own way see dont yet like tactic well sir tush replied justinian coolly punic foespunic faith chapter xxii apple of discord woman caused fall of man woman caused fall of troy apple woe began brought beneath pale sorrow ban earthly joy for eve be fair helen fair wrought destruction by face captured heart in beauty snare made mankind burden bear of disgrace to day story repeat woman win loses pluck fruit for to eat taste find apple sweet then fall ill fated eunice have be wrecked about middle of august be now nearly end of september close on celebration of vintage feast justinian determined to celebrate with great splendor so a to gratify maurice with accurate representation of ancient dionysia of athens crispin for moment have resumed old occupation of playwright have furbished up one of old drama not having time to write absolutely new one in play caliphronas helena be to take part author like modern schylus acted a stage manager drilling chorus arranging scenery attending to music coaching principal actor in part people of melnos be also busily preparing for vintage feast of first day for olympian game of third amid peaceful occupation justinian kept watchful eye on caliphronas neglected nothing might guard island against sudden assault by captain alcibiades gang completely deceived by manner of demarch be justinian local title among people caliphronas now assured of helena melnos eagerly entered into plan of cunning old man on returning from week cruise with alcibiades revealed wide stretching conspiracy among levantine greek for capture of melnos far wide alcibiades with great art have instilled belief into mind of idler vagabond scamp of gean that melnos contained immense treasure weekly leader of band of men repaired to alcibiades rocky little island to receive instruction a to how plan be to be carried out of course wily old pirate be leader arranged scheme in most dexterous manner for gave command to chief men who came to see returning to own island communicated such order to own follower by mean alcibiades have collected quite army eager for plunder have arranged among to attack melnos by tunnel western pas at first convenient opportunity may seem strange in eye of civilized people that conspiracy must be planned carried out under very nose of greek government operation be conducted with great caution different portion of proposed army be scattered piecemeal over island of gean so there be really nothing to arouse suspicion of authority that revolutionary movement be in course of formation besides melnos being in extreme south of archipelago close to crete home of turkish misrule local disturbance must be taken comparatively little notice of a such disturbance be quite common so seemed a though alcibiades brother scamp be going to have thing own way once captured plundered melnos have fear of future a once dissolved into small company returned to own island must be quite impossible for greek government even if did interfere to punish body of men to appearance have existence plan of alcibiades be very simple for having arranged with leader of several body of men that must join in scheme commanded that must meet on own island on certain dayas yet unfixedwhen in aggregate must number quite three hundred men must thus storm melnos must only be defended a knew by two hundred inclusive of woman in fact population of justinian island capable of bearing arm even including english sailor guest scarcely numbered more than one hundred twenty men so when fiery old englishman heard from caliphronas of strength of enemy saw that danger be indeed serious melnos however be strongly fortified against inroad of ill armed pirate for tunnel defended by palisade must hardly be forced if held by small body of resolute men western pas be commanded by two piece of ordnance one on side must sweep down stormers by score must attempt to carry natural entrance by assault a to rest of island be quite impossible for marauder to climb over rugged snow clad peak so what with cannon defence arm of most modern construction resolute men justinian felt that must defy captain alcibiades ill armed crew old demarch still permitted caliphronas to remain in fool paradise a matter be in delicate position resolved to wait until after three day festival before coming to perfect understanding with treacherous greek caliphronas therefore regarding a entirely favored by fortune became almost unbearable in insolence have not maurice known real fact of case serious quarrel must certainly have taken place between a be however young englishman saw that greek be completely duped by false prosperity must almost have pitied blind confidence in good fortune have not arrogance insolence spite of count inspired with utmost contempt caliphronas indeed be hated by one in island by common people owing to haughtiness scorn invariably displayed towards by english sailor who thought coward have never forgiven treachery on night of wreck have cost captain life by inmate of acropolis who despised brilliant butterfly heartily quite unaware of delicate ground on be treading caliphronas in gorgeous albanian costume swaggered about place in most offensive manner quite assumed demeanor of despot much to amusement of justinian who chuckled grimly a saw blind confidence of greek however be calm before storm everything went along smoothly enough save for occasional outbreak between maurice count about helena who be veritable apple of discord between fiery young men helena disliked caliphronas intensely a be only too well aware of mean petty soul contained in splendid body outward beauty have effect upon knowing a did what truly despicable wretch man be admiration for be purely sensual one for knew nothing about true pure love wanted be to have lovely woman to to be mistress slave doubtless be same animal passion a be cherished by paris son of priam for other helen whose beauty must scarcely have be greater than of namesake of melnos caliphronas a trojan prototype be inspired by purer deity than venus pandemos when count paid compliment helena shuddered so instinctively did virginal soul feel impurity of persistent suitor treated with marked coldness much to anger of caliphronas who complained bitterly to justinian of scorn with advance be met good andros said justinian one day when have be inveighing against caprice of woman why do come to for assistance if handsome face fine figure smooth tongue can not win affection of woman nothing else will believe like that englishman muttered greek in wise pleased at ironical tone of demarch be not responsible for like dislike retorted justinian coldly although heard remark with much inward satisfaction however have promise will keep only on condition that keep informed of scheme of alcibiades oh will do will do anything to win helena if deceive will be worst day work ever did there be necessity to threaten without cause replied justinian bridling anger at insolence of count will have helena melnos before announcing publicly wish to wait until after dionysia very well answered caliphronas turning on heel week so will make difference to when be publicly acknowledged a son in law successor first thing will do will be to turn crispin insolent englishman out of island well well well see about said justinian with great indifference wait till after dionysia after conversation caliphronas went away perfectly satisfied that everything be going in favor be extremely foolish a might have guessed something be wrong from unnatural calmness of justinian formerly old demarch have be given to outburst of fiery wrath when will be crossed however slightly now bore insolence of greek so quietly that le astute man than caliphronas must have be placed on guard by unusual suavity count however blinded by good fortune rushed madly forward unseeing abyss yawning before deemed that self restraint of proposed father in law arose from feebleness of age if must have seen passion of justinian when be once more alone must have changed mind be unaware of self conceit egotistical blindness kept in perfect ignorance of approaching storm be with great satisfaction justinian saw great admiration maurice roylands have for helena with still greater when noticed that daughter be disposed to look favorably on suit of handsome young englishman indeed in spite of real simplicity be born reader of character happy trait inherited from father a inherited fair beauty of greek mother more saw of maurice more loved for kindly heart honorable nature delicacy with treated caliphronas confident in manly beauty paid address with air of conquerora mode of wooing woman like helena least of a fired proud soul with indignation when saw how deferential be maurice in courting naturally enough preferred diffident englishman to over confident greek true daughter of eve however be for in spite of dislike to caliphronas must not resist at time temptation of speaking kindly to in order to arouse jealousy of maurice in be quite successful though roylands must not deem wise to lull caliphronas into false security at present crisis still be madly jealous of look bestowed on greek two suitor be always on term of ill concealed enmity with one of course helena be quite ignorant of father plan merely treated caliphronas with unexpected kindness out of pure coquetry being quite delighted when saw how such caprice annoyed man truly loved woman may worship man look upon a sole object of adoration yet even wisest purest kindest woman can not help teasing god little out of sheer capriciousness be playing with fire certainly many woman burn finger at perilous game of love to day to morrow yet will indulge in such coquettish trifling to make man love value more out of pure malicious desire to see anger woman instinctively know that what be won with difficulty be more valued than be gained with ease besides flatters man into thinking be superior to fellow creature in fascination when secures affection have fluttered doubtfully here there before centring finally in precious self think cleopatra must have kept antony so long slave have not stimulated love occasionally by giving cause for jealousy by mean octavia be humble faithful true loving so marcus antonius grew weary of such domestic virtue turned to cleopatra who kept in constant state of alarm lest fickle nature must choose lover helena knew nothing of cleopatra wile instinctively knew that way to win man be to place prize almost not quite within reach so flirted with caliphronas must have flirted with crispin have given chance yet cared more for maurice whom thus tortured than for rest put together to day be on best behavior however be seated with maurice in court weaving coronal of flower for adornment at dinner helena be fond of wreath rarely made appearance at meal without chaplet of rose ivy violet delicate white lily adorning golden tress crispin be in room engaged in writing drama caliphronas be holding above mentioned conversation with justinian two young people sat lazily in sunshine maurice smoking cigarette helena weaving wreath with myrtle rose sweet smelling violet sun shone brightly on white marble court with treasure of many colored blossom fountain flashed like fire in lustrous light white pigeon whirling aloft in cloudless brilliance of sky at time settled down on roof in milky line with gentle cooings helena with hand buried in flower many colored ribbon be humming quaint little song of madrigal type set to simple sweet melody rendered very

shepherd shepherdess of melnos deliciously delicate for wonder where father picked up oh father know plenty of old tune be so fond of why do ask because curiously enough that song be written by carolean ancestor of mine can not think how justinian came to know be strange certainly said helena thoughtfully helena who be father asked maurice impulsively demarch of melnos yes know what be english name can not tell replied helena shaking pretty head know nothing beyond that be justinian that be daughter that be island like tempest be not be miranda justinian prospero queried helena with slight blush can not guess asked maurice significantly girl laughed looked down at flower suppose ferdinand oh know tempest said young man with surprise know shakespeare play do think be so very

of if talk like maurice will certainly not give rose then wont talk like so give rose not yet must win first helena be a hard hearted a chloe of song be if dont give pansy helena made sudden movement towards of ill suppressed eagerness whereupon having betrayed more than wished to do feigned anger to escape from declaration saw be trembling on lip why did be hard to say a loved maurice very much longed to hear tell of passion yet nipped declaration in bud why ask woman to solve mystery for be beyond power of man to unravel see said playfully have upset flower pick up at once obedient maurice went down on knee before pretty tyrant began to collect flower position be worse than word so helena seeing danger hastily began to talk of first thing came into head talking about tempestwho be andros ariel for look caliban for wickedness crispin crispin be gonzalo honest old counsellor helena made pretty grimace ordered maurice back to chair be at safe distance did not admit of embarrassing endearment miranda be very fond of ariel wasnt yes suppose so hated caliban do like caliban well like ariel then what about ariel calibancaliphronas asked maurice vexed at fencing cant bear himand yet continued helena reflectively with certain spice of malice there be something nice about cant bear yet there be something nice about echoed maurice bitterly dont understand dont understand can explain asked roylands eagerly drawing chair little nearer helena hesitated blushed then made very irrelevant remark tell about roylands maurice very nearly uttered bad word be so angered at coquetry thinking best way to pique be to meet with same weapon a used at once acceded to request much to secret dismay stupid thought lady flirt thought gentleman decidedly two young people be at cross purpose roylands said maurice pushing back chair into former place be large park formerly owned by one of plantagenet king what be plantagenet king will have to give book of mangnalls question to learn said

maurice be own yes at least be unless uncle rudolph turn up uncle rudolph oh be one family romance rudolph roylands be father elder brother be in love with mother favored father austin brother have

rudolph be heir to grange not father so if turn up alive if have left heir will have to give up property to must mind very much asked helena in pitying manner not at must have once now have chance of staying in delightful island dont think must be such great loss after maurice have hardly said word when heard grunt of satisfaction behind on turning head saw justinian standing beside in company with caliphronas so dont mind if lose english property said demarch in peculiar tone not when can stay here did hear story be telling to helena of do think uncle rudolph be alive hardly after forty year what be forty year to long living race like roylands how do know be long living why told so said justinian hastily after uncle may be alive claim property in case will be penniless oh then will stay here a sculptor to public work old man laughed approvingly nodded head will be glad of none of greek can sculpture be lost art with hellene since day of praxiteles will make statue of helena here a venus urania better a chloris remarked caliphronas with forced smile coming forward chloris goddess of flower for charming suggestion cried helena rising to foot will give rose andros will treasure a life replied in low passionate voice a fastened flower in embroidered jacket what about rose helena asked maurice who viewed proceeding with silent rage here be one for answered helena quickly rose be red so cant complain dont treat fairly perhaps have better make rose white in order to mean silence said caliphronas pale with anger a saw maurice receive flower red rose mean love know sisterly love retorted helena looking at with undeniable frown caliphronas with sudden outburst of rage tore flower from breast flung on pavement walked out of court without word helena in astonishment turned to maurice only to find that also have vanished with more self restraint than greek have taken rose with only justinian be left looking sadly at daughter placed hand reproachfully on shoulder child said reprovingly make ill blood between two men by woman wile ate flung apple of discord on table of god must have done harm for woman jealousy name be helena be doubt not a fair a of troy so beware lest beauty be a fatal to melnos a be to ilium chapter xxiii bacchanalia clash of cymbal beat of drum oer mountain peak come far from parchd hindostan to laughing realm of pan nymph satyr reel about

revelry a shout so loud free io bacche evoh celebrate fte of st dionysius to day said justinian a stood in early morning on platform of acropolis awaiting arrival of bacchanalian band from below st dionysius repeated maurice with emphasis thought gentleman of name be olympian be interposed crispin before justinian must speak have forgotten heines account of how heathen divinity be transformed into medival saint st dionysius be old friend bacchus in new guise athena have given place to virgin marythe panagia a call in atticazeus be still supreme being with awful lock thunderbolt while far darter masquerade in classical adolescence a st sebastian venus mr professor asked helena with gay smile venus answered crispin with profound bow still life in gean sea a helena of melnos what charming compliment cried girl who in plain white chiton purple edged peplum silver banded hair looked indeed like aphrodite incarnate what about andros here hermes caliphronas poising lightly on verge of staircase certainly be herald of olympus divinized athlete more so a instead of voluminous fustanella wore simple tunic of fine white wool displayed fine figure to greatest advantage curl yellow a of achilles true achaian color be bare a never wore head covering unless forced to do so thus stripped of artificial aid to beauty looked incarnation of hellenism genius of greece ever fair blooming in eternal adolescence even justinian be struck with manly grace perfect vitality of young man yet after admiring glance at physical perfection turned to maurice quoted line of homer faultlessly fair body be not always temple of godlike soul be curious must say that sir observed maurice for old tutor mr carriston said same thing about same man carriston echoed justinian hoarsely rev stephen carriston rector of roylands replied maurice amazed at emotion did know know said demarch with forced smile have be absent from england many year rector of roylands muttered in undertone strange strange what be strange asked roylands curiously nothing nothing answered justinian turning away with frown be thinking of something must not understand here come bacchanalians maurice now will see glimpse of ancient hellas maurice pondered over strange emotion of justinian found quite unable to explain coming to conclusion that demarch must have met one of same name under unpleasant circumstance dismissed subject from mind a trivial concentrated attention on rapidly approaching procession justinian have closely followed old line of dionysian ceremony saving that expurgated coarser element of drinking debauchery during whole three day festival modelled on ancient feast of hellas maurice did not espy one offensive thing must bring blush to cheek of modesty indeed helena woman of island be present so mingling in ceremony must alone have prevented coarseness even without stern interdiction of demarch for greek have great sense of delicacy being especially careful not to offend delicacy of woman in way whatsoever modern bacchanalia then represented antique solemnity a be in earlier attic day before later worshipper defiled rite of god with vile orgy be perfect day a there have be slight rainfall in morning in east loomed sombre cloud however foreboded nothing a across darkness like many hued scarf be flung splendid rainbow helena caught sight of first clapped hand merrily oh father see how red be rainbowthat be good sign for vintage how so asked roylands somewhat puzzled at iris prophecy be old greek superstition answered justinian smiling at daughter glee if red prevails in rainbow there will be plenty of grape if yellow fine harvest when green will be year for olive one be reddish a see so bacchanalia will turn out successfully in front of procession marched musician men playing on pipe flute drum goat skin sabounas kind of bagpipe while beside danced young ivy crowned girl clashing cymbal together men be dressed in dancing costume similar to of caliphronas save that color of rainbow be represented though woman still in loose white chiton neutralized to extent vivid tint of male dress behind musician came lad garlanded with wreath of intermingled violet ivy bearing thyrsus afterwards number of maiden with vine leaf decorated amphora of wine basket of fig bunch of grape goat with child on back be led by two elderly woman waving pine branch then came elder of village in white robe with tall linen mitre followed by joyous band of young men profusely bedecked with flower who capered round sedate as on rode wit of village representing silenus empty chariot drawn by goat a substitute for panther then appeared in be to be installed count who undertook rle of bacchus procession finally closed with ten sailor walking two abreast stiff march contrasting strangely with acrobatic dancing careless grace of fellow reveller arriving at foot of step chief elder made speech in sonorous greek in invited justinian friend to come down to village festival bring good fortune to vintage justinian graciously accepted invitation in company with guest placed in rear of procession while caliphronas who have be crowned with vine leaf arrayed in leopard skin bearing pine cone tipped sceptre sprang into chariot with laughing glance a reveller saluted himevoh bacche back to head of grand staircase returned procession with wild music merry dancer while god lightly brandishing sceptre looked benignly on motley crew have fawn skin be crowned before procession ran child strewing road with flower while company sang song in praise of st dionysius whom caliphronas be supposed to represent rather than genuine son of semele silenus by drunken gesture difficulty in keeping seat evoked roar of laughter be quite hero of hour never did see sich tomfoolery growled gurt who be enjoying hugely baccus be tommy rot like lor mayor show be oh great spree said dick cheerfully who be gurts companion in march aint girl like ballet

cove have own way whereupon gurt in raucous voice struck up rule britannia much to amusement of justinian messmate joined in chorus though wild orgiastic music still continued be almost drowned in lusty chorus of briton never will be slave roared out by ten pair of lusty lung chariot of god have perforce to be left at head of staircase caliphronas descending led way down to valley followed by barbaric crew shrill sounded pipe loud clashed cymbal bright sunshine shone on a merry company of wine worshipper a ever did in athens of schylus vineyard of melnos be planted on side of mountain where rose terrace by terrace nearly up to dark pine wood divided vegetation from snow with broad green band wine press be placed in nearly one of vineyard place where ceremony be to take place lay near to theatre be particularly large enclosure filled with long straggling vine in centre of huge whitewashed tank piled with purple grape stood ready to be tramped out to lower tank into juice flowed justinian guest be conducted to kind of raised da on be placed seat tastefully wreathed with flower most elaborate of being reserved for caliphronas who a presiding deity of feast ranked for day higher than lord of island scene be singularly picturesque far above piercing blue sky arose snowy peak lower down pine forest then field of yellow corn divided by belt of gray olive tree grape laden vineyard while near slope near scene of festival be covered with red berried mastic bush delicate white cyclamen rose blossomed oleander pomegranate tree bed of strongly scented thyme filling still warm air with aromatic odor amid beauty be bacchanalians with many colored garb whiteness of woman dress predominating whole laughing throng swaying leaping whirling bounding gyrating to wild music shrill plaintive a wind of rude instrument in such vineyard might dionysius appear to modern schylus command to kindle anew with breath of genius fire of ancient goat song with solemn splendor gigantic scene majestic figure of god goddess hero a rule vintage of insular greek begin early in august year for unexplained reason grape have ripened slowly hence melnosians feared bad year of vine be much delighted to find that be one of most prolific ever known fact be further confirmed in eye by prophetic red of rainbow papa athanasius priest of island arrayed in gorgeous sacerdotal vestment of church now came forward surrounded by number of acolyte bearing censer sacred ichons in order to pronounce blessing on first fruit of vine year ceremony did not last long at conclusion papa retired while amid cry of rejoicing noisy music dozen men with bare foot sprang into vat began to tread grape white tunic naked foot be soon stained red with juice of vine shortly afterwards began to gush freely into lower vat amid song of onlooker soon afterwards cup of last year be passed round to present though greek a rule be very temperate people yet thin sour liquor speedily rendered slightly intoxicated singing became more vociferous than ever hope will give national dance said maurice to helena who sat beside himwho looked lovely a queen of love indeed will answered vivaciously will see syrtos have good deal of pyrrhic dance in step moloritis in zoe andros crispin will take part then there be dancing on slippery wine skin be very amusing see be syrtos party of young men in tight fitting white dancing costume now came forward saluted caliphronas a master of revel placing arm round one anothers neck began to sway slowly backward forward with kind of mazourka step to inspiriting music of tabor pipe evolution increased in rapidity be interspersed with wild acrobatic boundings by single dancer until maurice became quite giddy watching whirling afterwards woman linked together with handkerchief in order to make line more flexible danced gracefully to slow melody with frequent genuflexion of body bending of head greek dance be rather monotonous be afraid said roylands who found incessant swaying trifle wearisome why dont men woman dance with one do sometimes a in moloritis replied helena rising from seat will dance now think will like better than syrtos be graceful dance music be more melodious first four people danced together then separately finally crispin caliphronas indulged in wild saltatory leaping while helena zoe stood still swaying from side to side like nautch dancer think waltz must be jollier than said maurice when returned to seat waltz what be asked helena innocently will show time during daythat be if can get one to play music oh andronico old man with violin can pick up anything by ear see be now going to have singing handsome young fellow stepped forward escorted by number of woman who joined in chorus of song be in praise of dionysius vineyard maurice owing to skilful tuition of helena now knew enough greek to understand word irregularly translated be a follows solo oh love went to vineyard there beheld bunch of purple wine fruit full of milk of earth mother woman wine like thee be heart gladdener solo thro vine leaf peeped st dionysius who laughed when heard sound of kiss be not mad with wine so cried st dionysius not with wine be mad with love kiss woman wine like thee be heart gladdener there be about twenty verse of delectable song interlarded at time with rude music of sabouna maurice grew tired of dreariness went off in company with helena to where feasting be going on table be spread out in open air with cheese bread honey goat flesh pile of grape other rustic dainty to hungry reveller be doing full justice of be dancing smyriote others singing interminable song roylands by time have quite enough of greek dance song so asked helena to show hot spring be near at hand be at base of little cliff volcanic in character with curiously twisted streak of red green black lava presented bizarre appearance water owing to presence of oxide of iron be of yellow tint boiling hot while occasional puff of steam rising skyward veiled variegated tint of rock behind so that looked strangely weird horrible wonder be not afraid to live here helena said englishman going down on knee to examine gean geyser dont believe crater be extinct one have be quiet enough for over thousand year replied girl carelessly so dont see why must break out now if did loss of life must be terrible oh dont maurice idea be too frightful why not one of must escape alive then good by to father idea of new athens new athens have other thing to fear besides volcano what do mean that if caliphronas be appointed father heir be better for crater to become full of seething lava once more than hot bed of scoundrel such a scamp will surely make dont think need be afraid of replied helena with great scorn andros be not likely to rule melnos dont like hate why be very handsome do think be woman likely to be taken with mere good look in man answered with angry light in eye thought knew better than maurice forgive helena indeed be glad like caliphronas helena knew reason of pointed remark looking down with blush be about to reply when man be talking about came quickly along narrow path with savage scowl on handsome face helena father be asking for said abruptly oh will go at once replied girl lightly in order to conceal confusion rapidly left spot where caliphronas still remained looking angrily at maurice englishman saw that count be in terrible rage ready to overwhelm with invective nevertheless be not sorry to come to complete understanding with treacherous scamp who have regard for truth honor daring caliphronas be thorough bully by nature having succeeded in browbeating own countryman by arrogance thought must try same plan with maurice quite unaware that seemingly easy going young man be made of sterner stuff than yielding hellene must hold own against odds with true british doggedness well bacchus said maurice trying to pas matter off lightly at first why have deserted reveller to punish scoundrel burst out furious greek stamping foot maurice looked around serenely then sitting down on block of black lava streaked with sulphur began to roll cigarette innocent proceeding irritated caliphronas beyond power of self control do hear cried mad with rage came here to punish scoundrel in quarrel victory be generally to who keep temper a maurice knew very well so in case more enraged grew greek calmer became englishman so see replied phlegmatically a see scoundrel here hardly understand understand mr mauriceyou be scoundrel really said roylands lighting cigarette with provoking coolness reason for applying name to make love to lady who be to be wife be not aware offer of marriage have be accepted have father consent true have not lady consent bah what of woman dog be born to obey dear count constantine caliphronas said maurice deliberately have called scoundrel for epithet coming from despicable wretch like care nothing if dare to speak disrespectfully of miss helena will certainly throw into boiling spring over there greek be young strong athletic must doubtless have held own against englishman to considerable extentalthough must have be beaten in end owing to ignorance of boxing art in maurice excelledbut so craven be soul that did not dare to resent calmly insulting speech merely stood ground quivering with fury v hissed through clinched teeth shaking five finger at maurice be about strongest imprecation greek can use will be even with pig english a be see want pitching into stream replied maurice rising dare to apply such epithet to a sure a stand here in go caliphronas trembled with mingled fear rage for have seen man before box with boatswain dick knew have small chance against such pugilistic science be a careful of beauty a lady dreaded lest sledge hammer blow must mar perfect feature therefore deemed wise to restrain temper laughed derisively bah to day for to morrow for said jeeringly can not hold against future ruler of melnos will have island helena will have nothing dont be too sure of caliphronas dont want melnos certainly do want helena will certainly refuse to give up without struggle try sneered greek snapping finger under roylands nose try hitherto maurice have kept temper well under control last insult be too much so lifting up light frame of greek in athletic grasp in spite of struggle calmly sent splash into nearest pool be fortunately tepid in character otherwise count might have run chance of being parboiled next time dare to use vile tongue on will sling down grand staircase said maurice quietly then without waiting to hear bad language of enemy calmly strolled away towards scene of festival smoking with great enjoyment caliphronas considerably cowed crawled out of pool looking like drowned rat few must have recognized in despicable object daring handsome hermes of morning have possessed knife must certainly have pursued maurice done best to kill being without weapon have wholesome dread of englishman fist so swallowing rage for time being went off in search of dry garment a maurice approached vineyard heard shout of laughter found be owing to latest amusement that of dancing on slippery surface of skin of winea pastime a old a day of dionysia many skilful dancer fell off be long before one succeeded in carrying off prize be skin of wine ultimately fell to lot of handsome young palikar who have sung song about st dionysius helena looked apprehensively at when appeared a be afraid there have be quarrel between two suitor maurice calmed fear by smile together watched sailor hornpipe danced by dick to music supplied by old andronico who have picked up air from gurts whistling justinian be in ecstasy over dance made dick sing sea song with rude tuneful chorus of messmate made old man eye flash with patriotic fire im only greek on surface see said to crispin with somewhat sad smile heart be english still heart of oak replied crispin gayly after there be place like england for see melnos with tropical loveliness be still unsatisfying when memory of white cliffed albion awaken in heart bravo crispin cried maurice who have heard speech be true patriot must confirm view by singing home sweet home crispin nothing loath did so greek attracted by beautiful air crowded round to listen darkness be falling fast for long day be nearly at end through still night sounded liquid note of cock nightingale calling to mate higher than voice of bird arose that tender old melody brings tear to eye of absent from own fireside justinian leaning white head on hand listened intently when song be ended maurice must have sworn in dim light that sudden tear flashed like jewel down withered cheek be extraordinary to see man of iron astute keen ruler a be so touched by simple little song have heard perchance at mother knee from moment maurice always believed in justinian whom be certain must have good heart when so affected by pleading air torch be now brought wild music burst out anew reveller prepared to escort demarch back to acropolis caliphronas apparently a merry a ever made appearance in new clothes resumed sceptre vineleaf crown along street danced procession with clash of cymbal throb of drum torch flaring in windless air on excited face of bearer be like confused dream with flash of white robe tossing red light barbaric pomp swaying restless dancing crowd at foot of grand staircase maurice burst out laughing what be matter asked crispin who walked near be thinking of caliphronas whom flung into one of hot spring deuce did pity be not drowned be not born to be drowned retorted roylands sardonically be born to be hanged at acropolis bacchanalians left saw long procession stream like serpent of light along road down staircase with glimmer of white robe distant sound of mirth last flash of innumerable torch last burst of frenzied mirth then darkness quietthe dionysia be ended chapter xxiv thespian silvery smoothness of sweet sophocles rolling thunder of schylean verse subtle twisting of euripides to prove better reason by worse such poet gained light athenian praise by daring dealing with universe yearly won envied crown of bay not on attic shore alonefor yet know greatness in modern day in alien land across stormy sea where with much painful learning do dare in pristine splendor to revive three till foiled by antique genius high rare quit task with unalloyed despair theatre of melnos be crowded next day to witness one performance of year whole semicircle of seat be occupied by chattering throng resembling doubtless gossip loving athenian of old be in gala dress men brilliant in albanian costume of fustanelli embroidered jacket gaudy gaiter vivid red silk sash while woman in accordance with edict of demarch still wore graceful antique robe of white indeed male bird here have more splendid plumage of two what female lacked in color made up for in grace population of melnos be indeed fine specimen of humanity a owing to selective genius of justinian none physically perfect be admitted to privilege of island in case of birth exercised almost spartan rigor certainly departed so far from law of lycurgus a to permit child born with blemish to live be sent away from melnos at moment of birth provided for elsewhere in consequence therefore of untiring care in such matter melnosians be strong healthy beautiful while constant out door life congenial occupation kept in wonderfully vitalized condition be eminently calculated to form race a physically perfect in form health a be possible on earth be great believer in men sana in corpore sano theory said demarch to maurice who sat beside first law of new athens be that citizen will be healthy in way body being thus perfected by degree who know what intellect may not ripen sooner to first fruit of genius be that not rather against homeric line quoted other day sir observed maurice thoughtfully mean a regarding caliphronas be physically perfect thoroughly healthful yet can hardly call intellectual andros said justinian emphatically be not true greek mongrel from island of name where found shepherd lad have faith in mixed race a genius if have be apt to be confusing english be essentially mixed race therefore literature although marked by great versatility lack that dominant note denotes special characteristic of pure blooded race look at jew hellene be perhaps sole example of unmixed blood haveat least in westand will see that work of genius however different in outward form be still instinct with individuality of particular race nature psalm of david tragedy of greek dramatist must only have be written by men of unmixed blood steeped in color of peculiar branch of human family what about shakespeare none mixed race must have produced comprehensive mind like though may perhaps think narrow in desiring formation of pure blooded nation may be barren of such versatile genius yet believe maurice plant must bear own natural flower now melnosians have be carefully selected from most untainted blood of insular greek who be real survivor of old attic stock allow mixed marriagesi protect from outward influencei encourage to develop inherent characteristic of race so in human probability in year to come will produce blossom of genius entirely own be that not rather hot house forcing style well yes such artificiality be needed in day of easy communication cosmopolitan race tribe of mankind be not now isolated from a in former time when very isolation forced uninfluenced by contact with alien tribe to develop own special race nature in literature music art mixed race produce mixed result splendid own in many case not so severely unique classic a must be case with untamed tribe did not disraeli discus question in coningsby touching semitic raceyes think so be so long since have read book almost forget line of argument have strayed from subject be physical not intellectual perfection verily believe if a much attention be given to breeding of humanity a be given to rearing of race horse race of mankind must be much benefited thereby justinian have quite mania regarding question of race maurice must gladly have continued interesting argument play be shortly about to begin so deferred discussion until more fitting occasion meanwhile examined theatre with careful attention stage facing semicircle be long narrow with slender column on side supporting pediment unfortunately be quite plain a justinian theory have not yet developed pheidias to sculpture red limestone into god like form of hero deity broad flight of step led downward to orchestra have entrance to right left for convenience of chorus while veritable altar of dionysius wreathed with sculptured grape nude figure of dancing faun nymph taken doubtless from ruined temple stood on raised platform fronting stage on burned small fire whereon incense be occasionally flung be that not rather pagan asked maurice referring to altar everything herein be ideal not real replied demarch wisely when see chorus throw incense on altar think not that be sacrificing to wine god of ancestor be of orthodox church obey devoutly precept of papa athanasius like to carry out old ceremony even to altar mean nothing be highly characteristic of antique festival a crispin helena caliphronas be actor for day demarch maurice sat alone in centre of semicircle surrounded by sailor who be much puzzled at strangeness of stately open air theatre so different from air tight box to have be accustomed in london if be only adelphi melodrama said dick whose inclination leaned to bloodthirsty play suppose will be something like squalling called singing yesterday moosic observed gurt chewing quid reflectively seed gal in one of em down wappin way a guv song called tap on shoulder bill eye be good un ere decidedly unique dramatic representation many english scholar must have beheld with delight be quite thrown away on conservative tar who preferred melodrama comic song to solemn splendor of ancient tragedy be naturally enough greek to in more sens than one in accordance with instruction of justinian poet have composed play embodying allegory of aim of island colony of melnos forsaking to great extent severe classicism of schylean tragedy have modelled drama on loose flying splendor of shelley hellas piece entitled phnix be intended to represent degradation of greece under turkish yoke escape from such bondage material civilization subsequent rise to intellectual supremacy end formation of colony of melnos be supposed to foster crispin have fear of allegorical drama not being understood by audience for greek be singularly keen witted people besides justinian have so imbued whole population with hope of reviving ancient glory of athenian genius that present be quite able to comprehend hidden meaning of play phnix be to occupy whole morning after interval of two hour for rest refreshment satiric pendant to more solemn piece be to be represented in afternoon consisting in instance of local incident developed expanded by crispin into wild aristophanic farce blending wit with irony laughter with tear stately chorus with clownish play of rustic actor crispin moreover be not only author actor stage manager also accomplished musician therefore have made use of western training in respect to get together orchestra with aid of andronico have adapted plaintive music of hellenic folk song to chorus quick eared greek speedily picked up air many of already knew thus drama followed closely in footstep of athenian prototype wild rude music sounding at interval between long speech of principal character prevented monotony otherwise must have certainly prevailed with violin flute pipe drum symbol sabouna musician therefore took place unseen by audience for crispin adopting wagner theory did not want attention of audience distracted in way by presence of orchestra between stage auditorium back of stage represented smooth white marble wall fronted by range of corinthian pillar wreathed with milky blossom in centre great folding door ready to be flung open when required by exigency of play against absolutely colorless background moved brilliant figure of performer in measured fashion with stately gesture a moved serene side faced figure on marble urn dreamed of by keats clear light of sun burned on great half circle of eager face with steady effulgence left in delicate shadow wide white stage whereon be to be enacted drama such a in england lacking thing necessary to such colossal majesty can never hope to see being read curtain arose rather fell for crispin with strict fidelity to athenian usage have adopted curious mode of withdrawing veil between audience performer stage be empty wild chant sound in distance long train of moslem headed by sultan sweep in bearing with hellas captive in own land to barbaric power helena draped in black manacled with chain represented hellas who stand with melancholy mien amid gaudily dressed chorus of moslem listening to song of triumph over downfall have chained to chariot

partake of splendor offer furious with rage barbarian smites still smiling repeat constantly body be thine soul be mine so in wrath leaf with promise that woe will never end moslem chorus follow from stage with triumphant shout of joy at success of arm left alone chained desolate amid ruin of temple hellas bewails downfall contrast so darkly with former brilliance in classic time crispin afterwards translated play into blank verse for benefit of maurice english verse give poor idea of fire majesty of sonorous greek original woe be cry fallen queen for be sport of jealous god who envious of athenian gloriousness have crushed city of violet crown beneath force of overwhelming horde thus blotting out heaven aspiring son who burning with new promethean fire must fain have scaled god crowned olympus high to match gainst god in equal strife then with sudden energy of despair call upon hero of salami of thermopyl of marathon to aid mother in time of need ala voice answer to cry of anguish overcome with sense of hopelessness hellas discrowned chained sink weeping on broken column of fallen shrine now enters chorus proper of young greek maiden dressed in black stole to denote

reward of such folly curse of ate be on thee cry pitifully will goddess be satisfied until have exacted due penalty for neglect of olympian relate former woe of hellas how first be slave to macedonian then to roman power how latin set mailed foot on neck now moslem have again reduced to position of bondswoman ever slave ever desired be thrown from one to other a plea unable to free from such degradation when chorus of reproach be ended hellas call upon tutelar genius of greece to help ere perish in answer to cry apollo represented by caliphronas appears blame for foolishly forsaking old god for new thus falling into hand of nemesis power be engendered kept alive solely by belief have departed can not help her much a desire to do so say een whose fanes be ever reverenced be now bereft of shrine oracle no longer do hear delian hymn taste savor of sacrifice lyre in hand go wandering through night lamenting for skyey chariot wherein bore fierceness of sun up eastern hill down to

be once more stainless hellas of old fired by speech of god hellas rise assisted by chorus begin to sing fierce battle song call upon son to remember hero of past clamor be heard without a of men fighting then chain of hellas fall off with dark robe now be free once more clad in purest white so while rejoicing in liberty herald crispin appears tell how well greek have fought for independence gave poet opportunity for stirring speech descriptive of modern greek hero canaris botzaris conduriottis name be received with shout by audience fired with patriotic fervor once more apollo genius of greece appears declares that longer can hellas dwell in desecrated athens even a mother latona must seek shelter in gean isle there after long year give birth to supreme race who will revive ancient

obedient will render homage to thee a of yore thou wilt stand forth in thy splendor goddess once more after introductory chant in unison chorus divided in twain semi chorus replied to semi chorus in fiery speech jubilant music rang like pan through wide theatre ever moving figure kneeling youth maiden soft radiance of sunlight triumphant burst of choral song while hellas serene in freedom stand beside tutelary genius with light of glorious future on face listening to eagle flight of liquid word greeting a queen of world play being ended lively greek streamed out of theatre loudly praising entertainment having have intellectual feast now proceeded to table set in open air be covered with kind of food to satisfy physical want maurice demarch waited in theatre alone for actor very shortly crispin came to see how liked play received warm congratulation of success from two men while helena caliphronas also received due meed of praise greek be radiant with self complacent delight for vanity have be much gratified by approval of audience for rest of day regarded a hero of hour quite forgetting crispin helena in serene egotism hope have succeeded in showing aim clearly justinian said poet a sat down to comfortable meal have succeeded admirably especially in last chorus only hope that will see piece be meant for more than amusement of hour if heard how villager be talking remarked caliphronas with laugh think must have doubt on score for already regard a saviour of hellas intellectually physically politically did intend genius of greece for lord byron crispin asked maurice who have understood admired allegory well character be supposed to blend god poet replied crispin after pause let say be olympian incarnate in body of englishman olympian englishman incarnate in greek said demarch graciously caliphronas smiled at receiving compliment be intended to further blind to reality of justinian feeling towards there be nothing must like better than to become leader in reality said gayly to inspire countryman with desire of once more making hellas supreme queen of world of intellectual world materialit matter not pardon matter great deal replied justinian quickly politically greece have place among powersshe have constitution king so a far a material prosperity go wish not to meddle with aim be to revive intellectuality crispin play be entirely written to illustrate point hellas will never be modern roman empireshe never be conquering power strength lay in brain not in hand of son after be not greater to control mind than body of men want to turn hellas into school pen be mightier than sword rejoined justinian sententiously let other nation be merchant warrior while greece reasserts ancient vocation of teacher aptitude for special line be a true of many a of one must not give lyre to soldier sword to poet so race must exercise talent with be especially gifted not of course to exclusion of others make peculiar gift greatest aim at present great human family of europe be in state of transition unaware of others aim be watchfully in arm one against other let hope that before end of twentieth century will recognize that one special faculty predominates in nation permit other to cultivate special faculty what exclaimed maurice somewhat astonished must have english nothing shopkeeper colonizersthe french nation of warriorsthe german philosopher only italian musician indeed must narrow down talent of world to one special field understand maurice said justinian impatiently quite agree that nation must have own literature art music philosophy drama one special gift of race must be cultivated more than others must be made state lawa political necessity however question admits of much argument have time to argue now in illustration that be not so narrow minded a think will merely point out that educate greek in military civil occupation quite a much a attend to intellectuality after said caliphronas pointedly only civil occupation such a touch agriculture be necessary for intellectuality be yet in future with be not likely melnos will ever require to resort to arm trust not replied justinian looking steadily at count if doe be quite sure will find son able to defend island even against enmity treachery caliphronas smiled uneasily held peace upon there ensued rather embarrassing pause be only ended by departure of crispin to look after afternoon entertainment maurice strolled off in pleasant company of helen much to disgust of caliphronas who now pointedly avoided company of englishman owing to fracas have occurred during previous day truth to tell roylands be pleased with such avoidance a now that open war be declared between greek have need to cloak distaste for society of precious scamp satiric comedy of honey bee be fantastic piece based upon incident have lately occurred in melnos justinian have lately imported potter to teach people ceramic art new acquisition turned out to be idle scoundrel who spent time in drinking making love to neighbor wife on basis poet have worked out amusing plot not devoid of point in aristides idle scamp force into industrious hive of honey bee whose queen desire to marry in order to be independent for rest of life unfortunately fall victim to counter plot of bee who in order to disillusionize queen get pretty young girl called myrtis to pay court to adventurer make love to myrtis be discovered by enraged queen who order bee to drive forth from hive slight framework be filled with pointed allusion to passing event weakness of many of melnosians be slyly pointed out so that gossip loving audience enjoyed stinging remark to full indeed failed to laugh when irony be directed at scene be public square of village with lake bronze statue of jupiter so that with well known setting local point be understood applauded chorus consisted of honey bee dressed somewhat after fashion of aristophanic wasp with pinched waist yellow black banded body spear for sting alternating with rude buffoonery of play be burst of choric song lauding community of melnos industry of inhabitant with many sly hit at idle life of adjacent islander in fact with great judgment poet have constructed whole comedy to glorify melnosians at expense of labor thus render more resolved to work hard at appointed task thus fulfil aim of demarch following scene of arrival of aristides entrance of chorus will give idea of play though of course what with local allusion flexibility of greek language comedy be more amusing in original aristides o pan to what land of honey have come truly see naught wild thyme yellow comb poseidon have thou then girdled hymettus with azure scarf of ocean queen hill of attic fame do here behold sky piercing melnos beloved of god aristides jupiter behold graceful creature have then be thrown on alluring coast of fatal circe queen sun god daughter be not one who rule over honey seeking bee in hollow island cleverly do extract sweet juice of flower to fill emptiness of many celled comb aristides running away ah fear sharpness of sting queen in wise will hurt thee save at behest be still o handsome stranger will invoke for thee industrious tribe whose ambrosia be sweeter than food of undying god aristides already shake in cowardly knee queen o pan inspirer of vague fear do call on thee to send swift flying bee whether ye lurk in honey throated flower industrious speed lightly through measureless sky do summon ye hither o sting bearer enter chorus of bee buzz buzz buzz indeed heard thy cry o queen when seeking on mount serene sweet tasting honey for store drawn from core of rose daisy violet in sparkling dew of meadow set with patient labor do strive to fill hive ala too often plundered when espied by devouring men buzz buzz buzz lo whom see lurking here form of man whom much fear buzzzzz let prepare angry sting to slay greedy passioned thing who must devour honey in single hour buzzzzz audience lover of laughter a be much preferred amusing play to solemn teaching of morning yet from learned something necessary to well being from one how justinian wished to make centre of new intellectual force from other how aim must be achieved by industry perseverance so grave gay performance instilled policy of demarch into mind on conclusion of comedy rest of evening be devoted to feasting while justinian guest returned to acropolis well pleased with success of performance well what do think of sermon from stage asked crispin a strolled along beside maurice think very highly of answered englishman be pity dare not be so out spoken in own land if set forth foible of londoner a plainly a did in honey bee be afraid must have dozen libel case must be impossible to transplant aristophanic comedy to england for modern civilization be too complicated to admit of such free speaking besides average briton be too serious too practical to relish truth even when uttered by comic muse only light hearted athenian must have appreciated enjoyed such plain speaking french be more given to open criticism daresay political comedy constructed on line must appeal greatly to sense of humor when one be in rome one must not speak evil of pope nation have pope of conventionality agree with there after be impossible to revive past even new shakespeare must be a out of place in post revolutionary day a new aristophanes modern world deal with drama of little thing individual idiosyncrasy be caricatured instead of national policy have only one plain speaking aristophanes nowadays name be punch chapter xxv olympian like statue fair naked runner stand poised for start on elis sacred plain limb resplendent shine with fragrant oil eager athlete be fain to win wreath of olive for toil in honor of laud like flying arrow from stretchd bow onward speed with muscle strained breathless pausethen shout to heaven go in token of victory hardly won triple cry of hail victorious sound with dance choral song victor go to bend before statue of god then one with glad rejoicing proudly throw robe of triumph oer shoulder broad with wild olive crowned athlete unconquered in state wait silent in awful god abode to hear with pride of victory elate rushing splendor of pindaric ode owing to comparatively small size of valley be much taken up with dwelling house manufactory public building place wherein yearly game took place be not very large still with sparse population arena be large enough when be assembled be comfortably filled leaving large open space in centre for runner leaper boxer other athlete who took part in sport despite dislike to anachronism justinian be obliged to deviate from special sport of elis introduce number of modern pastime in order to keep men in efficient state of training for defence of island to end shooting match be arranged demarch supplied melnosians with gun for day be afterwards returned to armory of acropolis many of villager be excellent marksman justinian also who appeared to know something of military tactic drilled manuvred men in fine style last not least gurt who be old man of war man have taught special number cutlas drill of british navy arena be large open space near grand staircase surrounded with many tree of beech elm pine plane sort thus to extent shaded ground agreeably from sun beat fiercely down at noonday there be amphitheatre row of stone bench on woman must seat while husband father son brother stood around lay luxuriously on grass justinian however have kind of stone throne rudely carved guest be supplied with seat adjacent so that must view game quite comfortably athlete be clothed in tight fitting dancing costume gave free play to body be comfortably cool while foot only be bare so a not to impede speed in racing on final day of festival color changed sex for most of men be garbed in white for sport while woman have decked snowy chiton with brilliant ribbon gold coin while wreathed dark lock with fragrant chaplet of flower only helena be in pure whitehelena who sat near father like queen wore robe hue of milk snowy wreath of delicate cyclamen yet who looked fairest of fair woman assembled in spite of attraction vine feast goat song have occupied two previous day olympian game be favorite with lively melnosians a must take part in win praise of demarch smile of woman be greatly flattering to harmless vanity of greek nature maurice in common with crispin be arrayed in white wool athletic dress a caliphronas have challenged to compete in jumping for honor of country accepted glove so insultingly thrown down insultingly because caliphronas confident of superb physical perfection have taunted englishman with not being able to hold own in athletic sport save in boxing taunt have stung maurice so much that have wagered against caliphronas in running jump at college maurice have be famous athlete though six year of idleness in london have impaired power yet pure atmosphere of melnos constant open air life of mountain climbing swimming have completely reinvigorated what lacked of former skill be counterbalanced by endurance of spare frame hardness of muscle general feeling of exuberant vitality be in white save for color of college wreath of red rose helena have woven round gray sombrero in headgear looked like sicilian shepherd acis when went courting galatea by sea seated by justinian watched progress of game with great interest be fully shared by surrounding guard of sailor who thought festival most sensible of three ambitious mariner have entered for game running wrestling leaping boxing shooting did fail to uphold honor of england for if greek have speed briton have strength in dogged determination that englishman must not be beaten managed to secure respectable number of victory over nimble stepping islander think like game best myself said justinian a surveyed race from throne like one of old olympian hellanodikai for know that strength be what melnos now requires from son amusement intellectuality be in future with chance of probable war need a many skilled athlete trained soldier a possible notice make everything subservient to scheme observed maurice who day be more more impressed with administrative capability of demarch of course think entire life of people must be mean to end thus will be able to live healthfully mirthfully intellectually yet be able to guard in time of danger quite like sparta have told never did approve of sparta destroyed individuality of man turned nation into nothing warlike machine plant will not grow in pot too small for will child constantly confined in swaddling clothes develop physical nature freely mankind requires four thingsamusement education work physical exercise on requirement base system of rule year round people work for well being of community festival although please be not without object first day be pure amusement only of vintage feast during second day educate mind to understand reason of existence now on third day indulge in physical exercise keep healthy also train to defend land from outside danger be modern solon solon of unnoticed island replied justinian with smile well see owing to exigency of modern life be forced to go in for quality rather than quantityto rule tribe instead of nationto govern island rather than continent nevertheless know saying from small event what mighty cause spring so perchance miniature government when develops into larger one may not be without influence in often misgoverned world justinian said maurice with irrepressible curiosity who be demarch of melnos forgive replied maurice flushing a noticed pointed rebuke know question have asked be breach of good breeding be such wonderful man must be excused for wondering where came from be not angry at question returned justinian touched by frankness of young man spectacle of old englishman with such project be perhaps calculated to arouse curiosity however will promise to tell about when certain event dearly desire come to pas event justinian smiled meaningly let eye fall upon helena upon maurice flushed red with delight must have spoken that wary old man shook head a sign that be to keep silence andros whispered significantly time maurice saw that caliphronas be walking towards wisely held peace although be difficult for to repress delight hint of justinian have awakened in breast to have queen among woman a own to pas life by side to always have beautiful face before eyesit be too good to be true yet true be for justinian have unmistakably shown approbation of match a to caliphronas young englishman have fear have given rival plainly to understand that must strive hardest to win helena greek must not say that be involved in way in justinian crafty diplomacy maurice roylands be essentially honorable man despite necessity for such treachery underhanded dealing of demarch be revolting to sense of honesty be glad have come to complete understanding with count so that when justinian showed hand in deep game be playing caliphronas must not accuse rival of underhand dealing in way a to helena straightforward lover be not so ignorant of way of woman a not to know liked best in spite of coquettings with caliphronas therefore felt quite confident that helena must not be cruel enough to refuse meditation be put end to by crispin who approached with dick on whose behalf proffered challenge to mr roylands here be maurice said poet cheerily dick wish to know if will be antagonist in boxing contest certainly will be delighted be afraid dick will have best of a havent touched glove for last six month im not in good training sir replied dick modestly id dearly love to have turn with sir if may make so bold just to show darned greek how to use fist dont speak contemptuously of darned greek friend said crispin dryly of justinian men have small skill in boxing can tell not caliphronas remarked maurice recalling contest with count on first day of feast caliphronas echoed crispin scornfully be too much afraid of beauty being spoiled to go in for hard knock be good leaper maurice so will have to look to university laurel can fail before lady eye quoted maurice jestingly perhaps not remember caliphronas be also exhibiting prowess in lady eye so be like two knight of middle age tilting before queen of beauty if fail poor maurice v victis retorted roylands with laugh keep lamentation till after contest mr aristophanes jove how fellow scud one mile race be going on four time round arena be quarter of mile in circumference about dozen men have started among whom be temistocles young greek who have won wine skin dance on first day of festival have shot slightly ahead of competitor who be making great effort to catch up maurice adept in such thing saw that be exhausting in effort to keep lead a be only first lap must not be able to hold out to end going at pace crispin tell that fellow leading to reserve for last round what for because he taking too much out of stupid quick shout a pass runner be now flying past winning post be directly in front of justinian throne so crispin sang out loudly in greek to temistocles a maurice have instructed young palikar be fool saw that advice be good so let two behind gain side took second place between ruck only three men be in race for remaining three be already well blown temistocles acting on wary advice given wanted two most dangerous opponent to exhaust during second lap one of last three men threw up sponge a also did at third round a hinder man be completely out of interest in race centred in two leading runner temistocles who followed closely behind neck neck ran first two making violent effort to pas one quite unaware of danger behind so that at final lap be getting somewhat stale half way round arena one gained slightly on other thinking be now pretty certain of victory ran home at full speed temistocles who have be mustering strength saw that decisive moment have come shooting past like arrow gained goal four length ahead applause during exciting race be tremendous onlooker cheered hoarse when temistocles won while grateful young man came to thank crispin for hint have gained victory thank said crispin smiling a drew roylands forward kyrios maurice told what to say temistocles expressed much beholden to lord went off to receive congratulation of friend while next item on programme be boxing contest began maurice dick watched exhibition of pugilistic science critically came to conclusion while islander be active enough in dodging hitting have not sufficient strength to make blow effective enough when hit home be dexterity avoidance with made fight pretty enough to look on scarcely exciting from english point of view still one of light weight greek be enough to tire out ordinary boxer once having exhausted antagonist must hope to tap pretty freely thus come off victor at last after several contest maurice dick put on glove stepped into arena after shaking hand in time honored fashion began to spar warily at one be heavier built men than spare framed greek be pretty equally matched in point of weight science if anything dick have quicker eye of two while roylands possessed longer reach justinian old boxing man be a keen a needle over glove match came down from seat in order to get closer view of battle while melnosians equally interested crowded round eagerly to watch contest after sparring lightly for time maurice made feint led out straight home dick be on guard parried blow with right catching antagonist lifter on jaw with left secretly annoyed at roylands made rapid play succeeded in landing stunner on dick eye before active sailor must dodge maurice got worst of first round dick of second so seemed difficult to foresee who must finally triumph in third maurice got nasty one in rib feinting with left extended right rapidly in dexterous blow known a policeman knock catching dick full on face have effect of tumbling over on grass in fourth round however dick recovered lost ground by blowing antagonist first then coming home with tremendous rap on left ear made maurice see star greek be frenzied with excitement even justinian caliphronas crispin caught contagion yelled a loudly a rest at successful blow not so active a cat like sailor maurice be getting trifle blown thought be going to disgrace in helena eye what be worse in caliphronas by being beaten so when fifth round began made up mind to come off best by time be pretty well versed in dick tactic when sailor closed in with right hand feint in order to come home with left maurice dodged like lightning breaking down dick guard punished severely on nose men blood be up now indeed dick be showing a streamed from what be called in graceful language of prize ring smeller at sixth round onlooker saw that final bout must be severe woman be rather nervous at savage contest helena pale a lily at sight of blood be clinging to father arm inwardly breathing prayer for success of hero for so now regarded maurice dick have now quite lost head be quite reckless while maurice be a cool calm a ever self control standing in good stead in parrying dick furious onslaught still sailor managed to draw blood freely much to secret joy of caliphronas who must have liked nothing better than to see maurices handsome face spoiled when roylands setting teeth like vise tried to close in with opponent for final tussle for minute two men dodged rapidly feinted parried sparred did best to break down one anothers guard when dick losing self control hit out recklessly in wild fashion upon maurice sent one blow after home like sledge hammer ended fight with tremendous left hander levelled dick almost insensible on ground man on ground aroused by sight of blood fairly went mad when dick went off supported by two of messmate wanted to carry victor in schoolboy fashion round ground on shoulder triumph maurice declined retired to cleanse of blood long after be that fight remembered local poet made kind of iliad out of struggle be one compared to triumph of achilles over hector maurice of course being son of silver footed thetis sport went on during whole of long day a if competitor must never tire there be flat racing hurdle racing jumping wrestling further boxing until late in afternoon then gurt put men through cutlas drill justinian manuvred whole male population of island much to own satisfaction that of maurice who saw that melnosians be capitally drilled where did learn military science asked justinian when drill be over be in army once replied old demarch with great pride what regiment may ask can not tell that yet be a mysterious a crispin there be good many mystery in island of fantasy mr roylands retorted justinian good humoredly when be solved will be surprised in more way than one have be soldier be man of peace uncle rudolph be lieutenant in line regiment th ah lost uncle said demarch with ambiguous smile must tell family history day be afraid will be necessary soon replied maurice glancing at helena ah think so well remember desire about being successor maurice wish answer shortly will have a soon a hear from england well will be soon have boat waiting at syra for letter so trust will reply crispin yacht shortly then still anticipate trouble do remember have one possessing fatal name of helena here be firebrand a well know will talk of thing time son meanwhile let come look at shooting a maurice turned to accompany old man felt soft touch on arm on looking down saw that helena with expression of pity on beautiful face be looking at be hurt maurice said anxiously not at all replied laughing dick gave nasty one on nose be rather painful nothing to speak of to morrow will be such sight a will shudder to look on must rather see brave man disfigured than handsome coward retorted helena with disdain casting side look at distant form of caliphronas oh think caliphronas be very nice interrupted helena cruelly yes be delightful believe be very fond of caliphronas said maurice displeased at speech dont think be maurice pouted girl looking down assuredly im not to prove will do best to beat at high jump if do said helena gayly will give rose of what color coquettered for love white for silence yellow for jealousy ran away after father with silvery laugh in maurice in spite of vexation must not help joining a charming coquetry of young girl be delightful enough to fascinate annoying enough to pique pride of mr roylands have small share be loveliest woman in world said to sauntering towards shooting party if win will be most fortunate of being be afraid be coquette else be woman way of provoking love hullo dick be added aloud a boatswain considerably battered approached im afraid ive knocked up bit not bit of sir replied dick heartily grasping young englishman extended hand ill be a right a trivet to morrow word sir shouldnt like to meet without glove dont know so much about dick be pretty tough antagonist can tell so zoe thought sir when saw grinned dick displaying white teeth thought be gurt sir be sorry wasnt perhaps im blest if be mr roylands im white haired boy in quarter sir gurt oh dont mind sir he not marrying mani be intend to marry zoe if shell have sir dont think there much fear of dick replied maurice genially hope not sir woman be queer creature be indeed dick answered maurice with sigh thinking of helena dexterity in avoiding wooing yet keeping fast captive in chain what id like to do sir said dick reflectively be to have glove on with mr caliphronas why so for answer dick pointed to own swollen face grinned meaningly whereupon maurice walked away laughing to think of count handsome countenance in such scarred condition shooting be going on splendidly melnosians proved good marksman more le while justinian be crack shot made one centre after other in most surprising manner will have try maurice said when young man reached not to day sir im too shaky after fight wish to keep up strength for high jump have tough antagonist in caliphronas know that rejoined maurice uneasily im hanged if ill let beat bragging must never cease bravo crispin crispin have just made bull eye be rejoicing in modest way over success so maurice to encourage patted shoulder what pity eunice be not here to see said roylands laughing im afraid eunice must not appreciate skill dear lad must appreciate anything did dont think mother must a long a have twelve thousand year mr dengelton will think admirable crichton not without name have name a good a in england said justinian touching poet on shoulder what be will tell when trouble be over be first time demarch have spoken so plainly crispin be much rejoiced thereat be quite content for know will keep promise be right rejoined justinian proudly never break promise unless with regard to punic faith caliphronas heard saying of course did not understand significance of remark strolled away in order to look at high jump be being put up near throne of justinian shooting being at end rest of party followed took seat for final contest of day be to be competition of greek englishman in high jump two competitor came forward a lightly clad a possible in order to give advantage in contest two finer specimen of manly grace must have be hard to find caliphronas be a lithe sinewy a panther with sinuous grace in movement while maurice who be heavier built of two have not spare ounce of flesh on body thanks to active athletic training during residence in melnos be fair haired handsome delicately moulded face of graceful greek have cunning expression be quite absent from more manly look of englishman with supreme conceit caliphronas quite expected to gain victory while maurice in spite of university record must not help feeling trifle uneasy a looked at springy grace of antagonist besides still felt trifle shaken by glove fight even though have taken place during earlier part of day caliphronas jumped first poising on ball of foot about ten yard off made for tape be extended between two upright pole with speed of deer be four foot ten high presenting obstacle to accomplished leaper like cleared easily with lightness of flying bird maurice followed also went over without least difficulty amid applause of spectator much to greek secret vexation a saw antagonist be fresher than thought mean athlete to be scorned four eleven be also cleared cleanly by though in air maurices foot be perilously near tape fact caliphronas who be eagerly watching noted with delight height be now five foot at caliphronas unfortunately for went with over confidence so that touched tape lightly intensely vexed at failure must only hope that maurice also must touch englishman set teeth determinedly cleared five foot with bound of deer greek mad with anger at thus being beaten furious at applause of spectator loudly swore that jump be chance one whereupon maurice walked straight up to with angry face count caliphronas forget forget to make such statement there be fluke about matter to prove to will jump five over again justinian disapproved of maurice be firm caliphronas be only too delighted to have chance of beating hated enemy so once more going to start made rapid run cleared jump by hair breadth be truestill cleared now mr maurice said ungenerously forgetting noble way in englishman have acted let see if can do twice will not do twice sir thought not retorted greek exultantly so have won not yet forget also have cleared five to prove to that jump be fluke challenge to five one youll never do maurice whispered crispin in alarm jump five again let match be tie im hanged if will retorted englishman fiercely have done better than five one at oxford if have not be for glove id do again at event ill try jump count caliphronas in fair play count must not refuse challenge although be pale with anger so knowing must never clear that extra inch went half heartedly towards start faint spirit be not conducive to victory caliphronas not only touched fell heavily on ground much to chagrin then be maurices turn measuring distance with eye placed little more than ten yard from tape helena clasped hand with nervous fear spectator held breath a maurice pale in face stout in heart came flying forward soaring upward like bird cleared five one with consummate ease there be wild cheer from crowd especially from british tar who rejoiced greatly at way in maurice be upholding honor of england victor found two hand nearly shaken off by crispin justinian a soon a must get free looked for caliphronas greek too petty souled to bear defeat have vanished be seen in arena for rest of afternoon game being concluded helena distributed prize be useful article especially selected by justinian for occasion caliphronas have won several race also wrestling contest must not receive prize owing to non appearance concerning one seemed sorry so universally be hated for arrogance temistocles dick gurt others be duly rewarded for prowess in athletic field then maurice knelt before helena to receive prize justinian have be somewhat puzzled what to give guest a simple article loved by villager be hardly acceptable to travelled englishman helena however solved problem hastily twisted together wreath of wild olive placed lightly on bent head for said justinian a arose crowned victor kissed hand of helena can have fairer prize than olympian wreath of old must now have pindaric ode exclaimed crispin gayly ala be not pindar must be content with old archilochian shout hail victorious valley rang with cry of delighted greek caliphronas seated on summit of grand staircase heard triumphal shout with wrath in heart have beaten in game hissed between clinched teeth will not beat in love will ask helena to be wife then englishman third shout came from valley below caliphronas only laughed scornfully then englishman chapter xxvi beautiful paris evil hearted paris what wouldst thou force to thine evil will bear far away in benchd ship

partaking of refreshment be going merrily from outside point of view more united party must scarcely be found yet one felt that be ominous calm before breaking of storm demarch astute in interpreting of sign saw that matter be approaching crisis must not be averted that disaffection of caliphronas consequent on refusal by helena must take place sooner than have be anticipated that count must propose to daughter that evening have little doubt a saw that smarting under defeat in game caliphronas be determined to equalize in eye of by gaining helena consent to marriage a set off against englishman triumph being case justinian be equally sure that helena must promptly refuse greek whom so much disliked in case caliphronas must call upon to enforce marriage then whole truth must have to be revealed after demarch have little doubt that count next step must be to leave island range openly on side of alcibiades truth to tell old man be rather anxious for storm to burst a suspense be rapidly becoming unbearable a judging from review that day melnosians be well prepared for war did not mind if caliphronas out of wounded vanity precipitated affair quicker than be expected again a greek have told plan of alcibiades have further use for so being prepared in way for trouble justinian be in wise sorry affair must come to head alcibiades threatened invasion must be crushed at once insolence of caliphronas also be becoming unbearable to proud old demarch therefore desired to hasten rather than retard explosion have not seen that caliphronas be bent upon bringing matter to crisis must have doubtless hinted necessity of marriage proposal being made at once with maurice caliphronas veiling hatred of other under artificial smile with justinian watchful for expected catastrophe with helena anxious knew not why at greek burning glance will be easily seen that merriment over supper table be rather forced only truly happy member of party be crispin who unsuspicious of ill rejoicing in having promise of demarch to reveal about parentage be laughing jesting gayly in highest of spirit think can congratulate on three day of festival being perfect success said to justinian

demarch must betray thus relied blindly on promise of forced marriage being fulfilled in case consummate scamp decided to sacrifice helena in most painful manner must devise for gratification of wounded pride that maurice loved helena knew well enough for have not mere sight of lovely face brought young man from england to semi civilized island of gean a to whether passion be reciprocal

demarch only meant mayor be hardly lordly enough for such magnificent person a intended to be must call prince of melnos who know what with assistance of alcibiades few other scoundrel of same kidney with whom be acquainted must not be able to extend principality so a to include surrounding island then crete under turkish misrule must be glad to come under protection rhodes alsoin fact few year

emperor of east when sight of acropolis directly in front of dispelled glowing dream ascended step rather dolefully with conviction that a yet fine scheme be in cloud pausing moment on threshold in order to quite recover usual jaunty manner future emperor present adventurer drew aside curtain entered court to find confronted by justinian daughter two guest old demarch reclined in capacious chair beside fountain smoothing golden hair of helena who be seated at foot on back of chair leaned maurice laughing at trivial remark crispin balanced perilously on marble rim of pool be irritating argo who strutted near with gorgeous tail spread out to fullest extent of looked remarkably happy especially justinian whose stern face be glowing with pleasure in helena eye shone light of undying love a glanced shyly from time to time at joyous lover so strong so handsome so noble when caliphronas appeared at entrance however merriment vanished for helena mindful of previous night sprang to foot with indignant look at advancing greek face of maurice poet assumed cold expression of keen disapproval not so justinian who quite enjoying situation received enemy with bland smile have caliphronas known boded ill for success of mission helena child said demarch quietly will leave for little while have business with count caliphronas helena needed second bidding with angry glance at rejected lover walked quickly to curtain through vanished not before sending sweet smile in direction of maurice caliphronas saw that smile felt uneasy a to meaning of became still more uneasy when demarch without asking to be seated addressed formally a count caliphronas why do not call andros asked greek apprehensively understood called count caliphronas replied justinian smoothly naturally give title of

something for loss polish be more valuable than moss in due time alexandros came back to acropolis reported that caliphronas have left island in small boat when last seen craft be running before wind in direction of kamila on hearing justinian have doubt that greek be on way to stir up alcibiades to immediate action therefore resolved to lose time in putting melnos in thorough state of defence in meantime placed strong guard at gate of tunnel in western pas so a to prevent island being taken by surprise at event there be special necessity for prompt action a caliphronas have only departed that day in probability alcibiades must not attack melnos for at least one week privately maurice wondered if greek adrift in small boat must succeed in reaching land safely a judging from terror on night of shipwreck have not much pluck in foul weather sky however be perfectly clear there be chance of castaway being caught in storm so justinian laughed at fear of nephew bade set mind at peace caliphronas said knew water of gean sea well have few mile to sail before reaching kamila once there must doubtless meet with of alcibiades follower to guide to chief in innermost heart old demarch rather regretted that caliphronas must thus escape safely must not have grieved much have treacherous scamp be drowned in sea instead of reaching alcibiades without harm stirring up accomplished cut throat to immediate war there be chance however of such event happening justinian quite expected within week to see melnosian water covered with boat of bitter enemy helena be much astonished delighted to find maurice be cousin though must scarcely be more in love with than already be yet felt that bond of blood relationship bound to by nearer dearer tie than even that of future husband talked of thousand thing in connection with future life of dreamed of returning to family seat in england hoped when war cloud have blown over to pas rest of life untouched by sorrow in lotus land of east maurice in common with crispin be anxiously expecting letter from home a yet none have reached so to appearance looked a though must be blockaded in island by pirate before communication arrived at syra on day of caliphronas departure however be thinking little of thing a maurice be anxious to learn history of uncle while rudolph roylands on partnow being able to talk freely of owing to revelation of identitywas desirous of hearing about late brother ancestral estate present position of roylands family did not want to speak of thing before helena a judged girl have undergone quite enough excitement for present besides there be many thing in own career did not care about speaking of before innocent child justinian be not bad man having one of restless adventurous spirit whose impulsiveness lead into strange scrape have during sojourn in levant indulged in many escapade if not exactly criminal be yet daring lawless enough to startle sober minded person serious justinian of present be very different from dashing rudolph of past a daughter knew only in reverend old age respected a wisest kindest best of men naturally did not want to disturb that feeling by narration of wild adventure of somewhat scampish youth therefore be not until helena have retired to rest that told maurice story three men sat up till nearly morning eldest talking in arabian night vein two younger listening with rapt attention to fascinating career of free lance of middle age born by strange chance among respectability of nineteenth century passionate a benvenuto cellini ambitious a first napoleon reckless a csar borgia fascinating a lord byron extraordinary being possessed vice virtue charm astuteness find not in military machine of to day in brilliant adventurer of renaissance who burned fiercely over troubled world of day like wandering star terribly grand to look upon carrying destruction dread everywhere a swept onward in fatal path after supper helena retired justinian went with guest into cool court where comfortably seated under star strewn sky with coffee tobacco coffee grew cold tobacco burned untasted to ash a maurice crispin with elbow on knee leaned forward to listen to wondrous story of modern ulysses who have seen many land knew many people have done many reckless wild deed during stormy career justinian grew excited like old war horse a told of early life be easily seen that spirit be a dauntless a ever that thirst for adventure still possessed soul that chafed bitterly at inglorious ease to frail body condemned bright eye flashed at memory of hot youth grand voice pealed trumpet like through still air a strode up down before enthralled listener reciting deed of derring do done in time have be yes be grand day in bolivia said resuming seat after outburst of stormy passion a old memory awoke in brain feel carried away to past when talk of if jumez have only brought troop up in time might have be president of south american republic instead of demarch of melnos well at event late year have be peaceful enough a president must have have stormy time ending very likely in violent death after left south america uncle came back to england in sailing vessel there be mutiny on board of three other fellow managed to quell held life in hand way until got to england when left ship went down to roylands in disguise to look after people found happy have not killed father a have feared be now married to rose seemed happy enough so have not heart to disturb must have be pleasure to to take estate from austin a have plenty of treasure found in bolivia life of country gentleman be irksome to besides woman have loved so fondly be now brother wife so have nothing to gain by revealing strayed about old place for time then returned to london in order to think of future be very wealthy in prime of life anxious for adventure so at first thought of returning to army on reflection decided that first experience of soldiering have be quite enough so turned attention to travelling went over europe tour found tame work asia be more exciting however have good tiger hunting in india when left place went down cape town way explored southern wild of africa be even more savage than be now got wound there in row with nigger drew up sleeve showed white cicatrice on arm must have be dangerous wound then began to tell of african adventure of battle with savage tribe of explorings in unknown wild fight with wild beast elephant hunt witchcraft ceremony of obi kind until listener did not know at to marvel most memory bizarre existence have led have five year of sort of thing went on after pause became rather tiresome besides be now thirty five year of age thought be best to settle down where must not make up mind who have prairie fever once always get again sends off on travel into wild a if be stung by gadfly of io what wanted be big work to keep mind body busy with wealth really did not see where must find such occupation true might have remained in africa become kind of savage king with buccaneering leaning have intellect enough to despise such rusting away in tropical forest beyond reach of civilization wished to exercise brain a well a body yet in spite of hard thinking scheme appeared feasible enough to give work interest pleasure when have passed meridian of life england disliked returning to a cramped existence in gray little island must have sent mad unless have asserted right to roylands entered parliament did not see how must employ time besides be averse to disturbing austin prejudice must meet with on side from narrow minded stay at home must have sent back again to savage life unlike genius in arabian night must not go back to jar after once being released therefrom england therefore being out of question have serious thought of returning to south america exploring up orinoco river where say sort of buried city civilized indian golden temple be to be found then changing mind almost decided to go to san francisco have try at gold digging feeling doubtful of being worth undertaking fancied australia where fortune be being made up ballarat way must suit idea also abandoned did not wish to make fortune a already have more money than knew what to do with be safely invested in england see maurice have price of army commission be great sum mother fortune be considerable also enormous inca treasure dug up near lake titicaco nearly cost life a told so can fancy be quite millionnaire long before day of chicago pig sticking pennsylvanian oil well how did decide to come to gean well came about in queer sort of way said demarch lighting pipe when be up at zanzibar be about a far north a have then got met poor devil of greek who be starving so took about with a kind of companion have be mixed up in war of independence got on bad side of king otho who be at time ruling greece about a badly a must be ruled greek have dream of reviving old hellenic learning with country under bavarian king overrun with brigand did not see how must be done told of desire to find something to occupy mind body so suggested a have lot of money ought to try to start little kingdom of own on intellectual basis idea took fancy greatly a be always of administrative turn of mind then told about island of melnos how must be cultivated fortified made into kind of elysium by man with capital after deliberation decided to do pose a second lord byron therefore with greek went up coast in trading vessel into red sea be very uncivilized in day have kind of adventure in one of poor hellene be knocked on head so be left to battle way on alone over isthmus to mediterranean wonder be not killed be pretty nearly rejoined justinian grimly especially up suez way of course at time there be canal suez managed somehow to get across isthmus to alexandria need not tell adventure from time left zanzibar a must take too long be just a exciting a bolivian escapade if not quite a bloodthirsty ought to publish book of career dear crispin must call second baron munchausen for many of adventure must seem impossible in tame day of cook tourist party thirty be great falling off from buccaneering time in day thirty seem quite bloodthirsty where next generation of born adventurer such a be will find scope for exercise of talent be sure know well uncle what did do after alexandria came on to athens to see about new hellas there hired kind of small schooner with picked men went down among island until came across melnos recognized from description of greek at zanzibar having landed climbed up over peak when saw valley be enchanted for be indeed fortress formed by hand of nature true at first hesitated about establishing colony in crater of extinct volcano for one must never know when must break out again however when saw temple of hephaistos felt pretty safe a crater must have be extinct when be built by old hellene thousand of year before so thought if volcano have kept quiet since day of pericles must surely keep quiet for next thousand year probably will hope so at least have seen sign of eruption besides there be vent for volcanic force at santorin so ought to preserve melnos intact forever well a said saw island found suitable for proposed scheme went back to athens to buy of greek government there be told island belonged to turkey a greek tributary island only extend a far down a santorin nothing daunted went to stamboul after about year hard work managed to buy melnos for good round sumit be pretty stiff price can tell inca treasure proved equal to even when have paid down money still found with plenty in hand with to start colony so melnos be absolutely own absolutely can leave to whom please be private estate a have always kept friend with sublime porte there be chance of being taken from when succeed here maurice will find everything drawn out fair square with lawyer in london what have not sultan firman here london be safer for even if alcibiades be to take island can still prove right to by paper in london paid too sweetly for to greedy turk not to take precaution to keep title safely stowed away where must meet with accident be safest city in world for preservation of such thing so in london placed paper recognizing right to ownership of island well uncle now have new rome what about citizen oh a to did not find difficulty in obtaining plenty of men eager to settle down under protection in day what with turkish misrule pirate at sea brigand on land islander fared badly enough when promised such a became subject absolute immunity from such ill difficulty found be a to quality not quantity be pure hellenic stock wanted from to develop new learning there be good deal of mixed blood even among insular greek however by careful selection managed to get together goodly number of pure blooded male brought wife sweetheart to island colony child old men must not have a latter be useless for purpose with regard to child wanted to regulate birth so a to keep new race up to standard in time populated melnos accorded to mind then set new subject to work on dwelling industry first repaired temple for own accommodation arranged system of government planted mulberry tree obtained silkworm built factory so on olive vineyard currant vine also planted after few year began to flourish greatly so gradually established commerce with surrounding island thus melnos by export be able to earn income for what with keeping island going in infancy buying what be required for people carrying out engineering occupation capital large a be have dwindled considerably be delighted when found that from outlay be now realizing income sufficient not only to carry out further work also to leave surplus saved up against bad season year devote part of income derived from industry to public work in connection with place people balance place out at interest in london still london well must not have risk hard earnings in athens must commercial crisis revolution war where must money be while london though liable to social depression be at least safe a regard other two contingency year after year have sent money to england now have assured income must keep going even though earned nothing for many year have be to england since settled here yes replied demarch with half sigh went once in order to arrange about safe investment of melnosian money remained in month when returned brought back mother crispin mother echoed crispin with deep flush name can not tell now answered justinian trifle sadly when trouble be over will do so why not now have reason for not doing so crispin did not like further putting off knew justinian be iron when once have made up mind so submitted to further procrastination of important secret with sufficiently good grace although made one objection might be killed in mean time if happens will find paper necessary to establish legitimacy with london solicitor think be harsh unkind crispin in not telling what wish to know now when reveal will see have good reason for not doing so one thing can comfort with howeveryour father be alive will restore to arm mother be dead know died here boy be sad story will have to tell at event will have father name a good a in england with promise be content said crispin gladly a have brought up from infancy must be indeed ungrateful if did not trust to end yet left in anger think must blame caliphronas for that be machination that caused to misjudge a misjudged caliphronas have be bad genius of said justinian decisively now thank heaven be gone will trouble more faith cried maurice lightly will trouble good deal if brings alcibiades here ah be open war mind that be hidden treachery to referred by way said roylands meditatively suppose that caliphronas think have untold treasure in acropolis doe be one of reason desire to plunder melnos fortunately money derived from island be in london what disappointment for alcibiades company when find treasure here cried crispin laughing must never get here said demarch resolutely will defend island to bitter end in spite of strength fancy will find difficult to force either western pas tunnel if have western pas a entrance to melnos why did pierce tunnel asked maurice curiously must not have be better to have only one entrance decidedly see western side of melnos be exposed to gale in spite of harbor anchorage be hardly safe so be forced to build breakwater on eastern side of island of course being case when ship be loaded unloaded there good must not be taken round to western passhence tunnel think scheme be wonderful one said maurice with great admiration wonderfully carried out be yet only in infancy need wise ruler to carry on to ripe fruition that ruler maurice expect to find in trust will not be disappointed in administrative ability well be satisfied so far have courage judgment self control be main thing needed to control excitable greek let not go too fast for know not yet if intend to stay in melnos assuredly do especially now have discovered be uncle why did not tell of relationship before because wished to fall in love with cousin on own account have revealed suggested marriage with natural dislike of young man to be forced into matrimony might have objected oh dear nephew have have plan in head for long time long ago saw that crispin andros whom have trained a successor must suit post crispin be poet not ruler while a for andros whom know better a caliphronas be idle scamp who must undo forty year work when saw failure in respect married greek girl more from policy than love in order to beget heir died when helena be born thus be disappointed of son surely regret uncle when have helena no now a love child dearly did then a be at wit end whom to select a successor then heard about maurice from agent in england resolved to send for here before revealing ascertain for whether be fit for such responsible post a ruler of melnos task of bringing in ignorance here be delicate one entrusted to andros who promised to fulfil on ground must permit to pay address to helena agreed to result see there be question of forced marriage until lately when be rendered necessary to mislead caliphronas out of policy brought here maurice rest know a everything have turned out better than expected be going to marry helena succeed herethat be if have quite decided to stay have decided replied maurice grasping uncle hand warmly hesitated at first now do so no longer there be nothing to keep in england when crispin marries eunice can stay at grange look after estate while helena stay here old tutor if old tutor come out be sure will be delighted for to stay here forward plan of new hellas be ardent greek scholar will approve thoroughly of undertaking good work like revival of learning rather than idling away discontented existence in england good said justinian with great satisfaction set mind at rest never fear about alcibiades trouble maurice for melnos be strong think can defend stanchly when storm be at end will devote remainder of day to teaching necessary rule of policy so that can carry out completely when die a heir maurice will inherit island invested money in london so will find everything smooth before to carry on work have begun well after conversation think have better go to bed said crispin rising with yawn be afraid will be morning soon replied justinian with smile a followed example so will not get much sleep be glad have told history be wonderful cried maurice enthusiastically quite give lie to proverb that rolling stone gather moss stone that rest in inglorious ease gain moss said justinian wisely rolling stone circle world gather polish marco polo columbus drake napoleon csar be rolling stone think have be of more benefit to world than wiseacre who remain gathering moss in dulness of home in belief that such vegetating be true aim of existence chapter xxx keeping vigil day night with anxious eye vigil keep to watch ever changing sky changeless deep yet though for rest spirit sigh dare not sleep for in sky will comet pale burn warningly when filled with foe black vessel sail across sea to wake upon shore wail of misery yet though such ship star appear a portent vile face will devoid of fear with courage smile for greek englishman will here defend isle two week passed since departure of caliphronas to stir up war against melnos yet alcibiades made sign of attacking island so doubtless plan have not yet matured sufficiently to permit of assault else be trying to lull melnosians into false security so a to storm unawares justinian thought latter supposition more likely be too old campaigner to be thus caught napping day night have sentinel posted on highest peak of island to give notice of approach of enemy by lighting watch fire be ready prepared a before stated defender of melnos inclusive of englishman numbered about hundred twenty certainly small force to hold island against three hundred enemy a caliphronas have told justinian be strength of alcibiades army melnos however strongly fortified by nature be quite gibraltar of gean owing to ruggedness height of surrounding peak enemy must gain crater of volcano save by western pas tunnel of be skilfully defended by wooden palisade maurice thought mistake that barrier be not constructed of stone justinian explained that be thus built so a to admit of approach of enemy being seen when few determined men intrenched behind must keep at bay large force in narrowness of tunnel of pas whereas if stone wall intervened outside foe must perhaps batter down without hurt from defender advantage justinian have over hostile force be fact of tunnel being staircase a men posted on height must sweep down enemy climbing slowly upward in order to do away with necessity of fighting in dark by feeble glare of torch justinian have powerful electric search light placed at inner entrance of tunnel so a to command palisade indeed demarch having unlimited money at disposal have latest european invention obtainable for defence of island much regretted that have be unable to obtain new magazine rifle have lately be served out to english army rifle hold six cartridge can be fired one after other unlike revolver have barrel a cartridge lie in line one at back of other a justinian be not able to obtain efficient weapon be obliged to put up with martini henry rifle be deadly enough weapon in hand of excellent marksman western pas be narrow winding gorge created by primeval convulsion of volcano severed low semicircle of mountain in deep cleft at inner entrance be commanded by two old brass cannon demarch have found in dismantled tower of venetian cannon however in spite of age be in excellent state of preservation must do deal of damage when sweeping down narrow pas middle of cleft be fortified by strong wooden palisade at outer entrance be of similar construction thus defender intrenched behind barrier held invading enemy at considerable disadvantage justinian have also search light sweeping pas in event of night surprise thus two entrance being so well defended by nature art be feasible enough that little band must keep at bay even larger host than alcibiades be bringing against even if beleaguerment of island lasted for month there be danger a long a pas tunnel be defended for there be plenty of provision food eaten by inhabitant be grown on fertile side of crater so be likely alcibiades despairing of taking place by storm must retire men after few week demarch be perfectly satisfied that occupied too strong position to be dislodged only chance of capture lay in inside treachery enemy scaling peak coming down unawares in rear neither of thing be likely to happen a there be chance of treachery from melnosians who be devoted to justinian enemy consisting of scum of levant have engineering skill courage to climb over forbidding looking mountain enclosed central crater of volcano during two week watchman on height kept constant watch for foe justinian assisted by maurice dick looked after military preparation with right good will rifle be duly served out to men who practised shooting daily also sword cutlass in use of dick instructed yet time went on with work only after be over did attend to military duty there be fear of ammunition giving out a demarch have constructed magazine in lonely part of valley be filled with cartridge cannon ball plenty of powder elaborate military preparation to defend rocky little island may sound childish enough in western ear accustomed to gigantic military power of europe coming assault on melnos be holiday battle must probably involve good deal of hard fighting a desperado of alcibiades be by mean to be despised thought that melnos be full of treasure quite unaware of justinian wise precaution of sending public revenue of melnos to london to be in safety lusting for gold be ready to fight like demon in order to plunder island defender on side valued home wife child too much to permit loose band of absolute wretch to gain entrance into stronghold so seemed a though fight on side must be fought with dogged determination to bitter end maurice dick be principal assistant of justinian at juncture a crispin knew nothing about military matter testy old demarch said be more trouble than use so wandered about good deal with helena quite idler of community in spite of however knew that crispin be a keen a one on fighting must defend island with best of besides being minstrel of party wrote war song after mode of tyrtus to fire melnosians with martial enthusiasm old fighting blood of roylands showed plainly in demarch nephew for looked anxiously forward to anticipated invasion must have be seriously annoyed have not come off justinian quite renewed youth at idea of once more smelling powder fiery energy overriding obstacle occupying ceaselessly with military matter at time even tired out muscular nephew yet maurice worked bravely showed to be made of stuff required for leader of men despite ignorance of matter military made several valuable suggestion from common sense point of view be greatly approved of by demarch egad maurice said grimly surveying nephew if have only have instead of caliphronas must have made man of meaning im not man now said maurice rather nettled by mean youve got roylands spirit boy will fight like devil when need be when think of year of idleness in england make angry such loss of good material must be made use of dare say there be hundred of fellow of physique stamen who write life away in office instead of going in for adventurous career dying rich what mean be that be

fonder in spite of residence here have a patriotic spirit a of jingoist who shout war war war on least provocation come let go look at search light on terrace justinian during last few year have dabbled considerably in electric matter have sent alexandros to england in order to learn about science alexandros keen witted in thing have soon picked up be necessary be quite accomplished electrician so when returned to melnos brought with by justinian instruction machine necessary for production of light powerful engine for working dynamo be placed at back of acropolis under eye of demarch from centre wire be laid to tunnel western pas thus machine being so to speak in heart of island be safe from being captured by enemy lighting of place be quite under control of alexandros demarch have also third apparatus rigged up on terrace in order to make trial of power of light be to be tried that night for justinian wished everything to be in thorough working order against arrival of alcibiades army while be examining electric apparatus on terrace in front of acropolis helena in company with dick zoe came to in great state of excitement papa give key of tunnel for crispin say boat have arrived from syra with letter by jove thats good news cried maurice a demarch handed key to daughter now will know about new yacht uncle if melnos be taken can go to syra escape

telling to wire to agent that yacht be to stop at syra humph well be not bad news a say be a well to be prepared for emergency here be key helena where be crispin waiting at tunnel entrance replied helena brightly went away with key of island guarded by dick zoe there be sign that two be following in footstep of master mistress for a zoe tutored by helena must speak english very well there be obstacle to dick wooing bosn be handsome young fellow with masterful manner about greek maiden found very pleasant so be not at indisposed to yield to solicitation become mr dick more so a thought marriage must not part from helena whom loved dearly early flame gurt have quite vacated field in favor of handsome young rival now took paternal interest in match a yet zoe with innate coquetry have not given dick direct answer there be little doubt in end must accept assiduous lover who worshipped very shadow while three have departed to take crispin key of gate justinian continued examining electric apparatus questioning alexandros concerning mode of working moon be not up till late to night said demarch looking at sky so in darkness will be able to test splendidly be light at tunnel western pas in order alexandros added in greek yes kyrion attended to to day engine work perfectly kyrion capital said justinian in english turning to maurice think electric power will rather startle alcibiades doubt do know uncle think be pity did not place search light on one of peak so a to sweep ocean thus reveal approach if try to steal in to beach under cover of darkness true true said demarch thoughtfully nursing chin will think of meanwhile try light to night a to watchman on peak maurice know there be also two on beach one on side of island so if see alcibiades approach first will light fire to signal to peak above will fire theirs to warn be easier to see from beach than from above where everything look flat besides night be so still that sound of oar can easily be heard long way off especially by men trained to hear like greek suppose alcibiades us oar oh well in case will be warned in time in case of night attack men can muster rapidly suppose in few minute guard there be strong one in tunnel under command of gurt in pas commanded by temistocles good with such precaution can not very well be surprised here be crispin in state of great excitement too said maurice laughing have got satisfactory answer to letter right called out crispin mounting step waving open letter in hand yacht have left england for syra with mr dengelton rector eunice be there letter for asked maurice nodding satisfaction at intelligence yes one from rector see if encloses one from eunice to maurice tore open letter of old tutor out dropped envelope directed to crispin in dainty feminine handwriting of poet at once took greedy possession on balustrade of terrace maurice sat down to read letter crispin after glancing at eunices private note rattled on to justinian about content of own correspondence have read on way hither from tunnel agent got letter right sir said gayly have difficulty in securing yacht wanted be still in market left england week ago for athens why a there be danger of row thought best must be near at hand so wired to agent that be to stop at syra where ought to arrive shortly left southampton after letter presume day so after of course came

sister niece mr carriston be on board wont care about being mixed up in battle sister repeated justinian thoughtfully be born after left england only caught glimpse of when went back so be quite stranger to be aa pleasant sort of person well talk good deal said crispin with hesitation then be afraid will tire dreadfully said demarch dryly for like chatterbox however helena will be glad to see aunt will not child of course papa will be glad to see relation if be a charming a cousin maurice eunice be angel of course said helena mockingly be because love why maurice say same thing about what doe maurice say asked that gentleman looking up from letter be dearest girl in world laughed helena going up to will find out when milliner bill come in milliner said child of nature what be milliner laughed at particularly justinian who pinched daughter ear gently ah milliner be very important person child make gown like white one of mine more pity said crispin with laughing glance at simple white garment if gown be of style bill must not be so large husband must frown le well maurice what say rector decline to commit to opinion until see melnos with own eye said maurice putting letter in pocket be coming out especially to see new hellas there uncle be that not compliment will be glad to see mr carriston observed justinian little stiffly a maurice thought crispin did georgios see anything of alcibiades nothing hear anything not word must be keeping preparation very quiet muttered demarch to a went inside for believe attack will take place within week party on terrace broke up after withdrawal leaving alexandros still busy at electric apparatus be in complete order by night time after merry supper one came out again on to terrace to make experiment with light alexandros went away to look after dynamo still night a be with not breath of air to cool hot atmosphere sky in shimmering heat seemed closer to earth than usual moon be yet in heaven dark blue vault be bright with innumerable star large mellow like tropical constellation valley below be in complete shadow not glimmer of white walled house being visible side of gigantic cup formed crater of volcano be veiled in diaphanous darkness so intensely quiet be everything that even nightingale be silent there seemed something awesome in breathless stillness of nature a though whole earth be dead only handful of people assembled there alive dont like sultry night whispered helena to maurice uneasily a stood by one of pillar with arm round waist hope nothing be wrong with volcano what after thousand of year quiet laughed maurice gently dear child volcano be a extinct a dodo dont know what dodo be replied helena panting whole place seems so unnaturally still that give idea of coming trouble perhaps alcibiades oh can fight against cant fight against eruption who be talking about eruption said justinian turning round from electric apparatus be examining helena be afraid there will be one soon nonsense nonsense said old man testily yet with anxious frown on face if there be danger of upheaval must be warned by hot spring be just bubbling a usual besides georgois tell there be eruption at santorin so with vent for volcanic force be quite safe why have lived here for forty year in safety crater have be extinct for thousand of year so need not be afraid of anything going wrong now thus pacified helena in common with rest turned attention to electric light at moment flashed out from carbon point in terrible splendor alexandros began to move about like flaming sword of st michael tail of comet swept in tremendous arc across dark sky turned down on valley revealed everything a if be day lake house tree streetsall sprang out of darkness with minuteness of photograph then intolerable brilliance began to move slowly round side of crater black pine forest arid rock then rugged peak white with chill snow lo a travelled eastward along jagged height on one burned huge red star watchfire cried maurice springing to foot turn off light commanded justinian hastily alexandros did so there on cold peak amid luminous twilight flamed bonfire of watch like baneful star telling of destruction war death chapter xxxi battle of troglodyte hear noise of battle tumultuous be not on earth do spectral host contend in cloudy sky under foot be raging in heart of globe skirmish struggling army cry of horror clash of weapon sharp crack of deadly rifle strike dully on ear a though crust of earth intervened between fighting listening yes battle be subterranean do gnome assault one over new vein of gold lately discovered do dead not rising from stone sealed sepulchre renew quarrel below on earth ended existence know not indeed whether be dead gnome hear noise of battle tumultuous there be doubt that night attack be intended alcibiades hoping to take justinian by surprise trusted must be able to break in through tunnel before secret arrival be discovered unfortunately for did not know military alertness of demarch who warned by watchfires marwilled men with greatest rapidity in space of hour man on island be drawn up under arm in space before acropolis powerful electric light flooded whole crater so that little army manuvred a though be day in profound silence man took place in rank ready to march to front justinian held hurried council of war with maurice crispin dick a to disposal of troop for question be whether alcibiades must concentrate force in tunnel make one bold dash for island dividing men into two body attack entrance simultaneously messenger have now arrived from watchman on height on beach from whose report appeared that advancing enemy be making in body for eastern side of island therefore demarch came to conclusion for present only tunnel be threatened by invader however to obviate chance of western pas being taken by surprise about thirty men under command of crispin dick marched in direction remaining eighty six with justinian nephew a leader took up station inside tunnel palisade alexandros of course remained behind at acropolis to attend to working of electric light be burning with full power at western pas in tunnel middle apparatus being turned off after departure of men so a to increase brilliance of other two temistocles be employed a messenger between two force so a to keep four leader thoroughly cognizant of what occurred on western eastern side of island watchman on beach have waited until boat of alcibiades be near shore then rapidly fled up tunnel to palisade through door of be admitted by justinian who listened to excited report concerning number of enemy with greatest calmness indeed roylands capability for command showed in demarch nephew for more perilous did situation become cooler be never for moment lost head in giving order to men self control have wonderful effect on nerve of melnosians who thoroughly efficient a regard drill absolutely blind in implicit obedience to leader carried out command with utmost skill promptitude at entrance of tunnel burned great round of electric light like full moon illuminating neighborhood of palisade with steady splendor so that defensive operation must be carried out to minutest detail without slightest difficulty earthen work have be built half way up wooden structure to height of man shoulder now on top of melnosians laid bag of sand diagonally one overlapping other to side of tunnel with interstice between at interval for barrel of rifle be arranged so a to afford inside good view of attack while protecting in great measure from fire of stormers electric light also gained considerable advantage a being at back must carry on operation with ease while dazzled eye of enemy who in front of must see black mass of palisade at interval catch glimpse of defender like silhouette against bright glare must have considerable influence on fire of attacking party maurice demarch be armed with revolver sabre while sailor have cutlass melnosians martini henry rifle thus what with protecting palisade everything be in favor especially a steepness of ascent hampered enemy considerably in dash to carry barrier by storm thus intrenched waited in absolute silence with calm courage for onslaught shortly heard tramp of approaching foot ring of gun sword exclamation of astonishment uttered by invader when powerful ray of electric light flashed on advancing mass alcibiades might be good commander be confoundedly bad drill sergeant for men came up staircase in singularly disorderly fashion rushing forward pell mell a though anticipated easy victory however at sight of electric light barricade from protruded deadly barrel of rifle impetus received decided check foremost recoiling on in rear threw whole body into confusion hesitating thus for second in bewilderment offered fair mark to defender who at given signal by justinian poured heavy fire into huddled mass of human being fell dead many wounded yell of discomfited assailant vibrated under vaulted roof of tunnel a retired in disorder then stentorian voice of alcibiades be heard urging forward with sudden resolution dashed forward like wave on rock only to retire again before deadly volley of melnosians ground be cumbered with dead dying while air be so thick with gunpowder smoke that hung like veil between contending party not even powerful ray of electric light must break through opaque cloud a yet protected by earthwork melnosians have not lost one man for bullet of enemy passed harmlessly over head buried in sand turf justinian ordered men to reserve fire a attacking party be now retreating for third time in confusion therefore being considerably scattered did not offer so good mark a when rushed forward in dense mass evidently be holding consultation for when again assaulted barricade one party dashed forward under heavy fire with hatchet to cut away timber while others remained behind kept up fusillade at safe distance in order to avert danger save palisade from being cut down marksman returned fire of rear rank while using bayonet at close quarter comrade stabbed stormers whenever must get chance notwithstanding warm reception assaulting party still stuck to work amid infernal din of yell from wounded fighter must be heard steady blow of hatchet sharp crack of gun ping ping ping of bullet whizzing through smoky air at last in spite of valor stormers be forced to retire not without doing considerable damage for have cut through considerable number of barrier post so that palisade be now in somewhat shaky condition egad theyll have down in time maurice said justinian to nephew with grim smile then will be hand to hand fighting better replied maurice coolly examining edge of sword fancy will find hard to drive back from position here come again devil whats matter be going to fire barricade be caliphronas idea ill bet party of men now surged forward bearing huge bundle of brushwood smeared with tar inflammable oil threw at foot of barrier ignited without moment delay melnosians adopting former tactic shot stabbed with right good will advantage be with enemy for in space of few minute wooden pole crossbar of barricade be in flame against new peril nothing must be done a not anticipating stratagem justinian have not provided with water so flame leaping redly out of thick smoke roared upward to roof of tunnel while little band with bayonet fixed others with gun loaded awaited assault must follow downfall of protective palisade a if to hasten catastrophe enemy with infinite labor dragged small cannon up steep stair having placed in position fired recklessly into centre of blazing mass with hope of ball cutting lane through melnosians luckily owing to irregularity of ground be unable to depress muzzle of gun sufficiently shot passed innocuously overhead having other effect than to bring down small shower of stone from roof of tunnel justinian be rather dismayed when found have succeeded in bringing up gun when saw effect of shot smiled contemptuously thats no good said confidently cant get muzzle low enough to be effective nevertheless if roof end of sentence be lost in tremendous explosion nearly stunned for in eagerness to fire alcibiades men have overloaded cannon with result that burst at application of light killed five men glory glory yelled gurt when heard row cant do much now dn cried maurice rapidly barricade will soon be down will be hand to hand fight if bring up gun well take by storm heat by time be something intense owing to near neighborhood of fierce flame while thick white smoke rolling upward in cloud nearly choked with pungent odor melnosians be getting worst of in case a draught blowing upward from sea drove eddying wreath of acrid vapor full against face while enemy be quite free from such annoyance headed by alcibiades caliphronas who for wonder have pluck enough to place in front of men awaited with impatience fall of barricade quite anticipating that melnosians must be choked by pungent smoke be prepared to dash forward carry earthwork by storm while defender be yet stupefied justinian saw danger made up mind acted thereon with promptitude decision maurice must make sally get into clear air beyond else smoke will suffocate thus give advantage right replied nephew recognizing necessity for immediate action flame be now pretty low so let dash through at once take by surprise will lead stay here sir im hanged if will must uncle so a to help if need tell men to follow a be not well enough up in greek at moment barricade fell down with crash amid sudden shower of spark rolling vapor must hear triumphant shout of alcibiades at achievement of result maurice ground teeth with anger a caught taunting tone of caliphronas voice rejoicing over catastrophe wait here with men uncle build up earthwork higher while make dash with handful see if can not drive down staircase suggestion be more palatable to justinian than former one a gave something to do so hastily told men of maurices suggestion number of melnosians who be lying on ground with head wrapped in cloak to escape stifling smoke sprang up on hearing with joyous shout so hastily selecting men maurice unsheathed sword grasped revolver made ready for dash owing to fall of palisade flame be now very low smoke still rolled upward in blinding cloud thus effectively concealing movement from enemy good by lad god bless said old lion grasping nephew hand drive down a far a can while keep at bay will have barricade built up again with sand bag turf followed by gurt about twenty men maurice leaped up on earthwork dashed downward through smouldering ruin of beam with fierce cry in moment be out of smoke into clear atmosphere while enemy thrown into confusion by unexpected sally recoiled in confusion alcibiades however seeing smallness of party soon rallied with curse prayer so next instant maurice men be in thick of fight be now hand to hand struggle maintained with equal fierceness on side fortunately narrowness of tunnel prevented small band of melnosians being overwhelmed by enemy while fact that be on higher ground gave decided advantage made up somewhat for lack of number electric light again pierced now thin veil of smoke so that must see what be doing melnosians used cutlass with deadly effect while who have bayonet fixed to gun stabbed enemy relentlessly a dashed forward again again gurt kept close beside maurice fighting like old sea dog be got nasty stab in thigh brought to ground alcibiades saw sprang forward to finish unfortunate sailor when maurice having cut down wiry greek who be pressing closely turned just in time to see alcibiades lift sword for blow a quickly a possible raised revolver to firing level broke captain arm near elbow causing to drop weapon with yell of pain hitherto fighting have be in one place a party must give way inch now disturbed by reverse of leader enemy began to fall slowly back caliphronas indeed tried to rally on seeing maurice sprang forward to encounter clearing space for fight by whirling sabre round round head greek seized with sudden panic flung into centre of men so that roylands effort to reach be futile maurices band be now much diminished have serious thought of retreating back to barricade justinian by time must have almost rebuilt seeing that advantage be now on side be unwilling to lose so with men stretched out into single line from side to side continued advancing driving enemy step by step down staircase alcibiades who be brave man in spite of villany have now shifted sword to left hand a right arm hung useless at side with many prayer curse entreaty taunt strove to rally force to purpose for slowly surely retreated before devoted little band who with flashing eye clinched teeth pressed steadily downward gurt having bound up thigh with piece torn from shirt be again by maurices side fighting with dogged determination in spite of entreaty to retreat back to barricade go back gurt go back tell justinian to send more men what leave with devil not if know sir hurrah england for ever be wounded only prod in thigh look out sir for black wretch maurice sprang aside just in time to avoid slashing down blow turning on foe made dash at with sabre managed to run through left shoulder greek like lightning cut at defenceless head for gurt who intervened with cutlas maurices career must have be ended a be greek weapon smashed against sailor sword before must recover for blow maurice have slashed through neck so that fell dead at once enemy be fighting like demon electric light having be shut off by angle of tunnel battle be raging in complete darkness save for fitful glare of torch held by alcibiades men pale glimmer of daylight forcing in at cliff entrance of tunnel a long a maurice must keep enemy in front line steadily advancing have fear while owing to confusion of retreat foe kept fighting one with other in semi darkness step by step fell backward until nearly lowest platform of staircase when maurice having thus accomplished object began to think of turning back especially a have now ten men left at entrance of tunnel however saw cowardly caliphronas in rear keeping out of harm way forgetting caution of keeping enemy in front sprang forward to battle with greek alcibiades saw false move when maurices men followed rashly forward dashed back with handful of troop in moment little band be surrounded by horde of howling savage be immediately under entrance of tunnel on level ground so advantage being with enemy in way seemed a though englishman handful must be cut to piece seeing mistake maurice with devoted follower strove to fight way back up stair environed on side by tumultuous crowd gave up for lost god if justinian must only come prayed a fought back to back with gurt surrounded by band will nothing save at moment a if in answer to prayer low moaning sound came sweeping over ocean making heart sink with fear island began to tremble for moment so terrible be suspense that fighting ceased friend foe stood alike pallid with fear a ground began to shake convulsively whole host looked a though turned into stone ground heaving convulsively hurled one to ground including maurice band who be just beyond entrance of tunnel suddenly there be sound like thunder on prostrate mass of humanity lying on quivering earth great mass of rock fell from above what with dust noise yell of fear imprecation maurice be almost stunned when arose to foot saw that enormous slip caused by earthquake have not only killed number of enemy have also blocked up entrance to tunnel seeing that there be hope to return way well aware that alcibiades of men who still survived must kill a soon a recovered from fright maurice sprang to foot seized gurt by arm to boat boat gasped hurrying astonished sailor down to water edge tunnel closed must try western pas about four melnosians have followed with superhuman strength pushed off boat from shore when six be afloat islander took oar commenced to pull outward so a to skirt breakwater by time enemy have recovered from first terror seeing escape of fugitive came rushing down to sea there seemed to be about two hundred of left being pretty well used to such trifle a earthquake especially who came from santorin now that danger be past be determined to follow kill little band luckily maurice by prompt action have gained good start be already outside breakwater making for western side of island where hoped to re enter through western pas must see alcibiades caliphronas gesticulating fiercely on beach urging companion to follow so just a fugitive came in sight of wreck of eunice enemy started in pursuit thank god for earthquake said maurice thankfully taking off cap saved life dont holler till youre out of wood sir said gurt dryly pointing to sea ive seed sort o thing at thera aint child play water around be boiling like furnace have changed from normal blue tint to color of milk maurice in astonishment dipped hand over side of boat into opalescent sea withdrew immediately with cry of pain water be boiling hot bless sir there lot of sort of thing about here said gurt in philosophical tone ive seed bilin round santorin like kittle greek dont mind much dont replied maurice in disbelieving tone well alcibiades lot seemed pretty sick while last theyre frightened enough soon get over sir look at em follering by time be rounding angle of melnos breakwater of western harbor be in sight boat containing alcibiades manned by able rower be gradually gaining on two of melnosians though tugged away pluckily be yet in great pain from wound while gurt feeble from loss of blood must hardly rise to foot give way men cried maurice in greek a examined revolver ive got two shot left gurt so if boat come too near ill try to pick off one of rower be not far from home now sir said gurt hopefully mr crispin will be at gate hope will gurt earthquake must have demoralized everything perhaps mr crispin went back to see justinian not sir hed send temistocles mr justinian must think dead not improbable however will soon show be alive though tunnel be closed up forever good job too sir replied gurt cheerfully there getting in way now so if villain want to take melnos theyll only have western pas to enter by guess that there rock sir killed few what with battle earthquake must have lost at least hundred men while death be comparatively small weve got nigh on hundred left think sir if werent fur sir gittin that idear of boat wed be dead men for sure egad well be dead men now if dont look out said maurice a foremost boat of pursuer came within pistol shot look out gurt im going to pick off fellow standing up in prow melnosians in sudden rush for boat have naturally enough dropped gun maurice with englishman determination to stick to anything have once got grip of have carried off sword still possessed revolver gurt also have cutlas so in event of foe catching on land before must gain shelter of stockade maurice one of melnosians must have to defend three wounded men remaining one who have weapon meanwhile boat impelled by rower with energy of despair have rounded breakwater be rapidly sweeping inward to land little distance above must see narrow entrance of pas a crispin men be intrenched behind palisade farther up gorge of course fugitive must not hope for help maurice however thought that pistol shot might attract attention a sound carry far in rarefied atmosphere also told melnosians to shout loudly so a to let friend know be in peril just a boat be nearly touching land bullet from rifle of man standing up in prow whizzed past maurices ear fortunately being widely aimed did not touch englishman resting revolver muzzle on left arm fired carefully luckily hit enemy full in chest whereupon man flung up hand fell splash into water rower startled at paused for moment in time maurice ran boat ashore giving gurt who must not walk into care of two melnosians one of whom be unhurt other only wounded in arm thrust gurts cutlas into hand of remaining one began to retreat slowly up hill alcibiades boat be yet far distant one near shore rower having recovered from surprise at loss of leader landed a quickly a possible began to run a fast a possible after fugitive melnosians shouted with right good will for help while retreating slowly maurice managed to drop one of pursuer with remaining cartridge have now nothing left to fight with sword cutlas of be useless against rifle carried by pursuer look out be worse a captain alcibiades with new crew of cut throat have now landed on beach two melnosians hurried gurt along a quickly a possible other wounded man ran ahead shouting for help maurice with remaining islander covered retreat with stern determination several shot sung past pursuer be evidently bad marksman gained entrance of gorge without being hurt palisade now must be seen little distance away foremost fugitive have nearly reached so maurice took heart in spite of near proximity of alcibiades men in heart however be praying that crispin might be still at post a if be not whole four of must certainly be murdered on spot one of pursuer be now close at hand raised rifle to shoulder maurice with sudden inspiration threw flat on face ball passed over head then springing to foot commenced to run rapidly after companion followed by baffled marksman who did not wait to reload maurice heard shout of joy from palisade so knew that crispin be at post must bring help at moment foremost man caught up with englishman slashed at neck with sabre wily greek dodged lightly clubbing musket brought down on roylands head with tremendous force instinctively maurice put up sword to guard weapon shivered to piece under blow stunned by stroke fell insensible to ground chapter xxxii warning of hephaistos hence ye mortal hence away dare not on isle to stay for in grim seclusion here mighty forge must rear so that in sea girt grove can work for mighty jove thunder bolt require swift to follow lightning fire when wrath must assuage on mortal wreak rage never more will melnos isle with corn of cere smile from crater flame will rise roaring to frighted sky bubbling from depth below in cup will lava glow sea around will boil at never ceasing toil therefore mortal haste away dare not on isle to stay when maurice came to be lying on grass inside palisade crispin be bending over with greatest solicitude head ached dully with effect of blow blood be clotted in nasty scalp wound on right side of skull where butt of musket have struck dizzy a be yet by violent effort managed to sit up inquire in feeble voice what have become of companion of flight oh be right maurice said crispin holding out brandy flask take drink of lie down again for time maurice did a be told resumed recumbent attitude on grass anxious to know everything looked inquiringly at crispin who at once replied to mute questioning have be here ever since left for tunnel morning explained poet quickly a justinian sent word by temistocles be on account to forsake post heard pistol shot cry for help thought be stratagem on part of enemy then theodore whom sent on for aid made appearance at barricade gasped out incoherent story a soon a ascertained be sallied out with men saw gurt being helped up hill with basil protecting rear alcibiades others be scrambling up after then saw engage with foremost blackguard knocked over must have finished for dick who took pot shot bowled over like ninepin then rushed up brought here with alcibiades friend yelling like fiend at escape of prey alcibiades oh other fellow have gone back in boat to eastern harbor suppose jove be never so surprised in life a when saw scudding up hill for justinian thought be dead doe justinian know be alive yes sent temistocles off to tell a soon a be in safety expect hell be here minute what about earthquake oh felt can tell be tremendous shock have filled up tunnel completely at suppose uncle be heart broken fear never thought about tunnel while be in danger how did manage to escape be long story said maurice faintly for felt sick with fatigue give more brandy here be dont talk more till justinian come tell where be gurt oh rest have gone off to acropolis to be looked after now do be quiet maurice youll be fainting again roylands closed eye while crispin with sponge water brought by swift footed temistocles carefully bathed wound dexterously bound up with lint linen so that maurice felt more comfortable only flesh wound said in satisfied tone be mercy did not get head smashed what be time nearly ten oclock in morning youve be fighting night so dont wonder be dead beat sun will be up over eastern peak soon be indeed long after dawn for in darkness of tunnel one have taken count of hour when earthquake have occurred be just that time between fading night coming day so upset excited have maurice be with fight earthquake escape that one else remembered that fighting have begun at midnight lasted till sunrise now remembered that sun have risen while be rounding angle of island having forgotten flight of time have not thought strange be great blessing that have escaped in boat at daylight else even in luminous night must have be difficult with sea in such perturbed condition to have made voyage safely very shortly justinian arrived full of thankfulness for maurices escape fear concerning wound by time young man though much shaken be quite again leaning on demarchs arm with occasional assistance from crispin managed to crawl along a far a acropolis where be joyously received by helena a tunnel be now completely closed up there be chance of pirate getting in way so justinian sent men over to western pas where under command of dick remained on guard woman from village came up first thing in morning with provision wine to minister to want so thus everything being in order for present demarch be anxious to hear detail of nephew miraculous escape told whole story over breakfast table with occasional help from gurt who be admitted to symposium on account of bravery during battle old demarch self contained by nature training did not say much during recital beyond expressing heartfelt joy at escape of nephew must easily be seen that be inordinately proud of maurices prowess promptitude of action for though hero modestly suppressed such detail a tended to self glorification gurt in blunt sailor way came out with true unvarnished fact of case caused maurice to blush audience to exclaim admiringly by jove maurice ought to be vc cried crispin when story came to end if hadnt have wit about seized that boat must have be dead man to certainty be roylands blood said justinian proudly knew be not mistaken in estimate of character maurice will make admirable ruler of melnos be if there be melnos to rule over replied maurice with uneasy laugh for by jove uncle when earthquake came thought everything have gone to kingdom come ah see father be right about earthquake last night said helena in triumph felt that something be going to happen yes thought must be eruption answered justinian with apparent indifference though there be anxious look on face a to earthquake why greek island be volcanic so mean nothing how did get on after left uncle why set men to work to build up barricade again with turf bag of sand be long time gone son became afraid that have be cut to piece so when work be done intended taking men going after then earthquake occurred heard fall of roof at cliff entrance thought be dead for sure can not tell of anguish felt at loss however temistocles brought news of safe arrival at western pas breathed freely again oh dear maurice continued demarch taking nephew hand how fervently do thank god that be alive for if scoundrel have killed indeed think must have have heart to continue living in melnos maurice be greatly touched with uncle emotion be rare thing for iron old demarch to display for a rule took good bad fortune with utmost equanimity seldom gave outward sign of feeling on such occasion nephew however be very dear to heart looked upon with great pride a future son in law successor so have be terrible blow to to think have lost young man on whom future hope depended a for helena said nothing genuine offspring of father a be bore up pluckily though must be plainly seen that have suffered much during absence of lover fortunately time have elapsed between maurices supposed death subsequent reappearance have be too short to permit of knowing of calamity else brave a be must certainly have given way under cruel misfortune a be however now sat beside safe sound so terrible event detailed with such coolness only seemed to be hideous nightmare have vanished at coming of morning insisted upon maurices going to bed for good sleep after breakfast in insistence be supported by father who saw that maurice be more shaken by late fatigue than chose to acknowledge can sleep for few hour at event son said affectionately for alcibiades have lost too many men to think about making attack at least for time be not going to sleep be going down to valley to look at hot spring earthquake have rather unnerved wish to see for if there be probability of eruption crispin will come with if desire to tell truth also be rather tired pshaw said man of iron with good humored scorn have stamen crispin if have be through maurice have undergone might talk however take sleep for hour so crispin really be very delicately constituted must not do without sleep justinian despised in order to be ready for emergency curled up on divan in court rested there without removing clothes maurice on contrary completely worn out with fatigue anxiety to say nothing of scalp wound went straight to bed slept soundly most of day while helena tenderly solicitous of comfort watched beside whole time with little hand lying in warm grasp meanwhile justinian who in spite of age scarcely seemed to feel effect of previous night vigil took cold bath to freshen up then started on journey of inspection round island like careful general first visit be to outpost at western pas where found everything in extremely satisfactory condition part of men be sleeping while others kept guard waiting to take turn of rest when comrade awoke notwithstanding hard fighting who have be engaged in defence of tunnel seemed in wonderfully good condition while dick nine sailor hardened by seafaring life seemed to feel fatigue whatsoever in spite of constant watchfulness anxiety with view to seeing position of enemy justinian climbed up small path led to hill from inner side of outward palisade using field glass soon discovered that alcibiades be concentrating force below in order to storm pas boat after boat filled with desperado came sweeping round breakwater into smooth sea of harbor tent be being erected on beach by besieger evidently have discovered that there be chance of entering by tunnel be completely blocked up by fallen rock so be determined to effect entrance by western pas where at least must have advantage of fighting in daylight carefully surveying disorderly host justinian calculated that there still remained about two hundred men against must only bring ninety five thereabouts still intrenched behind barricade having pas swept by two cannon thought invader must find somewhat difficult to dislodge from strong position more so a lacked discipline leader be quite ignorant of military tactic having ascertained justinian descended into gorge again where gave dick final instruction be simply to keep sharp lookout on enemy in event of seeing movement uphill towards mouth of pas to at once send off temistocles to acropolis with information dick having promised faithfully to obey instruction demarch escorted by couple of men went along mulberry avenue in order to survey tunnel have not entered since driven from thence by earthquake hour previous electric light be turned off a demarch now that danger lay more in west than east judged advisable to reserve power of dynamo for one light swept western pas therefore bidding men take torch went downward into darkness of tunnel with such illumination only passing down to ruin of palisade where so fierce fight have taken place crossed that boundary turning angle of staircase came in sight of landslip caused by earthquake red flare of torch feebly showed amount of damage done justinian saw sufficient to assure that there be chance of tunnel being made use of again for at least month extending from cliff entrance to considerable distance back whole roof have collapsed ton of dbris piled upward from floor to vault completely sealed up mouth of passage must take goodly amount of dynamite blasting powder to remove massive block now that knew maurice be safe demarch have time to grieve over damage done to beloved tunnel justinian however be too practical man to waste time in useless lamentation promptly decided that a soon a alcibiades be beaten backan event be assured must come off without much difficultyhe must set gang of men to clear away obstruction restore with a little delay a possible tunnel to pristine excellence burning of palisade also have taught lesson to obviate chance of such defence being destroyed by fire decided to build kind of stone bastion in same place with loophole for gun also to fortify with two field piece must simply mow down enemy advancing up staircase like ripe corn inspection of tunnel being concluded justinian returned upward to light of day descended grand staircase in order to pay visit to spring looked upon a kind of thermometer useful in warning of seismic disturbance for in spite of long silence of volcano justinian knew that subterranean force be still at work under crust covered crater with remembrance of great eruption of vesuvius in year constantly in mind be not without certain fear that long slumbering monster might reawaken from sleep of century volcanic force however having vent in adjacent island of santorin have hitherto calculated that melnos must remain quiescent terrible earthquake have so unexpectedly occurred inspired with great uneasiness be in deadly fear lest must prelude renewed activity of mountain a before described hot spring of melnos somewhat resembled geyser of iceland save that be le active did not send up jet of water to great height from uncanny mouth on day however when demarch approached desolate gorge where have hitherto rested a slightly bubbling pool of water be astonished dismayed to find in full activity cloud of thin steam almost obscured yellow red green lava of rock behind amid ominous vapor spring be spouting furiously at interval thick jet of boiling water must gush up from ragged cleft in sulphur streaked block to considerable height after expending fury must sink down again into bowel of earth after time muttered bellowing of monster must be heard amid groanings gurglings told of colossal force at work beneath great column of water must again shoot skyward with hideous roar demarch noticed unusual disturbance of spring with great uneasiness a during whole forty year residence on island never have there be such sign of danger even where stood earth be cracked in many place little jet of steam escaped with whistling noise must be heard shrilly when bellowing of geyser ceased melnosians be in terrible state of alarm took justinian eloquence to persuade that be simply local disturbance caused by earthquake that there be danger of outbreak on part of long sleeping volcano truth to tell in spite of speech be not at easy in mind a climbed up staircase to acropolis for ominous sign boded ill for safety of island dreaded lest without further warning crater must burst out into full fury in case being therein must certainly be killed be unwilling however to communicate fear to helena to maurice thus disturb mind at critical period of siege feeling that must have one with whom to talk awoke crispin from siesta taking into own room gave description of geyser activity deuce said crispin in dismay when heard unpleasant recital hope be not going to have destruction of pompeii over again must say look uncommonly like do think melnos will break out again spouting geyser certainly dont bode good sir that earthquake perhaps be warning from hephaistos that have better leave island leave island said justinian obstinately drawing iron gray brow together after forty year of incessant toil must indeed be coward to leave melnos simply because thing look trifle ominous yes volcano be delicate thing to deal with sign be slight who know what may be followed by blowing up of crater crust in case be afraid everything in connection with melnos will be at end volcano have be extinct for thousand of year so be vesuvius replied crispin coolly mountain in new zealandtarawera be notthat awoke to activity after century of quiescence cant trust volcano sir be most treacherous monster when least expected break out in full fury eruption be going on at thera more reason that volcanic action will extend to melnos there dont agree with if subterranean force find vent in one place there be le chance of breaking out in besides thera have always be active herodotus appollonius plutarch speak of previous eruption then there be one in when venetian occupied island in think last outburst took place in well according to georgios there be one going on now be bad sign for on contrary very good sign dont see crispin that whereas thera have burst out hundred year so for many century there be record of melnos being active temple of hephaistos be built long before christ during supremacy of hellas in sea have crater not be extinct then must not have be built on inner cup must eruption have taken place since a must have be destroyed so a mountain to appearance have be extinct for thousand of year volcanic force find vent at thera really see why because of earthquake spouting geyser must think likely crater will break out again still see hellene must have known be volcanic island perhaps put up temple to god of fire in memory of eruption if remember rightly rhodians built temple to poseidon asphalios after early eruption in order to propitiate god so shrine may have be erected for similar reason scarcely if volcano be active then dont think even pious hellene must have risked life in building temple under very nose of vulcan in full work what do think be best to be done well certainly must be foolish to leave melnos after work have expended upon without very good reason until something more serious occurs must be inclined to remain in spite of sign volcano have be a quiet a lamb for thousand of year so see why must break out now save out of sheer contrariness have better go on defending melnos from alcibiades take notice of volcano if anything serious occurs must get away a quickly a possible how alcibiades have destroyed boat well will seize else a soon a can guess eunice be at syra will go over bring to melnos so that in case of danger can save one over hundred fifty people impossible there wont be hundred fifty people by time alcibiades be beaten replied crispin dryly be not that be afraid of if such contingency a volcano becoming active doe arise difficulty will be to get through besieging army out into open sea im afraid there chance of replied demarch gloomily well certainly look impossible there nothing like trying however there may be necessity for such daring dont trouble about volcano justinian ive doubt hephaistos will warn again before proceeding to extremity be of same opinion still word have given great comfort crispin for after money labor expended on island must indeed be terrible thing if became nothing smoking mass of black lava to say nothing of destruction of scheme wont tell maurice helena of maurice have quite enough on mind already must only frighten helena to death be brave enough at most danger think volcanic eruption must frighten most stout hearted have to great extent calmed feeling of in village so will be best for to keep own counsel not uselessly alarm friend hope be useless alarm said crispin uneasily be very unpleasant idea to think that one be living on top of powder magazine may explode at moment a far at go answered demarch dryly whole globe be nothing egg full of fire live on surface of explosive bombshell whirling through space may burst at moment island be only sample of whole earth wish wouldnt look at thing in such unpleasant light cried crispin laughing nerve will be destroyed before leave island however be going to finish sleep maurice also be asleep ive doubt will wake up quite fit for midnight attack egad hell get said demarch grimly villain alcibiades be getting ready for assault well in spite of benefit conferred be to be hoped hephaistos wont interfere time with earthquake have warned twice replied justinian a walked out into court with poet once by earthquake again by spring heaven help when third warning come oh there luck in odd number said crispin flippantly in case if come to grief enemy will be in same plight a ourselves chapter xxxiii invocation of artemis o moon thou risest from western sea virgin aphrodite fair chaste by thy votaress on bended knee stainless flower be on thine altar placed pale lily rose

sacrifice song worship thee so grant o moon bliss of feeling in heart pure delight tell love be coming back to evidently alcibiades have little stomach for midnight fighting for made attempt to storm pas under cover of darkness be apparently making preparation to begin fight at first flush of dawn in thus deciding be wiser than knew for many of men have be killed in tunnel by own friend owing to confusion prevailed during retreat down staircase moreover with electric light showing position of enemy to defender dazzling eyesight when advanced to attack there be nothing to be gained by night sortie alcibiades thought best to storm pas by day so that at least in matter of light might have same advantage a justinian day long demarch nephew posted on height above gorge from vantage with aid of strong field glass saw preparation be being made for final attack alcibiades with more military precision than of yore have divided two hundred men into two body one of be commanded by other by count caliphronas under two leader be four other commander responsible for fifty troop deferred to caliphronas alcibiades while count in turn took order from old pirate a supreme head of whole army without doubt alcibiades desired to attack island in two separate place for knew thanks to treachery of caliphronas justinian force be too few in number to admit of division thus while one body be attacking palisade in gorge other must get at rear of melnosians by way unfortunately for daring scheme cliff on side of pas be perfectly inaccessible a arose smooth arid from beach to height of two hundred foot a besieger have not wing must scarcely hope to climb up sterile steep must not have afforded foothold even for goat only path available for plan be perfectly well known to caliphronas unluckily for besieger be inside outer palisade from whence wound up to height where demarch nephew be seated from thence went through altar glade down to back of acropolis once outer defence be taken caliphronas intended to lead century of men up secret way knew thoroughly thus gain heart of island a exemplified by acropolis while demarch be keeping back feigned attack at stockade stratagem be very clever very feasible difficulty in carrying out consisted in fact that before path must be ascended outer defence must have to be taken be easy task when defended by such determined men a melnosians however be to appearance only chance of gaining speedy possession of island without risking prolonged fighting so alcibiades adopted plan without hesitation arranged with subordinate to assault palisade at early dawn carry with dash then while made feigned attack at inner defence caliphronas men gaining interior of island by path must attack defending party in rear never for moment struck messrs alcibiades company that justinian be far too wide awake not to have thought of contingency have made preparation in consequence entrance of path from gorge be up narrow winding staircase cut in live rock must only hold two men abreast so in event of outer defence being beaten down staircase must be easily defended by dozen so of men added to iron gate closely locked be placed at entrance therefore even if enemy did gain entrance into pas have considerable difficulty to overcome before marching in triumph into acropolis justinian must indeed have be bad general have not foreseen danger even though thus guarded against to best of ability trusted that men must be able to hold outer defence until alcibiades retired in discomfiture a matter of fact fiery old adventurer must have liked nothing better than to sally forth at head of handful of men drive enemy into sea be no longer reckless rudolph roylands of past judged best to be cautious risk chance of pitched battle in open with unequal number intrenched in strong outwork of pas little band must hope to face enemy with more than fair chance of victory if be foolish enough to make sally ninety five men must in spite of bravery be quickly cut to piece by more than double number of course military precision must doubtless tell against undisciplined horde of alcibiades still risk be too great justinian much a desired to make bold dash for victory deemed best to take advantage of shelter advantage fortification afforded western pas be not unlike tunnel in conformation for extending from inside to outside distance of quarter of mile ran upward from cliff of beach for little way then turning in abrupt angle pursued straight way into interior of crater evidently created by volcanic eruption for outlet of lava side rent apart by convulsion arose precipitous sterile to height of over two hundred foot vegetation softened nakedness of rugged rock streaked with green yellow red presented singularly forbidding appearance on top grew ancient pine whose sombre branch nearly touching one a stretched across gulf only permitted thin streak of sky to be seen so that depth below be singularly gloomy to imaginative hellene might well have suggested thought that be gate of hades by name be traditionally known justinian however abandoned such cognomen a of evil omen called western pas by title be generally called by melnosians be indeed remarkably eerie place even on brightest day light filtered downward from between branch of pine half revealed in glimmering gloom horrent rock lack of flower grass chill vault like seeming of whole tremendous cleft maurice having slept day felt wonderfully refreshed when awoke just a sun set though head be still painful with wound yet brain be perfectly bright clear so after making hearty meal started with uncle crispin for western pas where be to remain night enemy might might not make night attack justinian rather inclined to belief that must wait till daylight nevertheless to guard against chance of such thing occurring resolved that one leader men must remain in pas during hour of darkness men thus being at front number of woman be sleeping up at acropolis with helena so a to be near relation interior of island be thus given over entirely to feminine influence while extreme end of pas near to outer palisade be occupied by male defender at time sunlight came into cliff entrance so there be scanty vegetation for distance inward so on sparse grass justinian men made comfortable many of soldier wearied out with watching be sleeping around there be strong guard at barricade under command of gurt who be much better have insisted upon coming to front round fire sat demarch nephew crispin dick talking earnestly about coming struggle for bosn having snatched few hour of sleep during afternoon be now quite alert active fire be lighted more for sake of comfort than because of cold though indeed bottom of abyss be chilly enough cheerful flame flickered redly in intense darkness while high above glimmered pale star to right arose frowning mass of palisade black against faint gleam of luminous night to nostril came salt savor of sea at interval must hear song revelry of foe on beach below what with recumbent form of sleeping men firelight hollowing out space for in blackness intense stillness of night broken only by pacing of sentry fitful snatch of song from near distance whole scene be extraordinarily weird so much so that crispin with impressionable poet nature soon relapsed into silence crispin why dont think of business said maurice mischievously a noticed poet abstraction be thinking ofofother thing niece for instance observed demarch with grave smile not improbable replied crispin reddening trifle after be in good company for maurice be doubtless thinking of helena maurice smiling did not deny remarkably accurate guess uncle smoothing silver beard laughed silently im afraid dick be only person who be thinking of war im certain of a far a be concerned will not answer for dick there dick dick said justinian shaking head gravely what be hear about zoe sir answered bosn innocently oh be daughter maid well see sir said dick bashfully be like sir zoe see gentleman like like zoe so with permission mr justinian be thinking of marriage permission echoed demarch with lurking smile a far a go doesnt seem to be needed be surely pairing time for three young men seem to be choosing mate eunice helena zoe maurice when old tutor arrives must have triple marriage weve got to drive away alcibiades first uncle doubt that though difficult be not impossible hope not crispin wake up sir be thinking about eunice again indeed be not answered crispin with dismay be thinking of revolver have left behind at acropolis there warrior for said demarch with hearty laugh forgets modern substitute for shield well lad a revolver be important matter have better go back get crispin jumped gayly to foot ill go at once said putting on sombrero hope battle will not begin without think may make up mind there will be row till dawn sir said dick who be peering between bar of palisade there must not be kick up going on down there if meant business in case observed maurice rising slowly think ill go back for revolver crispin for heart replied poet laughing oh dont wish to bring back especially in wartime be safer with helena uncle can go by mean agree with dick think there be chance of night attack however have better make haste to come back to post so paris fly harsh war alarm for dalliance in fair helen arm crispin keep rude couplet to ill forget to bring back revolver adieu gentleman will return anon maurice stalked away up gorge like tragedy actor much to amusement of justinian indeed light hearted desultory conversation did good deal to keep up spirit in spite of serious danger at gate englishman be wonderfully merry be characteristic of british that if take pleasure solemnly keep balance even by being gay in presence of danger who doubt truth of statement have only to read kinglakes account of battle of alma in order to assure of truth a before mentioned gorge be very dark maurice knew inch of way being sure footed a goat never stumbled in step strode merrily along in darkness whistling garryowen be curious amid greek life revival of paganism piratical invasion to hear quaint irish air maurice found admirable melody to to march moved leg so rapidly to tune that in very short space of time emerged from pas into moonlit road skirting crater be only about ten oclock in evening moon full round burned like lamp in sky near milky way be slowly drawing near brightly gleamed sirius amid feebler twinkle of minor star eastward like ruby glittered mar planet of soldier foreboding war blood wind gently moved branch of mulberry tree above head of pedestrian moderating pace strolled lazily along shadow strewn road while nightingale sang in thicket thrilling heart with delicious note soon however song mingled with strange wild melody chanted in clear high voice arose fell sadly in chill moonlight then imploring chorus of voice sounded in unison again one singer cried in appealing manner then silence hurried note of hidden bird curious to know meaning of strange singing maurice walked rapidly onward bounded up step of acropolis entered into vestibule music shrill fitful sounded close at hand so stealthily approaching curtain hanging before entrance of court roylands peered in to discover reason of such fantastic melody be evidently disturbing mystery of bona dea for court be thronged with woman seemed to be engaged in performance of ritea kind of invocation to moon appeared shining brilliantly in sky through hypthral opening of building small brazier filled with burning coal elevated on tripod stood near fountain before stood helena in long white robe with loosely flowing hair slender arm outstretched towards serene planet above around court knelt number of melnosian woman in long chiton maurices eye be fastened on beautiful central figure stood so motionless before tripod moonlight softly fell on lovely upturned face on snowy robe milky arm touched with chilly beam disordered gold of hair maurice who felt that be looking on at ceremony not meant for masculine eye must have stepped forward announced presence at moment helena broke out into song so wild thrilling that involuntarily paused in amazement word be in greek be now sufficiently master of language to understand be evidently antique invocation to inviolate artemis wondered where must have discovered a rippled from lip rising falling with fitful sobbing like voice of complaining wind on lonely beach helena oh waning moon why hidest thou thy face fair be night le fair than lover absent unveil thyself from jealous cloud woof thou wilt see how fair be worship chorus o dian sun of lover night call thee helena thou canst control tide of ocean tide obedient who be slave to thee surely then thou canst control heart of lover make long to return to arm so loving chorus o baalit mistress of tide call thee helena save from danger for be daring lover ride surge of battle a thou ridest flying cloud save tanith bring safely to arm of who calleth chorus o ashtoreth thou also hast loved call thee at moment helena took something from bosom throwing few grain of incense on coal held in thick white smoke arose afterwards advanced to fountain dipped thrice singing time strange melody helena amber heart place in rising odor so thy virtue may pas into thrice do dip in lustrous water in thou hast beheld thine image for thus will draw magic from thy breast on lover neck will place iton beating heart will rest will save when red run blood of battle chorus hecate controller of spell call thee when ended chorus of woman arose to foot slowly filed out of one of side door leaving court empty helena still standing by brazier from whence burning incense still rolled skyward maurice quite astonished at strange scene of magical incantation stole quietly forward looking over shoulder saw that be gazing at amber heart have converted into amulet by moon spell helena turned with cry of astonishment then fell into arm with joyous laugh oh maurice dearest darling be old story true have spell drawn back to side be much excited so maurice drew gently to one of chair near fountain placing therein knelt at foot smoothing two hand held between own to quieten alarm at sudden appearance dearest helena came back to fetch crispin revolver have left behind hearing singing looked in oh cried helena with blush what did see nothing very dreadful replied laughing only saw symposium of woman felt like clodius surveying mystery of bona dea what on earth be doing oh be only game maurice replied burying head on shoulder be ashamed must have seen acting so childishly fact be there be woman here who told about about what incantation to moon in spite of father being so particular about purity of blood of woman be of arab descent one who told how to make talisman come from africa believe be descendant of old carthaginian nonsense be stamped out by roman well what about modern dido well saw how anxious be about told if invoked moon bathed small article in moon water incense must become endowed with powerful virtue protect wearer from danger foolish child said maurice tenderly stroking loose hair be mummery on account yes if laugh at talisman will lose power then ill be a grave a judge where be wonderful amulet helena held out amber heart lay in centre of little white palm from maurice lifted daintily pressed mustache against hand be to wear round neck there be nothing to fasten there oh dear must get string silk oroh cried struck with sudden thought have knife then lend sword what be going to cut head off for overlooking bona dea ceremony said laughingly drawing keen weapon from sheath for answer arose to foot shook loose gold of hair over shoulder carefully selecting one long tress smoothed down with hand held out towards lover cut off what beautiful hair cried maurice who stood before with sword gleaming in moonlight oh helena must not do that then give sword ill do dearest must hurt why do want to cut lock to make chain for heart there chain round heart already said lover still hesitating wont spoil hair maurice how tiresome be cut off at once stamped foot with pretty petulance so seeing be obstinate carefully sheared off tress close to head being done shook lock over shorn place sitting down in chair once more began to weave shining hair into delicate chain silly child making despoil of glory said maurice touched by action there let put sword up again will help hold end of chain then talk will break charm maurice sheathing sword knelt down before taking one end of glittering coil daintily between finger thumb watched weaving thread rapidly together crooning while strange old song in low voice weave thread of golden hair golden future also weaving happy be thy fortune fair plenteous joy scanty grieving in out out in thus thy coming life spin bind chain to golden heart golden heart to thee be binding meet together neer to part love will come with little finding in out out in thus thy future life spin there said helena having finished chain now let tie up endsgive heart heart have already answered mischievously amber heart please must bind to chain where did learn that song made up by said helena triumphantly dangling chain before do think that only crispin be poet sappho there be chain of hair talisman attached to keep from harm so bend head knight will give to maurice entering into spirit of charming humor bowed head over flung slender chain of hair then kissing on forehead leaned back clapped hand gayly there now be safe nothing can harm while wear that nothing can harm while think of whispered tenderly taking in arm love be safeguard in peace war oh dear sighed helena a pillowed head on shoulder what nonsense be maurice still very pleasant nonsense very pleasant be very nice be very vain said kissing rising to foot there charming sorceress new circe precisely must not stay with circe longer let go to crispin room for revolver then good by a quickly a possible ran into poet bedroom found weapon on bed where neglectful poet have left slipping into belt came back to say good by to helena now mind go to bed dear said kissing tenderly more magical ceremony to night no will go to bed oh do take care of maurice will both for sake own besides talisman helena threw arm impulsively round neck give talisman give love bent down kissed then without word went away into moonlit night on way to battle perhapsdeath chapter xxxiv modern thermopyl in gap say fifty fighter waiting for coming

mingle fiercely with shrieking of wounded in pain till in spite of toiling valor stanch effort foiling down slope again recoiling reel shattered column back dauntlessness in vain battle ground be cumbered with multitude unnumbered of slain at first flush of dawn in gray eastern sky melnosians be on alert ready for fight owing to early hour fact of having passed night in open air many of men be shivering with cold on noticing justinian ordered hot coffee to be served out round also took light meal then went through few evolution on narrow space of bivouac ground suppled limb sent lethargic blood once more speeding rapidly through vein crispin maurice felt somewhat stiff especially latter owing to wound hot coffee food indulgence in few gymnastic exercise soon brought back to normal condition of physical fitness unlike le seasoned frame justinian iron constitution never seemed to feel strain to be subjected in spite of year be a brisk active a youngest member of band a be imperative that outer defence must be held against odds owing to proximity of side path demarch have two cannon be planted inside second barricade brought down a rapidly a possible placed on side of entrance to gorge in order to sweep down enemy a dashed up sloping ground from beach muzzle protruding from earthwork must pour confusion into rank of stormers in most effective fashion especially a be loaded with grape shot must scatter widely in discharge a in tunnel palisade thick wall of turf be built half way up against beam while on sand bag gabions with loophole for rifle barrel be also laid whole front of battery be therefore bristling with danger to besieger while garrison intrenched behind outwork be in comparative safety inner palisade farther up pas be defended in similar manner saving in matter of cannon justinian determined to use best endeavor finally to crush enemy in present position so a to do away with danger of gaining possession of side path led into heart of island directly in front of battery ground sloped away down to beach in gentle declivity up winding road be cut by slight gradation afforded sufficiently easy approach still so undisciplined be troop of alcibiades that demarch thought instead of marching along road in regular line must scramble confusedly upward by path by slope so that gun must play on scattered rank with deadly effect maurice uncle took field glass up to point of vantage above side path from whence must survey preparation of enemy who be now deploying in irregular line under amateur leadership of alcibiades traitor greek justinian laughed contemptuously a saw confusion into caliphronas be throwing men without removing glass from eye remarked on bad generalship to maurice always thought andros have certain amount of brain seeing what mess be making of thing after training be wrong in believing capable of anything except grinning in mirror well have very bad soldier uncle seem to be ignorant of simplest rule of discipline wonder very scum of levant peasant sailor turkish scamp stupid islander still even out of most hopeless material good commander can form disciplined corp be sure have have plenty of time to drill men andros have not slightest capability for military matter a for alcibiades demarchs opinion of alcibiades generalship be so bad that must not find word sufficiently contemptuous to express scorn a at moment enemy began to move irregularly towards road led to mouth of pas shut up glass went down to men followed by maurice dance be about to begin said crispin when garrison be in order at several post expect will be merry one faith will be piper replied justinian grimly pointing to cannon will caper gayly enough when play tune have better lose time in beginning then said maurice who be looking at approaching enemy for here come dancer a justinian have foreseen stormers instead of advancing by road in compact body thus neutralizing danger of opening fire rushed irregularly up slope in hopeless confusion yelling wildly in order to keep up courage scum cried justinian scornfully a saw motley crowd climbing upward give em lad dick presided over one of gun gurt at other a of having be in english navy knew necessary business for loading adjusting sight firing cannon demarchs finance have not run to expense of importing cannon of new type so brass gun be somewhat old fashioned still loaded with grape shot be very effective when fired especially when sighted with considerable science by old men of war men up came enemy shrieking like fiend broken into irregular band dotting green slope with patch of blue topped by red of turkish headgear dick who be to fire first waited till be within easy distance then put lighted match to touch hole of cannon there be roar a deadly grape shot splashed among advancing crowd then shriek of rage a column reeled wavered for moment paused encouraged by alcibiades still advanced only to be mown down by dozen with discharge of gurts cannon upon dismayed at carnage retreated down hill in confusion leaving ground thick with slain on seeing sailor set up hearty british cheer in joined justinian who smiled grimly at effective work done by gun alcibiades be stamping with rage for little scheme of firing barricade a on previous occasion be quite impracticable owing to deadly muzzle gaped through palisade with considerable caution however scattered men so a to avert danger of huddled mass being cut down by grape shot kept up continuous fire at frowning front of battery melnosians returned fire with martini henry rifle managed to pick off few of sharp shooter while protected by gabions managed to escape without loss of single man for bullet buried with dull thud in sand bag else went ripping above head to flatten harmlessly against lava wall of pas cant last long against cannon uncle said maurice who be watching dick reloading gun that first dash have lost nearly twenty men will take time to polish off two hundred replied justinian who have glass to eye besides alcibiades have scheme in head sharp shooting be done to divert attention thought so whats up now he bringing up field piece to hill deuce cried maurice hastily focussing glass must silence that dick do think must bring one of gun to bear on hill to right dick after consideration thought must did for with assistance of sailor wheeled round gun carriage to angle of thirty five degree so a to bring muzzle of piece in direct line with conical shaped mound up enemy be dragging battery hill be slightly to right of pas must have be utilized long before for gun by able commander not until loss of twenty men have taught alcibiades experience did think of making use of position crest of mound be slightly lower than palisade by depressing muzzle of gun dick got fair opportunity of disabling battery of enemy owing to number soon succeeded in dragging field piece up to top placing in position raised mouth slightly so a to aim at upper part of barricade just a be preparing to fire dick who have loaded with round shot discharged cannon great mass of iron went hurtling viciously through air badly aimed dick said maurice who have glass up eye be not quite in look out be returning compliment there be puff of smoke sudden flash infinitesimal pause ball came ripping along at tremendous speed only to strike ground in front of battery ricochet harmlessly down hill gunner isnt much better than sir cried dick carefully training sight of piece wont miss time aim be much better for second shot while not touching cannon knocked over two men standing near who dropped down quickly over brow of hill egad wish two have be leader said justinian cheerfully scamp be there here return fire time ball struck palisade fair in top centre smashed down several of cross beam sharp shooter seeing gave cry of triumph be echoed by on hill gunner rapidly loaded again so a to follow up advantage gained dick however be already prepared before cannon of enemy must be fired again shot from gun struck on carriage causing to fall out of position besieger set at once to work about restoring to former level by time gurt also have directed gun towards battery shot after shot from two cannon followed so rapidly that in short time enemy have to vacate position wish must make dash spike gun said maurice a melnosians cheered loudly youll hing of sort sir replied justinian sharply dont want to run chance of losing again besides alcibiades be going to make dash for gate old fool said crispin scornfully cant bring men up against gun he going to try at event a evidently think shot have told heavily on defence time there be constant flash flash flash along line of sharp shooter a kept up continuous fire in spite of precaution two melnosians be killed under cover of musketry be apparent that alcibiades be about to make dash having learned lesson from previous advance led men along right side close under cliff where cannon must not reach justinian saw manuvre rapidly serving out fresh ammunition told men to be in readiness round right corner of battery came furious crowd headed by huge negro for alcibiades have liking for heading forlorn hope attack be received by garrison with volley from musket in spite of many dropping off dead wounded besieger still continued to struggle fiercely up outward beam in order to reach upper gap made by cannon sharp shooter have of course to cease fire lest must hit comrade seeing that have swarmed up nearly to top of barrier ran forward to help melnosians in two line one kneeling other standing at back fired continuously at writhing mass while behind gabions stabbed with bayonet cutlas with right good will both cannon be discharged cutting two lane of blood through furious throng yet notwithstanding loss stormers still stuck to intention became evident that nothing now remained to garrison to beat back in hand to hand fight one pirate leaped from parapet through gap be speedily despatched by bayonet thrust in chest others however followed like flock of sheep there be little doubt that melnosians must have be driven back have not be so expert in use of bayonet justinian old army man have taught exercise splendidly raising bayonet first high then back over right shoulder weapon told in thrust so be thus enabled to keep foe at bay while top of barrier be thus being assaulted number of men under caliphronas be hacking away at lower beam for unwilling to harm men alcibiades refrained from setting fire to palisade a have done before weight of stormers on top made now weakened lower portion rock ominously be evident whole structure must soon be in ruin when happened danger must be imminent a justinian knew that enemy far exceeded in number own little band even with advantage of narrow gorge be doubtful if must hold ground giving way however meant that side path must be left to alcibiades however bravely defended must be certain to be captured at once besides dared not leave gun in possession of enemy a must at once use with deadly effect against own men rendered reckless by despair melnosians fought like demon against enemy though alcibiades hurled body after body of men against stood ground did not give way one inch at moment however barrier might fall justinian lost time in rendering gun innocuous if be forced to retreat up gorge dick gurt spike gun spike gun roared in english greek not understanding language did not guess how important be order caliphronas however heard on other side of barrier made immediate report to alcibiades who grasped idea at once make for gun capture gun yelled in greek will spike body of men leaped down from parapet made for gun held by dick maurice sprang in front of while bosn be busy putting in spike kept enemy at bay soon emptied revolver thus have to fight solely with sword demarch seeing danger re enforced with four melnosians who speedily beat back assailant however dick task be accomplished gurt having also obeyed order gun be now spiked perfectly useless must enemy gain possession of only danger remaining be side path in spite of iron door might be forced so demarch men stanchly held ground in spite of havoc be being made in rank by overwhelming force of enemy fighting fiercely with obstinate determination not to give way one inch slowly surely melnosians drove back stormers to barrier clambering up over heap of slain in effort to force enemy to vacate position air be blinding with gunpowder smoke clash of sword fierce shout of besieger cheer of melnosians created most infernal din high above be heard crash of palisade a yielding to ax of enemy fell outward many be unable to retreat in time owing to crush behindfor alcibiades have long ago given up attempt to keep orderand in fall great number be crushed to death while comrade not heeding death agony rushed forward across platform thus formed in order to follow up advantage a speedily a possible at critical juncture justinian bethought of stratagem of scaring enemy by fictitious force hastily bade temistocles to run to acropolis tell woman to come down gorge with drum beating color flying there be plenty of kettledrum flag at acropolis justinian have not cared to use so used by woman advancing down pas might inspire enemy with fear that re enforcement have arrived only proviso that justinian made be that woman on arrival must keep out of musket shot not risk life temistocles sped away like deer justinian hastily advanced to front in order to assist maurice crispin who be fighting with desperation of despair melnosians two deep extending right across gorge being at close quarter be using bayonet for stabbing clubbed musket for dealing blow sailor be almost in ring round maurice crispin slashing away vigorously with cutlass cutting principally at face neck of assailant so a not to transfix blade in body thus render defenceless maurice whose stature gave considerable advantage over opponent be sweeping sword a rapidly a possible among enemy cutting thrusting slashing stabbing be much encumbered by one of wounded enemy who be clutching leg thus impeding movement justinian saw firing at wretch knocked brain out while maurice thus freed sprang resolutely forward followed by sailor in order to get at alcibiades who be urging on men to attack from vantage ground of fallen palisade justinian crispin thus left alone in front of line fought vigorously to keep back enemy while old demarch seeing nephew aim shouted out word of encouragement cut off head body will follow cried in english then rapidly added in greek close up men close up give chance of getting to rear in obedience to command a soon a man in front rank fell stepped in from rear to fill up gap else foremost soldier closed up shoulder to shoulder so a to preserve unbroken front by mean kept enemy in front notwithstanding fierceness of fight held ground stanchly waiting signal to advance between fallen palisade be furious crowd heaving like stormy sea at back alcibiades giving order however be not heeded justinian be waiting until maurice killed alcibiades when determined to advance with force thus drive disheartened enemy over verge of barrier be with difficulty that maurice managed to fight way through crowd protected in rear by dick sailor at length managed to get clear leaping on parapet confronted alcibiades bare headed waving sword with stern resolve to kill pirate alcibiades be coward have kept in background a deemed life too valuable to risk a indeed be for lacking head invading army must be worse than useless face to face with englishman however did not shirk combat whirling sword with fierce cry dashed boldly at enemy must not call upon follower to aid a sailor with cutlass kept clear ring for combat so saw plainly be duel to death one upon depended whole issue of battle not having reach of arm stature of englishman found at considerable disadvantage nevertheless fought on bravely adopting stabbing tactic more than slashing tried best to give opponent mortal wound maurice however having quick eye be enabled to ward off blow by dexterous use of now emptied revolver made rapid play with sword firmly grasped in right hand pirate captain managed to wound in left arm just below elbow at moment maurice passed sword through chest alcibiades though not fatally wounded gasped out christos fell back over palisade into outward mass of men who must have carried off justinian hearing distant roll of drum seeing that maurice be alone on parapet gave order to advance on observing uncle action maurice cried out in greek alcibiades be dead whereupon intervening enemy be filled with alarm began to retreat before advancing melnosians dick sailor maurice leaped down to take alcibiades prisoner while busily engaged in fighting whole inward crowd driven forward came rolling pell mell over fallen barrier carrying who must have fain stayed with maurice have enough to do to keep foot against torrent managed to divide into two stream with use of sword aid of sailor in moment justinian crispin be by side down slope fled foe in headlong confusion with melnosians in full chase keep together men keep together yelled demarch a raced down slope like school boy melnosians have be too long held back to pay attention to order right left fled enemy making for boat gurt seeing tried to intercept with few sailor unfortunately must not run owing to wound so have to abandon pursuit foremost fugitive managed to get afloat justinian have forbidden useless killing islander frenzied at loss of comrade elated by victory be quite beyond control who must not reach boat be slaughtered on spot demarch in despair of saving life of must hing stand on beach with maurice crispin beside goodly number of fugitive however be now pulling for open sea among caliphronas who standing up in boat shook two hand with despair on beholding rout in short space of time what with fierceness of melnosians who gave quarter flight of fugitive there remained not single enemy on island except wounded men who have be unable to fly there be roll of many drum shrill cry of delight turning face landward three men saw helena with company of woman standing on ruin of palisade setting sun illumined group grasping staff whence floated victorious fold of union jack seemed to be goddess of victory come down to sanctify with presence triumph of melnosians woman behind blackened ruin of barrier beneath foot englishman below on beach lifted up staff proudly great flag flung out mighty fold to breeze a if too rejoiced in triumph of success three englishman heart thrilled with patriotic pride a saw symbol of victory flaunting in wind british sailor uncovering head saluted invincible flag with three ringing cheer chapter xxxv council of war snake be scotched be not dead beware snare soon will lift again head beware dare fang contain poison still wounded creature yet may kill beware take care with cautious speech good council take beware snare trust seeming lifeless snake beware dare for unexpected may spring slay thee with venomed sting beware take care immediate danger be over justinian be by mean inclined to think that even with death of alcibiades island must be left in peace particularly a caliphronas be still alive that foiled greek must tamely submit to be beaten thus be out of question demarch be quite certain that must again gather army to assault melnos if such event took place matter must become very serious a notwithstanding loss be le than of enemy scarcely fifty melnosians survived many of be severely hurt four sailor have also be killed so total of able men left to defend island making allowance for incapable through wound amounted to scarcely forty soul thereabouts even with carnage have ensued during battle justinian felt sure that nearly hundred men have escaped in boat a caliphronas must know that garrison be considerably weakened by loss of men demarch feared lest must return almost immediately with added number risk battle in case seemed impossible for melnosians escaping total extermination belief be confirmed in strange way on return to palisade for alcibiades be found under heap of corps apparently lifeless though for short time be revived with brandy have died immediately afterwards assuring justinian that re enforcement be on way to avenge death whether be mere bravado not justinian be not quite sure yet in spite of intimate knowledge of dead smuggler rascality hardly thought even such scamp must die with deliberate falsehood on lip therefore at once hastened to rebuild barrier in case of invasion by possible foe of woman went back to village for provision while others remained behind to look after wounded there be time to bury dead present safety being great question of hour so body of friend foe be laid gently down on beach under cliff to be buried a soon a possible when danger be past gorge thus being cleared of slain justinian made men sit down to refresh with wine food after wearied a be hand went bravely forward to rebuild barrier even woman helped in important task by time be ten oclock in evening goodly portion of desired barricade be erected a soon a heard about approaching re enforcement from dying alcibiades demarch foresaw that to be prepared for such emergency a fresh attack men must have to work night therefore desired alexandros to bring down electric light so a to permit toil to be carried on continuously until battery be finished be easily done by electrician joining other wire on to already at head of pas then fixing apparatus near outer entrance so speedily did perform difficult task that in few hour be in order powerful ray flooded not only immediate neighborhood of work even beach portion of harbor inside breakwater helena have obstinately refused to go back to acropolis a other woman remained to help father did not insist on return so attended to maurices wound after be mere scratch in common with rest also took turn at nursing aided to carry wounded into interior of island for so busy be men at repairing of barrier that none must be spared so woman proving thorough heroine took hospital work on shoulder wonder in scheme did not include doctor uncle said maurice a stood by demarch superintending rebuilding of palisade medical man must have come in handy now be true have crispin not left a did must have sent to study medicine a be put off affair from time to time now when most need one find without surgeon must never have be surgeon justinian said crispin with shudder cutting up people make feel quite ill cut up good many to day without being much disturbed said demarch with laugh of course know be in hot blood however be use longing for impossible so be to be hoped melnosians will recover without aid of medical science be wound hurting maurice asked helena who though tender hearted a rule seemed on occasion to think solely of lover despite fact that so many men have be killed pooh not bita mere scratch youve got to thank amber heart for safety golden hair retorted smiling in faith helena fancy good luck have have most to do with safety dont undervalue fighting power maurice said demarch who overheard remark tussle with alcibiades be light one well certainly got better of wound be only trifle have not tumbled over parapet fight must have lasted much longer a be poor devil be really trampled to death during retreat of enemy still if like will put down to amber heart what amber heart be talking about asked justinian inquiringly ah be secret between helena said maurice with meaning look at blushing girla very charming secret indeed well gurt how do find sailor who have be working outside palisade gave trouser hitch pulled forelock im a right a trivet sir hop little with there dig got yesterday lor bless sir taint nothin if may make so bold mr justinian want to speak sir what be gurt growin tired of bricklayin sir go down bit for breath of air there sir a im sinner hears dip of oar boat coming cried demarch maurice in one breath yes sir jest came up like shot turn on light sir t th north if dont see lubber comin back im dutchman maurice ran off to tell alexandros who at once sent white glare across sea there pulling straight for breakwater saw long string of boat men therein guessed by sudden flash of light that be discovered gave yell of anger for have hoped to pull in under cover of darkness take melnosians by surprise thanks however to gurts quick ear serviceable electric light little scheme be frustrated at nearly moment of fulfilment ten boat cried justinian counting rapidly push on work men here of take up gun what about cannon dick right now sir said sailor saluting got spike out see if can knock few of boat to splinter helena woman go back to acropolis oh father let remain here see woman be helping to build wall well well need hand for god sake child keep in place of safety do think will attack to night asked crispin who have raced full speed down gorge be out of breath in first place have have good thrashing to day in second caliphronas be too much of coward to lead on until have recovered nerve theyve got re enforcement however expect flying met new men coming persuaded to come back be that gun ready dick in minute sir just turn light on water so a can train gun alexandros did so dick carefully sighted piece so a to allow for way boat be making through water evidently unaware of danger instead of keeping widely apart thus neutralizing chance of shot hitting made for beach in dense bunch electric light showed position a clearly a if be day round shot went with roar right into conglomerate mass doing considerable damage advancing greek yelled with fear seeing only chance of safety be to get under level of gun pulled in like madman to beach then by white radiance of light be seen that two boat have be sunk many of occupant killed survivor fish in water like insular greek be swimming rapidly to land caliphronas foolish though be in military matter yet knew sufficient of formation of ground nature of cannon to be aware that be impossible muzzle of gun must be depressed sufficiently to do damage to men on beach therefore feeling comparatively safe newly landed pirate hastened to put up tent evidently intending to rest night continue assault in morning knowing that little garrison must be worn out with long fight during day did not trouble in way to guard against attack not even placing sentry at outpost a movement be revealed by glare of search light justinian noted fact regretted bitterly that have not sufficient force at command to sally forth against ill guarded camp egad maurice said in vexation with fifty men at back must sweep off island before dawn rascal evidently know how weak be in number else must not be so careless of camp how be work going on nearly finished sir reported dick who be overseer wont get over wall in hurry ill bet transfer command to one of men come here wish to hold council of war dick saluted having instructed one of messmate to attend to final detail of parapet came forward a justinian desired helena in company with of woman have gone up gorge in order to attend to wounded so five men for gurt be also included in council sat down on grass little distance away from worker began to discus situation in low tone sentry have be posted at barrier electric light be full on camp of enemy so in event of movement being made for assault be not likely justinian knew must be informed at once after with barrier heavy gun musket must hope to hold pas for time in end be doubtful if must not have to give in catastrophe must mean death to soul on island can see for yourselves gentleman that danger be very grave said demarch anxiously be only forty in number with re enforcement enemy must be at least one hundred fifty took time to beat off to day when be stronger not fatigued to morrow with such small force worn out with fighting want of sleep dread worst there be one thing in favor observed maurice in satisfied tone bad leader a alcibiades be have more pluck than caliphronas a be general now will not inspire men with confidence however brave follower be unless leader be equally so valor be not of much use a lack discipline trust in general there one thing sir remarked dick addressing justinianthere be one thing id like to say greek have bare foot so think ud be good plan to strew front of palisade with broken glass must cut up bit thats good idea dick then when be in confusion can do damage with cannon by way what about gun must have brought that in pity didnt sir aint much good to for ive spiked proper youve got dynamite justinian have not said crispin who have be thinking yes plenty then why not make mine on slope of hill blow up with electricity when enemy be coming up egad ill do at once dynamite can be brought down in about hour wont take long to dig trench lay wire so ought to have whole thing ready by time assault battery at dawn dick take temistocles other men up to magazine dick went off to obey order with alacrity justinian whose spirit be rising at feasibility of scheme to conquer enemy went on talking hopefully of future what with cannon dynamite broken bottle to cut bare foot fancy scoundrel will get warm reception ah if only have full strength of melnosians again must soon drive scoundrel back to ocean if smash up to morrow with dynamite wont come again uncle trust not alcibiades seems to have made extensive preparation in way of re enforcement for know fresh batch may arrive to morrow while at assault number diminish if only must get more men fear be impossible not so impossible a think said crispin deliberately suppose go to syra get eparch there to send re enforcement true he friend of mine if did not send regular soldier must at least let have men of same fighting power a scoundrel how be to get to syra how be going to bring troop back a to bringing back by time yacht must be there so must not take long for to steam here with good number of men well cant go be beleaguered enemy be asleep so if gurt here who know water thoroughly will come with think must steal down to breakwater obtain one of boat good breeze be blowing so if put up sail must soon cut across course of one of cretan steamer sail to syra from khanea in case must take little time to reach yacht once at syra must get a many men a possible come back at once be wild scheme not impossible said justinian thoughtfully youd have to sail about thirty mile then there be chance of getting picked up by steamer with ere breeze sir remarked gurt who be not averse to adventure guess wed get in track of one of cretan in about twelve hour more le once in line there lot of em plying to fro so chance be wed soon be picked up im game for if mr crispin be sir be not too tired be not said poet stretching besides anything be better than suspense only thing im afraid of be gurts wound dont be afeared o sir replied gurt bluntly ive lost blood taint nothin aint babby to squake fur nothin if kin git boat im ready to start minit what do say maurice roylands have be listening to proposition not without certain amount of approval be however mingled with feeling that scheme be somewhat foolhardy hardly know what to say observed at length there be one thing certain if wish to hold island must have more men a far a can see crispin scheme be only way of getting mere sight of yacht filled with troop must frighten life out of scoundrel cause to clear out difficulty be how to get boat without being seen by enemy think can manage said justinian indicating point with finger for of course with electric light there be difficulty in following action see camp of enemy be here to right of harbor noticed that several of larger boat be tied to breakwater so if crispin gurt get down there walk along breakwater can loosen one of boat tow outward to mouth of harbor there can get in row off to west without chance of dip of oar being heard by enemy be very well uncle how be to get down to beach doubt enemy be asleep a know have not posted sentry still if crispin go out by palisade might be seen in spite of precaution caliphronas be sure to be on alert expect caliphronas be too weary with day work to keep awake replied demarch dryly be not man to deny rest let consequence be what may however if dont object to little danger crispin think can get out by way in case there be danger so little more make difference then will go up to point above side path from there know cliff slope down sheer two hundred foot can let gurt down there by rope can steal along in darkness down to breakwater once there rest will be easy risk certainly whole enterprise be risky will keep electric light full on camp so while can see movement of enemy can see nothing of in darkness to tell truth however have belief that can hing that be sound asleep so dont think will run much risk well what do say ill do so will sir good will trust to providence for rest let see crispin be now past midnight so if can catch one of steamer before to morrow night will be in syra by next day in twenty four hour have doubt eparch will give plenty of men will not take very long time for steamer to reach here altogether if go well ought to be back in four five day question be can hold island till then must said maurice decisively if worst come to worst can blast overhanging rock yonder with dynamite thus close up pas entirely true will shut up a in prison still will be safe until aid arrives for once gorge be closed up enemy can possibly get into interior without almost superhuman exertion must hope for best answered justinian rising to foot well crispin thank for offer will accept when will start at once there be nothing to be gained by waiting will take enough of provision to last for three day in case miss steamer for rest trust to providence there be good deal of trusting in providence about whole scheme said justinian with sigh may run gantlet to breakwater successfully may get safely off in boat without being seen by enemy may be picked up by cretan steamer may find yacht lying at syra chance boy really think must be better for to adopt maurices plan in closing up pas so a enemy cant possibly get in cant possibly get out replied crispin significantly be too dangerous remember conversation other day about volcano if blow up pas mean of exit will be cut off must crater burst out one of must be left alive then go god speed cried demarch who saw plainly that be case of scylla charybdis maurice have not heard conversation about volcano much to uncle satisfaction having gone forward to meet dick who have just come back from magazine with dynamite bosn expressed great satisfaction when heard of proposed scheme must dearly have liked to go in place of gurt only knew justinian must not spare however be well aware that crispin must not have better companion than gurt for old sailor be well acquainted with course must have to take towards west moreover having have something to do with line of steamer between khanea syra knew better than one a to possibility of being picked up by one of without loss of time scheme be put into working order at once sufficiency of provision be made ready for adventurer crispin filled brandy flask took revolver in case might be stopped on beach by enemy gurt took heavy woollen cloak to protect from chill sea breeze be agreed that justinian maurice only must go up with rope to let down companion to beach below a be necessary for dick to remain in order to attend to dynamite mine nothing be told to melnosians about proposed scheme lest seeing how desperate affair be must lose heart beyond four leader gurt helena one be in ignorance of daring attempt about to be made after helena who be deeply affected by crispin bravery have said good by to gurt went back to acropolis with number of woman to obtain rest having arranged with father to come down at early morning with plenty of broken glass in order to protect front of palisade dick men be already hard at work just on brow of slope about one hundred yard away digging mine for dynamite so all thing going on thus fairly well there being sign of movement in camp of enemy demarch with nephew two adventurer unlocked iron gate in order to ascend to top of cliff from whence crispin gurt be to be lowered to beach below chapter xxxvi forlorn hope night be dark cliff be high moon illumes cloudy sky below mark fearful gloom in night hide sombrely way of flight to slender rope cling with dread hanging there a by thread with fearful hope downward fare till on strand in safety for time land fortunately for success of enterprise sky be cloudy so that moon thickly veiled by vapor be unable to betray adventurer by tell tale light strong breeze be blowing seaward from land ruffling surface of black water to ragged cap of white promised anything pleasant journey to crispin companion be warmly clothed in thick garment of blue dyed wool consisting of tight fitting jacket loose trouser tucked into high boot of untanned leather in belt crispin carried dagger revolver while gurts cutlas dangled by side men also wore red fisherman cap common to gean with ample woollen capote to protect from keen wind standing on height of lofty cliff must not see beach for profound gloom below to left saw camp of enemy clearly defined in fierce ray of electric light everything there seemed to be a still a grave pirate be evidently sound asleep under canvas for not sound broke stillness save whistle of breeze sullen rolling of wave on sand below maurice poet have brought up two coil of strong rope over hundred foot in length so a cliff measured two hundred there must be difficulty about rope being too short tied firmly together then making one end fast to strong pine tree grew distance back from verge flung other into abyss below rope paid out rapidly until when only few coil be left ceased running showed that have touched bottom now two adventurer prepared to descend shook hand with demarch nephew of whom be much affected none of four knew if must meet again for two be bound on perilous voyage others be beleaguered in dangerous volcanic island by bloodthirsty enemy if reached boat safely managed to push off into open sea unseen by enemy be to send up rocket a signal of success to watcher on land gurt carried useful article be first to descend slender rope to clung like spider to thread dropped swiftly down until thickening gloom hid from anxious eye after time rope slacked gentle vibration stealing up showed that gurt have landed safely good by dear lad said justinian a embraced brave poet be sure have everything revolver cartridge cloak satchel filled with food letter to eparch yes think be gurt have water bottle rocket good by maurice good by old fellow replied maurice then grasped others hand in token of farewell with stolid composure with englishman in trying circumstance conceal emotion take care of for sake of eunice certainly will for yours also if go well will see white wing of eunice off coast in few day dont surrender island before then not much retorted maurice grimly ill blow up rock in pas first if enemy want to get in will have to fly over barrier good by once more boy over go crispin even at supreme moment of parting must not restrain merry laugh at friend coolness laying down on brow of cliff grasped rope prepared to descend a soon a gurt below felt from quiver that master be fairly on way down pulled rope taut with strength so a to render descent easier look out for rocket cried crispin a dropped slowly downward into blackness keep light turned on camp so that can see what wretch be up to right shouted maurice who lying flat on stomach be peering over good by faint farewell floated up through intense gloom a crispin with hand tightly grasping rope leg twisted round went sliding down like spider on self spun thread thanks to gurt who be holding out cord widely from rugged face of cliff found difficulty in descending soon landed safely beside sailor on damp sand shaking rope vigorously a sign to on top that be now on terra firma walked carefully forward in darkness towards land end of breakwater gradually eye now relieved from dazzle of electric light became accustomed to gloom must see to extent good distance ahead stealing along silently boot made sound in dead sand arrived without mischance at rocky wall of harbor against several boat be floating tied to iron ring welded into masonry rejecting first three four be too cumbersome for two people to manage selected small light caique with mast sail oar lay nearest to sea gurt pulled in easily by painter then bade crispin get into so a to keep off from wall a be towed along a sailor be more powerful of two crispin obeyed without hesitation with aid of oar kept craft out from masonry while gurt with rope over shoulder bent form pulled with difficulty towards entrance time thing have gone smoothly with for electric light kept up steady glare on camp of sleeping enemy must see movement to lead to suspect that pirate be aware of daring attempt at end of breakwater placed provision water bottle cloak in boat after making fast boat to iron ring proceeded to let off rocket in token of success crispin placed in position applied match then hastily got into boat with gurt pushed off to sea just a be few yard from shore rocket flashed skyward with sharp whizz scattering train of spark in ascent alarmed by unexpected sound pirate rushed out of tent to ascertain cause rocket having expended fire have fallen back into water so must see nothing to account for explosion after rowing out little way gurt shipped oar with assistance of crispin hoisted sail bellied out with groan to wind made glide rapidly forward then sailor took helm crispin wrapped in cloak laid down to sleep for few hour little craft sped away lightly over white crested wave into profound darkness when be out considerable distance electric light suddenly flashed out long ray into sea in token of farewell then reverted to original position boat with two brave occupant be swallowed up in night on cliff left behind waited watched until welcome rocket shot long trail of golden fire through darkness then simultaneously heaved sigh of relief well be safe so far said demarch thankfully by jupiter maurice rascal have heard rocket go oh theyve seen nothing replied nephew indifferently a few men who have rushed out retired again to tent fire died out before caught even glimpse of im glad crispin be safely away boat will be flying like stormy petrel before stiff breeze let go down uncle send farewell flash of light might reveal boat to scamp said justinian a rapidly descended narrow staircase oh theyve gone inside again besides crispin have got too much of start by time ill go see alexandros accordingly did light after flashing for second on flying boat be again turned on camp after maurice uncle went to see how dick dynamite mine be getting on without doubt amateur sapper have be working hard for trench be dug dynamite cartridge placed therein hole filled up wire attached to cartridge ran underground through palisade to interior of battery none of enemy must have suspected that whole of broad space in front be one deadly mine when exploded must blow to piece by dozen there sir said dick wiping heated brow now when miss helena brings broken bottle well smash em up on ground between mine palisade so if of beggar escape being cut to piece blown to atom itll be miracle splendid dick answered justinian clapping on shoulder now lad have better go have sleep dye think ull be safe sir quite safe scamp be sound asleep will not attack before dawn barrier be built up a strongly a can do cannon be right what with mine broken glass think theyll find pretty hard to get even a far a did to day be mr crispin right sir yes got safely into boat sent up rocket to tell of success by time be on way to syra for help saw rocket sir so guessed ud be right dye think sir well hold out till brings yacht here of course will said maurice who have joined pair defence here even with small number be quite strong enough to stand one storming if of get foot cut to piece by glass others blown up sky high by mine wouldnt be surprised if gave up attempt sailed away suppose dont sir questioned dick dubiously then richard have plan for closing up pas how sir see overhanging rock up there well a be just over entrance of pas to morrow so soon a have beaten back wretch well go up bore hole along narrowest part for dynamite cartridge then well attach wire a in mine if find that cant stand against second assault have to do be to inveigle friend under rock explode charge then richardoh what time will have that ull shut up in island sir well what of pleasant place to dwell in neednt be afraid dick easier to get out than get in when yacht arrives well not have much difficulty in getting on board leave melnos sir said justinian angrily ive doubt if be forced to fill up pas scoundrel will leave if dont arrival of yacht with fresh troop will drive away then well go to work to open up pas tunnel not enough men mr justinian ah poor melnosians well well have to get more settler thats difficulty be not in getting men woman in getting pure blooded greek dick did not understand latter remark so wisely left unanswered touching cap went off with messmate to snatch few hour sleep before grand assault anticipated must take place at dawn justinian nephew made inspection of defence saw that sentry be posted then went to talk to alexandros about small battery be rigging up for purpose of exploding mine when necessary there will be difficulty about affair alexandros kyrion have attached wire leading to cartridge to battery will have under charge to morrow behind rock will protect from fire of enemy wave hand a signal touch button when mine will explode in second excellent said justinian with great satisfaction if wanted to close up pas by bringing down rock above in same way kyrion make hole above for cartridge attach wire of length with battery at one end of wire dynamite at other must blow up whole of gorge from acropolis can trust man in charge of engine yes kyrion be have to do for dynamo work by without being present seems going smoothly said demarch to maurice a turned away that mine ought to do considerable damage im certain will uncle must be quite worn out for want of rest so go to sleep will watch will sleep later on meanwhile be going up to acropolis to tell helena that crispin gurt have left island safely will be very anxious give kiss for cried maurice a uncle walked away up pas be afraid will be horribly damaged on transit replied demarch smiling good by lad keep sharp look out if anything go wrong send temistocles to acropolis will be back in hour went away slowly for in spite of iron spirit determination to keep up incessant fatigue be beginning to tell on frame at seventy five one can not play with constitution hardened a be body of justinian by temperate living constant exercise yet felt that be not man be thing worried mentally thus acted on physically be thought of volcano for in spite of way in reassured crispin felt by mean easy in mind regarding safety of island not until be absolutely forced to must close up pas thus shut up in crater apparently on verge of eruption true if worst came must escape with people over cliff method must take time with volcano spouting fire there must be small chance of one escaping alive full of thought walked leisurely along pondering over matter volcanic matter military for with treacherous crater on one side cruel enemy on other must not see that matter be approaching crisis even if volcano remained quiescent enemy be beaten back still thing be in anything satisfactory position for have lost many of men knew how difficult must be to supply place with greek of old hellenic stock who be dead have be trained up under eye knew aim aspiration be already developing greatly now be at end have be cut off by death even if got new blood must mean that whole task of training up new generation must have to begin over again justinian be man of great self control when thought of have lost in darkness of night gave free vent to emotion wept bitterly at

seven englishman fight under fold well guess mr roylands dozen englishman be worth fifty greek cried dick with great confidence once get union jack up id like to see whod pull down be early morning be talking about flag helena have brought down on previous day a bulk of army consisted of melnosians who did not understand sacred feeling with be regarded by english maurice thought hardly worth while to plant on palisade demarch in spite of independent sovereignty be patriotic to core of brave old heart with touch of sentiment insisted that attack must be repelled under unconquered banner maurice therefore humored uncle agreed to wish so five sailor planted stout pole just inside barricade in few minute flag of england be floating proudly at mouth of gorge a yet enemy have made move so justinian have plenty of time to complete defensive preparation in spite of father veto helena mindful of maurices instruction regarding broken glass have come down at dawn with woman bearing bottle crockery earthen jar be speedily smashed to atom strewn plentifully on ground between mine barrier alexandros have battery in good working order have ensconced behind rock little distance away from on being signalled to by demarch must explode mine at proper time melnosians have managed to snatch few hour sleep encouraged by victory of previous day be ready for fight so sense of great hopefulness be diffused among valiant little garrison what with mine to blow up enemy broken glass to cut bare feetno ineffective defencethe gun ready loaded to sweep down a swarmed up stern determination of defender to fight to bitter end justinian felt that in spite of being outnumbered must be able to hold island until return of crispin with re enforcement more perilous became position higher arose spirit of defender especially of sailor on whose patriotic feeling presence of country flag have wonderfully inspiring effect now then helena said father when preparation be complete have better return to acropolis with woman very well father will be very anxious for safety what about asked maurice reproachfully oh youve got talisman replied with attempt at lightness so will be quite safe be not so sure about father dont trouble head about said demarch kissing if die die if live liveits fortune of war best thing can do helena be to go down to valley attend to poor fellow who be wounded know will be very anxious dear so will send temistocles to now then with information a to how fight be getting on now good by dear child keep up spirit will walk up with to head of pas said maurice turning away from palisade there be sign of enemy getting under arm yet so can easily spare few minute helena of course be delighted at thus having lover to herself for even quarter of hour walked beside up gorge followed by woman who have taken affectionate farewell of son husband brother zoe also be weeping bitterly a have just parted from dick dreaded lest must never see again indeed despite danger men at front be le to be pitied than woman remaining behind in interior of island for while former be at least too occupied to fret over trouble latter with nothing to take mind off disaster surrounding be in state of suspense pitiable to behold do think crispin will come back within week maurice asked helena a walked arm in arm with lover hope so if be picked up by cretan steamer yacht be now lying at syra have doubt will be merest chance however come what may think can defend island to end be not of danger without of danger within be thinking why what do mean volcanobegan helena upon maurice interrupted with merry laugh of scorn dear one fright with false fire suppose be thinking of earthquake yes of lake spring what be matter with spring be spouting furiously lake have disappeared great heaven doe sound ominous said maurice anxiously doe father know of course doe told not to speak of lest people must become panic stricken of course such prohibition doe not extend to lake gone spring active repeated roylands in musing tone be afraid there be danger of volcano breaking out again so think father laugh at fear must be terrible catastrophe must such thing happen for not one of must hope to escape besides if melnos became active volcano father forty year of hard work must go for nothing do think be likely eruption will take place maurice asked helena in tremulous voice have idea how afraid be egad be enough to make one afraid however think can set mind at rest helena eruption if there be to be one can not possibly take place for week by time crispin yacht will have arrived so if there be sign of outbreak can escape at once oh hope so trust so what doe worry pursued maurice meditatively be war going on for what may turn out to be nothing heap of cinder must be very irony of fate if after beating back foe volcano must start drive away from very place have defended if such thing happened think father must survive must be blow certainly replied roylands affecting cheerfulness be far from feeling one can hing against giant force of nature however helena remember wealth of melnos be safe in london thanks to wisdom of uncle so if hephaistos did start forge here seems inclined to do must simply have to abandon island start scheme of new hellas on time must select one le dangerous from volcanic point of view think of forty year work thrown away think of leaving paradise however if archangel wave flaming sword must still if go eve will be with will comfort greatly ah dear dear mauriceoh what be that roll of drum cried roylands stopping abruptly enemy must have begun attack so will have to return to post good by dearest dont trouble remember have amber heart real heart also well leave mine with for safety so cant be shot through heart can jove there drum again give kiss there good by dear one down gorge tore at full speed for already heard sharp crack of musket shot helena remaining where be sank on knee example be followed by woman whole company with uplifted hand implored protection of heaven for dear one at front maurice arrived at barrier just in time for enemy be already scrambling up slope justinian catching sight of nephew shouted out to to redouble speed quick quick maurice confound sir theyll be on in few minute well will be just time for to recover breath said young man good humoredly in order uncle yes well meet with rifle shot first give chance of cutting foot to piece if let get so near will assault barrier what after crossing broken bottle barefooted dont believe lad will be jumping about like cat on hot brick shortly melnosians be in high state of glee over snare for enemy be so simple yet dangerous yelled with laughter a foremost stormers dashed with bare foot right into centre of sharp point of course vigor with rushed forward rendered glass more effective after receiving with volley of musket shot garrison paused to roar with laughter at sight of bare legged islander hopping in agony over broken point be be not dignified be not particularly dangerous must hardly be called legitimate war yet by simple mean first rush be effectually checked streaming with blood enraged stormers retired leaving few of dead who have be killed wounded by volley lying on field information concerning stratagem soon passed from mouth to mouth of enemy who be not yet climbing up hill dashed back to tent from whence after time emerged wearing tough leathern sandal with hair still on bound round foot by strong thong who have be wounded in novel manner have regardless of safety sat down within rifle range to tie up bleeding foot justinian with more generosity than must have displayed in like circumstance refrained from firing on thus defenceless caliphronas who since death of alcibiades now held supreme command of irregular army saw forbearance sneering at justinian for soft hearted fool with for exceptional courage led of men who be booted across dangerous ground apparently have quite forgotten how alcibiades have carried forward stormers previous day under shelter of cliff for advancing thus in compact body full in front of palisade be exposed to raking fire from musket of garrison lion led by deer be not dangerous quoth justinian grimly on seeing bad generalship dont think well have bad time of a did yesterday certainly not while caliphronas be general of enemy replied maurice laughing have courage see for lead stormers ill soon frighten back sir said dick who hated caliphronas for treachery on night of wreck will fire wait minute till be more conglomerate now gun roared shower of grape shot splashed over advancing body did considerable damage in rank be if such disorderly huddling must be dignified by such name still continued to come on however on noting justinian who in default of gurt have charge of other gun sent shower of grape among wavered for moment a leader still urged to come on maurice snatched rifle from man nearest aimed deliberately at caliphronas not with intention of killing merely forcing to retire wounded ball struck caliphronas on elbow of sword arm with yell of pain dropped weapon ran away followed a matter of course by soldier at rate maurice can hold island for year said demarch with jeering laugh child play compared with yesterday if can get on mine explode in good time siege will be over replied nephew decisively be averse to useless massacre so be if dont put fear of god into soul will wear out by puny attack one bold stroke will fly well do what will have confidence in generalship enemy again charged up hill time caliphronas be conspicuous by absence a be evidently in camp attending to wound huge man in albanian dress be leading time have at least virtue of brute courage for in spite of musket shot double discharge of cannon killed many still advanced with men right up to palisade hand to hand again said dick a melnosians began to use bayonet wont get over barricade time a barrier be now built of nothing turf overlaid with sank bag gabions besieger found ax of use be reduced to try to swarm up to top of parapet in overwhelming number garrison however shot freely into struggling mass in doing have to expose greatly in consequence lost many men still managed to drive back besieger two cannon belched forth grape shot alternately so at enemy be forced to retreat over brow of hill thus relieved from immediate danger melnosians busied with dead wounded carrying to rear so fighting might not be hampered by cumbering of ground with body in front of barrier ground right over brow of hill be thick with fallen of enemy of wounded be trying to crawl to place of safety while others lifting up hand cried out on christos in remarkably short space of time pirate re formed into something like order still led by albanian came once more to point of attack time however instead of assaulting barricade lay down on crest of hill began to pick off garrison with rifle while now then small body must make sally forward only to be beaten back with bayonet cutlas quite unaware of danger be in whole of firing party be camped right on top of mine justinian wishing to end desultory warfare waited until be pretty well massed before giving signal to explode twice raised hand to give sign twice dropped again from sentiment of regret for scum though besieger be yet seemed terrible thing to hurl into fragment fifty sixty men who be so calmly seated over mine still be case of necessity for garrison worn out with incessant fighting be not fit to stand assault such a have taken place day before if pirate captured island living person must be ruthlessly put to death justinian be not uselessly cruel man must fain have be spared necessity of wholesale massacre when thought of child defenceless woman who must be left to mercy of savage in case of capture feeling of pity died in breast so when enemy be massed in great number above mine gave signal alexandros at once sent electric spark along buried wire ground in front of barrier heaved like convulsed serpent in concussion followed roar of explosion one of garrison be thrown to ground when arose to foot sight met eye be frightful for ground be strewn with fragment of human body leg arm trunk head lying about in ghastly confusion sky seemed to have rained blood for garment be splashed with crimson fluid whole space of ground on crest of hill be rent riven into huge hole of human being resting there few minute before hardly one be left alive down hill fled frightened survivor yelling out that earthquake have taken place still in camp caught alarm ran for boat so in few minute harbor be dotted with craft pulling hard for entrance not one pirate save who be wounded remained on beach for frightful catastrophe ascribed to natural cause have completely routed whole host have stormed palisade so confidently few hour before war be over said maurice who be very pale for shocking sight of body in fragment be enough to make bravest shudder have have lesson wont come back again trust not said justinian who stood sternly under drooping fold of union jack doubt while caliphronas be alive still have gained victory time though be ashamed of having perpetrated wholesale massacre under flag yet necessity know law mercy either if have not beaten by time must have beaten said maurice taking pull at brandy flask for men be about worn out must not have stood assault have lost good few too doubt uncle if out of hundred twenty subject have more than thirty left have indeed be severe struggle replied justinian sadly now thank god be overat least for time a sure a stand there maurice caliphronas will come back with fresh set of blackguard by time crispin re enforcement will have arrived so will soon be able to drive back dick yes sir must repair damage bury dead right sir be about four oclock in afternoon when began task not until nightfall be dead buried decently in willow graf dug in sea shore sand papa athanasius came down with woman from village read service of greek church over remains of friend foe alike so that when moon arose above peak of melnos there be sign of struggle having taken place save in battered barricade rent ground when be completed justinian held consultation with nephew dick a to probability of foe returning soon a if there be possibility of such event happening must be unwise to leave barrier unguarded ultimately be decided to leave sentry on guard with cannon musket loaded alexandros directed search light full on entrance of harbor so that in event of enemy returning must be seen before reaching shore alarm given at once temistocles who be still in good condition a have done fighting be left behind also in order that if attack be made might run to acropolis to alarm justinian arrangement having be made survivor of fierce fighting returned to village in order to take rest so much needed loud be wailing for dead from melnosian woman many of whom be now alone in world night sleeping in acropolis heard sound of bitter sorrow rising from valley below have be tough fight many have be lost much damage have be done still foe have be forced to retreat melnos be still under rule of demarch night leader be gathered round supper table to make first good meal have tasted for day helena zoe waited on for rest of servant be down in village looking after wounded men of looked worn out haggard for strain physical mental have be something terrible even now like justinian maurice dick gifted a be with iron constitution be nearly broken down by terrible experience have undergone poor helena look fit to drop said maurice tenderly drawing down beside rest for time be so afraid danger be now past think of many life have be lost do regret still selfish a may sound remember be safe after be great thing be sure dont know how long will be safe with volcano nonsense helena said father in vexed tone tell there be danger there nothing new have happened that know of island be quite safe if there be chance of outburst will get away in crispin yacht be what be saying to helena morning will abandon new hellas must if hephaistos bid bravest man can hing against burning mountain maurice if be driven from melnos will no longer fight against fate already by death of so many great deal of forty year labor have proved futile so if crowning touch be put to by outbreak of volcano will throw up game return to england yes be old now want rest so have doubt helena will give corner at grange will be great blow to must thing turn out in way still may be too pessimistic may yet be well if may make so bold sir said dick who have be talking in whisper to zoe what may ask be to become of zoe here say if miss helena go to england will go too well will accompany dick said maurice genially have doubt that when be married will be able to give billet at grange buy yacht sir leave to mr crispin so can still take service under make zoe stewardess be looking at black side of thing mountain may remain quiet in case will still stay here carry out justinian scheme of new hellas hear hear cried dick lifting glass beggin pardon sir here to health of mr justinian coupled with name of mr roylands who be hero said justinian bowing thanks for compliment add helena name also for be heroine cried maurice gayly now then uncle dick helena zoe three cheer for noble self be given after quite worn out retired to rest chapter xxxviii prey of god far down valley altar be reared offring power can delay for god never honored yet god ever feared claim prey fire spring from womb of earth will flame on altar of fear song of living laughter mirth none will hear for weeping wailing of hundred afraid roll up neath sting of rod worship be ended sacrifice made to god thing went along very smoothly for next two day a there be sign of pirate returning did volcano hint at near outbreak of fire gradually diminished population settled down to old occupation for justinian in spite of terrible event have lately taken up attention of one judged wisest to prevent disorganization of social system few men surviving returned to work did best by constant industry to make up for lack of number though indeed dismal silence have settled down on rural population once so gay mirthful later on when fear of invasion have passed away justinian intended to make excursion round archipelago in search of new colonist have little fear that must be able to obtain a many a wished for many islander must be only too glad to place under protection of wealthy eccentric englishman thanks to demarchs wisdom in placing money with london solicitor have plenty of capital on to draw when thing be once more quiet melnos repopulated from adjacent island made up mind at once to restore tunnel to former perfection certainly must take time to gather number of pure blooded hellene for colony with plenty of capital at back production of island in flourishing condition must afford to wait besides have maurice now beside young fellow be man after own heart for in contrast to former listlessness when in england flung into justinian scheme with ardor delighted old man with to conceive nephew to carry out demarch be quite jubilant in spite of late revers for foresaw that in such capable hand melnos must soon be restored to pristine glory only thing therefore agitated mind be dread felt lest caliphronas must again assault melnos with army of cut throat calmly a justinian have taken treachery of greek yet in own soul felt deeply hurt that year of kindness have met with so base return have found caliphronas poor shepherd lad on island of andros have educated clothed fed for many year now when perilous time came not only be ungrateful scamp absent from side actually arrayed against being in way active agent in bringing ruin on benefactor however if pirate headed by accomplished villain did appear again demarch knew well that must not hope to hold out against for lengthy period a owing to smallness of garrison incessant watching fighting suspense must wear out even bravest among in dilemma there be only one thing left to do must pirate reappear be to close up pas by mean of overhanging rock at cliff entrance true must shut within island up in crater threatened to break out still from appearance volcanic outburst did not seem likely to take place therefore if pas be firmly sealed must at least be free from dangerous enemy without until such time a melnos must be repeopled thus defend notwithstanding earthquake disappearance of lake activity of hot spring demarch must not believe that crater extinct for so many thousand of year must break out in eruption without giving at least serious warning therefore with idea determined if worst came to worst to shut people in by closing up gorge rather than abandon forty year of work to mercy of band of levantine black guard a to helena maurice be perfectly happy in making love to other in interval of such delightful occupation young englishman looked after palisade at two sentry be constantly posted wandered about village with uncle attending to local matter twice thrice day went to vantage point above side staircase in order to watch for appearance of crispin yacht daily maurice uncle swept offing with glass thin line of smoke glancing white sail showed that eunice be on way to aid unfortunate during time be dick idle for with small body of men have posted above overhanging rock at entrance of pas there drilled hole in soft volcanic soil for reception of dynamite cartridge when be placed sufficiently deep alexandros attached wire to then threw thread like conductor across abyss to opposite side of pas at point where crispin have gone over cliff few night previously established small battery fixed wire thereto so in event of pirate approaching island man who be on look out at vantage point have simply to touch button of battery when enormous rock on other side of gorge must crash down in titanic fragment closing up narrow way irretrievably still a before stated demarch on account of lurking suspicion of extinct volcano be unwilling to avail of aid until last moment in event if last moment did come rock must be exploded from vantage point with greatest ease rope have be used to let down crispin gurt be still attached to trunk of pine tree have be carefully drawn up lest by chance if pirate arrived must enter island by ascending convenient ladder notwithstanding closing of pas on early morning of fourth day after crispin have departed justinian nephew ascending path at back of acropolis went down to vantage point through altar glade according to custom in order to look for sign of poet return east be yet rosy with dawn great expanse of ocean slept below in serene calm long white wave broke gently on sandy beach there be not breath of wind when sun arose suddenly out of sea long yellow ray shot like bridge of gold across water while orb invisible to watcher projected shadow of island on liquid plain in front temistocles have be on watch for considerable time a electric light be kept night constantly sweeping surface of sea in search of strange boat justinian asked runner if there have be indication of approaching danger receiving reply in negative put up glass in hope of discovering sign of long expected much desired yacht not speck must behold in spite of power of glass keenness of eyesight four day since went away said demarch to maurice with sigh a put down glass yet doe not seem to be coming back must allow more time uncle replied maurice comfortingly know everything may not have gone exactly a thought may have cruised about time before being picked up by cretan steamer even if be fortunate in meeting boat at once on arrival at yacht may not have be lying there yacht have have plenty of time to get to syra maurice have missed steamer else find difficulty in obtaining men from eparch of syra surely in urgent case like eparch will send help at once say be friend certainly say be belief be that be jealous of independent sovereignty must not be sorry to see little government come to end what nice old gentleman must be tell uncle what be difference between demarch eparch one rule over one island other over many a matter of fact demarch be kind of mayor really be too small title for seeing have whole island to myself still be quite satisfied with a king of melnos be out of question prince of melnos sound like hero of penny novelette what island doe eparch of syra rule over well really quite forget eparch of santorin rule over amorgos anapli santorin io of course epachsor what be iteparchsare subject to government of king george certainly then dont wonder envy island suppose be only independent prince in gean be now in former time there be many italian family ruled a duke of naxos line governed seriphos potentate be somewhere about fifteenth century think ruler likest to be one capsi kind of ancient pirate of alcibiades type who became ruler of melos melnos island of melos without n be curious coincidence be not similarity of name rule very what became of king capsi oh turk invited to stamboul then cut off head for presuming to set up a rival to sultan fate be not likely to happen to a be very good friend with abdul hamid think have better establish line of prince uncle said maurice in joking tone will take title of justinian when succeed to throne will be justinian ii if helena be fortunate enough to present with grandson will be justinian iii so see have excellent beginning for royal family see why must not be so replied demarch seriously look at brooke who became rajah of sarawak bernadottes now king of sweden then again bonaparte family dear maurice believe there be still kingdom to be gained if who seek have nerve judgment fortune of born adventurer such a exactly be of same type oh be younger maurice with by side must go to south america carve out kingdom smile tell can be done have be done in melnos oh be nothing intellectual training school only mean real large kingdom on continent may be like in thing uncle think have ambition a will be quite content with island sovereignty of melnos daresay be wise maurice what story adventure must makethe way be brought here by androsthe description of craterthe attack on islandwhy must make capital romance nobody must believe must look upon a embroidered lie of alroy specie ah author of bookdisraeliwhat man wondrous boy wot wrote alroy said maurice yes certainly be clever little too fond in book of oriental splendor perhaps genius a statesman if disraeli have be eastern vizier must have become king what desultory conversation said nephew laughing began with eparch end with possible sovereign well a far a be concerned island be big enough for princess helena who be talking of princess helena cried gay voice behind on turning saw princess with arm a usual full of flower looking at with smile in eye be culprit highness said maurice bowing when did arrive very moment so if have be saying nice thing about may a well repeat vanity vanity be vanity if be only thing have to say to will go think have better go said justinian turning away from cliff be anxious for breakfast young people suppose be content to live on love not in keen morning air father have seen sign of yacht not slightest what bad thing pirate appearance of gentleman what good thing wonder who will arrive first crispin caliphronas trust former answered father hopefully dread latter oh dear said helena with sigh do wish must leave alone why can not get island of own ah thats just child doe not desire island so much a will never get answered resolutely sooner than become wife of traitor must throw over cliff can rest quite content helena said maurice with quiet determination if caliphronas overwhelms melnos with force will not obtain prize desire if capture will be over dead body then hell never capture for can easily conquer such coward retorted girl with great spirit after dont believe hell have courage to come back uncle exclaimed roylands suddenly a saw justinian stumble what be matter do feel ill not exactly ill replied demarch taking nephew arm to tell truth awoke morning feeling very sick faint why papa so did exclaimed helena in surprise be why came down to cliff to obtain breath of fresh air also have headache when awoke said maurice after pause so a have felt same thing there must be malaria in air justinian gave cry of alarm face blanched white under bronze oh maurice dread to think what may be why uncle what do mean vapor of volcano helena lover grew pale at ominous word still said latter anxiously if hing give headache forget replied justinian in sombre tone a entered acropolis be way up crater if vapor be rising from volcano think of people in valley without waiting moment three in state of great alarm hurried to platform in front of temple looked anxiously down to village although be now seven oclock melnosians be early riser there be appearance of life in valley below sound of labor voice ascended smoke curled upward from chimney in still morning cup of crater lay spread out before scene of exquisite beauty yet terribly ominously calm great god cried justinian with strangled sob can be a feared man came staggering along mulberry avenue waving arm wildly when came sufficiently near saw be bosn dick pale haggard reeling in gait like drunken man maurice ran forward to help a advanced ultimately have to carry to step of acropolis while helena by father direction ran inside for brandy smelling salt with revived almost insensible sailor who opened eye with shudder only to find three face scarcely le haggard than own bending over none of asked what have happened for intense quiet of valley told own terrible story justinian knew that in one night have lost whole of subject through deadly vapor breathed by awakening volcano oh mr justinian mr roylands be horriblehorrible said dick sitting up with difficulty be deadnot one left alive poor messmate be gone also let leave cursed place sir will die also dick have fought bravely through campaign be man little given to emotion yet so unnerved be by fearful catastrophe have happened that buried face in hand almost wept in intensity of agony maurice helena also be paralyzed with dread for however daring human being may be most resolute quail before gigantic power of nature high spirited a be heart thrilled with fear a recognized in what death trap be snared only justinian preserved certain amount of calmnessjustinian who suffered more than others for be crowning blow whole untiring labor of forty year have be swept away a naught in single hour be not valley cried looking downward in despair be tomb enclosing many dead oh poor melnosians how did discover dick asked maurice in awed tone after went away morning sir walked down to valley in order to get messmate to go on with mining work in pas felt bit headachy queer however did not think about went down stair just a got down way felt poisonous breath of air wafted up from below seized by throat made fall down insensible by statue of apollo dont know how long lay be lucky be not farther down else must have be stifled a be little breath of gas floated up cool air above revived somewhat managed to crawl up higher then came along sir helped here be dead must be said justinian in tone of despair see how be escaped know grotto del cane at naples maurice where man can enter freely dog dy be because vapor only rise certain height down below there when be sleeping gas must have be breathed slowly from mouth of volcano stifled soul must not rise higher on account of weight so managed to escape death look at valley cried demarch with passionate gesture be smiling death trap can see nothing half way up cup be filled with deadly poison must kill be to descend oh poor people dead dead dead hid face in hand overcome with horror at sight dick somewhat cured of poisonous vapor have inhaled arose to foot with effort must get away from here mr maurice dare not stay night for even if volcano doe not burst out gas will rise rise until acropolis will be below level must fly how can fly asked justinian abruptly have boatsthose scoundrel of caliphronas have destroyed only thing can do be to abandon acropolis go to sea shore in order to wait arrival of crispin to save if volcano break out uncle in case must die island be so small that with crater in full fury must be crushed under weight of stone thrown out burned to death by stream of lava only hope be crispin a to death trap must leave at once helena helena did not answer be crouching down with head on lap of zoe who have joined group two girl be too terrified to speak lay silent with horror mere huddled mass of humanity how many of be left alive asked maurice raising girl to foot about ten sir replied dick making rapid calculation two who be on sentry go at palisade alexandros who be down there attending to mine temistocles who be on look out man here who drive engine zoe miss helena mr justinian demarch flung up hand with cry of horror ten survivor out of nearly two hundred people oh there be curse on mine be useless to fight against fate maurice must fly very minute trust to providence to be spared until arrival of yacht hark what be that there be low moan seemed to come from lip of crater moment afterwards earth trembled slightly be dreaded voice of earthquake a knew only too well with sudden impulse turned to fly valley smiled peaceful serene in brilliant sunshine white peak glittered like pentelican marble against sky delicate green of foliage myriad hue of flower met eye on side yet under mask of smiling loveliness raged fierce subterranean fire be already pressing furiously upward to shatter whole beautiful scene into titantic fragment of stone let take provision water winewhat can said justinian rapidly a led way into acropolis there be not moment to be lost must fly without delay unfortunate made a much speed a must collected food must find assisted by argyropoulos who have be called by demarch from engine fortunately there be few valuable to take away a justinian have always lived with great simplicity money be safe in demarch hastily gathered up few of paper money little jewelry belonged to helena while others loaded only with necessary such a provision wine water cloak to protect must have to pas night on beach helena weeping bitterly took leave of beloved flower never have court with snowy pillar sporting fountain mass of blossom looked so beautiful a did on fatal morning argo poor bird be strutting proudly about quite unaware of danger helena touched by feeling of compassion impulsively spoke to maurice will take argo with be afraid can not dear girl see be heavily laden where be uncle have gone to take last look at valley

to abandon acropolis forever little band sadly left beautiful home in must no longer hope to dwell took melancholy way up winding path led up to altar glade argyropoulos went first then dick came supporting weeping zoe finally justinian with nephew on one side daughter on other came slowly walking along overcome with grief scheme expenditure work be now at end a far a result went last forty year of busy life have be absolutely wasted just a reached altar inscribed have witnessed of late birth of young love temistocles in state of great excitement came running up path led from cliff

nothing sorrow care for god have spoken prayer spurn yet tho thus broken make return of holocaust high on altar bare offering bitter of despair saying never rain pours be fully exemplified by series of calamity have befallen once peaceful isle of fantasy inhabitant first treachery of caliphronas then war have killed so many people now threatened eruption of apparently extinct volcano to crown band of pirate waiting at only outlet of escape to massacre survivor a fled from peril within evidently sin of rudolph roylands youth be now bearing fruit ancestral ate be now exacting full penalty for half forgotten episode of early life by depriving of valued most in world one thing after have be torn from reluctant grasp now seemed a if life be to crown measure of repayment standing on lofty cliff with nephew daughter dependant beside justinian watched pirate landing from boat with cynical despair feeling that end of thing have come a far a be concerned owing to mental physical trial of last few week demarch have lost to great extent iron nerve must no longer conceive decide execute project with former promptitude loss of island have turned from vigorous determined leader into feeble old man although now then spirit did flash up with gleam of brilliancy be apparent to eye that be no longer fitted to lead control matter at final crisis of affair be then that maurice showed capable commander leaving worn out uncle to care of woman instinctively took affair into own hand without further loss of time of course still deferred to justinian a ostensible head of thing be who made suggestion demarch did little else than agree to proposition first of maurice getting from justinian key of iron gate sent temistocles down staircase to call up alexandros two melnosians in order to concentrate in one spot survivor of island decide upon course of action when came up to vantage point temistocles locked iron gate again restored key to master after men sat down to consider position of affair be now noon sun at zenith be blazing hotly down on lava rock of melnos flinging back glare rendered heat almost intolerable pirate having drawn up boat on beach inside harbor have retreated to old camp tent of untouched by melnosians be still standing there evidently intended to remain until grew cooler in order to assault palisade quite ignorant that inhabitant of melnos be dead that volcano be on point of bursting out in eruption have known latter fact must speedily have fled away from ill omened spot maurice be glad be thus ignorant a wished to use one of boat in order that party might escape from coming explosion of mountain do think pirate will assault palisade afternoon uncle asked maurice anxious for old warrior opinion dont think so replied justinian shaking head have evidently be rowing here morning be tired out be probable will sleep afternoon attack just when grows dusk what do propose to do maurice first pull down palisade what thus lose only defence be mad there be method in madness a will see uncle wish to pull down barrier so that when pirate come up to assault will find difficulty in passing up gorge of course suspecting nothing will make way right into interior of island while who be in rear can go down side staircase on to beach then push off in boat before return good idea sir said dick scratching head suppose when get inside palisade must come up stair find here wont do dick for will lock gate can depend upon when find pas open will not waste time in trying to force side path if can gain interior of island by open way certainly wont try to pas in by blocked one dont think will suspect treachery maurice uncle in first place most of be new arrival in spite of what comrade have told wont believe areor rather wereso strong in second place will think have retreated up to second palisade so even if stop there will have time to get to sea what about kyrion said alexandros pointing to battery stood near will not wait till enemy be under rock then bring down to crush by mean alexandros for by so doing must close up only avenue of escape left to will not be much gratification crushing enemy if only attain that by letting be blown up by volcano alexandros looked rather unhappy at a be proud of work must have liked to show how skilfully battery worked recognized force of roylands reasoning so said more about justinian be also silent simply because have conceived plan for punishing enemy looking at battery rock frowning over pas coil of rope near pine tree glanced suddenly at alexandros with significant smile whereupon quick witted greek saw that demarch have scheme in head that battery must yet be utilized accordingly when men descended to gorge for purpose of levelling palisade alexandros lingered behind with justinian to receive order what be kyrion asked in greek alexandros replied demarch fiercely be leaving island forever for a know friend be dead will leave behind offering to mane of scoundrel who have given such trouble must carry out wish will kyrion by coil of rope up there can escape down face of cliff easily kyrion be monkey in climbing good well when pirate have gone up pas have gained boat on beach remain behind when give signal explode mine thus pas will be closed up sealing pirate up in crater so if volcano doe burst out will be blown to piece will do kyrion said alexandros who liked scheme immensely then can escape down cliff keep to said demarch in whisper a went out of iron gate mr maurice be too tender hearted might not like how justinian must reconcile proposed massacre with aversion have felt previous day in exploding mine be hard to say fact be with trouble brain be becoming slightly affected now deemed point of honor to sacrifice enemy to mane of dead subject after a considered very truly pirate be dangerous desperado gean must very well spare so sooner be cut short in nefarious career better for islander of cyclades besides rudolph roylands have even in old age wild lawless spirit only curbed by wonderful power of self control in thus avenging on enemy who have destroyed cherished scheme be indulging in burst of baresark fury inherited from norse ancestor with hard work eight men managed to make breach in earthwork through enemy must pas carefully built fortification be levelled to ground be growing dusk when finished already must hear stir in camp of enemy so rapidly completing work of devastation returned to vantage point where have left woman only demarch nephew lingered behind one to lock iron gate other to carry away union jack still floated proudly over ruined barricade wont get at event uncle said maurice gleefully a hauled down flag have fall into hand for thousand pound sooner burn retorted demarch fiercely hurry up maurice for judging from noise be making suspect force be being drawn up roylands with fold of flag wrapped round body ran through iron gate with uncle latter having locked carefully ascended staircase in order to wait event be just at hour after sunset when day blending with night produce that luminous twilight so noticeable in mediterranean little band concealed from sight on high cliff

of wound will remain behind in camp let army do work once conquer will come out crow be andros over like to be monkey use others a cat to pull chestnut out of fire be very glad be not leading said maurice thoughtfully for must be keen enough to mistrust appearance refrain from entering pas in case of treachery in case must be kept prisoner up here helena uttered low cry of fright hid face on maurices shoulder for at moment earth began to tremble slightly shock however be not severe one did damage still made whole party feel uneasy wish be relieved from perilous position four melnosians who have lost friend relative looked like statue of despair still so selfish be man for that though pleasure in life be gone be a uneasy anxious to be saved a rest of party luckily owing to ardor with enemy be forming line have not noticed ominous warning of earthquake be evidently about to make grand assault on barrier at given signal rushed wildly up hill shrieking like fiend recoiled in dismay a saw ruin of palisade evidently suspecting treachery consulted together for moment then cautiously went forward into pas finding foe there to confront became more confident a caliphronas who must have shown way be not present took notice of iron gate marched boldly up gorge firing rifle at interval until there be not single man left at palisade on beach there be not moment to be lost so justinian
