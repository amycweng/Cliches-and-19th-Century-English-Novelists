morning at eight o'clock started off to catch express at junction be coming back that know boy mr phelps looked round cautiously lowered voice to whisper took jewel with jewel yes have quantity of jewelry put money must get from husband into clothes diamond most extravagant woman alan well be gone be certain jewel left address said word about returning what do think of upon word sir know what

parsh to bournemouth did well about five o'clock brown will call that instead of quiet gentleman though believe really be name well about time brown walked over to abbey farm brought letter purporting to come from to housekeeper mr hester from alan yes letter be forged said alan with emphasis directed mr hester to allow brown to remain at farm until returned be in handwriting signed with name knew nothing about brown save that be staying at mr marry thought somewhat strange must come to stop at farm during absence a instruction in letter be quite plain knew handwriting well that show how expert forgery be gave brown run of place in meantime wrote to at bournemouth asking if be right inclosed forged letter here be a saw handwriting mr phelps started upon word alan wonder mr hester be deceived especially when consider sight be not good why with eye must certainly take for yours mr phelps wore pince nez nevertheless resented aspersion on optical power why on earth did telegraph to well know how old fashioned conservative be sir make out through scripture how can not tell that telegraph be sinful institution therefore be not to be wondered at trusted to post got letter only morn a of course followed on from bournemouth nevertheless knew about loss of key last night ah loss of key yes go alan very well brown being allowed to remain in house proceeded to make quite at home in library mr hester writing letter easy task for took further heed of be in room for hour amused appears in breaking open desk having forced several of drawer found at last one wanted one containing key of vault then made thing beautifully smooth so that mr hester must not see have be tampered with leaving message that must return to dinner went out ostensibly for walk returned appears to lodging left there again about nine o'clock in evening since then nothing have be seen heard of god bless alan be sure have key positive looked in desk last night be not there everything be done so nicely that be strongly of opinion that mr brown have served apprenticeship a cracksman under pretty good master too one must have stolen that key besides forged letter show plainly that came to farm with honest intention what ca understand continued alan biting mustache be how man came to know where key be extraordinary yes be extraordinary undoubtedly be who stole body gained access to vault with key murder of dr warrender committed that too be convinced of called to see found be out have doubt followed probably saw brown remove body of course interfered upon villain made short work of be theory sir very sound one too in many respect said rector brown must not have removed body alone must have have accomplice true be for very reason be going to town afternoon cicero gramp may be able to supply information on point be quite possible slept in churchyard saw whole business murder alan alan cried mr phelps horrified do believe murder be committed on sacred soil of churchyard in god own acre alan one surely must be so vile do sir at door of vault brown a say cleverly concealed body in marlow coffin have time to screw down again apparently must have have pretty tough job to cut through lead have to trust to chance of course that vault must not be visited until have got safe distance away with booty indeed for gramp letter one must ever have thought of going there in fact brown be most ingenious dangerous criminal be indeed be what must possibly want body for have be just fancy be case of blackmail if remember millionaire body be stolen in america few year ago only restored to family on payment by of very large sum of money oh be what think be after yes do be highly probable think that in few week perhaps even in le time will receive letter demanding thousand for return of body surely police oh mr brown will look after that may depend upon will make quite safe before go that far so talented gentleman a must not be likely to omit necessary precaution of kind humph muttered mr phelps considering of mr warrender suspicious flight what think confess know quite what to make of have great opinion of a woman still must hardly credit with being in league with ruffian indeed for must need be worst of woman said mr phelps with warmth why alan poor warrender be simply crazy about worked day night to provide with finery craved for besides seemed really fond of who be asked alan bluntly well must like to say to one alan mr warrender have be actress actress under what name can not tell called there one day heard reciting shakespeare elocution seemed

moment dear boy what about sophy have seen of course be judicious in what told know nothing about loss of key suspicion of brown although funnily enough suspect bless on what ground can do oh on purely feminine ground that suspect declares will not marry until father body be discovered very right very proper quite agree with must start married life with absolutely clean sheet alan young man nodded a left inn delivered of one warning do keep eye on joe brill said significantly why why what for because fancy know good deal more than be inclined to tell replied alan then without further

day while rector ran on in fashion blair silent examined empty coffin noted that lead casing have be cut with sharp instrument very neatly done so neatly that inspector became thoughtful be done by man in hurry mused said nothing merely turned to mr phelps with question who screwed down coffin who bless let think yes yes dr warrender poor soul joe brill faithful fellow joe must see last of master be undertaker present crank well yes be be sorry to say mr inspector here face of rector became severe that on day crank be intoxicated h be who made drunk suppose rejoined mr phelps trifle

others considered well that saw while mr phelps chattered quite so said detective at length let go outside examined graveyard a carefully a have done vault in angle formed by lady chapel found long grass crushed down part of torn up to make pillow humph squatting place said blair who have read good deal about prehistoric man tramp have be sleeping here tramp repeated rector of course be cicero gramp who wrote letter doubt dare say saw whole business blair continued research came to halt at wall divided church yard from pine wood pointed to loose stone have be knocked off did observe before sir replied mr phelps raising pince nez be nothing see wall have be put together without mortar simply stone piled one on top of other high wind now think high wind knocked stone off will notice sir

trail said from evidence of wall suspect body be carried over where to mr inspector probably to cart waiting on highroad run across moor of course be in dark a to let see keyhole of vault door went back have good look at there be scratch to be seen humph said inspector be opened quietly enough by man who knew what be about there be hurry fumbling in putting in key ah said rector looking wise what key not one mr phelps suspect probably key be that stolen from mr thorold desk by quiet gentleman speak a though be not quite sure there might have be third key blair said cautiously if so why must brown have stolen thorold key be one of thing have to find out let call on mr marry mr marry be voluble buxom woman with rosy cheek great amount of curiosity a to matter did not concern clever a be seemed that have nothing to tell about mr brown with many curtsy much talk conducted rector inspector into gimcrack parlor full of gaudy furniture berlin wool mat antimacassar wax flower when jeremiah died explained widow with pride spent nest egg left on elegant set of chair sofa also on curtain table glass luster be considered very fine be intent gentleman a lone widder to take in single gentleman like something to tickle eye most inviting room mr marry said rector perching carefully on fragile chair varnish design entirely wanting in solidity mr brown ah sir be gone where must go mr marry wiped away imaginary tear remark called forth question from blair who have be making close examination of room how do know be dead bless man must be back if be be sure be comfortable enough cooking be above blame thank heaven if one mr brown went out at nine o'clock said blair cutting short wo deceive mr policeman did stayed in most of day went out in afternoon at six came back for bit sup at nine went out again to take air said so at least ai set eye on since said so remarked mr phelps on finger of course be dumb sir not deaf conversed on finger wonderful can talk way said mr marry gravely having niece a be deaf dumb in asylum expect be knowing language a brought mr brown here to lodge where did come from london town gave to understand sir did talk much on finger about be very quiet ate drank read book what kind of book novel sir yellow novel in foreign tongue here sir be rosewood bookcase also wrote great deal what know thought have idea of becoming writing person blair opened bookcase one by one examined dozen so of french novel ranged on lower shelf be by good author usual paper covered cheap edition nothing strange about name be written in one of shut up bookcase with look of disappointment be lodger frenchman asked lor ' sir dunno talked english with finger have seen reading newspaper did not look like foreigner remarked rector ah quite forgot knew man mr phelps can describe look be not very tall have long white hair beard ruddy cheek dark eye be usually dressed in gray suit walked with stout stick gout in foot put in mr marry not at pleased at being left out in cold wore cloth boot for gout walked very badly did mr brown strange murmured blair again looking round room how must old man helpless through gout in foot carry off dead body humph carried off dead body cried mr marry crimson with wrath if be mr marlow corpse be talking of believe mr brown bin murdered like doctor why do believe so because have made up mind to believe said mr marry fiercely 'd like to see man a must change mind so must remarked blair well mr marry show mr brown room must examine luggage there be only one box be locked will take liberty of opening ca be honest woman what will mr brown say when come back find thing gone besides there be trifle of rent hold tongue said inspector with glance quelled will take nothing away forget who be mr marry show bedroom landlady thinking better of obeyed without further argument box be there common brown painted traveling box there be name on proved to be locked inspector asked for chisel forced open within found three suit of gray clothes linen sock together with pair of cloth boot nothing else name on shirt tailor tag on clothes evidently nothing of mr brown identity be to be learned from belonging man from nowhere said phelps gazing blankly around inspector blair be not yet satisfied searched sitting room bedroom questioned mr marry looked at torn piece of paper in fireplace found nothing rector inspector walked out of cottage a wise a when have entered so far search have be failure afternoon blair hunted village for evidence heard how warrender have called at mr marry house how have left there to follow quiet gentleman who have be seen by peasant going in direction of moor blair recalled loose stone dropped from churchyard wall own theory that corpse have be taken to cart on road sent out police have heath searched even to hut where corpse have be with result a yet be ignorant of what cicero knew tired baffled returned to heathton to inn here found messenger from mr phelps asking to call at rectory hurried there be met by alan thorold who presented cicero mr warrender then tramp told story of that have seen blair rubbed chin can doctor have helped brown to do said half aloud no did not cried mr warrender angrily husband be a good man a ever lived why must steal corpse humph why indeed blair recollected something have seen in vault of cared not to speak until must be more certain so held peace even if late lamented dr warrender did violate sanctity of tomb said cicero softly who killed late lamented dr warrender perhaps shorter man who helped said rector be hold tongue just now whispered alan for cicero be about to mention joe brill name will come to later who be that proved to be mr marry who came in with part of torn envelope in hand on envelope be obliterated stamp writing have be torn off found in mr brown room said on floor by edge of carpet how escaped dusting know blair looked at piece of evidence jamaica stamp said strange cried rector know marlow be at one time in jamaica husband dr warrender came from jamaica said widow there be silence looked at one one have explanation to offer chapter x disappearance in course of investigation mr blair have examined servant at moat house from footman heard of west indian letter of effect have produced upon mr marlow search have be made for letter a likely to throw light on mystery without success evidently mr marlow have thought important enough to destroy secret whatever might have be have gone to grave with be strange coincidence that man brown must also have correspondent in jamaica be who have stolen key of vault from alan desk again dr warrender who a wife told alan have be in jamaica have be murdered between three men then marlow brown warrender there be evidently connecting link have there not be warrender must not have assisted to remove body of millionaire brown by stealing key must not have helped there be doubt in mind that brown be short man seen by gramp blair said to alan be followed from mr marry by dr warrender who be bound on same errand mean theft of body think so brown have key gramp saw remove corpse saw warrender corrected alan not brown judge other be brown from theft of key fact that warrender called to see then followed again men have disappeared at least one have other be dead who murdered brown said inspector with conviction be sure of how can be sure because something unforeseen happened murder probably in ordinary course of thing take brown must have come back to fetch luggage must have gone away in manner le likely to arouse suspicion probably warrender have quarrel when put corpse in cart brown killed doctor then drove away blair argued alan forget that doctor body be seen in hut even if brown have dragged there admit might have done see how must have brought back again to vault do mr thorold be brown who have key most likely put dead body in place of safety then came back following night to hide away in safest place knew of to wit vault if recollect alarm a to loss of marlow body be given be likely to be given warrender dead body must not have be searched for in vault be at least highly improbable that vault must have be opened be true assented alan that cicero by chance saw affair dare say must have remained in ignorance of business for many long day one must have gone to vault very clever man brown very clever for accident of cicero having slept in churchyard must have got off scot free a be see how can hunt down gout dumbness white hair beard may have be assumed fact of linen left at mr marry being unmarked be proof enough that be disguised perhaps said alan doubtfully what ca make out be how knew have key of vault in desk did mention to one only to mr phelps where in churchyard after funeral be round vault service be just over phelps locked door with key asked where mine be said 'in desk in library be brown present at funeral yes think caught glimpse of be there crowd round vault door when be closed there be did notice brown on occasion blair nodded very probably be too much taken up with business in hand yet will swear brown be in crowd heard say where key be clever scoundrel made use of information same afternoon believe be right said alan clenching fist oh do wish must find villain what object must have have in stealing body can guess mr marlow be millionaire well in small way yes in way quite big enough to pay handsome ransom mr thorold inspector smiled depend upon will hear from so called brown will ask good few thousand for return of corpse oh be not first time game have be played well if brown writes will have arrested for murder humph said blair shaking head be easier said than done have be too clever for so far may prove too clever in matter of obtaining reward of wickedness well mr thorold inquest take place to morrow have got much evidence for jury be right talk have be built up upon theory on slenderest of circumstantial evidence fact that brown mysterious have stolen key even be not absolutely proved did not show that have stolen body cicero must not swear to identity even presuming that have committed sacrilege there be evidence that be who have murdered warrender so inquest on body of ill fated doctor be held theft of millionaire corpse being merely side issue can be wondered that jury be puzzled must be scraped together by blair be put before cicero related midnight experience mr warrender told how husband went out to see patient mr marry how doctor called at house afterwards followed brown finally alan housekeeper gave evidence a to loss of key forged letter be produced out of sparse detail little must be made after deliberation jury brought in only verdict possible under circumstance deceased have be murdered by person person unknown most unsatisfactory said blair grimly there be more to be said what can do now asked alan will give up case depends upon sir rather upon miss marlow in what way in money way mr thorold be poor man must attend to duty same if miss marlow will offer reward will do utmost to find out who stole father body who murdered doctor why couple two crime because sir in opinion brown committed give reward mr thorold will do best otherwise a have other urgent matter on hand must drop business deny continued inspector stroking chin that if be moneyed man 'd work at business for sheer love of be kind of criminal mystery doe not happen day reward will be offered said alan miss marlow will be guided by needle to say sophy be guided by indeed so eager be that remains of father must be recovered have not alan suggested must have offered reward herself also be anxious to assist mr warrender who in spite of vulgarity somewhat covetous disposition be really well meaning woman result of be that two reward be offered one thousand for detection of person who have stolen body like sum for information likely to lead to arrest of warrender murderer so here be two thousand pound going begging hundred of people hoped to have chance of gaining money case be so strange mysterious that have attracted not little attention fact that missing body be that of millionaire added to interest excited by fact of disappearance london paper be full of leader letter suggesting solution of mystery provincial press took up cry throughout three kingdom one be talking of case be even said that miss marlow present possessor of wealth must marry person who secured thief murderer wo marry alan dear until father body be back in vault said sophy at same time wo marry one else suppose fail to find body sophy then must remain spinster for rest of life in case condemn to be crusty old bachelor never mind can still be friend lover 'd rather be man wife sighed alan did not believe that must cling to idea of perpetual spinsterhood for length of time a for miss vicky thought sophy mad to have thought of such thing took roundly to task woman ought to marry said breaking through barrier of ordinary primness do think if darling have lived must now be wretched old maid indeed must have be delight to have be obedient loving wife to edward be sure wish have lived cried sophy embracing wo have call crabbed be sweetest dearest woman in world so poor edward thought sighed miss vicky fingering precious brooch always decorated portion of small person ala day how often told so died for country on field of glory cried with thrill of pride in spite of lonely old age grudge precious blood noble noble edward wept cry more vicky be obstinacy be cry at sophia if poor dear pa remains be not found within certain time marry mr thorold be happy ca wo how can be happy knowing poor father be at rest soul be at rest earthly tabernacle be nothing come sophia break with life happiness alan understand one vicky dare say will marry day body must be found lord grant ejaculated miss vicky piously said more for found that more argued more obstinate sophy grew amongst who have hope of gaining reward be cicero have come out of ordeal of public examination unscathed be now in possession of well earned fifty pound being anxious to remain in heathton for purpose of prosecuting inquiry magnanimously forgave mr timber took up quarter at good samaritan now that have money paid bill regularly good lady considered politic to treat with more civility although after manner of woman felt constrained to remind now again of former poverty remark did not affect mr gramp in least regarded no more than if have be fly sailed about village in suit of new broadcloth best of tall hat airing eloquence became attraction at inn discoursed there evening in fine style mr warrender be much averse to staying on at heathton lived in constant dread lest relationship between must be discovered cicero never mentioned did ever mention still felt doubtful one evening on plea that wished to hear more of what knew about husband murder sent for arrived to find in low evening dress glittering with diamond looking very handsome so handsome indeed that even must not refrain from giving vent to admiration upon word be juno clara maria said when be alone there be money in yet know what mean billy replied doctor widow coldly be not going on stage again in burlesque anything else how be going to live asked with brutal candor business retorted mr warrender have enough to live on even without selling jewel perhaps will marry again be sure will clara maria always be determined woman hold tongue tell how much longer do intend to disgrace here how can tell if be to hold tongue said cicero coolly a to staying here be not disgracing that know of one know be ungrateful sister billy if be lady 'd ungrateful indeed brute go away at once clara maria not till find out who killed brother in law never knew said cicero wiping away tear a nearest relative must avenge wo do billy said sister sourly only want reward reward clara maria with two thousand pound must be gentleman for rest of life that will never be must hing never have lazy vagabond interrupt insult clara maria work with work with gasped mr warrender at what at case clara maria believe that secret of mystery be to be found in island of jamaica in past life of mr marlow now husband knew late lamented millionaire in jamaica might have left paper relative to acquaintance if so let see will get on track of assassin will share reward husband did leave paper mr warrender said thoughtfully wo show to billy 'd take money will read paper if can find anything likely to reveal name of person who stole body murdered julian will tell mr thorold wo get reward cried cicero in agony oh yes will be a clever a be billy thank for idea wo work with said firmly wo know of old want to keep out of way leave village will give twenty pound what when there be chance to make two thousand clara maria then earn reward there be joe brill might tell what want to know mocked mr warrender husband said be with marlow for thirty year must ask joe brill said cicero gloomily ever since tipped sovereign have suspected joe brill be gone gone gone where know only heard news to night be gone away without word vanished cicero groaned chapter xi stranger joe brill have disappeared from heathton be perfectly true so far cicero be correct in stating that man have vanished without sign be wrong news to be precise gossip travel more quickly in village than in town also get more quickly distorted for intimacy of villager be such that be readier than le acquainted folk to take away from add to talk about whose everyday life know so well joe brill have left letter for sophy who in much alarm consulted miss parsh consultation be overheard by footman who told servant without mentioning letter about be not very clear having caught only scrap of conversation kitchen discussed news retailed to baker who with assistance of wife noted gossip spread broadcast over village thus in evening came to cicero greedy ear so be that came to tell sister that joe brill have disappeared without sign sophy knew better be dreadful said to miss vicky joe be very cruel to leave like in trouble know that look upon a one of best friend to be thirty year with father then to leave oh dear vicky what doe mean for answer miss vicky read letter aloud be badly written badly spelt be short to point amended ran a follows honored miss be called away on business may turn out well for when will come back miss know wait in hope stand by nail color to mast trust one mr thorold prayer honored miss be requested for humble servant joseph brill most extraordinary said miss vicky laid down letter to gaze blankly at sophy will go mad with worry cried poor girl taking letter oh dear vicky everything have gone wrong since father died hush talk of sophia pa remains have gone soul be above dr warrender have be buried verdict of twelve intelligent men have be given must think more of matter joseph letter be more of mystery than rest put together finished sophy just listen to nonsense joe writes `` m called away on business what business vicky how can turn out well for doe know when will come back mean wo come back at 'wait in hope hope of what for goodness ' sake vicky alan of course will trust one alan how absurd to put in then finish by asking prayer just a though be going to die vicky be joe mad joseph be too clear headed man to lose wit be opinion sophia that be gone to search for poor papa remains be alan opinion also when read letter heard of joe disappearance questioned servant must give detail page who slept in same room declared that woke at six o'clock to find joe bed empty did not alarm a joe be always first in house to be up so alan went to railway station learnt there that old sailor carrying thing tied up in handkerchief have taken train to junction wire to junction station master who knew joe elicited reply that have gone on to london by express beyond be hopeless to attempt to trace for at waterloo station joe have vanished into crowd be lost alan told lamenting sophy that nothing must now be done wait for return will return demanded girl tearfully think so agree with miss vicky joe have gone to search for father body have idea where be if did must surely have told alan knowing how anxious be may have clue may want to follow up believe sophy joe know more about matter than think do remember that gave cicero sovereign to leave moat house what of only that sovereign be large sum for servant like joe to give thought doubt that cicero knew too much wanted to get away before must be questioned be guilty conscience made so generous guilty conscience alan what have joe done nothing so far a know replied thorold readily be convinced there be something in father past life sophy must account for violation of vault joe know for reason wo tell questioned about ridiculous sum gave to cicero must get satisfactory explanation out of must blair think be short man with dr warrender on night alan asked girl somewhat tremulously asked boy who sleep in same room said that joe went to bed a usual that never heard go out besides sophy be certain accomplice of warrender be brown quiet gentleman yes have key of vault also by evidence of stamp have something to do with jamaica perhaps knew father there perhaps did joe must know joe will not speak at event have gone must wait until come back be not going to make more search for body alan dearest have not slightest idea where to begin case have baffled police baffle have made inquiry round country can find one who saw brown with father dead body indeed anything else might have aroused suspicion there be only one hope that may get back reward although blair believe cicero intend to work for hope lie in chance that brown whoever be may have taken away body for blackmail in case may get letter demanding money probably large sum must pay have father remains brought back murder alan ah be difficult part when brown stole body did not intend to commit murder came about in unforeseen way danger that may be arrested for murder may keep brown from applying for blackmail always supposing sophy that such be object in case may never recover poor father be afraid not however must live in hope conversation ended in usual unsatisfactory way on face of there be nothing to be done for alan must obtain clue brown if brown be indeed guilty person have managed so cleverly that have completely cut trail even offer of reward brought forth fresh information mystery be more mystery than ever in capacity of trustee alan have looked through paper of dead man found document letter relating to life in jamaica yet there be plenty dealing with doings in south africa twenty year before have left kingston with child sophy brought to england placed in hampstead convent then sailed for cape have made fortune there fifteen year after returned to buy moat house settled sophy came to live with have passed quiet peaceful time until sudden death so far be clear jamaica life still remained mystery when died be over sixty what have done with during forty year have lived in west indie joe must have told a mysterious a master have disappeared even if have remained alan must have got nothing out of old sailor a have be proved by thorold inspector be a dumb a oyster did marlow ever mention jamaica alan asked mr phelps when next met once twice in casual sort of way said have sailed good deal amongst island joe be sailor wonder if marlow went in for trading there be not impossible said rector that fact even if knew to be true must throw light on disappearance of body know have good mind to go to jamaica to kingston to make inquiry west indian island area be not so very large if marlow have be trader there twenty year ago must still be remembered amongst might come across one who knew of past life might assented phelps with amount of sarcasm surprising in so mild man if marlow be real name two be sitting over wine in twilight amid glimmer of shaded candle last remark of rector so surprised alan that turned suddenly knocked glass off table after have apologized for accident after dbris have be collected by scandalized butler squire asked mr phelps what meant be hard to say what mean rector sipped port meditatively marlow be always mystery to undeniably millionaire gentleman alan while here man of clean life have met people in worthy parson dabbled little in share who knew in south africa be highly respected there made million honestly so far a million can be made honestly in gambling day always felt that there be mystery about man be warrender who gave clue ah warrender came with marlow to heathton yes there be mystery about warrender told that have met marlow at kingston jamaica afterwards doctor settled in new orleans there met wife who be on stage did not do very well so mr warrender urged to return to england did so met marlow by chance in london where renewed acquaintance sorry to see that warrender be so unfortunate marlow brought down here where did very well think did well enough to have supplied mr warrender with diamond sir alan speak evil of dead did not get diamond from marlow legitimately dear boy from husband where did get practice must have brought in little enough wo say that fact think be that there be understanding between two men that marlow gave warrender money must have given good deal then jewel represent lot seems like kind of blackmail sir on point alan must prefer not to give opinion warrender helped to steal body of patron mused alan strange about idea of false name well be at dinner one evening lady have retired be alone with marlow warrender talking over wine just a might be now alan doctor have taken little too much on one occasion addressed other man a beauchamp marlow flashed one fierce glance at sobered at once made remark on incident at time stuck in memory then think that mr marlow be called beauchamp in jamaica warrender slip gave that impression said rector cautiously how very strange murmured alan toying with glass do know will of course be trustee sophy trustee why yes money go to doe most of there be legacy to myself joe brill miss parsh sophy get rest on condition what condition one be that marries other that pay two thousand year to man called herbert beauchamp be rector turn to be startled bless same name must appear so perhaps herbert beauchamp be relative of so called marlow money be to be paid into occidental bank of london for transmission to where be know now that have told so much will take first instalment to occidental bank make inquiry about man manager may be able in measure to account for hope so hope so cried bewildered rector for mystery seem to to deepen meanwhile went on alan calmly will see mr warrender may know something will be useful to think so rector said doubtfully bless why must be long afterwards that met doctor in new orleans well might have told about marlow at event will see know added alan curling lip mr warrender be fond of money amenable to bribery thorold be usually correct in forecast of what must happen time be quite wrong widow received kindly told absolutely nothing acting on advice given by cicero have be searching through paper of late husband have not found what sought have found quite enough to show that there be mystery in mr marlow past life mystery be sufficiently important to be worth money be intention of astute woman to play own game game have for stake goodly portion of sophy million have desire for partner to cicero to wish to join soon gave go by when alan came upon scene gave to understand that knew nothing intention be to prepare bombshell alone when be ready to explode in sophy presence that knowledge must be profitable to from financial point of view felt pretty secure for same blood ran in vein of clara maria warrender of cicero gramp wish must help mr thorold said knew nothing of mr marlow husband never spoke to about life in jamaica did leave paper lot of rubbish nothing must enlighten a to mr marlow past can see oh be so sorry burnt did not believe went away with conviction that be playing deep game meanwhile new personage have come upon scene man who told astonishing story who made le astonishing claim slight dark bright eyed man accurately dressed foreign looking presented card at moat house with request to see miss marlow captain lestrange exclaimed sophy who be thomas look like foreigner miss will show in yes said visitor be announced almost immediately started theatrically when saw girl sophy annoyed by manner drew back captain lestrange queried coldly captain lestrange be reply father chapter xii strange story sophy screamed fainted at extraordinary announcement indeed appeared to so very ridiculous that felt more inclined to laugh however controlled feeling spoke very quietly so quietly that visitor be somewhat disconcerted why do make strange assertion asked looking again at card because be true what proof can give of truth three proof sophy if may call may not interrupted girl flushing be miss marlow for present assented man with ironical smile soon will be miss lestrange three proof then have firstly can tell story of how lost secondly there be resemblance between thirdly have certificate of birth oh be easily proved can assure shivered spoke very positively what if claim must be substantiated looked at glanced into near mirror saw with dismay that there be strong resemblance like lestrange a called be slight in build small in stature also have dark hair brilliant eye contour of face chiseling of feature resembled own finally have that spanish look knew possessed so far a outward appearance went might well have be daughter of rakish looking stranger smiled from furtive glance into mirror guessed thought see glass proclaims truth said think of supposed father richard marlow tall fair blue eyed saxon in look like have spanish look posse grace color of andalusia always thought must grow up beautiful dear mother be loveliest woman in jamaica did not answer color ebbed from cheek courage from heart be true enough that in way resembled mr marlow man might be father after yet repelled glance of glittering eye gave feeling of repulsion be bad man of felt certain father fought against doubt with courage born of despair prepared to defend until help arrived thought flew to alan be champion desired expect guardian mr thorold in quarter of hour said in hard voice will be good enough to relate story to prefer to hear when be present believe mr marlow treated a daughter feel to be daughter do expect to believe to rush into arm without proof have shown one proof chance resemblance count for nothing what about certificate produced pocketbook took out piece of paper be copy of entry in register of church of st thomas at kingston will find correct marie marie what do mean paper will inform said lestrange coolly sophy read certificate truly seemed regular enough stated that

of evil alan have own uncomfortable feeling of decided to tell one not even phelps although phelps be very good friend in taking resolution alan made very serious mistake mistake found out when be too late to remedy injudicious silence have just time to dress for dinner before guest arrived knowing that mr phelps be dainty in eating mr hester have prepared meal such a good rector loved alan wine be of best did not stint so mr phelps addressed to solemn business of dinner with conviction that must enjoy alan kept news to until be in smoking room then when guest be sipping aromatic black coffee

be guilty be devoted to master warrender possessed master secret joe might have killed have run away to escape arrest alan shook head there be suspicion against joe said why must have run away guilty conscience perhaps man who have enough to commit murder take corpse of victim back to vault must have conscience to speak of besides boy who slept in joe room say be not out on night of course not said rector then ca be joe well give up said alan grimly go to london to morrow to solve mystery did left next morning be away for three day leaving mr phelps to console protect sophy from annoyance on part of lestrange who remained in village captain propitiated mr timber by payment of week board lodging in advance be enough to convince landlady that be most estimable person naturally enough cicero gramp came into contact equally naturally cicero did best to find out what business captain have in heathton be easy task for lestrange be guarded in speech did not at first encourage advance judging very truly that mr gramp be scoundrel must be dangerous finally decided that gentleman in if properly handled must be converted into useful tool determined to make use of in capacity intimacy began one night when cicero having taken more than be good for allowed tongue to wag more freely than usual lestrange thus became aware that must dispense useful knowledge tell what be noble captain said cicero with drunken gravity be clever man be why must get reward by working together really friend hardly see what can do be stranger here be why ought to work together be not in part for nothing gossip of servant ah gramp looked significantly at lestrange oh heard how be turned out of moat house what do mean dear friend asked captain in silky tone oh that have got game on so have let work

marrying that girl if let if let what do mean mean why hate young thorold want few thousand oh how do intend to get never mind if work together then cedant arma tog mean be soldier be lawyer so be right goo'night staggered off leaving lestrange with much food for meditation outcome of be that next morning captain met cicero halfway later in day sophy received note from lestrange asking to see if must not consent added mr thorold must be placed in position of great danger after reflection sophy sent for mr phelps decided to see scamp so on saturday morning captain lestrange be received in library of rectory well sir said phelps what have to say about mr thorold only be reply that be scoundrel indeed rector stopped sophy exclamation on ground on ground that be who stole body of richard marlow chapter xv trouble rector sophy looked at one then at lestrange smiling confident knew alan too well to credit so monstrous accusation for one moment indeed idea appeared so ridiculous to sophy that laughed outright lestrange frowned laugh now said will weep later what say be true thorold stole body of father supposed father sneered for say what like be child acknowledge relationship retorted girl with spirit never will mr marlow be father will always think of a such a to accusation of mr thorold be merely trick to cause trouble suppose will say next that murdered dr warrender say

drawled other coolly see mr thorold be scientific doe not look upon deed a crime what do mean by asked mr phelps sharply mean that mr thorold be once medical student at least have be told a much be true quite true said sophy opening eye for in innocence did not see what man meant rector did winced anticipated accuser mean that mr thorold stole body for scientific purpose for dissection yes mr thorold be enthusiast in surgery marlow rather must say beauchamp died of obscure disease warrender thorold removed body to hold post mortem on be men seen by cicero gramp see know about probably carried body to moor hut to dissect whether quarreled not know do know if be thorold who killed doctor say be that two stole body oh indeed remarked mr phelps ironically thorold put remains of dr warrender back in vault suppose what did do with marlow body know buried on moor very likely mr thorold have not key of vault cried sophy indignantly have be stolen by quiet gentleman so understand

new clothes rolled into room pax vobiscum said rector turned angry glance on be not time for playing fool said cuttingly be cunning rogue day will overreach now then out with lie lie scorn to pervert truth reverend sir will tell truth in puris naturalibus hope not threw in rector laughing in spite of at abuse of quotation mean reverend sir went on old scoundrel coolly that in hut on heath found corpse of dr warrender not body of father said sophy saw that taken away from vault undoubtedly miss marlow body be carried to hut for purpose of dissection by mr thorold be foolish enough to leave behind evidence of iniquitous purpose behold cicero produced lancet in most dramatic manner nota bene said grandly phelps bent forward took instrument in hand have ivory handle on be carved two letter t found in hut asked did reverend sir must have be dropped by mr thorold if not how did come there pause for reply why did not tell mr thorold about demanded sophy bided time to blackmail cried with harsh word miss sophia certainly must have demanded small payment from mr thorold have shown that mr thorold insulted matter not how nemo impune lacessit miss sophia determined to punish young man military friend be good enough to enter into partnership with for purpose of clearing up matter hence told of discovery there be more to be said save put in lestrange who appeared to be getting somewhat weary of cicero cumbersome diction that here be proof that be thorold who carried off body do believe now in guilt reserve opinion said rector who must not acknowledge to that thing looked black for alan cried sophy rising if fifty men with fifty lancet came to tell story must not believe word against mr thorold can explain believe in firmly to prove belief will marry a soon a can will hing of sort cried lestrange losing temper be father command to come with be own mistress refuse said quietly ca frighten believe story do said rector when mr thorold come back will doubt be able to explain presence in heathton on night also loss of lancet will explain to police cried lestrange in threatening manner said cicero apprehensive at mention of natural enemy let take counsel together can not matter be adjusted so that mr thorold may escape reward of iniquitous proceeding sophy looked at with satirical smile then turned to address lestrange a senior partner in firm of scoundrel how much do want asked captain winced did not like question to be put quite so crudely understand said think do how much do require to hold tongue say five thousand whispered mr gramp lestrange shook off marched to door very upright indignant will let know price ah said sophy scornfully when have seen police finished marched out cicero have to follow turned at door winked will not go to police said in hurried voice might suggest five be off scoundrel cried rector indignantly thrust out then resumed seat looked at sophy well said alan can explain said decisively if lestrange go to police wo said cicero will stop that meanwhile wait for alan talked on for long time must come to conclusion undoubtedly alan have be near vault on night have be in hut have said nothing of thing to one certainly looked suspicious sophy insisted that lover must must explain in spite of appearance have faith in alan honesty in alan honor same evening dined with rector without even miss vicky in attendance towards end of meal alan walked in unexpectedly looked somewhat downcast there be sign of fear in bearing after greeting have be exchanged sat down with rector sophy be anxious to inform of accusation have be brought against how went business asked mr phelps badly for be reply lestrange certainly arrived by boat said came by saw name achille lestrange on passenger list of negress ah devil speaks true sometimes said rector what about beauchamp yes yes cried sophy did find did see replied alan quietly heard of beauchamp be dead chapter xvi alan defense dead repeated sophy after pause then be mr beauchamp really father relative think be mr marlow dear said lover gravely doubt father intended to feign death to escape lestrange must seem that overdid really died saw manager of occidental bank informed that have received letter telling that beauchamp be dead how long ago be little over week who wrote letter that refused to tell have seen mr beauchamp to whom money be to be paid never father have informed that have left income to beauchamp draft for money be to be sent to certain place where know manager sent draft be returned to with letter stating that man be dead for own part believe that mr marlow be beauchamp plan to hide from lestrange have succeeded only too well mr phelps now joined in then understand alan that think marlow be really dead do if have only feigned death then beauchamp must be receiving income in opinion two men be one same believe lestrange story so far humph said rector who be really of same opinion let leave question for moment talk of other say that lestrange arrived on day by boat asserted that did saw passenger list if have not be on board name must not have be there even must not falsify passenger list then idea that lestrange be quiet gentleman be false must be sir man lestrange mean be not in england when quiet gentleman lived in village believe brown have to do with stealing of body murder then brown be not lestrange who be know alan cried sophy for if what lestrange stated be true hypocrisy be detestable be not straightforward with indeed be said with stare of astonishment have told of discovery why must deceive why indeed said girl bitterly know how much love yet keep in dark about matter concern matter if one have right to know might have have inkling of what meant for face turned dark red nevertheless held well in hand looked inquiringly at rector what doe mean sir think can guess said phelps more coldly than have ever before spoken to alan upon word sophy rose from chair closed mouth with hand cried despairingly ca bear captain lestrange hesitated ah said alan fiercely might have guessed have be making mischief well what doe say that stole father body alan stole body yes chimed in rector further say that took to hut on heath where warrender corpse be found oh indeed cried young man derisively did murder warrender too alan alan oh jest if love alan tell truth sophy what do mean pushed away plate rose do believe man tale for one moment be man to violate grave to drag remains of man respected honored to light of day must be mad to think of thing how dare bring forward terrible such dastardly accusation for what reason doe say that did out of revenge expect said phelps dislike alan say took poor marlow body to dissect base lie upon gossip of having be medical student suppose cried young man now thoroughly angry will thrash scoundrel within inch of life oh alan be so glad so thankful said so did mr phelps did do do of course did do why must phelps alan forgot respect for rector in rage do believe lying story knowing a do believe must say that lestrange be very dangerous man make out strong case against oh let hear on what ground alan sophy came forward took by lapel of coat before tell anything confess if have kept anything from looked at in puzzled manner then light seemed to dawn upon glanced at rector now understand mr phelps jarks have told told what asked rector with well feigned ignorance see see alan sat down again be right sophy kept that from only that must not be worried so lestrange found out from jarks suppose be at heathton on night of funeral yes yes oh alan be true true of course be why must not be true doe fact of having be here corroborate cock bull story ought to know better sophy too phelps must believe did cried girl told that lied must admit that thing looked bad for a put why did tell be at heathton on night why did come be there serious reason for such secrecy reason whatsoever replied young man frankly save trifling one did not want to bother sophy with suspicion yes came by train from bournemouth returned at half past eleven have to go to station to keep secret know jarks saw in graveyard about ten a wished to keep visit quiet for reason have told gave something to hold tongue appears that did not suppose lestrange bribed well said rector not exactly jarks in cup told that scoundrel gramp told lestrange oh so there be two of in league to make trouble proper pair of scoundrel said sophy more composedly have not told why came came said lover determined now to make clean breast of to look at vault to see that be safe rector uttered exclamation of astonishment did expect then that there must be foul play well hardly know sir be way after mr marlow received that letter from west indie doubtless warned that lestrange be on track be much worried must not tell reason kept speaking of shock have have might cause death know if scoundrel will let body rest in grave ' said in fit of passion asked to whom alluded must say no more when died so unexpectedly word came back to wondered if have enemy who might disturb remains day after funeral felt so bothered about must not rest without coming back to see if be well found nothing wrong nothing sir be in churchyard for about quarter of hour examined door of vault saw everything be right a came away met jarks rest know saw sign of tramp in churchyard none expect be sleeping when be there according to story be after midnight when vault be opened alan said sophy much relieved how be did not know at heathton station that be here did not go to heathton station stopped at murbury walked from there across heath went back same way did so simply to keep tongue of gossip quiet did not want to be worried sophy after said after pause beyond chance word of father have reason to think that anything be wrong ah if have only stayed in churchyard night must have prevented trouble vault must never have be broken into poor warrender must still be alive rector nodded approval of speech poured out glass of wine poor man sadly needed lestrange accusation have be disproved still there remained evidence of cicero sophy put question be in rector mind captain lestrange brought cicero here alan said abruptly cicero mean declared that be in hut on moor night be not cried young thorold hotly be never near hut why must have be ask a have to walk to from murbury spend quarter of hour in churchyard have time to cross moor distance to hut of course know believe cicero well how can prove be there said impatiently found something there belonged to

quickly into sitting position stared at visitor of men last have expected to see be one have so basely accused thought flashed into mind that thorold have come to have out with lestrange fault be not wanting in certain viperish courage rose to greet enemy with smile cloaked many thing good evening mr thorold said with wary glance to what be indebted for visit will know that before long replied

defend to use favorite phrase in open court if necessary word be enough protested lestrange be wrong to accuse very wrong did out of spite really believed what wished to believe interrupted alan in turn be intention to have given thrashing captain lestrange sir man started up white with rage have changed mind pursued alan without noticing interruption now intend to take course if at once leave heathton will bring charge against of defamation of character oh lestrange shrugged shoulder be true english shop keeper man must protect by more honorable mean know very well what be about sir wish

lestrange captain struck breast be while be still posing in very effective attitude door opened mr timber ushered in joe brill hardly have closed when brill took step forward staring at lestrange a though have seen vision lestrange turned white time not with rage with fear in silence ensued alan looked from one to other wondering what revelation be about to be made joe be first to speak swab cried joe d d if ai captain jean chapter xviii portion of truth joe be not in least changed wherever have be in nefarious transaction have be engaged be still mahogany colored tough old sailor whom nothing must surprise alarm after having greeted lestrange hitched up trouser in true nautical style touched forehead wished to see sir said to alan took sidelong glance at captain that polished

mr thorold joe alan kept irate seaman back will deal with gentleman in better fashion sit down joe while talk over joe nodded sat down on chair placed directly before door with glare showed noticed resented action lestrange resumed seat be too clever man not to recognize that joe cunning must dislocate plan be evidently determined to fight to last at present held tongue for wanted to hear what joe must say preferred for moment to remain strictly on defensive be with thankful heart alan thorold realized value of joe a ally at one time have really believed that lestrange be truly sophy father although must never have admitted relationship still be satisfactory to know that man have claim on obedience knowledge of lestrange falsehood cleared air somewhat for one thing proved conclusively that captain have come to blackmail girl claim to be father be doubtless made in hope that must accompany back to jamaica must give control of money failing lestrange have long since realized that there be doing anything with sophy in paternal way there remained chance that to preserve marlow memory from stain might buy silence thus lestrange argued alan with eye on man expressive face guessed thought answered lestrange said with decision wo get one penny will see about be rejoinder of course be going to see about now will be brought to bearing sir joe say that man be jean lestrange yes sir

barkham of falmouth believed master be innocent know 'd where be what be new name 't be wrote letter saying a captain jean be on way to england to make trouble barkham muttered lestrange ah be always

whip hand of a in jamaica thought 'd murdered munseer achille from quarreling about coming after wife master did do swear did more like did added joe with look of contempt though dare say ai man enough to stick knife into one alan thought for few minute then turned to lestrange think must see that have failed round said quietly plot to pas a miss marlow father be of use now accusation against be not worth considering a have shown if necessary can defend on whole captain lestrange have better go back to jamaica not without price said adventurer ah blackmail well always thought be at bottom of man with clean hand honorable intention must not have joined hand with confessed rogue like cicero gramp may ask on what ground demand money can prove beauchamp killed cousin what good will do be dead beyond malice ay that be said joe approvingly be gone where wo get reckon will go other way when time come blasted swab lestrange writhing under insult jumped up poured out volley of abuse seaman bore quite unmoved will not go without money raged good sum too otherwise will see girl if annoy miss marlow again will have arrested said alan sharply permit sort of thing in england will put story

shoulder will have to give that thrashing after let do sir put in mr brill who be simply spoiling for row stepped towards lestrange man courage genuine enough of kind suddenly gave way before ferocity of sailor sprang up ran into inner room bolted door joe uttered roar of baffled tiger never mind joe be quit of now will leave heathton will wait for at station muttered joe following young squire out of door 'tai right that swab must get off scot free outside rain have ceased alan looked at watch finding that be late turned face towards home suddenly recollected that joe have not explained absence well joe where have be asked sharply after joe pointed thumb over shoulder when master body be carried away thought that shark might have done know 'd be coming from jamaica so went to southampton to

walked off in great haste young squire pursued way to abbey farm way wondered if joe sudden departure hinted at unwillingness to talk of brown will ask about man to morrow muttered alan on morrow have other matter to attend to while be at breakfast card be brought to jumped up with joyful cry inspector blair said throwing down card show up mr hester ah wonder what have found out chapter xix reappearance be glad to see blair sit down have breakfast aha inspector rubbed hand a looked at well spread table never say no to good offer thank mr thorold will peck bit be looking well blair never felt better in life mr thorold have good cause to look jolly enjoyed holiday doubt said alan a assisted officer liberally to ham egg where did spend in brighton pleasant place brighton blair looked so jocular chuckled in so pleasant manner that squire guessed have good news however resolved to let blair tell story in own way what took to brighton of place asked tentatively well might guess joe brill took joe brill inspector nodded followed there have seen joe tell be at southampton in london doubt clever fellow joe know how to hold tongue well mr thorold hope trouble about matter of lost body will soon be at end blair alan bent forward in state of great excitement have found out something about yes enough to gain thousand pound not enough to gain two thousand pound blair face fell intend to get that also however have learned about theft of mr marlow body how be removed why be removed by jove how did find out through joe brill somehow suspected joe from first sovereign gave cicero gramp know always fancied there be something behind anxiety to get man away so have watched applied for leave of absence when left heathton followed a tourist chuckled blair oh assure mr thorold make very good tourist went to brighton yes direct to brighton went there found out about mean to say that stole body ay do with best intention too be short man cicero gramp saw with warrender be short man replied blair finishing coffee then why did not tell alan burst out angrily saw last night yet said nothing knew how anxious miss marlow be about loss of father body not father corrected inspector achille lestrange be father what alan started from seat know that know elopement in jamaica kidnapping of marie lestrange whom know a sophy marlow coming of jean lestrange to blackmail girl rest of see mr thorold interviewed joe brill morning told about conversation with rascal be posted up to date sir joe brill have business to keep in dark said squire angrily must have relieved mind miss marlow miss lestrange hinted blair sir sophia marlow be sophia marlow will remain until change name for mine father be dead jean lestrange have claim on sophia marlow mr inspector if please well well a please sha quarrel about name have anything to smoke mr thorold alan got excellent cigar returned to point why did joe keep miss marlow in dark asked acted under order mr thorold whose order mr marlow rather must say mr beauchamp blair alan gasped out name face be white be appalled at news for moment believed inspector must have taken leave of sens oh dare say astonishment be natural said inspector lighting cigar be astonished to find dead man alive kicking yet must not have be for suspected truth alan have not yet recovered from amazement suspected that mr marlow be alive said faintly on what evidence on circumstantial evidence said blair smartly when examined coffin with mr phelps noticed what did not at side small hole be bored in inconspicuous place shell of leaden case be pierced only one inference must be drawn from that man have designedly be buried alive design must have be carried out by warrender short man suspected joe from fact of having given sovereign to cicero watched presuming belief to be correct made certain that sooner later must rejoin master a say went to brighton followed close on heel to boarding house in lansdowne place there saw mr marlow did recognize of course while be living at heathton have seen mr marlow several time on business made attempt when saw at brighton to disguise not thinking suppose that clever scheme to frustrate lestrange must come to light in way blair did not know about lestrange then true enough soon heard whole story mr marlow told to a may guess be in great way about having discovered seeing mean of evading truth told insisted upon in fact now know how did come about blair held up hand mr thorold said will leave mr marlow think have better continue to call so to tell own history can do better than besides added inspector rising briskly have business to do what sort of business can judge for want to come with where what to do to see mr warrender see be husband who carried out scheme of feigned death to deceive lestrange marlow accused of having murdered achille in jamaica be afraid that captain jean must have arrested now warrender be in beauchamp house at falmouth jamaica when mr lestrange died knew about be belief added inspector slowly beauchamp be innocent a asserts to be warrender knew a much dear blair protested alan in case warrender must have told marlow truth must have stopped jean lestrange from making mischief dare say must did not warrender dear mr thorold be blackmailing scoundrel who assumed mask of friendship to bamboozle marlow have considerable difficulty in impressing view on marlow for strange to say believed in doctor joe did not however joe told few fact about warrender practice in jamaica showed that doctor be not disinterested person pretended to be be sure warrender knew beauchamp to be innocent kept fact quiet so a to retain hold on man get money out of now do understand why want to see widow replied alan not following inspector hypothesis if warrender kept truth from marlow must most certainly have kept from wife woman must have babbled even against own interest a woman always do mr warrender can tell nothing feel sure of that forget that doctor may have left confession of knowledge must have done said alan doubtfully must have be foolish thing when do criminal do other than foolish thing be blair response murderer usually return to scene of crime a often a not set out detail in writing be impossible to account for action of human being mr thorold must not surprise in least to hear that warrender have written out whole story in diary if so wife must have found amongst paper will be disposed to sell at long price if have found document must have shown to to sophy before now by mean if knew that marlow be alive then of course must realize that document be valuable belief to be dead humph said alan seem very certain that document exists perhaps be too sanguine admitted blair mr marlow gave full account of what happened on night achille be murdered moreover swore that be innocent believe a to warrender be scoundrel be sure that like scoundrel have left record of villainy in black white if be so can prove marlow innocence can defy lestrange by time alan inspector be walking along road led to heathton be bright sunny morning alan be in high spirit how happy blair news must make sophy warrender what about death asked doe marlow know who killed strange a may seem doe not mr thorold be a ignorant a that death be mystery still if warrender be killed on heath ca explain mr thorold hear marlow story will be a much in dark a be suspect lestrange so did replied alan speaking in past tense learned for certain that lestrange be not in england on night of murder proved that too said blair thoughtfully yet ca help thinking there be trickery lestrange be at good samaritan yes dancing on miss marlow doorstep in hope of getting money doe receive letter know why merely idea of mine will tell later on what think be keeping very much in dark blair said alan somewhat piqued care to show incomplete work replied inspector bluntly believe can unravel whole of mystery want to show raw material let work out own way mr thorold judge by result a please so long a do care how go about be working for two thousand pound said blair intend to let one else have that blackguard tramp must like to be man alan laughed have already made clutch at by accusing of theft of mr marlow body inspector nodded smiled grimly two be working in unison said rubbing hand will catch by way said thorold be mr marlow coming back here to be caught by lestrange think not be not such fool if want to see must go to brighton will go to morrow blair be most anxious to hear story of night strange story more like fiction than truth truth be always stranger than fiction blair assented walked on through steep lane led into high street of village a breasted mr marry with basket on arm met be evidently excited well mr marry said alan kindly what be poor dear be dead after cried panting woman declare mr thorold must have knocked down wi ' feather when saw saw who why mr brown sir quiet gentleman have come back chapter xx amazement op alan thorold mr marry delivered startling piece of news with air of triumph did not guess for one moment how very important be in what peril placed quiet gentleman came back last night continued told with finger how have be lying ill in london town poor dear took into head to go for jaunt say went by night train meant to have come back to next morning nasty influenza took kept away be that glad be come back ca tell cried mr marry joyfully for do pay most reg'lar give not bit of trouble innocent babe that be having imparted news hurried on down lane two men stood looking at one brown back again said alan now will know truth if know said blair dryly be le excited than companion doubt if will learn much from mr thorold if have anything to do with murder must not have come back must have something to do with man have forgotten that be who stole key of vault from desk said blair pointedly have forgotten that did not use key be joe brill who opened vault indeed where did joe get key not from mr phelps for still have key have cried alan suddenly did joe get from brown did not key be not used at there be third key in existence of mr phelps be aware marlow have have made to provide against contingency arose have always resolved to feign death must lestrange track so kept third key joe used on night well even granting that such be case why must brown have stolen key how must have known that be in desk think discussed point before replied inspector composedly that came to conclusion that brown overheard conversation with mr phelps on day of funeral where be going to see brown be determined to get truth out of blair looked at well mr thorold said suppose will do harm for to see man meanwhile will go on to mr warrender ought to come with arrest think have sufficient evidence to procure warrant mr thorold charge of murder be serious see pooh pooh want arrested for murder on charge of breaking open desk must do certainly well go see mr thorold while interview mr warrender will call along at cottage later need let brown out of sight until come will arrest if wish will take risk very good be off with abrupt nod alan ran down lane blair looked after with queer smile on dry face have own idea regarding termination of alan attempt to make brown mysterious speak out mr warrender be at home when inspector called at first felt must not see for idea of coming into contact with police be abhorrent to wondered if blair must have discovered relationship existed between cicero be anxiety to ascertain made grant inspector interview if brother be playing false more knew about plan better must be able to frustrate mr warrender be capable woman have genius for intrigue be quite decided that must hold own even against trained intelligence of police officer so came about that gentleman in question be shown into drawing room meretricious gaudy apartment betrayed in furniture decoration tawdry taste of doctor widow came forward to receive in elaborate tea gown of pink silk trimmed with lace in spite of early hour wore quantity of jewel blair have eye for beauty must not deny that lady be fine woman though perhaps too much of ponderous type wondered why did not wear mourning must have cared little for husband thought to appear in gay color so soon after untimely end in truth mr warrender have never professed to be affectionate wife have married for home made secret of good morning said with sharp glance at blair impassive face understand that belong to police that wish to see why can not conceive if will permit to explain will soon give reason said inspector in best manner may sit down thank now can talk at ease suppose be about sad end of poor husband said in tone of grief gay attire somewhat belied have found out truth hope to do so with assistance looked up suddenly if think killed poor lamb be mistaken said can account for action on night policeman last be hurled at blair with object of keeping well in mind of condescension in receiving never have slightest suspicion of protested errand have to do with quite different matter might suggest added trifle testily be usually addressed a inspector blair oh of course if insist upon cried with shrug inspector blair will do will do very well thank paused stared hard at expensive tea gown aggressive jewelry until widow became restive be rich asked abruptly what have got to do with cried mr warrender furiously remember be talking to lady to rich lady to poor one upon soul be too much mind business inspector blair be business retorted keeping well in hand merely asked question because if be not rich then come to make so what do mean answer question first be rich took good look at dress jewel said sullenly be not husband left fairly well off not with so much money a expected then must not object to making more eye lighted up with fire of greed must must be dying to leave dull village take up position in london can not do without money paused then clapped hand see cried sophy marlow be going to compensate for death of husband must be easy enough with million have be sure must assented blair coolly mean to supply with money for nothing have to do with matter good deal mr thorold miss marlow will rely on advice oh miss marlow jeered mr warrender sitting up be name be inspector blair be sure be marie lestrange leaned forward caught wrist in grip of steel so know truth then said give confession what confession what do mean cried trying to release hand confession left by husband in tell story of achille lestrange murder know yes do yes do lie shook wrist know that marlow never murdered captain lestrange let go wrist cried mr warrender succeeded in wrenching free what do mean by behaving like know nothing about matter there blair jumped up made for door very good then lose money have got for come back come back followed to door laid hand on shoulder be in hurry be there be there money in if have confession yes how much will talk of when know truth have confession yes have thought might with safety admit a much found whole story of mr mr lestrange mr beauchamp amongst business paper husband paper must say be signed witnessed in new orleans seems warrender be dying there wanted to tell mr beauchamp marlow mean truth so have confession drawn up by lawyer afterwards when got well did not destroy beauchamp be innocent of murder then yes knocked achille lestrange down did not kill aha thought so chuckled blair rubbing hand who did mr warrender drew back with look of cunning on face be telling said relapsing into speech of people part with secret unless get price name price two thousand pound what cried inspector two thousand pound for clearing memory of dead man dear lady five hundred be nearer mark two thousand repeated if sophy marlow have million left by supposed father can well afford humph will see must speak to mr thorold first have confession have safely put away be intention to have seen sophy marlow about thought 'd wait to see what price must get put in blair quite so be woman of business if get price burn that confession dare not can have arrested remember snapped finger pooh said care for threat be one chance of making money be going to take two thousand pound nothing will think over said blair be to have refusal of confession mind what do want to make money too certainly said blair with irony be man of business laughed took leave of in very amiable frame of mind when have gone smirked in front of mirror took long look at two thousand pound cried own saving be not so old after will run away from cicero marry again have have have made deal time went in to luncheon with most excellent appetite while interview be taking place alan have be at mr harry cottage having received order to contrary ushered into sitting room there sat quiet gentleman in gray suit at sight of alan started violently good day mr brown said visitor looking closely at have come to see about key stole be dumb believe not deaf so no doubt follow meaning quiet gentleman made step forward to amazement of visitor spoke alan said alan thorold young man dropped into chair white shaking knew that voice knew what be coming with laugh quiet gentleman pulled off wig beard know alan asked richard marlow gasped alan herbert beauchamp be quiet reply chapter xxi story of past come alan said beauchamp after pause need not be tongue tied with astonishment sent blair on to tell have happened so must have known be alive yes yes disguise stammered young man expected to see brown be not brown never must have be for when be here have seen at same time be all right boy be not brown a say who brown be know no more than do be brown now with emphasis brown will remain until can show with safety a richard marlow not intended to stick to name no if blair be right scoundrel warrender have left paper to prove innocence will take own name disguise be plot between blair be necessary must be on spot so thought be a good mask a oh depend upon alan be perfectly safe here from jean lestrange a spoke beauchamp be putting on wig beard when be done to satisfaction seated on chair opposite to alan looking very image of quiet gentleman thorold did not wonder that mr marry have be deceived completeness of disguise must have deceived cleverer woman still said doubtfully if real brown must reappear will have arrested for murder of warrender said beauchamp quietly yes be convinced be guilty else why did steal key of vault blair told about that must surely be tool of jean lestrange not man be aware of blair saw passenger list be certain that quiet gentleman killed warrender because did not see blow struck be insensible at time be long story to make thing perfectly clear must begin at beginning one moment alan beauchamp crossed to door turned key want mr marry to come in will hear voice believing to be dumb will speak low come nearer to chair first tell how sophy be very well much cast down think be dead that body have be stolen oh beauchamp cried alan passionately why did not trust sophy must have spared many unhappy hour wish now that have told acted for best have little time for thought expected daily that lestrange must appear if have only considered matter rather more there be done must make best of sophy tear will be turned to smile shortly if indeed still love knowing that be not father old man sighed need have fear on score said alan with faint smile be getting over first shock of surprise sophy must have nothing to do with jean lestrange although half believed story always insists that be true father will welcome back with greatest joy must welcome secretly secretly why must innocence be established must surely reappear a richard marlow what have whole story in paper alan will spend rest of life under true name of beauchamp live on two thousand year left in will sophy can marry take rest of money will travel take joe with well perhaps be best thing to do said thorold tell how be that manager of occidental bank reported dead joe wrote to by order to say so when joe came to at brighton told how death of warrender have complicated matter be afraid lest must be traced perhaps accused of second murder so thought best to put about be dead end pursuit if have only trusted sir trouble must have be avoided merited confidence think know know indeed on day when spoke to of probability that body must not be allowed to rest in grave have mind to tell somehow moment passed even then have designed plot of feigning death be only way saw of escaping lestrange tell story from beginning said alan know only scrap beginning be in jamaica alan said beauchamp sadly trouble arose out of love have for sophy mother poor zelia if only have married must have made good husband a be chose achille lestrange rou gambler spendthrift scoundrel must never tell sophy what bad man father be treated poor zelia abominably be that altogether fault beauchamp joe
