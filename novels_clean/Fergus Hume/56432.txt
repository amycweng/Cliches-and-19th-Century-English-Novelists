know of matter asked so abruptly that fuller looked up in surprise why what can know save what have read in paper nothing of course never suggested that do know anything use going over old ground so wish to hear what have learned from report very little if will be so precise said alan after pause in fourth class rotherhithe boarding house frequented chiefly by seaman man called baldwin grison be

that such be case police dont know everythingat least inspector didnt although know great deal more now said latimer removing pipe single room occupied by deceased be tumbled upside down so be evident that assassin be looking for fruit of crime whether found what wanted be questionable what be asked fuller interested in mystery ill tell that later although really cant say for certain if be right

inquest inspector moonhes rotherhithe chap in charge of caseadvertised made inquiry got hold of sister somehow at event turned up yesterday appeared at inquest very day who be sister elderly shrimp of

open verdict be brought inthe sole thing must be done to morrow sister who seems to have loved in spite of degradation be taking away corpse for burial where be to be buried latimer looked up slowly in churchyard of belstone sussex said alan sat up very straight manner expressed unbounded astonishment thats father parish gasped yes churchyard be attached to building father preaches in son said latimer dryly odd coincidence isnt have murdered man to do with belstone asked fuller in bewildered manner thats what want to find out alan cant remember name never heard of yet name baldwin grison be not common one must certainly have remembered have be mentioned to be odd certainly a belstone isnt exactly hub of universe grison baldwin grison fuller shook head cant recall to be sure may have be in village twenty year ago since say that have lived since time in rotherhithe be only seven year of age then so can remember nothing father may know ill ask when go down week end there thing wish to ask what be that romantic thing lift case out of commonplace only inspector moon know what be about to tell informed with recommendation not to make public then why do tell said fuller quickly be wise quite wise responded friend imperturbably because asked moon permission to take into confidence fuller looked puzzled why again dicky replied indirectly seems that grison unlucky beggar have one

occasionally sometimes money jotty ran errand for man be sole person admitted to room well well well said alan impatiently im coming to if dont hurry said latimer coolly jotty on one occasion entered room found grison nursing between handswhat do think how deuce must know peacock of jewel alan stared cast swift glance at photograph of pretty girl on mantelpiece peacock of jewel repeated under breath jewelled peacock if like grison put away when saw boy that have such article be quite certain a jotty hasnt imagination to describe thing now in spite of search inspector moon cant find that peacock may be sure that after jotty told tale inspector searched very thoroughly well alan cast second look at photograph well echoed dick rather annoyed cant draw inference think moon think that assassin murdered grison in order to gain possession of peacock be of great value if want to make money out of will have to sell in way inspector hope to trap beast for reason so that assassin may not be placed on guard moon doesnt want anyone to know truth cant guess why have told yes alan nodded rubbed knee while puzzled look came over dark clean cut face remember telling about fetish of inderwicks age ago tell again a soon a can withdraw gaze from photo fuller colored laughed consciously when man be in love much may be forgiven must admit dicky shes beauty of world now isnt latimer eyed photograph in turn shes pretty said judicially pretty echoed fuller with great indignation shes angel loveliest girl ever created besides being most fascinating of woman oh spare rapture broke in dick impatiently taste in look isnt mine ive met miss marie inderwick seem to forget be very nice very pretty oh hang lukewarm phraseology interrupted other shes most adorable girl in universe admit that for sake of getting on with business in hand now what about peacock of jewel told know isnt much said alan reluctantly changing subject marie life at big house in belstone be called monastery because be given by henry viii to inderwick of oh confound henry viii what about peacock family fetish for one hundred year have be in possession of inderwicks be stolen twenty year ago one ever knew what became of now now turn up in possession of baldwin grison who have evidently be murdered on account yet deny latter day romance well observed alan rubbing knee again admit that truth be stranger than professional journalistic fiction how did man become possessed of ornament latimer shrugged mighty shoulder how dense be didnt tell how louisa grison declared that brother have be secretary to certain person whose name said must tell later on will tell now if arent clever enough to guess rat said fuller inelegantly how can expect to guess by using what common sense nature have given hang man here be excessively unique ornament belonging to inderwick family have be missing for over twenty year grison sister say that intends to bury brother body in belstone churchyard declared at inquest that at one time be secretary to certain person now if put two two together will find that person be mr sorley randolph sorley cried fuller suddenly enlightened in other word uncle guardian of miss marie inderwick well now can see two two do make four humph fuller nursed chin looked thoughtfully at fire so murdered man be mr sorleys secretary according to sister lost situationperhaps dick because stole peacock cant be positive of alan grison in secretarial capacity certainly lived at monastery assisted mr sorley in preparing for press that dreary book about precious stone seems to be life work have chance to steal if mr sorley have suspected assuredly must have have arrested perhaps grison bolted must not be traced think not be so far a can gather from what miss grison say dismissed in due form lived with for time at bloomsbury boarding house later on drifted to rotherhithe to indulge in love for black smoke son mr sorley must never have believed that grison be in possession of peacock of jewel then why did discharge must find out that wont be easy after twenty year mr sorley be growing old may not remember clearly grison on evidence of jotty undoubtedly have peacock since can not be found must have be murdered by someone who desired ornament disorder of sordid room show that strict search be made by assassin must be for nothing save golden peacock now if assassin did find alan if moon jotty keep silent man will think that be safe will sell plunder wait bit dick may unset jewel sell separately then will be difficult to trace by sale of article true enough of solomon however must take chance of if be certain that loss be not suspected may sell whole without splitting into part if doe have eye on pawnshop jeweller on various receiver of stolen goodscan spot beast arrest a second string to bow be just a well to know about family fetish since history may throw light on mystery of disappearance now what have to do son be to go down to belstone learn can about grison when be secretary to old sorley ask miss inderwick uncle about marie wont know anything save by hearsay said alan shaking head remember shes only twenty year of age be infant in arm when family fetish disappeared besides if make inquiry will have to account for curiosity by revealing what have told to keep secret hm hm hm murmured other frowning there be that objection certainly must put out sprat to catch mackerel however want three day till saturday so will see moon hear what suggests about matter inderwicks be poor arent alan there be only one inderwick left answered young solicitor rising to stretch limb be marie of course be desperately poor a told age ago have monastery few acre of park two hundred year to live on sorley be mother brother uncle guardian with two hundred income by pooling cash two manage to keep thing going hm dull life for girl do like mr sorley replied fuller serenely he selfish old animal who only regard marie a necessary piece of furniture be at school for many year only returned home twelve month ago now act a uncle housekeeper lead infernally dull life mr sorley never seems to think that marie be young requires enjoyment he beast ho chuckled dick shrewdly seem to dislike excessively can easily see that doesnt favour suit hang doesnt if marie married old man must be left with two hundred year to get on a best must may be jolly well sure dicky that doesnt want to leave big house natural enough yawned latimer well son help moon to hunt down grison assassin recover fetish of inderwicks perhaps old man out of gratitude may accept a nephew in law worth trying for at event said alan thoughtfully mary angel im bound to marry sooner later ill go down on saturday start operation chapter ii at vicarage alan fuller thoughtfully tucked rug round knee in third class compartment of train be taking to belstone there be station at village brighton express stopped at lewes thence must walk drive to destination young man be in tip top spirit a suggestion of latimer that must join in search for grison assassin secure return of peacock fetish to marie inderwick rendered hopeful success in direction must lead to marriage with girl of course must not take place for time since be not yet making sufficient income to justify becoming husband of most adorable girl in universe still if mr sorley must withdraw absurd oppositionand probably must do so be peacock recoveredalan concluded that might become officially engaged to marie so must not be snapped up by other suitor legally speaking must have lien on not that be really needed since marie loved a much a loved position must be more satisfactory to if matter be arranged on basis in practical way after marie be young impressionable if mr sorley found rich man anxious to become husband of lovely niece might probably must worry into accepting suitor marie must fightalan be quite positive on pointbut might be worn out by uncle persistence fuller knew well enough that old man be a obstinate a mule when once set mind on achieving certain end on whole then alan be pleased that chance have thrown in way opportunity of doing mr sorley service a benefit conferred must undoubtedly soften certainly peacock belonged to marie butlooking upon a must a mere ornamentshe probably must not mind remaining in uncle possession when be found sorley be fanatic about jewel glitter rainbow hue seemed to send crazy with delight to recover radiant splendor of peacock must assuredly concede much alan felt quite sure consent to marriage with girl must not be withheld everything depended upon tracing of miserable grison assassin be not easy task before leaving london fuller have visited inspector moon at rotherhithe office along with latimer policeman have be greatly interested in fact that solicitor knew original possessor of article for grison have apparently be murdered have also be astonished with good reason at coincidence latimer to whom have spoken about jottys evidence must have friend who wasso to speakmixed up in matter of peacock since fate appeared to point out fuller a active agent in bringing unknown murderer to justice through instrumentality of stolen ornament moon have readily given young man permission to speak of matter to mr sorley to marie meanwhile inspector still continued to hunt for trail without success assassin have come gone in crowd inhabited mother slaigs boarding house entirely unnoticed now that grison be buried in belstone churchyard a arranged by sister appeared a if rotherhithe murder must have to be relegated to list of undiscovered crime further revelation depended either on chance that criminal must pawn sell what have risked neck to obtain on evidence procured from marie sorley relative to peacock where have originally come from who have manufactured why did inderwick family regard a fetish finally why have grison stolen be question fuller came down to belstone to ask meanwhile inspector still continued to hunt for trail without success assassin have come gone in crowd inhabited mother slaigs boarding house entirely unnoticed now that grison be buried in belstone churchyard a arranged by sister appeared a if rotherhithe murder must have to be relegated to list of undiscovered crime further revelation depended either on chance that criminal must pawn sell what have risked neck to obtain on evidence procured from marie sorley relative to peacock where have originally come from who have manufactured why did inderwick family regard a fetish finally why have grison stolen be question fuller came down to belstone to ask be therefore wonder that since alans future happiness depended upon success in solving so deep mystery must be thoughtful on journey to belstone dick have talked great deal about matter for want of further evidence must arrive at conclusion until mr sorley explained about peacock stated what knew concerning grison there be nothing more to be done alan thought that uncle must probably know more than niece since have be infant in arm when fetish have be stolen same resolved to question marie first on chance that might know something upon what stated must depend future plan young man did not like mr sorley not only because gentleman thwarted marriage with marie also for very simple reason that mistrusted sorleys character eye be too shifty manner be too suave although always wished to know private affair of everyone else never by chance confessed anything have to do with be necessary on ground a fuller considered to deal with mary uncle in wary manner in due course train stopped at lewes alan got out with intention of walking five mile to belstone have only gladstone bag containing few necessary article for saturday to monday stay in country since invariably kept supply of clothes at home with nod to station master to whom be well known fuller left station ignoring application of several cabman struck at angle to reach high road be soon on hard metal walked along swiftly easily swinging bag glad of exercise to grow warm again a day be cold be chilled from sitting in train a be now end of november there be slight grey fog spreading veil over surrounding country sun be conspicuous by absence that alan thought of mary bright face must be certain to see smiling before on day next must have be depressed by want of sunshine what lover who hope to look into eye of girl adores within specified number of hour can feel down hearted however gloomy sky moist earth not alan fuller who moved on to much desired goal with love song humming in active brain burden of be marie marie marie with delicious name joined to most eulogistic adjective in english tongue be when be almost within sight of belstone village that motor bicycle came along alan heard buzz of machine round corner stood aside to let pas indifferent to coming going when saw slim old man with ascetic clean shaven face smartly dressed in grey suit with brown gaiter seated thereon started called out in surprise mr sorley be unexpected on bicycle rider shut off motive power brought machine to standstill few yard past young man be astonished said coming back wheeling bicycle well alan dont wonder at at age of sixty be not many people who must risk brittle bone in way indeed replied fuller staring at mr sorleys fresh complexion closely cropped white hair surmounted by very juvenile tweed cap thought be such indoor man pooh pooh pooh said sorley good humoredly know how particular be about exercise alan walk day certain distance in order to keep in health for year have slipped out to range park with increasing age must come increasing activity so have bought shook machine alreadyin three week isi have learned to ride without fear can explore country now intend to do so dear lad park be too small for must take exercise possible if wish to keep look vitality increasing age increasing activity said mr sorley again there be increasing age generally mean sitting by fire going to bed early sir replied alan dryly dont overdo boy there be nothing so objectionable a advice beg pardon only thought then dont think on behalf at event snapped mr sorley who appeared rather ruffled by fuller reflection on age when come to year alan doubt if will look so healthy a do young man mentally admitted that be possible might not wear so well sorley be marvel of preservation although have turned sixty certainly did not look more than forty five at most save for white hair face be almost without wrinkle form spare lean be unbowed up to date clothes always affected gave quite youthful air at distance in fact be very handsome man in elderly way for shifty eye slack mouththese marred appearance considerablyhe must have impressed people even more than already did with juvenile aspect ingratiating way there be something untrustworthy about man at least alan thought so have always thought so perhaps might have be more observant than usual run of humanity for mary uncle be extremely popular although usual life be somewhat after style of hermit mr sorley ascribed le to inclination than to want of money since humorously said that marie unable to make end meet have to make one end vegetable be wonderful mr sorley said alan hastening to soothe old man easily hurt vanity never saw look better how do manage to knock year off age abstention from over drinking overeating said mr sorley briskly giving recipe for everlasting hour sleep in afternoon plenty of at night cold tub dumbbell exercise in altogether a trilby say with window open judicious walk optimistic way of looking at thing there be ended with favourite catch phrase a usual now must add trip on motor bicycle laughed alan smiling by way how be marie blooming a rose fresh a daisy cheerful a lark prattled mr sorley with swift not altogether approving glance at speaker face shell be getting married soon cant expect to keep such beauty grace hidden from world must make good match ladthis be for alans particular benefit a young man knew very wella title money good look landed estate with brain added be suitor have chosen for marie be looking for bird of paradise said fuller coloring at hint conveyed doe such perfection exist in mere human being hope so hope so said sorley still cheery still shifty in glance must look for rarity lad im in hurry to lose marie be great comfort to old uncle be annoyed other day greatly annoyed talked into quite good humor what annoyed sir asked fuller not because cared merely from desire to chat about miss inderwick funeral took place in village oh baldwin grison funeral sorley brought shifty green eye to young man face what do know about baldwin grison asked sharply a seemed to alans suspicious nature rather uneasily that newspaper must tell mr sorley be murdered at rotherhithe by unknown person sister brought body down here for burial in village churchyard that last wasnt in newspaper retorted other quickly looking everywhere at alans face wasnt friend latimeryou may remember meeting at vicarage mr sorleywas at inquest afterwards spoke to miss grison who told of intention did tell also that brother be secretary twenty year ago alan demanded sorley face growing red eye glittering did say how be turned out of house a drunken swine miss grison hinted something of thing at inquest did not go into detail a be unnecessary be not pressed told latimer that brother have be discharged by for reason be hard drinker also smoked opium said sorley angrily did what must for have to discharge in long run that woman have right to bring body here bury under nose a might be decency must have prevented bringing back man to place whence be kicked out twenty year ago didnt bring back man remains sir must have be better have thrown into london ditch replied sorley tartly grison be bad servant to bad brother to profligate animal dont wonder be murdered can suggest motive for commission of crime asked fuller looking straightly at elder man grison be drunkard opium smoker liar loafer man like must have made many enemy in low slum lived in certainly risked what have in end happened wonder be that be not murdered before alan well have one good point said fuller meaningly to force confidence if possible on part of sorley wasnt thief can prove that be not can prove that be demanded alan in turn at event omitted that particular crime from category poor devil dead dont wish to say more about than have already stated said sorley moodily beginning to start machine trust that silly sister will not come worry why must asked fuller noticing that man before evaded question of grison being thief there reason in world why must except that be infatuated with brother believed have discharged unjustly shouldnt be surprised if came to tell that again by word of mouth a have told dozen of time by letter ascribed grison downfall to be always asking to assist when be at rotherhithe during last twenty year of course didnt because be poor a know alan for simple reason that grison be not worth helping be best friend far from bringing about downfall did best to keep straight in vain in vain became quite scandal in place mr inderwick sister insisted must get rid of did so went to dog entirely so there be alan boy cant stay here day talking about matter annoys intensely by time machine be alive with energy mr sorley swung into saddle a ended voluble speech with nod set starting gear in motion almost instantaneously be dot on horizon travelling towards lewes at speed of swallow alan looked after thoughtfully tried to arrive at conclusion regarding apparently frank speech by time reached vicarage came to one resolution at least be to say nothing for present to mr sorley about peacock young man must scarcely decide what made refrain from speaking save that old gentleman manner vague speech communicated to sort of uneasy feeling hinted that reticence be wise for time being might have be sixth sense induced decision for fuller certainly must not argue out matter logically however determined to obey intuition to avoid making confidant of uncle while speaking freely of errand to niece there be feeling in mind against discussing with theft of peacock a possible motive for murder of man relative seemed to detest so thoroughly a usual young man received warmest of welcome from parent who adored only son thought most wonderful person in world vicar assuredly did not worship marvellous boy so devotedly a did mr fuller nevertheless took great pride in alans handsome look clever brain general good conduct be bright eyed rosy faced little man who scarcely came up to tall son shoulder with kindly nature be always being imposed upon wife sweet faced old lady tall grey haired singularly graceful be more practical in many way than husband checked vicar too generous way of dealing with who took advantage of lavish kindness be true ruling power in house weak point be alan often sighed to think that must never find woman worthy to be wife dozen of best woman in world rolled into one perfect creature must never have come up to standard have set up in own mind future mr alan fuller be to reach alan always enjoyed home visit not only because loved parent with tenderness respect rare in modern day of revolt against domestic authority also on account of quiet well ordered life made vicarage so uncommonly pleasant mr fuller be famous housewife managed establishment with such rare tact that kept servant for year husband income be not large one one must have guessed seeing perfectly appointed dinner table dainty meal prepared vicar wife have brought to husband by way of dowry quantity of valuable old furniture so that room looked graciously beautiful a house be quaint old kept in perfect repair order not in secret of income believed that fuller have ample mean everything grateful to eye touch palate be due to vicaress a husband jocularly called worst tempered person in world must have succumbed to soothing influence permeated place home home sweet sweet home hummed alan when trio sat in fragrant old drawing room after admirable dinner mother darling have idea how restful be after noise bustle of london mr fuller smiled from favorite chair went on with tatting busy a bee for be rarely idle in silver grey dress with lace cap of dainty gossamer resting on white hair worn cast back after style of marie antoinette old fashioned set of amethyst ornament looked singularly charming in subdued light came through pink lampshade looked like gentle ghost of early victorian day soothingly womanly motherly have grown old gracefully a diamond flashed from ring while tatted diligently alan thought what delightful gentlewoman looked placid dignified gracious be vicar who answered son question although alan have scarcely put remark a such ah boy youd soon grow weary of drowsy place must long for crowded hour of glorious life be contrast make appreciate eden mr fuller nodded approval white always show up best against black well have have london black down here lately mother when looked at inquiringly alan continued mean funeral vicar face grew sad yes yes be indeed unpleasant reminder of what lie beyond quiet hill poor grison poor louisa tool know be most sorry for for louisa said mr fuller raising quiet eye need not be sorry for john did duty more than duty by poor creature who have gone to account so have nothing to reproach with be glad be staying for few day a wish to have talk with be miss grison staying here then asked alan wondering if must be worth while to look up at mr millingtons dressmaker dear louisa be close friend twenty year more ago be when grison be secretary to mr sorley yes chimed in vicar who told about boy miss grison spoke about at inquest also to dick inspector moon father then met mr sorley on way here told that have employed man have to get rid of for drink dont think be true interrupted mr fuller with indignation in usually gentle voice poor baldwinwe called so when be young mandid not drink to excess although certainly took more than be good for at time then why be discharged can not say alan can anyone else louisa know must never tell mr sorley be much to blame in throwing baldwin on world without character since be too weak to stand by louisa did what must fell from bad to worse untilalas ala tell alan have anything be discovered a to who killed not yet mother have read paper oh yes louisa sent report down to father to knowing that took deep interest in baldwin dont remember alan be little boy of six seven then alan shook head have faint recollection only mother little man wasnt with fair hair blue eye there may have got impression from dick description saw corpse dont talk about such thing alan said vicar hastily worry mother be very impressionable let be thankful that poor creature have be brought back to lie in quiet churchyard a to person who murdered will suffer for sin in god good time doubt if truth will ever be discovered said alan with shrug by way father do remember that peacock of jewel be fetish luck of inderwicks not knowing what connection there be between murder of grison ornament in question vicar thought that apparently irrelevant inquiry be made by son in obedience to request that crime must not be discussed in presence of mr fuller everyone in village if not in county know about peacock said with approving smile a to bringing luck believe in such superstition boy perhaps not said wife quietly must confess john that since what inderwicks call luck have be missing nothing have gone well with themthat be with marie who alone represents family nonsense dear marie be young healthy pretty happy enough in own way a sorley be kindness to there bad luck haunting girl so far a can see of course not allude rather to poverty inderwicks used to be rich mr inderwick be left comparatively well off then lost money when marie be born afterwards died inderwickmaries father isshould not have made sorley trustee for be always be bad business man acted honestly enough daresay even with sister consent must never have speculated a did wonder money be lost be speculation asked alan land in australiain melbourne chiefly believe there be big land boom there over twenty year ago then everything failed bank after bank went smash before sorley must get letter even telegram out everything be gone however marie have monastery park sufficient to keep in food dress so cant grumble marie never doe grumble said mr fuller decidedly be brightest person know dull life for young girl at monastery ought to have season in london be presented at court have opportunity here stole shy glance at alans expressive face of making good match with mary blood look must secure title well perhaps will when peacock return to bring back luck said alan refusing to be drawn into argument with mother over marie will never be found said vicar positively how be lost father cant tell have be missing twenty year be not likely to reappear marie can do very well without such superstition be ridiculous now must have prayer ended mr fuller inconsequently wife looked up amused since knew that acted thus because have patience with belief in peacock a fetish while prayer be being said alan wondered if peacock must ever reappear in spite of father doubt to influence mary destiny chapter iii story of past ancient village of belstone hidden in fold of low lying undulating hill be inhabited chiefly by agricultural laborer one irregular street four five narrow lane few behind time shop together with many small cottage constitute sequestered hamlet there be great number of farm several country seat in district who own usually buy necessary of life at lewes so belstone can not depend upon trade for support villager however mind neglect a be sleepy headed indifferent to so long a earn sufficient for bed board sole house of note be vicarage at one end of village great mansion of inderwicks at other formerly owner of monasteryas place be calledwere lord of manor a property have dwindled to few acre title have passed to modern more prosperous family inderwicks formerly so rich powerful be now of small account amongst gentry of county rev john fuller always maintained that prehistoric name of village be baalstone that be so termed after altar stone to baal bel deity whom phoenician have introduced into britain be more than questionable whether sea rover ever traded so far a sussex mr fuller assumption can be taken for what be worth although held stoutly to opinion be a may undoubtedly there be druidical temple where big house now stand later shrine to diana afterwards altar to woden until early christian missionary built on same spot primitive flint mortar church finally came benedictine monastery lasted until reign of arch iconoclast henry viii from expelled monk have passed into possession of nicholas

with golden peacock know story only that there be such fetish be supposed to be luck of inderwicks have be for one hundred year more secret have heard nothing about now come to think of daresay havent only became acquainted with real meaning of peacock of jewel year ago read about in manuscript found in library when be battle of plassey alan in answered fuller who have good memory for date be won by lord clive wasnt yes what have to do with peacock great deal a will hear one moment marie be peacock of indian workmanship no be made by man called simon ferrier who be servant of great great greati dont know how many greatsgrandfather let say grandfather who lived about time of plassey what be name george inderwick went to india to here marie broke off looked at lover searchingly why do ask about peacock ill explain that when have heard legend isnt legend true story be very mysterious said girl somewhat incoherently well then george inderwick went out to india long before battle of plassey in hope of restoring family fortune be only younger brother left monastery in possession of julian inderwick thing be very bad with family then have be worse since nowmarie sighedeverything be lost unless treasure be discovered treasure alan looked excited be there treasure of course stupid thing be secret of peacock alan became exasperated by way in have to drag thing out of frowned wish must tell story clearly said tartly will do so if wont interrupt so often retorted marie then looking round quiet dell a if for inspiration finally finding in eager look in lover eye began tale george went to india along with servant simon ferrier who be foster brother wait bit interrupted fuller again who wrote manuscript simon ferrier wont tell anything if keep asking question alan how can speak when talk be dumb dearest virago go on im not virago horrid boy well then george went to madras a clerk of east india company be lent to rajah to drill army learned soldiering from lord clive although

mr inderwick because saved life life of son simon hid when master be captured by other king rajah never mind say captured by enemy oh very well said marie obediently when be captured by enemy be long time in captivity george be forced to drill native troop while simon be made to work a jeweller why a jeweller oh seems that have be brought up in england a watchmaker having mended clock belonging to enemy be set to work in shop to make ornament for enemy wife learned how to make indian ornament became very cleverat least say so perhaps be bragging dont think so if story about beauty of peacock made be to be believed said fuller thoughtfully recalling certain story related by old village woman who have set eye on ornament in question before have disappeared go on dear be interesting most interesting part be to come replied marie nodding small head with wise air simon managed to get away went back to where have hidden jewel dug up came to england leaving master in captivity how shabby of only did what master told said marie quickly be to take jewel to england give to julian inderwick so that fortune of family might be restored simon did not like julian found out that be spendthrift gambler if have given jewel must have be wasted inderwicks must have be none better for simon therefore said nothing about mission hid jewel then returned to india to rejoin master who be now free be fighting beside lord clive well what happened then when battle of plassey be being fought before simon must return to master be taken prisoner by who have before held captive have come to know about jewel insisted that must tell where be simon be even tortured to make tell refused to speak so grew tired set to work again a jeweller be then that made peacock why peacock particularly because wished to let george inderwick know where jewel of begum be hidden in england must only do so by indicating place through golden peacock in what way dont know cant find out simon feared lest secret must be discovered by indian lest must send someone to england to get back gem therefore a say made peacock contrived to have taken to george inderwick through native who be friendly to then died after writing manuscript telling master that secret be hidden in peacock be murdered believe a say at end of manuscript that expected to be put to death be use of sending secret to george when must not be guessed be stupid admitted marie thoughtfully since george never managed to find out from peacock where jewel be in anxiety to keep secret from everyone master simon over reached entirely forgot that george must find a hard to learn truth a anyone else into whose hand peacock fell however died ornament with manuscript came to george after battle of plassey george returned home with money tried

relative to rotherhithe murder laid great stress on fact that jotty street arab have seen peacock of jewel marie listened with open mouth cant be sure that poor man be murdered because of peacock said when ended besides how must have oh that last be easy grison be uncle secretary may have taken peacock out of revenge knowing that mr sorley be fond of jewel on other hand grison may have read very same manuscript about have be telling might have tried to learn secret then must not have cried girl positively else must not have remained in horrid slum who have peacock now assassin who be one know

until avenge poor baldwin death fierce determined look on yellow face showed that thoroughly meant what said can help in way why must asked cautiously because take interest in case alan explained equally cautiously friend of mine mr latimer who be at inquest told about sad circumstance death be so mysterious that of wish to learn truth if only out of curiosity little woman paused almost imperceptibly cast swift look at young man girl by side before replying then accepted well meant offer in usual unemotional way will be glad of assistance mr fuller said producing printed card from

reasonable mr fuller hint ground on part for never mind what hint interrupted miss grison sharply if call on in london feel can trust then may speak out anyone must trust alan said marie indignantly visitor gave thin lipped smile be quite right to defend dear defence be natural enough since selina millington told that mr fuller admires he man men be bad except alan who be engaged to be married to men be bad repeated miss grison stolidly only knew one good man be brother baldwin hm murmured alan remembering what sorley have said on previous day if miss grison heard ejaculation understood

time to make comment on last speech continued a though have not stopped to draw breath know house very well also said calmly have be walking over while waiting to see mr sorley walking over repeated marie rather indignantly stranger be not stranger to mr sorley to monastery replied small woman with great coolness when brother be secretary here year ago used to spend day wandering about room

see mr sorley showed in here to wait for himas if required showing ended miss grison disdainfully fuller stared at hard seemed to be in right sens what said be reasonable enough struck that there must be something eccentric about when ventured to enter house explore without owner permission again miss grison gave time to make comment went on talking in shrill voice latimer have noted mentioned henrietta jane trent be twin explained to marie a if girl knew nothing about own servant remember a little toddler in village mother took in washing fine bouncing woman have grown into dear red cheek

there be lot to do admit said miss grison nodding that many of room be shut up dear weuncle be require so many looked into found bare of furniture pursued miss grison calmly with hard unwinking stare yet in time there be lot of valuable pardon miss grison interrupted fuller seeing consternation of marie dont think be taking rather liberty in entering house in talking like may appear liberty to mr fuller rejoined quietly will not to mr sorley be old friend friend said alan with emphasis turned on with flash in eye did ever give to understand otherwise demanded drawing quick breath have ever mentioned name to waited for reply none came a alan be deliberating whether must be wise to inform her of way in mr sorley have spoken also wondered if miss grison knew that brother have be murdered for sake of peacock if must tell how baldwin became possessed of same felt that must be best not to ask question to make answer until knew ground better with hard look little woman waited for to speak be saved trouble by unexpected entrance of mr randolph sorley be perfectly dressed a usual in well cut suit of blue serge wore patent leather boot together with smart scarf of white silk fastened with black pearl breast pin if be miser in thing a marie asserted assuredly be not so in matter of clothes for one must have be better turned out have looked more aristocratic carriage be so upright hair so short face so bronzed greenish eye so alert that have quite military appearance even looked young in dusky atmosphere of big room be only when came forward more into light that betrayed sixty year be possibly because alan knew true age for smooth clean shaven face looked much younger in spite of white hair mr fuller miss grison said slowly be indeed surprise be delighted to see indeed appeared to be so for smile be open speech soft manner frank after what have said about woman on previous day fuller quite expected that must be rude to andsince have other plan in headthe young man quite expected that must be rude to also mr sorley be apparently too well bred to act impolitely in what regarded a own house even if same house be property of marie inderwick miss grison blue eye glittered trifle more a shook hand with cordially otherwise remained impenetrable self remembering what have said about host alan be a amazed at behavior a be at sorleys a to marie be so relieved that uncle received alan courteously that never gave thought to possibility that might be acting part for reason best known to have have tea inquired mr sorley poking fire marie dear why did not offer guest tea rang bell promptly did not like to without permission uncle ran said timidly dear child be house here be mistress be only guardian live here a be on sufferance miss grison be truly grieved to hear of brother death oh indeed said small woman sarcastically in case wonder didnt come to funeral must have awakened memory of past there be proverb remarked miss grison coldly bid let sleeping dog lie very good advice assented mr sorley suppose adopt by letting sad past alone coming to sad present have police discovered who murdered brother snapped miss grison impassively be likely to if can help certainly be then know of clue may may not be not time to speak about such thing dear lady said host with great dignity be under impression that came here to receive sympathy then be never more mistaken in life retorted miss grison grimly came to say what will say when tea be at end nothing unpleasant trust asked sorley distinctly uneasily be for to judge returned entrance of henny trent with tray put end to particular conversation while henny who be large red cheeked black eyed who really resembled dutch doll miss grison have compared to be arranging tea table alan stole furtive look at mr sorley old gentleman seemed to have suddenly aged haggard look have crept over deceptive face while eye hinted uneasiness a watched grison seemed to fuller sorley for reason feared visitor fact that have so audaciously walked over house appeared to indicate that be quite sure must not rebuke for liberty remembering man bluster contrasted so pointedly with present suave talk alan felt confident that there be understanding between asked if such have to do with murder replied mentally in negative if sorley knew anything about matter miss grison must then there have denounced since appeared to hate a much a dreaded beyond short answer sinister glance gave sign of enmity while sorley masked uneasiness under guise of small talk in spite of almost immediate occurrence of murder fact that miss grison have come down for funeral fuller noted that tragedy be scarcely referred toat event during earlier part of conversation along with marie remained silent allowed other two to converse be staying long down here miss grison asked host handing cup of tea to plate of thin bread butter why dont call louisa a used to do demanded be great friend know before be born turned to miss inderwick yes yes said sorley taking cue called randolph be too old now to use christian name laughed artificially be said miss grison shortly perhaps be how be getting along with book on precious stone may ask may said sorley blandly be getting on slowly surely have taken year to gather material precious stone suppose certain gem of small value amongst other material such a legend superstition connected with jewel will be interesting book im sure will said miss grison more graciously dont work too hard at be fond of exercise yes take great deal ah selina millington told that have bought motor bicycle yes said sorley stiffly still laboriously polite ride round country up to london no replied swiftly have not yet travelled on to town dont think take many hour to get to town on so rapid machine said miss grison in musing tone perhaps be wise might get knocked over in street what answer sorley made to speech alan did not hear marie who have resented attention to speech of elderly couple now insisted that must converse with did so rather unwillingly in spite of genuine love brain be running on odd somewhat spasmodic conversation wondered why miss grison so pointedly referred to motor bicycle also seemed strange that sorley must be on such familiar term with humble woman who kept bloomsbury boarding house to be sure brother have be man secretary sorley probably have be intimate with visitor in early day perhapsand here fuller startedperhaps two have be in love hatred miss grison felt for well preserved old gentleman be that of woman scorned when again caught drift of conversation be talking about cryptogram also alan thought strange poor brother be always trying to work out secret writing said why asked sorley again uneasy at mention of dead dont know answered miss grison indifferently wanted to learn secret must bring money in connection with what dont know did ever decipher secret writing refer to dont know said miss grison again spent day night in trying to work out cryptogram alan murmured marie under breath on hearing there be cryptogram connected with peacock fancy yes yes have said fuller hastily then raised voice be talking about cipher miss grison be fond of solving indeed be rather good at be be mr sorley who replied not woman think must puzzle couldnt rejoined alan deliberately boastful set cryptogram be sure can solve go on system of poe what be before must answer miss grison rose shaking crumb from dress walked to door there halted turned to fix cold eye on astonished host who have not expected so abrupt move in midst of agreeable conversation have eaten drunk in house said miss grison sternly thing never believed must bring to do now will say what came to say to mr randolph sorley shake dust from foot hadnt better speak to privately asked sorley rising with wan smile white face think not what have to say can be heard by young people who be aware of opinion have of be wicked cruel sinful man worse than worst of men although be bad now that poor brother be dead brother bald dont dare to take name on lip interrupted miss grison in fierce way death be due to to how dare accuse of murder sorley be whiter than ever seemed much shaken by abrupt accusation dont accuse of having wrongfully dismissed baldwin from house over twenty year ago dismissed if will have truth told in presence of others because forged name to check did not malign dead turned out soiled name ruined life without shadow of excuse that sank to slum in rotherhithe be work that be murdered there be work for if have not be in rotherhithe must not have died by violence if have dared to come to funeral must have spat on wicked face how dare how dare marie go to room marie will stay until hears what think of cried miss grison grimly with meal hoped to smooth down will never forgive for having laid baldwin in dust have have turn now be turn wait wait see how iniquity can be punished shaking menacing finger stalked out of room mad mad be mad gasped mr sorley literally tottered out of library presumably to follow denouncer what doe mean alan asked marie with awe why did turn so suddenly on uncle ran why did mention that brother be trying to solve secret writing hoped must bring money asked fuller quickly brother have peacock exactly now marie have clue to truth chapter v letter what fuller meant exactly when suggested to marie that there be now clue to truth may be gathered from one of frequent conversation held on subject with friend fuller have much to say when returned to town from week end visit to belstone for little time did not find favorable moment for exhaustive talk certainly gave dick few hint a to what have learned spoke more le in desultory manner latimers time be so fully taken up with journalism that matter be not discussed thoroughly until middle of week even then chance came about in somewhat unexpected way a alan took opportunity to detain reporter when strolled into chancery lane office for few minute dick have stated that be off chain for time simply wished for smoke rest can fire away with work old son said latimer taking possession of client chair shant bother affair of peacock bother

looking like huge good natured bear in fur overcoat bitter cold of december day demanded dont see use of bothering about business unless be legally retained to thresh out why waste time far from

remark went into outer office to tell clerk that must be engaged for one hour a solicitor with small certain practice fuller only enjoyed ownership of two dingy room very badly lighted still more badly furnished inner sanctum only contained large writing table green painted iron safe shabby bookcase filled with law volume bound in calf few cane bottomed chair window with slanting silvered

bolt with jewel upon have squandered mary money with fortune of peacock if can find same be there difficulty in finding alan yes in first place fortune be hidden only by gaining possession of peacock can clue be found to whereabouts in second place even if bird ooff bird suggested latimer vulgarly if like even if be found there will be difficulty in reading riddle riddle do mean what say retorted fuller impatiently secret of fortune be connected with secret writing have to do with peacock how can there be secret writing on metal ornament cant say dont know there enigma of sort cryptogram be very interesting patchy said dick readjusting big body in chair suppose tell from beginning then might get glimmer of what exactly mean very good then dont interrupt alan related strange story of george inderwick faithful servant who have preserved secret so faithfully indeed that not even master have be able to find jewel latimer listened with great attention nodded when story be concluded with air of satisfaction romance declared slowly when fuller waited for comment there be doubt that assassin stole peacock by murdering grison in order to get begum gem man must have be fool a to risk neck otherwise for paltry ornament be not so sure of seeing how valuable peacock be rejoined other doubtfully isas learned from father who saw fetish of inderwicksas large a thrush of pure gold elaborately worked be studded with precious stone of more le price tail be spread out be also jewelled now of lascar dago in mother slaigs boarding house must not mind killing man by cutting throat to gain possession of such object ah man be not killed in way seaman of nationality must cut throat must not use slender instrument scarcely drew blood to get rid of grison instrument usedwhich have not be discovered by waysuggests refined criminal slender instrument repeated fuller musingly why not stiletto italian must use there be italian seaman know dick nodded there be something in admitted well let point alone for time being evidently peacock be worth more than intrinsic value to man who can solve mystery now question be how did grison get hold of ornament see trouble in answering that dicky again alan told story time one dealt with grison dismissal from post by sorley on charge of forgery with visit of sister to big house then related how miss grison have spoken to host also how have talked about cryptogram although concluded alan since be talking to marie at time dont exactly know how introduced that particular subject that introduced at show two thing said latimer decisively one that knew brother stole peacock two be aware how be searching for solution of cryptogram connected with bird in order to secure gem how must have learned about begum treasure asked fuller undoubtedly in same way a marie did grison a sorleys secretary must have found manuscript if found why did not take with cant explain that must have done better have secured so that one else must learn true value of peacock be to get gem that stole ornament perhaps told story in moment of weakness to third party who afterwards murdered for possession thats what think have reason to believe that sorley know about peacock cryptogram fuller jumped up laying down pipe began to pace narrow confines of office yes do for reason in first place miss grison must not have mentioned cryptogram to without guessed that knew something in second when boasted purposely about knowledge of secret writing must not have told that have cryptogram must baffle skill a certainly did more le in third dicky must not have be afraid of miss grison what do mean by exactly well sorley told that hated miss grison that annoyed by saying that have dismissed brother unjustly have practically ruined life walked into house over house yet sorley did not dare to object to taking such liberty to calling name when marie be present also asked about motor cycle told have bought inquired if have be to london denied that have sarcastically advised not to go lest must be knocked over in street then infer said dick slowly removing pipe that believe miss grison suspect sorley of knowing secret of peacock that be in possession of brother also that came up to town by mean of motor cycle murdered man for possession yes do infer a much said fuller bluntly returning to chair if sorley have not peacock doe not know story of ferrier why must speak to about cryptogram only made idle remark be natural seeing miss grison spoke of cryptogram although admit that be strange must talk about at unless exactly interrupted solicitor tilting back chair so a to get at drawer of writing table unless belief that murdered brother now posse peacock with intention of learning cryptogram by employing to solve must scarcely do when know that if be guilty such revelation of possession of peacock must condemn forget said alan who have extracted letter from drawer that fact of murder being committed for sake of peacock have not yet be made public a said told marie did not tell sorley because mistrust warned not to do so either so if miss grison assumption be true sorley will have hesitation in enlisting service in showing peacock always presuming that be indeed murderer have in possession latimer nodded three time solemnly be strange argue very well son whats letter be holding from sorley came yesterday morning have not have opportunity of talking about to before a have be so confoundedly busy be letter said fuller unfolding missive illustrates proverb that who excuse accuses ho said latimer with world of meaning read out boy there be need to read can give gist in few word be fuller reply a ran eye rapidly over line sorley begs not to take notice of miss grison wild word a be trifle mad have to dismiss brother for forging name to check a man be also insaneslightly that ishe did not prosecute very kind christian like alan why doe sorley put up with miss grison vagary declares that be sorry for in letter by word of mouth a good a told that hated humph seems to that dear friend be hedging well what more alan nothing more on subject of miss grison save that declares contempt for threat threat what threat dick sat up alertly told in presence of marie in presence also that be to wait see how iniquity must be punished humph look a though mean to be nasty exactly sorleys cringing to implies that guess can make thing hot for however simply end letter by saying that when come to belstone for christmas will have chat with on subject of cryptogram did not say dick that letter illustrates proverb referred to why must sorley think necessary to explain about miss grison crazy wordsif indeed be crazyor why must wish to talk about cryptogram to unless quite so interrupted dick on same word in same manner a friend have stopped previously unless belief that sorley made away with brother strange case grows more complicated a go into what be opinion dick be rather difficult to give hard fast one on what fact have before seeing that be so much in dark by way how long have sorley have motor bicycle told rather hinted at three week marie said that bought four month ago humph so sorley tell lie about doe look fishy certainly on good machine must slip up to town back again in night without anyone being wiser then think that committed murder by alan spoke excitedly cant say interrupted latimer swiftly oh infer then that be innocent cant say that then what deuce do say demanded lawyer irritably much that before can be sure of sorley being mixed up with crime must learn for certain if posse peacock of jewel how can cant can alan sorleys request that must talk cryptogram with at christmas can only arise from desire to solve riddle of peacock wait hear what have to say then asked fuller nodding approval then will be able to take step along dark path mean to travel presume asked dick looking up searchingly of course do replied young man emphatically if jewel be in existence belong to marie want to find before sorley doe lest must make off with well said latimer grimly daresay must bolt because love jewel moreoverif guiltymust dread risking neck guilty if posse peacock must be guilty must appear so alan since only by mean of peacock can gem be discovered if find can assume very reasonably that killed baldwin grison a yet so far a know jewel be still hidden dick thought for few moment then ventured on advice have week so before taking christmas holiday why not visit miss grison at boarding house know where be yes gave card wont out dicky have be certain of sorleys criminality must have denounced then there to gratify hatred may only have suspicion of guilt perhaps wish be father to thought seems to that by allusion to bicycle to cryptogram wished to arouse mistrust of man still can not be aware that marie told about peacock riddle latimer ruffled hair in perplexity oh hang be use of speculating cried crossly rising to stretch big limb before can arrive at conclusion must sound miss grison a to what know what doe not know at event detests sorley so far a can see will do best to hang perhaps be task to prevent such miscarriage go see alan then tell what learn very good will write note invite to dinner why to dinner wish to see what kind of lodger miss grison have to hear opinion of landlady much can be learned in way tell dick what have discovered very little moon be still hunting for assassin be still at wit end how to strike true trail only thing of interest have learned be about jotty street arab whom grison befriended yes he clever little animal in better surroundings might improve into something useful miss grison intends to give chance be taking into service a page boy shell have enough to do to teach civilized habit concluded dick cynically why be acting so philanthropically out of regard for memory of brother a told inspector moon well murmured fuller thoughtfully be reasonable enough since appears to have have strong regard for brother perhaps commended jotty to care not improbable poor wretch may have wished to give boy chance if so show that there be decent feeling in if visit boarding house wish to keep eye on jotty why alan looked up quickly because believe boy know much more than have hitherto admitted oh said fuller after pause so be probable that miss grison interest in lad be not wholly philanthropic fancy that may desire to keep under own eye lest must say too much latimer shrugged shoulder cant say that quite took view alan a miss grison may really be acting kindly out of regard for brother wish same believe that jotty know thing about murder be keeping quiet will be just a well to watch more le closely on ground on ground whatever just idea have may be rubbish fuller nodded on other hand may be useful not to reject idea dick will watch question jotty if get chance be careful alan be sharp lad ill see that doe not get better of dick isnt strange how suspicious one get of everything when on man hunt yes natural enough on trail one always observes small sign to indicate direction so everything around becomes of value in way of evidence however know what have to do yes

when learned quality of establishment entered large drawing room to find men in workaday clothes although lady have certainly done best to smarten for evening function miss grison for instance received in worn black silk dress trimmed sparsely with jet set off with cheap lace still looked a though carved out of wood still stared with unwinking gaze somewhat confused young man there be

like scandal to be connected with name dear lady behavior call for nothing praise human nature be more prone to blame than praise answered hostess bitterly gave signal to lady for departure will leave to smoke with other gentleman mr fuller afterwards can come talk to in drawing room alonzo will probably see when open door for departure with stiff bow left room at head of shabbily dressed female who thus followed custom of west end for time alan be left severely alone smoked cigarette in silence since men seemed to be too shy to venture on conversation have many matter to discus among after time mr bakche left seat moved to chair at young man elbow offering a sat down cigarette case be well filled will find particularly good said mr bakche in deep mellow voice accorded well with grave

manner place too high mr fuller assure responded quietly come of princely family be not of princely rank can look upon a plain mahometan gentleman of tartar descent of tartar descent echoed fuller who found companion interesting yes did miss grison tell full name morad bakche indeed did gave meaning desire accomplished said other with sigh although fear that desire will never be accomplished however be by way wonder mr fuller if have read history of mogul regret to say have not well be rather unusual book for anyone to read unless be student will find mentioned therein ancestor after whom be called be also morad bakche youngest son of shah jahan who be descended from timur tartar family be rich famous when mogul emperor ruled at delhi everything belonging to be swept away in mutiny a english call can quite understand that give different name said alan sympathetically naturally desired to be free naturally injudiciously mr fuller if british raj ended unhappy country must become cockpit of contending host be too divided in india to rule great power must interfere so that must only exchange king stork for queen log reverse a forget exact detail of fable what mean be that england be better ruler of country than germany russia must be sentiment be very liberal mr bakche have read history replied other believe mr fuller that if people only read history more carefully so many mistake must not be made in world past life of nation be more le only what future will be making reasonable allowance for development bakche talked on strain for time displayed great knowledge of history betrayed shrewd observation of men manner so that alan found conversation very enjoyable later on companion became particular after general gave few hint about family at time of mutiny grandfather be rajah of kam be little known state be in madras presidency be be be repeated fuller surprised state can not vanish out of existence mr bakche since be land oh land be still there village town name have be changed family have be turned out be sole member left alive mr fuller have ambition to get back former royalty understood from miss grison that have come to england on mission of sort good lady be wrong again want forfeited title do want certain property see so be applying to government said mr bakche unexpectedly somewhat grimly property can not be recovered by government have to search for be here checked dont see why must trouble with dry talk be most interesting assure alan assured quite truthfully then must resume on occasion said bakche rising have to keep appointment perhaps will see again here possibly if come again here be card fuller passed along business address will be glad to see at time bakche glanced at card ponderingly be solicitor see be probable may want solicitor be at service may not be when know what want said indian dryly with sudden gleam in dark eye however be glad have met perhaps may call see good night sir with grave bow morad bakche took departure from room be now almost empty fuller drew deep breath a rose to go to drawing room late companion being of unusual kind have interested not little in spite of suave manner gentle voice there be something dangerous about betrayed for moment by sudden gleam of ferocity alan felt a though have be playing with tiger who have be careful for reason of own not to scratch must do so when appointed time came for to reveal true nature half hoped that bakche must not come to chancery lane office regretted momentarily that have given card reflection made laugh at nervous dread since be well able to look after need have fear of bakche of man besides wanted to get business must so a to make money marry miss inderwick therefore must have be foolish to lose sight of prospective client wondering what precise nature of man business must be alan sauntered towards drawing room when in passage came across diminutive urchin with peaked face arrayed a page oh said mr fuller stopping so be alonzo yessir gasped boy in one breath looked at tall gentleman from under light eye lash out of light eye have name nosir said urchin again in breath lying glibly never be called anything alanzer fuller nodded seeing that lad be loyal to miss grison did not try to wean from allegiance same wished to ask question about dead man did not think present moment judicious one to do so day must ask mistress to let come see at office remarked carelessly passed on in moment jotty be tugging coat tail what jer want ter arsk will tell when time come do know mr latimer jotty nodded with bright inquisitive eye with big coat like bear italyains chivy about yes see that know something about alonzo be quite right to say what have said dont want to call see unless miss grison permit to yer lawr gent inquired jotty pondering in chancery lane fuller gave number if do happen to be passing mr alonzo just look in earn few shilling im game for anyhow if doesnt hurt jerked head towards room where miss grison be supposed to be fuller turned on sharply why must anything hurt inquired jotty did not answer directly shes bin good t wos goodhim e died sir dont want hurt t come t anyhow with flash of light eye boy sprang down stair leading to kitchen while alan entered drawing room wondering what observation meant seemed impossible that harm must come to miss grison out of inquiry into death of brother again struck fuller that woman reason for helping jotty might not be entirely philanthropic however have time to dwell on particular point looked about for miss grison who be not to be seen elderly lady with simper informed that landlady be in own room pointed out direction so fuller knocked at door softly sharp voice of miss grison invited to enter found in small apartment crowded with furniture oh here be mr fuller said hostess rising from low chair in be seated by fire thought must find here can not stay listening to twaddle talk in drawing room having much more serious thing with to occupy thought very natural after great loss replied alan accepting chair pushed towards suppose wonder why have come to see said miss grison in sharp blunt way mentioned at belstone that must help be glad to have assistance can give if will be frank with what do wish to know miss grison took fan from mantelpiece a spoke used to screen sallow cheek from fire have idea who murdered brother if have do think must invoke assistance asked evading question dexterously two head be better than one countered solicitor true enough yet one head may be able to bring beast who killed baldwin to scaffold then must apologise for troubling said alan rising a told at belstone only desire to unravel case be one of curiosity if think that be meddlesome be really very good sit down will answer what question like after must be glad to have advice of solicitor for nothing unless expect six eightpence mr fuller expect nothing straight reply to question miss grison go on then a to one have already asked can say nothing at present dont know for certain who murdered baldwin have suspicion nothing have tangible proof apparently must not put feeling against sorley into word so alan tried tack must mind telling history that of baldwin suppose why must because may then learn if there be anything in life in life must cause death fear will be disappointed mr fuller replied coldly for history that of baldwin be uneventful on whole be child of doctor who practised at canterbury who made money mr sorley be patient of father took fancy to baldwin when came home from oxford where be being educated when baldwin finished college career got degree oh alan be plainly surprised got degree did baldwin be extremely clever man cried miss grison impetuously hand trembled with emotion dont see why must ask question in such manner took degree with great credit came home to go in for law mr sorley who be writing book on precious stone offered to make baldwin secretary offer be accepted because father have died did not leave so well off a be expected brother went to monastery stayed with mother for year until died then paid visit to belstone mr inderwick who be then alive asked to remain a companion be with for year until died managed to gather enough money out of salary to start boarding house shortly after marie be born mother died be left to grandmother of henny jenny to look after why not to because have already left place said miss grison flushing with sparkling eye sorley quarrelled with brother a quarrelled with everyone ended in baldwin being dismissed what reason be given for dismissal miss grison hesitated looked at fire suppose may a well talk candidly to since so much rest on knowing exact truth will be just a well said fuller positively well then drew deep breath although loved baldwin although be clever amiable have weak character learned to smoke opium took more drink than be good for in moment of madness because mr sorley paid so badly forged employer name to small check for five pound mr sorley found out threatened to prosecute especially a baldwini dont deny itmade objectionable to mr inderwick however mr sorley did not prosecute why not doesnt seem to to be merciful man he cruel hard beast said miss grison fiercely heard opinion of at belstone be fault of baldwin be not put in jail managed to stop in what way shant tell there be need to tell mr fuller be enough for to know have power to stop prosecution did so have just started boarding house brought baldwin here what with drink smoking opium behaved so badly that dearly a loved have to find home for be ruined got home with doctor who looked after baldwin ran away went to rotherhithe for there be near opium den begged implored to lead better life always promised always failed to keep promise must do be to allow so much week did a stated in evidence at inquest lived degraded life at mother slaigs house be down slum there met with death at hand of stopped short at hand of man whom suspect finished alan bluntly never said be man retorted miss grison abruptly couldnt possibly be woman never said that then what do say nothing because be certain of nothing have heard story wish to hear so make what use can of will do so if will answer one other question what be screened face did brother steal peacock of jewel from monastery screen dropped marie have be telling about told legend of jewel cryptogram of course a be child when peacock be stolen must say nothing about theft a inspector moon learned from jotty brother have peacock in possession be true be murdered on account of peacock believe so clasped unclasped hand feverishly not giving time to ask question do know who stole from belstone brother since have at mother slaigs no stole from stole from mr sorley stole fuller started up in amazement why did oh have good reason to assure be not ashamed of theft that peacock ruined baldwin that peacock will ruin mr sorley broke in fuller keeping eye on face flung up hand will ruin chapter vii yuletide alan must make nothing of miss grison final remark for after statingand in somewhat hysterical fashionthat peacock must ruin asked to leave in vain asked for more detailed explanation recovering usual wooden manner declined to speak further fuller returned to room at barker inn to report result of visit to dick be unsatisfactory alan said a much dont agree with remarked latimer after reflection have seen jotty ticketed a alonzowhat name have learned early history of unfortunate brother sister finally have met with mr morad bakche he got nothing to do with matter anyhow dear son george inderwick obtained treasure be looking for in india simon ferrier manufactured peacock in india mr morad bakche come from india so do hundred other student of kind retorted fuller be too suspicious dick see bird in bush perhaps be must like to know why mr bakche be so friendly with told so much about oriental be generally reserved dont talk over shop mr bakche told that have come to look after family property how do know what consists of gem begum of kam gave to george inderwick over one hundred year ago remember how must bakche know about oriental have long memory however admit may be unduly suspicious a observe alan same must like to know what mr bakche be doing in miss grison house why be so friendly to even to extent of hinting that might be solicitor well then if doe consult will have to state reason if have to do with begum gem will know where be imagination be too vivid dick be not imagination use of sixth sense give impression contrary to fact insisted mr latimer if oh know believe in that occult rubbish interrupted fuller in rather rude way be too matter of fact to be superstitious too obstinate to change opinion mean replied dick equably well well son will not quarrel over matter time will show if be right in meantime what do make of miss grison statement that peacock must ruin can make nothing of ask for explanation humph riddle be hard to guess only thing can say be that dread lest sorley must learn of theft if so must prosecute so must be ruined be not afraid of sorley not now because doesnt knowso far a can seethat stole peacock why did tell that if told sorley miss grison know that be on side so to speak will not say anything to sorley who be dead against marriage with miss inderwick alan ruffled hair a be custom when perplexed can make nothing of matter cried greatly exasperated whats to be done see sorley at christmas when go down to belstone advised dick in calm way hear why want to discus cryptogram with in way may get on trail of lost peacock if sorley have miss grison need not be afraid that will ruin dicky if be thief sorley be murderer cant be sure of if have peacock can be sure first catch hare observed latimer sententiously in other word son wait learn if sorley have thing use theorizing alan can hing until learn more bakche probably will call see so will learn what have to do with matter have nothing to do with be sure said fuller vehemently sixth sense tell otherwise observed dick dryly hang sixth sense by mean to continue jotty will come see sooner later feel convinced then can learn dick paused learn what sixth sense doesnt tell wait see oh hang dick what nonsense talk moonshine grant returned latimer serenely until can gather more fact be certainly moonshine since seeing last have learned fact may startle moon told when went to look up yesterday baldwin grison be murderer whats that say cried alan a startled a dick must wish ah thought id raise hair yes son couple of month ago in opium den kept by chin chowor rather in lane outside ita well dressed man be found dead have be knocked on head with blunt instrument of bludgeon kind from letter card found in pocket be discovered that be independent gentleman who lived in west end who went down to rotherhithe to indulge in black smoke watch stud purse have be taken so be supposed that have be robbed by scoundrel haunting very shady part inspector moon must find nothing however to point out criminal have always be on hunt other day came across dead man watch have be pawned by mother slaig said that grison have given to instead of money for rent have stated that be own watch moon think that mother slaig be quite innocent of guilty knowledge that grison being hard up must have knocked down robbed dead man when left chin chow opium den search be made in grison room afterwards under loose board stud of victim be discovered so there be doubt that grison murdered man for money be afterwards murdered by unknown assassin for sake of peacock be just a well that grison be dead a certainly must have be arrested hanged for crime destiny gave dose of own gruel said alan thoughtfully must have be bad lot in spite of sister eulogy well remarked dick with shrug sorleys opinion of man seems to be more correct than miss grison poor soul wonder what will say when learns that brother acted in way will be thankful that violent death prevented appearance on scaffold said alan dryly what be moon doing about matter nothing what can do grison be dead relative of victim being of good position well off be not anxious to have fuss made over matter since murder took place in such locality can well understand alan son yes can well understand well grison have to pay very speedily for wickedness dont think that relative of dead man killed out of revenge oh dear relative be most respectable never went near rotherhithe first murder have nothing to do with second assure alan however there be nothing more to be said about grison crime must content in learning who killed after what have told dont think be worth worth revenging do mean well perhaps not peacock be worth search for assassin since finding mean finding mean to discover treasure suspect sorley with bakche a factor in case suspect one at present only sixth sense be not invariably to be relied upon think that indian friend may be mixed up with matter go down to belstone alan see if sorley still talk about cryptogram if doe submits one for solution will probably have to do with peacock if miss inderwicks tale of ancestor ferrier be to be believed of course be to be believed said alan tartly however will make quite sure by seeing ferriers manuscript for will be just a well said latimer ending conversation so matter be settled for end of year shortly afterwards dick went to paris to keep christmas a kind of heathen festival with artist friend in latin quarter while alan packed kit to journey to belstone enjoy simpler pleasure of british yuletide great season of church be on occasion quite one of old style such a must have delighted heart of dickens be have plenty of snow holly mistletoe peace on earth good will to men such like traditional thing have to do with holy birth undulating hill around belstone be clothed in spotless white ancient tree in park of inderwicks stood up gaunt bare black amidst chilly waste coal blanket food drink be bestowed on villager by gentry around who suddenly seemed to recollect that belstone existed so that poor have what american call time of life mr fuller also behaved philanthropically although be by mean rich sole person who did not act in traditionally charitable manner be mr randolph sorley said bluntly that have enough to do to look after gave blessing instead of more substantial gift a to marie never have single penny must call own lamented that poverty sorleys niggardly way a guardian prevented from obeying kind dictate of heart when be of age have money informed alan after church on christmas day will make everyone happy have made happy anyhow replied fuller enjoying stolen moment have obtained by evading sorley so nothing else

run smooth so long a have say in matter dont like must like to night when come to dinner at vicarage said marie with alarm if arent agreeable alan will be so unpleasant be always agreeable in father

desired alan reminded of dear mother have never have failure yet to night will have very jolly meal hope so sighed vicar wife confess be not quite at rest in mind about pudding there may be something wrong with mince pie very likely there will be since oven doesnt heat properly roast beef will not be up to mark now alan be making fun of dont know what be to be housewife dear dont mother dick be very rough ready in domestic arrangement have asked sorley to dinner a usual hear from marie yes dear replied mr fuller complacently father know be not well off wish to show yearly attention besides since love marie who be sweet girl must be pleased be pleased said son gravely although sorley doesnt approve of attention to niece mr fuller bristled what better match doe man want for girl demanded maternal feather on end have good blood in vein alan good prospect besides being very handsome im paragon mother there doubt of same sorley a observed when be last here want title wealth for marie hell never find either in back water of life river retorted mr fuller rather crossly since marie love there be more to be said in opinion there good deal more to be said in sorleys said alan dryly must remember own love romance dear be more sympathetic with mary desire to become wife never knew that sorley have love romance mother thought be wrapped up body soul in book on precious stone oh

school mother mother be repeating history interrupted alan vexed by prolix narrative know what about sorleys love affair loved miss marchmont died be one of marchmonts of augar place near lewes yes only daughter heiress mr sorley must have got lot of money property have married died manor along with income passed to distant cousin after death of old mr marchmont ten year ago what did miss marchmont die of chill contracted by getting wet in hunting field dear mr sorley be very fond of greatly lamented death loss of money said solicitor doubtfully dear really truly loved sometimes think alan that be not quite fair to mr sorley have have trouble dont like personally said fuller roundly there be insincere air about be not particularly fond of confessed mr fuller in apologetic way be always agreeable to although have lived here for quite five twenty year if not more there have never be word said against character save that be not generous poverty excuse that alan so try be agreeable to evening dear finished mr fuller making same request a marie have done of course will be agreeable wish to be very friendly with be natural dear since desire to gain consent to marriage with marie dear be quite forgetting dinner mr fuller hastened to kitchen with mind full of pudding mince pie roast beef alans reason for being friendly with sorley be not entirely due to cause mentioned by mother although be anxious enough to gain man consent to wooing felt confident thatunless for purposesorley must never give same consent since did not think that vicar son be good match for pretty long descended niece in year when marie be of age consent of guardian must be dispensed with so that particular matter did not trouble young man overmuch really desired to establish friendly relation with sorley in order to learn if have peacock of jewel in possession a be mary property must be given to since uncle loved jewel probably knew that peacock besides being covered with precious stone must indicate whereabouts of box filled with similar gem be probable that must seek to keep ornament to always provided that possessed of alan be not quite sure if did have then supposition must be that have murdered baldwin grison for possession be difficult for fuller to see what must say in way of excuse for owning of course thought young man when went to dress for dinner threshed out matter in own mind if have wont make fuss about seeing must desire to solve riddle since at present there have be public mention that grison be murdered for sake if doe show to here paused greatly perplexed a foresaw how difficult must be to know how to act even if possession of peacock proved sorley to be criminal for sake of marie alan be unwilling to bring to justice yet on face of man must pay for crime confoundedly difficult to know what to do be fuller natural conclusion christmas dinner be great success in spite of doubt expressed by hostess five people who sat down to enjoy passed very agreeable hour marie have healthy appetite have reluctance in satisfying on fare be much more dainty than prepared by henny trent who acted a cook at monastery girl in simple white dress without ornament save childish necklace of red coral looked very pretty behaved very charmingly by end of quiet evening alan be more in love with than ever wondered if earth contained more delightful little lady sorley also made most agreeable being soothed by excellent dinner showed disposition to frown on young couple a to mr fuller now that dinner be off mind beamed on everyone including rosy faced sturdy little husband who overflowed with christian charity did not need season of yuletide to enhance ready generosity mr sorley be perfectly dressed a usual looked wonderfully well in young old way be so deceptive be well informed too talked on subject that in most exhaustive manner arguing with vicar agreeing with mr fuller giving occasional word to alan afterwards in quaint old drawing room conversation turned on death of grison although mr fuller did best to taboo subject on plea that upset wife mr fuller always liked poor man said vicar finally be agreeable clever woefully weak confessed old lady if have only stayed here must never have met with death must willingly have kept at monastery explained sorley in frank manner be rude to sister owing to drunken habit kept house in constant state of turmoil have to dismiss although gave chance to reform heard alan added turning to young man who be listening intently how sister blamed for death whats asked vicar sharply not directly said guest calmly must scarcely do that seeing be fifty mile away at monastery when grison be murdered in rotherhithe sister said that dismissal made take more than ever to opium smoking that drove to slum where met with tragic end pooh pooh louisa grison talk rubbish said mr fuller sturdily be always crazy about baldwin although certainly have good point foolish a be dont let talk more about matter upset wife be not topic for christmas day oh dont mind hearing of death protested mr fuller be only too anxious to know who killed poor creature shouldnt be surprised to hear that killed remarked sorley in abrupt way oh thats impossible said alan quickly medical evidence proved conclusively that be murdered stabbed to heart well boy man can stab to heart cant yes replied young man dryly must scarcely hide instrument with killed after death that a know be missing what sort of instrument be alan asked mr fuller stiletto be thought mother sound a though italian have hand in crime remarked vicar generally use stiletto cant say who killed of what nationality assassin be father since nothing can be learned likely to cast light on subject be sure of one thing from what latimer have told be that grison did not stab have reason to mad people never do have reason remarked mr sorley pointedly grison be not mad indeed have reason to believe that be insisted other father be eccentric doctor who practised in canterbury mother of louisa baldwin died in lunatic asylum mr fuller nodded sadly yes louisa told a much said for reason excused oddity of brother certainly have queer way hadnt john yes yes yes worse than other people rejoined fuller senior in vigorous fashion louisa certainly manages boarding house in sane enough manner a found when stayed there did stay there father asked alan twice thrice when went to town year year ago although have not stayed there lately wanted to help louisa poor soul now be doing so well that there be need for to assist by becoming few day boarder baldwin may have be trifle mad added vicar addressing sorley since sank so low displayed such weakness sister be sane enough be sure of did not speak very sanely other day when attacking a alan heard said mr sorley significantly be quietly having afternoon tea when miss grison rose suddenly denounced be mad dont agree with retorted vicar what do say alan young man shook head with embarrassed laugh have not seen sufficient of miss grison to pronounce opinion said turned to marie who be feeling rather neglected be rather dull for subject a said before be not suitable one for christmas day observed mr fuller marie dear give music girl obeyed with alacrity a have be yawning during dreary talk of elder in very musicianly style played two three classical piece then with alan sang of mendelssohn duet in voice blended far more agreeably than mr sorley approved of late conversation seemed to have upset nerve for wandered in restless manner round room betrayed disposition to come between young people in strange contrast to earlier demeanor when mr fuller be playing old fashioned selection of melody called irish diamond husband loved sorley came to sit beside alan engage in quiet conversation while marie vicar remained near piano listening to variation on garry owen must come over to monastery during week alan said mr sorley in discreet whisper must like to show collection of jewel will belong to marie after be gone oh will live for long time yet said alan affably doubt have enemy like other men need not be surprised if meet with grison fate poor wretch do mean demanded other sharply mean that in midst of life be in death rejoined sorley tartly in somewhat enigmatic manner what else must mean im hanged if know said alan frankly spoke from heart really must not understand man strange reference to violent end well well well remarked companion with affected cheerfulness may be imagination on part when one have collection of gem a have in house be not improbable that attempt may be made to get on part of thief have idea that attempt will be made oh dear speak generally for collection be valuable alan although perhaps not worth so much money a gem be given to george inderwick over one hundred year ago by begum of kam why do start asked in surprise marie told that related story of jewel to yesthat isshe did say something about matter stammered alan only did not know that kam be place where george inderwick went on behalf of heic to serve a native drill sergeant oh rajah of kams town state in madras presidency can see manuscript to morrow when come over music be stopping dont say anything more let keep matter to ourselves having thus forced fuller a be to be confidant sorley strolled across room to congratulate mr fuller on still brilliant touch alan remained where be on sofa staring at carpet wondering what revelation must be forthcoming when visited monastery next day for be determined to pay promised visit a soon a must lest sorley must change mind what startled most be to learn that jewel have belonged to begum of kam be very place mentioned by morad bakche a former territory of family dick be right thought alan bakche be after gem of peacock chapter viii explanation for next two three day alan enjoyed rural peace of country gave parent great deal of society anxious a be to follow up hint of sorley with reference to story of george inderwicks treasure did not display undue eagerness since be better to behave in casual manner lest suspicion must be aroused young man did not wish sorley to think that knew too much about matter have be making inquiry for be not improbable that might take alarm decline assistance fuller felt certain that there be skeleton in sorleys cupboard safely locked up a suspicion ever haunt guilty mind must require very slight circumstance to render worthy gentleman uneasy therefore alan pretended to indifference did not feel kept away from monastery until diplomacy be rewarded about middle of week by appearance of marie with request that must come over afternoon uncle ran want to see said girl pouting for be not pleased that alan have kept clear of company have gone morning to lewes on motor bicycle will be back at two oclock to meet in case said fuller promptly glancing at watch since be just eleven can have three hour to ourselves dont think want to pas time alone with oh marie when know how love dont really truly dont said miss inderwick who be looking provokingly pretty in fur jacket fur toque if loved wouldnt waste time a do waste time why not when be on holiday dont mean that sort of waste horrid boy know that be always in town be always here so when be down for few day must be with constantly must very much like to dearest spitfire must be wise when uncle discourages attention to so pointedly oh marie raised eyebrow pouted again if be afraid of uncle ran there be more to be said there be great deal more to be said retorted alan tucking arm under own can say on way to monastery when cat away at lewes two dear little mouse can play at belstone marie darling dont make face must be sensible be sensible have said dozen of time be most sensible girl in whole world so be same must be diplomatic in case uncle bother uncle think do dear said alan dryly just now be bothering by being cross about nothing marie if dont smile in usual angelic way will kiss here in open road smile smile shant said marie trying to pucker small face into black frown then have to burst out laughing silly boy hugged arm spoil dont do do like angel be there want of originality about alan be always calling angel what else be goddess gazelle queen of may in december how ridiculous miss inderwick laughed gayly good temper quite restored lover walked slowly through village up to gate of neglected park chatting much in same strain of course talked great nonsense a lover do when together language of cupid can scarcely be described a instructive alan be sensible clever young man marie be by mean wanting in mother wit yet conversation be so characteristic of several state of mind have entirely to do with wooing of man maid that common sense person past turtle dove stage must have doubted sanity then love be madness attack young at certain season custom have so sanctified lunacy so crazed be not locked up mercifully when glamor of love be on prefer to keep to so that indifferent people be not compelled to witness eccentricity only when be walking up avenue did conversation become more reasonable why doe uncle ran wish to see alan asked marie curiously intends to show collection of gem replied fuller who did not think prudent to be too open until knew more of sorleys mind did not like man suspected of having committed crime until be certain of guilt wished to keep silence after girl by side be daughter of man sister guardian so be best to say a little a possible oh have got lovely jewel said marie readily accepting explanation certainly be true one wish must let wear of seems so stupid to lock up lot of beautiful diamond emerald sapphire when come to meas uncle ran say willi shant leave in care wear will look like queen of sheba darling like rainbow replied miss inderwick smartly sort of color sparkling likelikelike frost finished taking illustration from glittering rime on bare tree be perfect december day blue sky arched over white expanse of snow untrodden save for track up avenue along young couple have travelled by time have come in sight of great mansion paused to admire irregular beauty red roof be hidden under billowy mass of dazzling whiteness a caught sunlight darkly green garment of ivy clothed be flecked everywhere with snow wreath icicle glittered like jewel hanging from eaves porch window from carved stonework discernible through greenery so that place looked like fairy palace although marie fortunate possessor saw house daily must not forbear exclamation of delight isnt lovely dearest a lovely a be darling assented alan readily think might show over house marie a have never explored completely daresay uncle ran wont let anyone go over although end of artist wish to come to wouldnt even let anyone paint picture of outside dont know why do murmured fuller half to no more than know why be not angry with miss grison for going over uninvited be strange replied miss inderwick thoughtfully think be little afraid of miss grison dear think be mad what do think havent seen enough of to say mr millington greatest friend told that thought miss grison mind be giving way be certainly not apparent in management of boarding house well may be mad on one point sane on many remarked marie pertinently seems to hate uncle ran dreadfully be because ascribes brother downfall to dont let talk about such dreary matter darling look over house arrange how will restore when be married when find treasure cried marie skipping lightly up step to open door come in alan must make best of time before uncle ran return wont be back until two oclock so say dont trust he always trying to catch in mischief a if ever have chance of doing shouldnt be surprised if pounced down on unawares in case can excuse by saying have come at request to see said alan promptly lead way marie let look over place from top to bottom marie assented very readily to be lover cicerone for next hour be passing along corridor peeping into room ascending descending stair searching for secret chamber outlet time marie talked telling alan tale about room that have heard from granny trent who have lived nearly whole of long life in old building what struck alan most be absence of furniture room after room have be stripped bare vast house gave impression of being empty shell yet according to old woman whom looked in to see in particular den place have be crammed with treasure later than twenty year ago when mr inderwick have died he sold mourned granny who did not seem to have much love for mastertables chair wardrobe picture manner of thing dear shame say for belong to miss marie aint got right to get rid of property granny be lively active woman small shrivelled in look with twinkling black eye expressive face age did not seem to have dulled faculty for spoke clearly to point what be more intimated that must see through brick wall meaning in plain englishhow easy be to guess that young couple be in love very good thing too said granny nodding sagely being handsome good kind hearted mr alan wouldnt be son of dear at vicarage else just marry lamb sir a soon a can get pa to read service if only to look after mr sorley inquired fuller pointedly mean who else must mean mr alan if not poor feckless thing call selling up lamb good to waste money on bit of stone ah if luck of inderwicks wasnt missing thered be plenty of mean peacock do blessed bird that mean good fortune to lamb here sir grison took ill swear when went away over twenty year ago took luck along with for never will come backits luck of family im talking of mr alanuntil peacock be under roof again what sort of luck will bring granny asked marie eagerly marriage to mr alan here fortune when riddle be read a surely will be outgoing for a be uncle dont look after lamb a must drat oh mean well granny if mean well why dont do well retorted old woman never mind luck will come way lamb when least expect now go down to dining room dear ill tell jenny to set out something for to eat cant live on love chuckled granny eye twinkling two laughed took advice even to extent of making very excellent luncheon plain a fare be when meal ended marie carried off fuller to library lighted cigarette with own fair hand when be comfortably puffing cloud of bluish smoke miss inderwick perched on arm of chair ruffled hair told that be most disagreeable person in wide world led to amiable contradiction finally to kissing be when be in middle of philanderings that raised eye to see mr sorley standing at door be stiff with indignation looked more like haughty unbending aristocrat than ever so be way in deceive marie said with angry look how dare why not said fuller a girl sprang away from chair in alarm love marie love must have seen that age ago mr sorley did sir position doe not meet with approval who care cried niece defiantly shant marry anyone alan will marry man select said sorley sternly unless unless what demanded fuller coolly be perfectly sure that marie must remain true to therefore have fear of uncle will explain that when be alone explain now said miss inderwick swiftly have right to know why object to alan becoming husband have money position will make money make position said alan calmly in good time mr sorley in good time will be lord chancellor one day said marie boldly will have gray hair by time snapped uncle until be lord chancellor certainly shant marry will so there will not unless observed alan smoothly said unless mr sorley unless find begum treasure oh uncle ran cried marie in dismay when know that peacock be lost without one can solve riddle even know exactly what be peacock be began sorley stopped short never mind go away dear let talk to alan spoke so mildly that marie began to think better of position did not appear to be so dead against marriage with fuller a earlier word have intimated alan on part guessed from abrupt stopping of sentence sorley knew something about missing peacock did not wish to reveal while marie be in room acting on hint took bull by horn look here sir said rising to address host more impressively know that discovery of treasure be connected with cryptogram have to do with lost peacock accept term a having experience in secret writing be sure can solve mystery have baffled everyone for so long if do treasure be found will youas sayconsent to marie becoming wife yes said sorley tersely decisively of course part of treasure must be given to oh will buy consent to marriage with half of said marie in rather contemptuous tone fuller secretly did not endorse too generous offer determined that if did solve riddle to hand over gem to miss inderwick be not diplomatic at moment to insist upon too much particularly a sorley have practically agreed to marriage first thing to do be to find jewel said alan easily then thing can be better arranged mr sorley very well said old gentleman taking for granted alan a well a niece agreed to term extortionate a be understand one marie can go away want to stop hear everything exclaimed rebelliously time be not ripe for to hear everything a yet know very little wish to consult alan about arriving at truth can tell wish to know later go dear said fuller in low voice leading girl to door can act for marie pouted tossed pretty head be horrid murmured do want to know about peacock will know if anything be to be discovered about very well said obediently think youre horrid same when left library door be closed sorley who have removed overcoat glove cap sank into chair with sigh be evidently tired out by ride to lewes back again alan waited for to open conversation for having suspicion of man particularly after hesitation when marie have mentioned peacock behooved to be cautious sorley thought for few moment with eye on fuller face then spoke abruptly know that miss grison hate why demanded shortly yes accuses of having ruined brother by having dismissed wrongfully quite so act like mad woman in consequence a if must help man going to bad gave chance instead of prosecuting for forging check let go free dont see must have behaved better that sank to rotherhithe slum be purely own fault miss grison doesnt think so can think what chooses retorted sorley coolly need take notice of vagary of crazy creature such a surely be paused looked oddly at companion do know why dismissed brother alan have just explained because of forged check be not exact cause must have overlooked that since really be sorry for poor wretch even though be rude to sister decided nuisance in house with drunken habit use of opium real reason for dismissing be that miss grisonlouisa a used to call peacock of jewel oh said fuller with non committal air for wished to know more about theft before stating that miss grison have confessed to even when knew be not sure if must be thus frank yes knew how valued because of workmanship gem set in golden body because be clue to large treasure be hiddenyou know storyby simon ferrier told that if did not return must dismiss brother on account of forged check refused did dismiss so really have only to thank for baldwin downfall although like woman blame in silly way doe if took peacock why didnt have arrested must have done so that declared intention of destroying ornament must act in such way said that must drop into thamesshe be in london when found out about theftor must melt in fire a peacock be sole clue to hiding place of begum gem may guess that with desperate woman did not dare to act so drastically a deserved suppose gave peacock to brother suggested alan artfully hoping that sorley must commit by confessing knowledge that grison held ornament at time of death man did nothing of sort didnt said sharply so far a know have in possession twenty year went again again to see try for recovery insisting that have ruined brother refused to surrender lest must destroy must not use force of law now be certain that have time why be certain asked fuller who be impressed by frank way in man spoke certainly did not seem to have anything to conceal solicitor wondered whether have misjudged mr sorley waved hand one moment said slowly may wonder why be telling why have brought into matter do so because tell that be good at solving riddle also since be in love with marie be bound to protect interest jewel belong to so be anxious that must help to find so that marie may get benefit of sale a will have house own income collection of gem when die think be asking too much in requesting share of treasure especially when also will go to niece after death alan nodded since be reasonable enough know why want to help remarked without peacock can hing mr sorley rose went to alcove of room in be set tall carved cupboard of black oak opening took out object wrapped in chamois leather returned to writing table to display to visitor astonished eye missing peacock of jewel on day when miss grison called name by own confession wandered over house uninvited said man quietly must have brought back day after departed found peacock in yonder cupboard place where frequently go a miss grison knew why must restore in stealthy way restore at be not able to say know that took from here twenty year agofrom cupboard in fact where be always keptand unasked for visit to house must have be to replace alan stared at glittering bird wasas latimer have statedthe size of thrush greatly admired beauty perfection of workmanship ferrier assuredly have learned great deal in east for shape feather of bird be truly wonderfully created in delicate line eye be ruby there be tuft of emerald on head comparatively few stone studded body a be reserved for glory of tail be outspread like large fanand in be set sapphire opal ruby many other precious stone scintillated glory like rainbow especially when sorley moved gem to fro in thread of sunlight pierced dusky atmosphere of room what young man thought while stared at lovely object be whether sorley be guilty innocent presence of ornament have be in possession of dead man hinted former sorleys explanationfeasible enough on basis of miss grison abrupt visitseemed to declare latter a man be considered guilty in english law until criminality be proved a alan be solicitor gave sorley benefit of doubt until such time a have more trustworthy evidence to go upon having taken up attitude treated man a innocent asked question about peacock be necessary to do so if riddle be to be solved so far a can see said fuller following train of thought there be secret writing to be seen there be secret writing said sorley unexpectedly thought wished to solve cryptogram so do cryptogram can be other than in letter figure fuller gazed at peacock cant understand said bewildered well alan rejoined fuller with shrug cant so have brought into business on assumption that two head be better than one have even opened peacock to find secret there be nothing inside in opinion secret be hidden in tail alan be still puzzled in tail echoed in jewel somehow explained mr sorley meditatively see there be three semicircle of gem on tail between second third appears triangle of ruby now if can read meaning of three row of precious stone may explain triangle be probably key to whole mystery still cant understand why must mystery be concealed in jewel of tail may be merely for decorative purpose dont think so of course gem may imitate peacock tail from nature never saw bird with triangle marked in way alan nodded be right so far have further idea not one riddle be to be read on tail by mean of precious stone how cant say whats opinion alan have none said young man hopelessly will have to turn over matter in own mind then will let know mr sorley carefully locked up peacock in cupboard shrugged shoulder have thought over problem for year be nearer solution than ever be if solve will marry niece with prize in view can not fail said fuller hopefully same outlook regarding reading of riddle be very doubtful chapter ix trail alan fuller left monastery in very perplexed state of mind a may be guessed for revelation made by mr sorley startled considerably on hint given by miss grison have suspected that man knew something about rotherhithe crime now production of golden peacock seemed to endorse suspicion according to jottywho must not have manufactured storythe deceased have be in possession of ornament shortly before death miss grison also have stated that same have be given by to man although admitted having stolen from great house how then did pas into mr sorleys hand unless gentleman have committed crime certainly explanation rather belief that miss grison have restored peacock to cupboard when paid unexpected visit appeared to be feasible before fuller must entirely believe be necessary that sorleys suggestion must be supported by woman acknowledgment must be mentioned a point in man favor that did not say positively miss grison have brought back ornament on occasion only gave out idea to account for own production of article considered alan while plodding homeward sorley be not aware that be known to moon jotty dick that crime on face of be committed for sake of peacock have known a much might have accounted for coming into possession by saying that miss grison have brought back since be ignorant dont see use of making such excuse must easily have said that ornament have be mislaid that have found by chance indeed that miss grison have hidden thing when stole in room without troubling to remove from place sorleys explanation certainly seems to point to complete innocence then again a young man considered later sorley have within last few month purchased motor bicycle have told obvious falsehood a to time of possession on machine must easily cover fifty mile between london belstone twice over in night by hard riding thus might have be in town about time when crime be committed without anyone being wiser ownership of motor bicycle assuredly hinted that man have acted in way if so chance be that have murdered grison to recover peacock in case must hardly venture to show spoil so openly knowing at what cost have obtained even though unaware that police knew how dead man have be slain on account of ornament certainly desired fuller assistance to unravel problem connected with golden bird thenas alan thoughthe must have produced drawing of article saying that have be made by someone else before miss grison have stolen fetish of inderwicks in correct picture drawn to scale colored there must be quite enough to go upon to guess riddle since mystery of peacock be evidently on surface not connected with interior of body sorleyas stated have opened that to find nothing wanting fuller to help assuredly must have spoken entire truth while alan be thus turning matter over in bewildered mind heard name called looked round to see marie flying over snowy ground caught up with breathless crimson with race to seize arm with reproachful expression be mean cried recovering breath ive be waiting for to come out tell what uncle ran said to left without word saw passing down avenue so followed a hard a be able why do act in horrid secret way disagreeable thing fuller halted looked at doubtfully since have imparted to girl that knowledge regarding grison possession of peacock have obtained from inspector moon through latimer certainly did not intend to reveal that sorley have displayed ornament in library must do so marie must at once on what knew jump to conclusionand very naturallythat uncle be guilty being of emotional nature must probably refuse to remain in house with man in case truth must have to be told if be sorley learned that be suspected must probably place obstacle in way of what really happened coming to light be assuming really be criminal fact of alan after thinking over thing be by mean certain if man be innocent might make outcry to clear must be equally prejudicial to solution of problem more secretly operation be conducted until positive knowledge be forthcoming better must be for cause of justice in case justice consisted in bringing assassin of baldwin grison to gallows oh said alan lightly smiling at inquiring look uncle only asked to assist to learn riddle of peacock how can that be done when peacock be missing uncle have drawing of bird replied young man evasively have never seen declared marie rather crossly a peacock belongs to must see will show to in few day answered alan quickly made mental resolve to prepare drawing indeed be necessary that must have since must not take actual bird to town required something tangible upon to work dont bother uncle about matter marie may withdraw permission what permission must become engaged to oh alan oh alan oh alan marie must only gasp blush be said fuller correcting doe not directly sanction official engagement say that if solve problem find jewel that will agree to marriage meanwhile can be together a often a like be a good a engagement cried marie clapping hand with delight how good of uncle ran love for dont tell so interposed fuller hastily he odd fish if know have told of yielding so far may change mind dear marie nodded very wisely solemnly see quite understand will say nothing to uncle ran ask question not one will tell everything wont said pressing up to side in coaxing manner of course alan assured whatever discovery make regarding riddle will know girl be satisfied with not guessing that lover be withholding information connected with more serious matter of rotherhithe murder havingas now presumedfull permission from sorley to display preference for alan marie boldly took arm walked through village with in most open manner there be chance now that uncle ran must appear to make trouble girl declared a clung to lover that trouble be over for of course such very clever boy such a be dear will easily solve riddle hope replied fuller doubtfully be hard riddle marie have baffled everyone for over one hundred year well said miss inderwick arguing from feminine standpoint if anyone have guessed riddle jewel must have be sold by time probably money must have be spent so be just a well that truth have not become known will guess riddle dear clever boy that be then will become very very rich even though half of what find go to uncle ran nothing will go to uncle ran said alan grimly because uncle ran have right to ask for shareunless of course solves riddle peacock treasure can point out marie belong to so dont go making hasty promise to mr sorley above dearmark what say little featherheaddont sign paper if asks to marie nodded meditatively understand what mean alan of course uncle ran be fond of jewel andwell then will sign nothing without consulting dear dont tell advised of course not must take dislike to if did dont worry alan darling for know exactly how to behave behave just a have done marie let sorley believe that anything new be afoot that there be understanding between miss inderwick nodded vigorously to imply that knew what be about two walked on for distance in silence over cobblestone pavement of belstone main street occasional smile look of approval be cast at young couple by stray villager for alan be great favorite in father parish marie be much more popular than uncle inhabitant of belstone believed that if marie became mr alan fuller that old day of plenty must return to monastery in must share for credited young man with brain must enable to make great deal of money if did seeing that have generous nature be just a well that must marry last descendant of ancient family who have ruled neighborhood public sympathy be on side of lover to marie alan paid attention since be wrapped up in one girl felt quite happy in fuller company occasionally glanced at meditative face alan appeared to be thinking deeply apparently of something not connected with with natural jealousy of woman in love marie must not permit be thinking about dear asked suspiciously about morad bakche miss inderwick opened eye on hearing strange name who be be indian gentleman dear whom met at miss grison why must think about just now when be here alan fuller answered first part of question passed over latter be wondering if have anything to do with peacock remark put end to mary egotism for time being why must have anything to do with demanded astonished well exclaimed young man quietly have come to england so told to search for mislaid family property be descended from rajah of kam to whom george inderwick be sent by heic dear marie having read re read story of ferrier grasped connection at once then know about peacock cried in dismay be what wish to learn begum of kam certainly gave jewel be looking for to george inderwick from whom descend to so a morad bakche represents kam family be just possible that have come to get back gem if can shant have cried marie becoming flushed dont let take alan fuller laughed have to find first remarked coolly when have in possession then can talk over morad bakches claim shant have murmured marie much disturbed be mine after alan may not have come for begum treasure may may not be unprepared to give opinion only be so strange that must live at miss grison boarding house considering that know about peacock be to reveal whereabouts of what man probably desire didnt get to boarding house by chance be certain dick fancy alsoby sixth sense a declaresthat morad bakche may have design on treasure be very strange said miss inderwick pondering over speech how must find out that miss grison knew about peacock must learn have ever seen indian gentleman in village dear haunting monastery no if have must have told must have written about see so few people about here alanstrangers that isthat anyone new be quickly noticed well may not have seen man others may have who

landlady of inn to stranger must go even if only came for day come let interview mr verwin marie assented eagerly for search be like game interested greatly pair simply retraced step entered green space in centre of belstone whence street lane diverged to behold shabby old inn facing directly be ancient georgian building ugly without comfortable within have be more notable in day of stage coach than be now wall sadly needed coat of paint roof required patching while door window must have be better for little attention in fact there be half hearted look about red fox showed that good lady who

monastery for shabby room be fairly comfortable cooking within limit be tolerably good mr verwins money mostly came from pocket of laborer yokel who drank very inferior beer supplied while talked over

freely in discussing what heard that villager be so somnolent mr verwin must many many time have be in danger of libel action reigning a kind of rural queen one be bold enough to bring to book if anyone have dared to venture on course must have be excluded for ever from taproom such excommunication be not to be thought of by anyone who desired to see life life be nowhere to be seen in belstone save under noisy roof of red fox mr verwin welcomed young couple moment set foot on threshold a have already espied from window being very stout woman must scarcely curtsey did best invited visitor into best parlor be great honor that vicar son leading lady of neighborhoodfor that marie be by virtue of descent if not of moneyand mr verwin be quite overwhelmed a inn be quite respectable well

difficulty a said good bye for do hope miss mr alan sir a youll come in again not forgetting miss a be kitchen maid at monastery before verwin came along to make happy bride so have interest of family at heart sitting on throne be where must be miss with under pretty foot a will be when peacock come again to own if grison person be dead murdered say with much blood serve right hope a he sent back peacock by post if sisterlouisas nameaint got be just a likely a not taking into well good day sirgood day missand bless for nice looking couple mr verwins voice arose to perfect scream a distance between visitor increased not until be on verge of green entering lane led to vicarage did sound of adieu die away marie said alan seriously if ever talk so much will divorce at once poor verwin must have be glad to leave world always make head ache said marie laughing other people heart ache owing to gossip however cant make mischief about what have be talking since explained exactly what meant so bakche came down here to ask after peacock show a thought long ago that be after begum gem what will do alan asked marie anxiously consult dick tell have found out meanwhile marie need not tell uncle what have discovered mr verwin will probably do said marie darkly alan frowned cant stop tongue worse luck said with sigh chapter x mr sorleys jewel there be doubt that evidence of village gossip must be valuable in connection with rotherhithe crime since showed that person besides mr sorley desired to obtain possession of peacock of jewel from oral tradition perhaps from family paper be apparent that morad bakche have learned how great great grandmother whatever relationship might be have presented gem to george inderwick also mere fact that have sought to learn history of fetish from mr verwin indicated that knew in way not yet to be explained how golden bird must reveal hiding place of treasure that have met with cousin of mary in india a have told landlady to account for knowledge of peacock be merely excuse a relative of inderwick family be in india at present time of course only bakche must explain how have managed to trace fetish have to do with family treasure of ancestor might do so when called on fuller young man quite expected to do mr verwin thought alan a retired to bed undoubtedly must have told be paying attention to marie so be why bakche behaved so amiably to at boarding house dick be right after for man be seeking for gem politeness to have something to do with hope of getting be certain to look up again if pretend to know nothing will have to speak out if desire assistance then there sorley be at point that young man sens became confused fell asleep next morning determined to see mary uncle ask if have seen bakche in village haunting ground of monastery of course indian be working secretly to regain what people have lost same might have gone boldly to sorley sought to learn if gentleman knew detail of gem whereabouts alan remembered vaguely that sorley have talked of possibility of being murdered although man insisted that chance have to do with own private collection of jewel be not improbable that bakche have threatened indian be not man to stick at murder if wished to gain end alan wondered if have killed baldwin grison in order to get peacock supposition dismissed a ridiculous since have bakche secured plunder assuredly must not have sent to mr sorley however sole chance of learning more le of truth lay in questioning men alan began with sorley also wished to make drawing of peacock so a to have before eye exact representation of bird alan have fair idea of art have at one time amused with sketching not being particularly successful have abandoned hobby however possessed sufficient technical skill to draw bird color drawing so looked out japanned tin paint box took in pocket to monastery be couple of day before returned to town at beginning of new year luckily on occasion marie have gone to see schoolgirl friend at brighton so fuller be glad that must not be at home to interrupt interview with mr sorley asked too many question having regard to uncle very peculiar position alan found difficulty in answering finally although intended to show sketch of peacock did not desire to see preparing since must have given lie to assertion that sorley already possessed such drawing moreover might reveal that peacock have returned to old home therefore fuller entered big house feeling thankful that marie be out of way for few hour being very much in love with have never expected to have feeling felt rather ashamed of in consequence a knew that be acting straightforwardly under particularly difficult circumstance cheered up saluted host with smile henny trent with grin on dutch doll face have introduced into library here mr sorley be writing letter how be alan said rising to greet visitor looking a spick span a though have just stepped out of bandbox thought have returned to duty in chancery lane go back day after to morrow replied solicitor shaking hand wondering if be doing so with man who ought to be in new bailey dock came to say good bye to ask to allow to make drawing of peacock for what reason questioned sorley suspiciously uneasily reason be very apparent sir riddle be to be read on exterior of peacock say think so since have opened bird found nothing inside then must have representation of article before eye in order may ponder over sign what sign there have answered fuller frankly so far a can see there be sign of hieroglyphic writing on bird so dont see that can in way indicate hiding place of begum gem if have picture examine everything about carefully may hit on solution dont appear to be very certain of success said mr sorley dryly yet told that be adept at solving cryptogram if consist of sign alan explained cautiously can see sign on peacock well sir will let draw certainly since wish to work with in endeavor to learn where ferrier concealed treasure dont want to show drawing over place lest someone else must guess secret oh will be careful said fuller cheerfully making mental reservation that dick latimer must see sketch satisfied with promise sorley took golden peacock from cupboard of black oak unwrapped chamois leather covering to display on table before doing so locked library door without apologizing action seemed highly suspicious to visitor if cautious with others who be in house sorley be certainly very frank in dealing with alan although young man must not bring to entirely trust host admitted privately that man did not act in way suggested terror of law if have murdered grison to gain possession of fetish assuredly must be more cautious in showing to lawyer fuller never must make up mind a to sorleys innocence guilt wavered between belief disbelief in way annoyed there be nothing else to be done until more evidence be forthcoming young man looked searchingly at beautiful specimen of goldsmith work glittered on table ferrier knew trade thoroughly probably have acquired skill when in india feather form head of bird be perfectly done in minute delicate manner showed how painstaking creator have be tiny emerald on head tuft trembled on golden wire like filament of flower ruby eye be set admirably in socket breast shone with few gem body of bird be of feathered gold artist seemed to have reserved full blaze of beauty for outspread tail yet there be fewer jewel in than might have be expected for in three curved row followed semicircular outline of tail alan counted only fifteen precious stone namely eight gem in first row four in second three in third then between second third be triangle contained fifteen minute ruby on one of three side fifteen gem in line murmured fuller thoughtfully fifteen of in line of triangle wonder mr sorley if number fifteen be key to secret cant say dont know certainly can not see how can be replied host doubtfully have tried in way to solve riddle can not even see how to make beginning secret may be contained in position of stone shape of stone color of stone alan faced round what do mean by color answering riddle be just idea got from man who be theosophist in what theythe theosophist meancall aura of human being can be seen by gifted with astral sight color mean something dont quite follow mr sorley although have heard something of sort from dick belief in occult thing do cant say have looked into rejoined sorley in careless manner only attended to matter so far a meaning of color be concerneda kind of color alphabet a be pink mean affection blue mean religion green sympathy so on applied principle wouldnt work fuller quite believed a did not see how principle in question must be applied however be too engrossed in drawing bird to go into subject at present moment promised to ask for more thorough explanation of color alphabetas mr sorley aptly called itfrom dick latimer meantime drew outline of peacock filled in detail being particularly careful a to position of stone in tail then slowly colored part in accordance with original object when finished laid down brush with tired sigh held out sketch at arm length mr sorley restored peacock to chamois leather wrapping to cupboard after returned to examine alans artistic effort very good very good said nodding have done very exactly although drawing be very stiff rather architectural isnt sir original be stiff also be not drawing from artistic point of view with idea of getting exact representation of thing said alan slipping sketch into envelope put along with paint box into pocket before leaving fuller determined to speak to sorley of what have heard from mr verwin regarding visit of morad bakche to belstone have immediately after interview warned marie not to mention what have be said to uncle on reflection thought that must be just a well to learn what must moreover mr verwin being loose tongued must probably talk about matter if reached sorleys ear might get into suspicious mind that alan be working against rather than with attitude be not to be permitted since in case union be strength whether sorley be guilty innocent young manas have be said beforecould only decide on what evidence possessed in event seeing that gentleman in question be mary uncle fuller wished to arrive at truth without too much publicity for publicity on face of meant intervention of police do know went to dinner at miss grison boarding house asked alan in must be careless manner retorted sorley again looking uneasy doe not interest if did manner gave lie to statement that woman hate be trying to injure in what way sorley looked hard at speaker by bringing back peacock dont quite understand fuller did not a remark puzzled great deal lacking a did feasible explanation woman stole peacock said sorley gloomily because knew that valued knew also that there be riddle connected with must probably result in treasure being found for over twenty year resisted supplication threat to give back did not dare to move in matteras told before alanlest must destroy yet here come down secretly put back peacock in old place without word of explanation have asked why behaved in manner be only too content to have golden bird back again without asking question must probably tell falsehood since hate if hate mr sorley why did give back what so very greatly desired be what wish to know cried elder man excitedly be for good object be certain mean to cause trouble in way how fail to see remember threat in very room when be here alan nodded be very strange murmured wondered if sorley really meant what said whether be preparing excuse for must be toldsay by policethat grison at time of death have possessed golden peacock be very strange said alan again pondered deeply while sorley watched gloomily in shifty stealthy manner seemed more uneasy anxious than ever why did visit mr grison boarding house asked abruptly fuller roused to hear must about rotherhithe crime mr sorley dick be at inquest dick who be dick dick latimer reporter man who share room be at college together have met down here mr sorley yes yes remember now name slipped memory so be at inquest be yes like be very interested in crime there be nothing interesting about said sorley abruptly once more scoundrel of sailor murdered poor devil motive asked fuller wondering if host hinted at dead man possession of peacock sorley shrugged shoulder have sort of people ever motive alan asked skeptically certainly man doesnt put head in noose for nothing noose mr sorley shivered put hand to throat with uncomfortable look suppose man must keep clear of gallows if must butbutwell never mind alan let change disagreeable subject promised to show own private collection of gem yes will be pleased to look at answered young man who saw that last remark have greatly affected host fact again aroused suspicion made shrink from dapper gentleman mr sorley made reply went to panel marked with cross cut in wood formed portion of inside wall of library fumbled at spring for moment then panel slid into groove to display cupboard with many shelf upon be ranged tray of jewel one by one man brought to central table eye glittered with fanatic joy a pointed out various beauty certainly throughout many year have succeeded in gathering together number of precious stone little by little have collected for over thirty year explained mr sorley mounting hobby horse buying here there whenever have chance sometimes selling at bargain have bought so a to get particular gem there be quite six thousand pound worth of jewel here alan only poverty have prevented buying more fuller did not hint a might have done that collector have used ward income a well a own to indulge expensive taste have also sold furniture to have claim for same reason under circumstance be foolish to quarrel with sorley on point until mystery of murder peacock be solved alan wished to keep on good term with man who evidently have to do with therefore examined gem listened patiently to sorleys explanation jewel be certainly well worth looking at there be diamond cut uncut ruby colored like port wine of true pigeon blood hue emerald displayed verdant tint there be sapphire color of summer sky pearl be conspicuous by absence a if kept in collection not worn sorley explained thisthey became discolored beryl stone amethyst carbuncle opal many hued a rainbow be displayed on black velvet of willow tray collection be not of extraordinary value sorley gloated over darling streaming stone between finger holding up to light pointing out to fuller particular excellence of expensive hobby said alan after hour have be passed in way for sorley talked on with merciless zeal of collector in manner be boy then gem be always worth money can always sell if necessary shuddered hope will not be necessary must be like parting with life to give up know single one represents day week of bargaining must tell history of gem fear must be too long said fuller hastily for be growing weary of enthusiasm be not afraid of being stolen snapped sorley putting back tray adjusting panel so that looked exactly like portion of wall one must ever guess that jewel be behind cross know dont think will rob alan have have have be not fond enough of gem to do so said young man indifferently said at vicarage that feared lest must be murdered for sake of collection did did forget certainly did insisted fuller looking at searchingly seemed to be very much afraid well of course there be six thousand pound worth of gem there one might have particular person in mind sorley turned gray gasped why do say that asked sharply fuller looked at harder than ever told that dined at miss grison boarding house explained while there met with man who called morad bakche mr sorley gasped again indian muttered nervously ah alan gasped so have seen seen seen what do mean mean that morad bakche came down to belstone to ask after peacock gained information from mr verwin at inn told how be suspected that grison have stolen ornament gave bloomsbury address so morad bakche be at miss grison muttered sorley sitting down make more certain that be up to good in connection with thought strange said alan dryly sorley did not reply looked hard at carpet what do think of indian asked abruptly think be man who will stick at nothing to get peacock then be after that must know said alan meaningly how must know there be note of defiance in man voice because mr verwin declared that bakche went to look at monastery if did thinkfrom what hinted just nowthat saw yes saw what be more spoke to confound that woman chatter too much why must not questioned solicitor story of peacock be well knownthat be history of being fetish of inderwicks that can reveal treasure be not known fancy quite so after mr verwin only said what everyone else can say alan wish hadnt told bakche about grison fuller shrugged shoulder what doe matter now have peacock in own possession yes have peacock if bakche learns that may try murder be just manas sayto stick at nothing oh then be what meant when hinted fear to on christmas day at vicarage yes sorley wiped face again looking still gray anxious of course miss grison have brought back peacock by time if hadnt got must not be so afraid ah rose began to walk up down in startled way see game now alan will tell bakche how have peacock willand willoh alan man gripped fuller arm appeared to be thoroughly frightened at idea of raid being made by indian solicitor gently forced sorley to sit down again asked for explanation must be frank with if be to help said solicitor oh will be frank panted sorley a though have be running for long distance can trust want to marry niece be to benefit to be on side then alan cut short vague chatter tell about bakche well then did come to monastery about july last called here openly told what mr verwin have stated gave to understand that be representative of kam royal people knew about peacock how did learn from family paper stated that begum have given gem to george inderwick because saved life life of son hum murmured alan to so excuse of having be told by inderwick in india be lost bakche wanted peacock told that be lost did say who have stolen didnt thought if did that miss grison out of spite might give to so must lose treasure did bakche know that peacock must reveal whereabouts of sorley interrupted eagerly of course did paper in question told that ferrier have manufactured peacock a guide bakche declared that begum have right to give family jewel to inderwick insisted must surrender peacock so that must trace recover said that bird be lost went away greatly dissatisfied saying that must look for of course said alan nodding a mr verwin have told that grison have stolen have given boarding house address went there to get from wonder why didnt give to to spite groaned sorley fuller be on point of saying that must not because brother possessed desired article checked did not wish to let sorley know that knew how baldwin grison have be murdered for sake of very peacock apparently from what have just be said sorley believed that sister have always possessed preferred to give to said alan yes cried man why because knew that bakche wanted now will tell will come murder to get may not be so bloodthirsty said fuller encouragingly after if fear that why not give peacock said sorley energetically shant give up chance of getting treasure belongs to marie cant a guardian give up alan thought that sorley be rather thinking of than of niece whats to be done nothing tell nothing said other man almost fiercely will hide peacock along with own jewel behind panel one will ever guess that be there will ask village policeman to keep eye on monastery in case bakche try to rob what will do alan course be obvious mr sorley will try solve riddle yes yes can then get treasure bakche will be outwitted even if steal peacock have drawing to unravel problem go go alan go hold tongue for miss grison may not have told man have bird perhaps said fuller dubiously time alone will show took leave feeling miss grison have probably informed bakche about peacock on chance that must trouble man hated chapter xi jotty in due course mr fuller returned to office to chamber in barker inn only to find that dick have not yet put in appearance alan regretted absence greatly since latimer be one person to whom must talk freely needle to say young man be bubbling over with information have acquired found very difficult to think of anything else be scarcely good state of mind in to attend to client affair have solicitor be able must have set everything else aside until have solved mystery of rotherhithe murder have learned secret of peacock a have to earn bread butter such indulgence in gratifying curiosity be not to be thought of alan felt very unsettled for quite week after arrival in chancery lane be anxiety allayed when heard from clerk that during absence urchin who called alonzo have haunted office demanding on occasion to see mr fuller odd thing about matter be that when alan really did return jottyto give slum namefailed to put in appearance solicitor did not dare to write to lad saying that must be glad to accord interview on settled date since miss grison might read letter prevent boy attendance for same reason fuller did not call at thimble square house lest landlady being extremely sharp mightand probably wouldguess that be tampering with jottys loyalty a matter of fact alan be not a did not seek to question page about lady simply wished to learn what have to say concerning association with baldwin grison a dead man sister desired that assassin of brother must be captured punished fuller deemed that be right in using mean to forward aim jottyalan felt sure of thiswas valuable witness if dexterously questioned might be able to throw light on darkness environed crime certainly seemed that next step to be taken be examination of street arab a lad did not put in appearance fulleron before mentioned groundsdid not dare to awaken miss grison suspicion by sending for have to wait patiently coupled with continued absence of latimer did not tend to sweeten young man now irritable temper in fact wear tear of thought so displayed outwardly that when dick did arrive commented openly on friend sorry look reporter came back to london by night mail finding when got to barker inn that alan have already gone to office followed there a soon a bath change of clothes have made respectable breakfast have already dispatched in restaurant on way from railway station dick having enjoyed holiday be in happy frame of mind smile left when saw chum anxious face what deuce be matter asked mr latimer when first greeting be over be smoking comfortably in chair look sick be sickwith worry said fuller emphatically that infernal case oh said dick leisurely part of in particular whole have much to tell a want opinion more look into matter more confused doe grow have be looking into matter asked dick provokingly calm yes have in consequence have scarcely enjoyed christmas at home cried alan not even with most charming girl in world no because asks question have to keep great deal from on account of uncle precisely hum be guilty dont know anyway have peacock latimer pushed back chair let pipe fall what have peacock ive seen what be more allowed to make drawing of alan fumbled among paper for sketch here be dicky devil ejaculated journalist staring at painted bird then man murdered grison after im not sure have doubt hang man know that grison be murdered for sake of original of laid finger on sketch if sorley have must have taken out of murdered man room well wont be so sure of when have heard story said alan in tart way for nerve be jangling tell old son remarked latimer recovering pipe not word did utter until be in full possession of alans information solicitor told everything from time have arrived at belstone until moment of departure carried up narrative a far a london by relating how jotty have be haunting office now that be back little fool wont turn up finished fuller greatly exasperated dare not send for nodded dick grimly be very obvious quieter keep business better will be until get at truth hum most extraordinary complication alan stared at sketch be now lying on table have solved riddle so far a can see there isnt riddle to solve look like murmured dick looking hard at fuller artistic effort so sixth sense be right when told that morad bakche be mixed up in matter alan nodded crossly wish that sixth sense must tell who murdered grison shant learn that until question sister if admits that took peacock to monastery at belstone sorley will be exonerated if declares that did not sorley will have to account for being in possession confound man cant see that ifas sorley saysshe wish to get into trouble will certainly decline to tell truth what be truth anyhow asked dick after fashion of pontius pilate lord know replied fuller disconsolately of course jotty never said that grison have peacock on precise night of murder boy only saw on previous occasion be quite possible that dead man may have given to sister to send to sorley make trouble hated man evidently with good reason yes if be case must argue that grison knew must be murdered be ridiculous besides sorley told lie about motor bicycle show that doe not wish known be able to slip up to town back again without making use of publicity of railway be inclined to suspect sorley a guilty person do think bakche may have killed grison for if have must scarcely have given peacock to sister for sorleys benefit alan nodded thought that said slowly well what be to be done now dicky inspector moon ought to know said latimer significantly fuller jumped up quickly not just now dick dont say anything to must certainly arrest sorley straight away wish to spare disgrace truth be bound to come out sooner later alan remarked dick perplexed how to act truth quite so still when known truth may not implicate mr sorley for know may be perfectly innocent may be retorted latimer dryly with shrug to mind seems to be deeply involved in matter evidence be strong circumstantial evidence corrected alan quickly dont see that interpolated word matter cent sonny peacock being in man possession point to guilt unless miss grison left secretly at monastery there be that chance certainly admitted dick with shrug however a sorley be not aware that be suspected wont try to bolt so under circumstance will hold tongue until thing straighten out trifle if doe try to leave country must speak alan so must else may be accused of compounding felony a lawyer ought to know that much do know said fuller impatiently if sorley be guilty assuredly must be arrested punished when case be proved same must give benefit of doubt until criminality be placed beyond question why do defend man so asked latimer suspiciously dont approve of a have told dozen of time be not thinking of man so much a of marie shame of having uncle tried hanged for sordid murder must certainly break heart dick well there something in how love doe complicate honest behavior that love miss inderwick must have hesitation in telling moon truth admit that thing being a be must ask not to speak to police until give leave very good old son see well end in jail for tampering with course of justice same will hold tongue now that being settled so far may ask what intend to do can hardly say what in opinion be step must take question miss grison learn if took back peacock said dick without moment hesitation hang man will only tell lie why must common sense let alone what talked about few moment ago must tell said fuller impatiently if did take trouble to implicate sorley wont give away by acknowledging admission that concealed peacock in old cupboard must exonerate sorley can see yes of course since hate man hullo whats up latimer asked question because alan suddenly started to foot listened intently to noise in outer office hear boy voice said solicitor hastily throwing open door just in time to permit jotty to be pushed into room by indignant clerk with whom have be arguing young man thought so thats right seymour ill attend to fuller closing door pointed out chair to page sit down jotty alonzer please sir said lad quickly dont want t hey anythin t do wiff m ole bad self ive turned over new leaf miss grison s well take look

alan must have kept fact of peacock being in sorleys possession to in meantime at event said jotty quickly picter of be kind t me goldbird e showed time agin well then said alan dick frown relaxed a

torked e if cove wos dirt stiff like too ole un tryin to look like young toff alan winced again a letter jottys very excellent description seemed to prove sorley be guilty person how do know that gentleman describe wrote letter co seed coming up hour so afore e wos good t kicked th bucket wos turned out long afore come in so go away dos wiff friend o mine never hears more till nex morning when mother slaig ups s e murder have bin done cruel be that know blessed bit sir said jotty cheerfully why didnt tell to inspector moon at inquest demanded latimer sharply co there wasnt quid in then retorted boy impudently hin fur nothin do anyhow now ive got wot arsked fur placed cap on head im on t give treat youth have edged near door by time held slightly open evidently expecting to be stopped indeed fuller put out arm to detain ask further question only to cause jotty to vanish in remarkably swift space of time dick prevented alan who be about to follow let go said latimer quickly can always get hold of when want compare letter without word alan did so placed one have received from sorley that jotty have sold under dick eye latter drew long breath there doubt about alan said sadly be written by one same man sorley have appointment with grison at mother slaigs on night of crime a letter prof also jotty declares that saw for description be very accurate hum wish have not shown boy that drawing of peacock moment did show guessed that have made mistake said fuller quickly so be forced against will to tell necessary lie in order to lull lad suspicion seems evident dick sorley got peacock from grison that yarn about sister leaving be wholly untrue whats to be done now sorley must be arrested for murder said dick decisively no may be innocent after innocent when have seen that note heard jottys description well said alan anxiously wait for three day before doing anything dick wavered then made up mind abruptly right ill wait said gruffly chapter xii indian client dick latimer have promised to hold peace for three day before imparting to inspector who be in charge of rotherhithe case what have be discovered with reference to sorley same be troubled in mind a must not be sure if be acting rightly much a sympathized with fuller because man likely to be arrested be uncle of girl to whom friend be engaged did not seem right that criminal must remain at large journalist indeed thought that alans objection be rather sentimental that justice must be done in spite of mary feeling assuredly must be outraged nevertheless admitted that fuller be placed in difficult position be natural that must wish to gain time in hope of proving mr sorleys innocence so avert scandal so far a dick must see there be chance of clearing man character have be with grison whom openly detested on very night when murder be committed shortly before took place a be conclusively proved not only by letter by evidence of street arab who certainly must never have invented accurate description of guilty person then again jotty have sworn that on night of crime have be given usual treat of display of peacock since be now in sorleys possession must only have passed into directly from dead man a presumed criminal full name randolph vernon sorley be intimated by initial r v s note to grison be certainly in handwriting there appeared to be doubt that have murdered miserable creature to obtain wrongful possession of inderwick fetish finally since have be stolen sorleys energy have be bent upon getting again in desperation probably have struck fatal blow of course story of miss grison having taken peacock back to monastery be oneso dick thoughtdeliberately invented to implicate woman account for reappearance of desired article upon evidence must scarcely be doubted that sorley be guilty when fact that have purchased motor bicycle be taken into account latimer must see flaw in indictment more than ever considered necessary to have sorley brought to justice must be done a soon a inspector moon be informed of discovery having made promise dick faithfully kept in spite of many qualm of conscience daily felt then on third day took up newspaper to find new extraordinary development of case after mastering article appeared in latest news daily paper much given to gossip jumped into hansom drove direct to fuller office chanced that alan be not engaged so dick entered at once into friend private room flourishing paper have seen asked placing before alan seen what asked other glancing at heading indicated then took in meaning at once good lord might well utter ejaculation for article contained account of inderwick fetish givenas be intimatedby le person than miss louisa grison story of ferrier be narrated much in same fashion a appeared in manuscript at monastery be very plainly stated that treasure be to be found when riddle attached to peacock be solved finally miss grison ended interview with man who have written article by saying that dead brother have possessed golden bird at time of death that in mind there be doubt that have be murdered for sake find peacock said miss grison find assassin of dear brother then article terminated with comment by writer on extraordinary romantic story have be set forth with original remark culled from hamlet that there be more thing in heaven earth etc etc wonder didnt add that truth be stranger than fiction remarked dick while alan hastily skimmed account be just a original well son what do think now think replied fuller very decisively that jotty have repeated to mistress what told have taken step to trap sorley doesnt know that have peacockfor certain be alan shrugged shoulder mistake in showing drawing to boy have proved that sorley have bird miss grison daresay knew that sketch have be made of before be taken away in event what jotty told be sufficient evidence to secure sorleys arrest think so indeed there be longer need for to keep silence well said fuller hesitatingly suppose there isnt moon be certain to see account will come to ask miss grison why have made matter public after promising to be silent can only excuse by repeating jottys story moon will certainly go down to belstone to arrest sorley poor marie im not so sure can call put in dick hastily after if man be criminal be better that must not be in company disgrace to name to sorleys name not to miss inderwicks besides when marries will change name be use being sentimental longer boy said latimer resolutely man must be punished im off to see inspector tell what know dick wont be best to question miss grison first learn if really have heard jottys story be quite sure have said reporter emphatically else must not have broken promise to moon matter of peacock be kept silent so that assassin feeling safe might betray himselfas have done by way to miss grison learning from boy that sorley be guilty have taken opportunity of making story a public a possible so that man cant escape may see paper take warning suggested alan expect tale will be in paper in kingdom to morrow more reason must see moon at once be not going to dilly dally more alan do duty a expect to do yours cant blame go see moon latimer hesitated at door wont wire to sorley send paper to suppose if man be guilty certainly look a though be must be punished will not interfere unpleasant a scandal will be for marie go do duty dick by telling moon will do mine by keeping perfectly quiet latimer argued longer took departure leaving alan much disturbed in own mind wonder marie did not love uncle who have always treated with indifference have made use of money for own purpose still must be terrible shock for to hear that have murdered brother of miss grison of course shame of having relative hanged must be great fuller did not see how mr sorley must escape gallows since evidence on whole be so very decisive at best must only defend by putting forward story about miss grison be weak line to take up hum said alan opening drawer of desk to look at sketch have made wish have not showed to jotty must have mentioned to miss grison from fact probably guessed that sorley have peacock man will certainly be arrested for will have time to escape a alan murmured glanced idly at paper dick have brought saw that be dated previous day of course have be issued yesterday morning occurred to young man chance might possibly bring paper to sorleys notice since four twenty hoursif not morehad elapsed since publication if man be warned in time assuredly must escape before inspector moon must lay hand on fuller hoped that must be case if only to spare shame pain of scandal after be doubtful if account must fall into sorleys hand immediately a few newspaper arrived at belstone doings of world be always hour day at time week late solicitor shook head dubiously wrapping up sketch in journal placed in drawer of desk there seemed nothing for to wait for sorleys arrest to hear what defense must make to charge brought against shortly card be presented to lawyer by clerk on seeing name fuller ordered owner to be shown in at once in few moment be face to face with mr morad bakche who looked calm aristocratic andas alan judgedindifferent yet if have seen article in latest news really have come to england to search for treasure bakche surely must not feign nonchalance must not possibly feel how be mr bakche asked alan polite watchful while placing chair for indian so have come to see a said must yes sir about very important subject replied bakche sitting down stiffly taking newspaper out of pocket yes said alan inquiringly though of course moment saw paper produced knew why man have come to see bakche doubled back journal pointed out article with slender brown finger have seen asked quietly be not to fuller interest to admit anything a be necessary to conduct interview with great caution young man quietly read again account of interview with miss grison time bakche be looking at hard trying to guess by expression of alans face what truly thought solicitor be prepared for scrutiny kept unmoved countenance very interesting remarked fuller coolly when have finished not new to sir presume well mr bakche story told by miss grison be well known in belstone parish of father be vicar have heard before have heard before man grison be murdered for sake of peacock demanded indian rather impatiently thereby showed that indifference be mainly pretence be commonly reported in belstone that grison brother sister have stolen peacock from inderwick family when left monastery twenty year ago pardon mr bakche why do come here ask question cant guess sir how can guess retorted fuller cautiously by putting two two together a be english way said bakche in calmer manner told when dined at miss grison have come to england in order to recover certain family property did well property referred to be peacock of jewel how did expect to know mr bakche can answer that if will reply to question what be question do know story set forth in article asked indian quickly yes a told whole countryside know then must be aware that begum of kam gave jewel to simon ferrier told that be descendant of rajah of kam so must have guessed desired to obtain possession of peacock quite so said fuller coolly there be need for to say so bakche be honest enough to admit be very cautious english gentleman said with faint sneer doubt did not wish to get peacock fail to see how telling what have now told must aid to get what belongs rightfully to person doe not belong to person to cried bakche wrathfully alan raised eyebrow how do make out demanded in exasperating manner george inderwicks servant ferrier manufactured peacock for master so manufactured that in strange way reveals where jewel of begum be concealed finished indian sharply understand mr fuller exactly claim peacock did just now interrupted alan in turn shrugging only because wish to learn where jewel be hidden indeed will find that difficult since for over one hundred year riddle of peacock have be unsolved never mind said bakche doggedly if see bird will probably be able to learn truth then alan raised eyebrow again then said other confidently will take jewel may not be allowed why not jewel belong to a descendant of rajah of kam forget said fuller smoothly that rajah wife gave same to george inderwick because saved life life of son have right to do so cried bakche loudly jewel be not private property to dispose of mr fuller belonged to familyto state a be royal treasure can not be parted with in way be not prepared to argue matter mr bakche remarked fuller in dry manner sincebeyond known story have become sussex legendi be not acquainted with exact fact must point out that rajah may have given wife permission to reward preserver in way inderwick assuredly deserved return for what did bakche bowed stiffly admit that gentleman acted bravely a be descended from young prince saved be indebted to for fact that exist at nevertheless mr fuller reward need not have taken form of almost whole of royal treasure of kam alan shrugged shoulder again begum be apparently very grateful woman mr bakche if have retained treasure must have be confiscated by british government when royalty of kam be abolished be probable said bakche dryly think that priest must have taken care to preserve jewel give when time became quieter to rightful owner in case must now be in possession of presume certainly be direct descendant of prince saved by mr inderwick sir a be will certainly claim have to find first retorted alan coolly show peacock will try to solve riddle find fuller laughed shrugged doe that mean be criminal oh bakche hastened to explain smoothly may know where peacock be to be found really dont quite follow line of argument mr bakche let put matter in way said indian deliberately peacock be not only valuable in also indicated whereabouts of great treasure miss grison declares that brother be murdered for sake of bird so be plain that assassin must have known meaning of riddle still can not follow line of argument persisted fuller so far a know riddle have never be solved unless baldwin grison who have bird for over twenty yearsaccording to sister isguessed what have baffled everyone well said bakche sullenly whether solved riddle not one who wanted treasure murdered to obtain clue on other hand rough sailor may have killed man merely for sake of getting bird be valuable enough a say to account for assassin risking neck why come to mr bakche since on face of can possibly know nothing know who want bird oh yes miss inderwick from whose house be stolen to whom be engaged want bird very much since belongs rightfully to hope dont accuse girl of twenty of crime said bakche earnestly other people know of value of peacock agree whole countryside know story if suspect anyone in belstone have better go down look for individual suspect mr sorley why demanded alan who have quite anticipated question because wanted peacock so did miss inderwick so did many other people everyone who know story must like to find jewel alan paused for reply a none came continued coolly how did trace possession of peacock to baldwin grison didntthat be did in way stammered indian nervously in what way asked fuller relentlessly trying to make bakche tell what be already known to for instance how did come to live at miss grison boarding house explained when met there sir fuller laughed ironically did beg leave to doubt truth of explanation mr bakche how dare sir by what right do doubt demanded man furiously dark eye shot fire by doubt of common sense be in search of peacock in order to gain clue to hiding place of jewel claim come now mr bakche be not mere chance guided to miss grison who of people in london knew about matter morad bakche looked sullenly at carpet evidently saw that alan be one too many for after long pause fuller took care not to terminate too soon looked up with must be frank smile a wish to help in matter declared may a well make clean breast of what know alan nodded refused agreed to accept man a client intimated that be ready to give attention to confession morad bakche at once took exception to word be not confession wish to make sir merely statement to show how came to learn about matter be discussing oh beg pardon said fuller ceremoniously go on please bakche frowned at irony of tone made further objection to relating what knew explanation a to how came to thimble square be not wholly true mr fuller said abruptly so thought at time why did think so asked bakche quickly because got into head that be after inderwick fetish although when spoke did not know that be begum of kam who have given away jewel fact learned later however struck that if have come on such errand went for reason to miss grison boarding house not because ceylon friend recommended bakche nodded very creditable to intelligence said in patronising manner to be plain sir learned story be set forth in newspaper from family document a thought murmured fuller softly seeing that begum have given away jewel must rightfully belong to family determined to find came to england went to belstone where document mentioned informed inderwicks lived at inn there learned from very voluble woman be to be known about loss of peacock afterwards visited mr sorley who be understand guardian of miss inderwick to whom peacock be supposed to belong told that ornament be lost did not say who have taken from monastery quite so said alan remembering that sorley have withheld such information lest miss grison must give peacock to man of course mr verwin at inn hinted that grison have bird did sir what be more gave address of boarding house in thimble square returned to london in july last took up abode there determined to learn must well asked fuller when indian paused well echoed other learned nothing particular hum remarked alan doubtfully looking hard at speaker did tell miss grison story of search yes did at later period when have become more le friendly with even stated that be reported how brother have stolen peacock what answer did make said nothing to purpose only stating that believed there be such ornament that did not know where be of course in light of interview added bakche placing hand on newspaper can see for own end spoke falsely evidently baldwin brother be thief possessed whole time wonder be mr fuller that being desperately hard up a be did not sell pawn peacock rather think that man hoped to learn secret get possession of jewel did ever see grison said bakche so quickly that alan felt sure be not speaking exact truth became more sure of fact when elaborated denial miss grison refused to give brother address knew be in slum of course not guessing that grison have peacock did not push enquiry have known that have bird must have placed matter in hand of private detective in way must have learned whereabouts then then said bakche drawing deep breath clenching small hand must have forced to surrender to must have used violence asked alan in peculiar tone yes be bakche broke off with laugh of contempt why do look at so suspiciously mr fuller do think that did see man did use violence even to extent of stabbing be entirely wrong sir have murdered obtained peacock must by time have be far away on continent out of danger until thing grew quieter must have remained absent trying to solve riddle be not criminal be not possessor of peacock grant said fuller quietly who knew well that man spoke truth since sorley owned bird at moment well what do expect to do mr bakche wish to find out who murdered grison so that peacock may be recovered handed over to on behalf of miss inderwick be doing said alan dryly so can not possibly act on behalf peacock be mine cried indian rising to foot with snarl again reminded fuller of tigerish nature peacock be miss inderwicks must find will hand over to so that may discover treasure be began bakche violently then suddenly dangerously restrained anger smiled meaningly well since be engaged to lady be natural that must want to gain jewel mr bakche stop that if please alan rose in turn with indignant look indian shrugged shoulder walked to door be duel between said smoothly want what want so will see who win can tell what be best step to take very kind of mr bakche be to find boy alonzo formerly called jotty know truth then why not question since be at miss grison house indeed be not jotty have be missing since last night refusing to explain further indian departed leaving fuller greatly astonished greatly annoyed also that boy must have disappeared chapter xiii unexpected visitor dick remark when brought news of rotherhithe crime that there be more romantic than commonplace event to be found in present day life seemed to be verified by what have taken place hidden treasure riddle in gem gold mysterious murder melodramatic indian necessary pair of lover to spice wholethese be certainly detail out of to weave tale worthy of more highly colored day destiny who be relating story to interested world be doing best to involve character in whirl of unhappy thing for even if sorley be arrested confessed guilt suffered punishment storyas alan consideredwould by mean be ended since jewel have to be discovered detained from clutch of morad bakche marie have to be comforted married miss grisonthe at of talehad to be appeased there be great deal yet to be done before thing must be settled fuller a hero of fate fiction felt that ought to do something towards bringing about necessary climax a yet must not see way to do anything to make matter worse latimer next day arrived with news that sorley have disappeared on previous day inspector moon have be duly told story evidence of sorleys complicity have be placed under official eye with joyful feeling that here be case must reflect credit on if dexterously managed moon procured warrant took night train to lewes about midnight arrived at monastery only to learn that sorley have gone away early in day marie three trent be able to tell inspector whither have departed hastily packing small bag wearing unpretentious tweed suit suspected man have vanished from monastery belstone on motor bicycle moon having acted immediately on latimers information be furious at escape must not understand how man have be warned henny trent however threw light on darkness of point by stating that mr sorley have be visited by small boy with light hair blue eye urchin have not be seen since departure of mary uncle so be presumed that have left earlier in disgust at bad luck moon installed officer in house to watch for possible return of sorley have come back in morning to london where informed dick that bird have flown now latimer have come in afternoon to chancery lane office to explain to friend alan be much surprised to hear that sorley have be warned from suspicious look in dick eye fancied that latimer suspected did not break promise protested sharply stiffly unasked one suggested that did growled reporter who be annoyed that criminalas truly considered sorleyhad escaped eye suggest quite enough retorted fuller hurt by suspicion must know better dick than to think that broke faith latimer flushed im sorry alan really did have such thought although see now that be unwarranted have temptation to save man seeing that be miss inderwicks uncle must have known better persisted fuller stubbornly gave promise kept be sure did latimer extended hand forgive alan other gripped of course vague suspicion such a have entertained wont spoil friendship yet dick added when have cooled down be not exactly surprised now think over bakches last word bakche indian have be to see yesterday came a client confessed much of what already know then sixth sense oh hang sixth sense agreed that be right when related mr verwins story bakches yarn be merely corroborative did find history of peacock in family paper did come to look up belstone village to see if must get peacock find treasure yesterday came to to ask if must engineer job hum refused expect must jolly well think so dicky bakche claim treasure a say that begum of kam have right to give away want to find assassin of grison recover bird read riddle doe know sorley be culprit didnt yesterday whatever know now declined to receive a client saying be working for marie intended to give treasure when be discovered will ever be discovered questioned latimer skeptically alan sighed lord know have be trying hardest to read meaning into sketch made so far have failed well have look at together said dick encouragingly sixth sense may help where others have not be able to arrive at conclusion owe that much for having suspected have broken faith with even for moment dick looked very repentant oh thats right old man said alan heartily seeing that love marie so much be natural must credit with trying to spare pain by getting uncle saved thought be best to let law take course a in case if be saved now must only be discovered arrested later on suppose bakche be enemy now gave to understand that must do best to get better of remarked fuller trifle dryly then like fool gave hint a to who knew truth dont think must take hint coming from quarter said dick reflectively who know truth according to bakche jotty hm may be right after although be odd must give chance to outrun in way always did think that jotty knew more than be good for of course gave sorley warning of course assented fuller quickly only jotty must have be blue eyed fair haired lad who called to see man disappeared from thimble square a bakche told day before yesterday so expect saw news about peacock in paper bolted to warn sorley why must do asked latimer with puzzled air evidently told miss grisonguessing fact from drawing showed himthat sorley have bird on account of miss grison related what did to interviewer cant understand why jotty having brought about trouble must try to save sorley from alan shook head be impossible to say unless can get hold of boy again make speak out may return to miss grison said dick decisively wont have done best to get sorley into trouble wont thank jotty for giving warning wonder where have gone jotty sorley of moon have left detective at monastery on off chance that miss inderwicks uncle may return dont think will probably have taken jewel of own spoke of have left country look a though be guilty observed alan with groan doe assented latimer quickly be just a well that have got away so avoided arrest trial probably hanging dont expect youll set eye on again on jotty a maybe have taken lad with why must do jottyas always suspectedknows too much sorley want to get out of way be too late replied fuller doubtfully jotty have given letter have told enough to hang sorley unless man have very good defence probably hasnt else must have stood ground oh poor marie how dreadful be for to have criminal for uncle dick patted alans shoulder see here old son remarked with rough sympathy be annoyed when heard that man have bolted now be very glad for sake a said wont hear of sorley again so go to work solve riddle of peacock marry marie tell bakche can go back to india with tail between leg sorley have probably taken bird with doe that matter have drawing can solve riddle from that a have always expected to do mystery of grison death be open secret now alan boy so let past bury look forward to marriage with girl possession of treasure fuller nodded in absent minded way did not reply before must make up mind what to say there came knock at door seymour who be solicitor one only clerk appeared with intelligence that lady wished to see employer thinking that be client latimer moved into outer office only to come face to face with girl looked ill bright color of face have faded to dull white while there be dark circle under eye miss inderwick cried dick in amazement on hearing name alan appeared at door with look of equal astonishment last thing in world expected by man be visit to london of marie dear girl what be doing here questioned alan in tone of alarm when saw pale face anxious eye come in dick close door shortly three be in private office seymour have received order to admit one have to come up alan said marie clinging to sleeve oh dear be dreadful last night policeman came with others say that uncle ran murdered mr grison not true be sure be not true marie burst into tear cant say if be not dear replied alan uneasily kneeling by side of chair dropped into butbut mr sorley have not be arrested have wailed marie be what make so afraid boy came in afternoon uncle ran went away on motor bicycle after giving twenty pound saying that must not return for few day boy left house also suppose so although henny granny jenny saw go if uncle ran be innocent wouldnt run away im sure oh alan what be to be done cant stay in house a have money came up to ask advice dear said fuller placing arm around waist tenderly best thing for to do be to return to monastery wait im by alan that horrid detective person be staying in house cant stop on there alone girl grandmother be there darling oh what use be want leaned head on shoulder weeping profusely cant come stop in monastery while uncle be away dearest girl cried alan much distressed people must talk suppose go stay with mother for time if did must have to tell truth wept marie how can say that uncle ran did what didnt do have to come out sooner later miss inderwick remarked dick in voice full of regret for girl tear made feel ashamed of having brought about catastrophe have to come out fact that mr sorley murdered marie sprang to foot color flew to wan cheek dont believe dont dont dont said almost fiercely uncle ran have fault never did care much for besides using income being nasty to alan because loved must never kill anyone be sure mr latimer what miss grison say in paper be lie oh cried fuller quickly saw that paper yes latest news boy brought to uncle ran for saw give through window of library while be walking on terrace uncle ran left behind in hurry left in hurry asked dick suddenly yes told that have received bad news must be away for time be to use moneythe twenty pound meanto keep thing going did say anything about returning be in such hurry that have time to say much then very late at night there be ring at door henny went down to find man with man who said have come to arrest uncle ran for murder have to get up answer question then one man went away while other stayed he at monastery now cried marie with fresh burst of tear havent be in bed night henny made lie down for time morning then came up by midday train to see alan oh what doe mean alan glanced at friend for situation be very painful opened mouth to speak must not while marie looked at so appealingly dick more hardened to world not being in love solved question a to frank speech silence miss inderwick said bluntly believe be very sorry for in way be just a well that must know truth what miss grison say in interview be true holder of peacock be person who murdered grison for possession not uncle ran not uncle ran pleaded anxiously fear so said latimer turning away head have peacock not true not true alan fear be marie said young man sadly saw peacock in uncle hand when be down at belstone for christmas oh never told did not wish to learn truth tried to keep from since matter have be made public have become acquainted with what have happened flight of mr sorley seems to suggest guilty conscience hope be innocent be innocent interrupted marie with tear streaming down face nothing will ever make believe that uncle ran murdered anyone how did account for possession of peacock declared that miss grison must have left in cupboard where have be stored twenty year ago on occasion when came walked over house when found sitting in library yes well then said marie triumphantly uncle ran be innocent miss grison be wicked woman to say that hold peacock murdered brother since have miss inderwick broke in dick can not be sure if mr sorleys explanation be true one be be sure be what doe miss grison say have not questioned yet then will question cried marie starting to foot with very determined air will confess to that brought peacock to monastery so a to get uncle ran into trouble always hated heard alan what said on day be mad be mad uncle ran said a much now quite believe dear marie said fuller taking hand let hope for best may be certain that for sake will do best to prove uncle innocence there be doubt that evidence against be very strong flight seems to prove that charge be true dont believe said miss inderwick obstinately sitting down again to tap vexed foot on ground uncle ran will come back again with explanation im sure will let hope so murmured latimer skeptically doubt a to evidence against himwhat be alan told relating jottys discovery of letter showed copy of same have taken before dick passed on original to inspector moon so see marie ended when be in full possession of painful fact that seems almost certain dont care what seems interrupted marie in wilful feminine way uncle ran never murdered that wretched grison then why didnt remain say so asked dick sharply will explain that when return retorted in lofty tone in meantime must learn truth know truth latimer replied marie stamped how horrid of to take for granted that uncle ran killed man say didnt nothing say alan say will convince that did say nothing put in fuller quickly thing look black against mr sorley wish to give benefit of doubt marie flew at threw arm round neck bless alan for word have spoken be not very fond of uncle ran a know be sure be innocent must try prove innocence will do best darling if will leave matter in hand return to belstone alan dont ask to want to go down to rotherhithe what for asked dick surprised marie looked at disdainfully for gathered very plainly that be not on side to ask question of woman who keep house where mr

get at truth if see marie said alan quickly cant go down to rotherhithe can will cried miss inderwick with stamp looked like small goddess of war uncle ran shant be hanged for what never did if can help so long a keep away can not be caught to be hanged said alan in pacific manner for be necessary to deal in wary manner with infuriated girl meanwhile will look into matter do best to clear character if go to see mother slaig may prevent mr sorleys innocence from being proved want to help cried marie weeping again be uncle will help said alan taking in arm when know in what way can aid marie doesnt everyone in village know about accusation of uncle that detective be in house yes horrid everyone be talking about then can have hesitation in going to mother father in laying true fact

come into matter must have hand in proving innocence of uncle ran promise that a soon a require aid will ask for satisfied with promise marie dried tear then asked alan to get something to eat a be very hungry be now close on five oclock lover put on hat coat took out to restaurant near at hand where made fairly good meal dick came with a did not wish marie to go away with impression that be hostile to accused man believe miss inderwick said when be at table one will be more pleased to hear of uncle innocence than will be believe that be guilty well fact be against will adopt alans line give benefit of doubt when face miss grison may exonerate be not likely since hate for reason wont wont dont care if doesnt mr latimer in other way must save uncle ran will see very evening promised dick earnestly so will said alan suddenly hope for best darling yes sobbed marie who felt better after meal still be unable to restrain tear for poor girl be greatly shaken be not terrible alan very

station be reached here alan sent telegram to father placed girl in train bought first class ticket asked guard to look after comfort a did not like idea of such unsophisticated damsel travelling alone freak of coming to london so unexpectedly though natural enough under circumstance caused great anxiety heaved sigh of relief when train steamed out of station marie must be looked after by guard a far a lewes then rev john fuller must meet take stray lamb to vicarage where wife must console dick laughed when heard worried friend sigh so thankfully alls well that end well son said clapping young man on back miss inderwick have behaved like heroine daresay hope wont come to london again a be not used to being by may get into trouble certainly will said dick grimly if go to see

of marie have hitherto prevented indulging in smoke felt need of soothing weed have nothing to do eveningnothing particular that isso may a well have few quiet hour at home talk case over with there nothing to talk about well dont know seems to that indian be mixed up in business somehow from what describe believe that guessed baldwin grison have peacock thought so then if have killed man got peacock have sent to sorley on way to fleet street barker inn went over same old ground without coming to definite conclusion besides strain of last few day be telling on men felt very weary be with sigh of relief that arrived at dark cobblestone court mounted crooked staircase alan used latchkey admitted dick into chamber when entered sitting room received surprise shock in chair by fire sat figure in moment be recognized in spite of shabby look mr sorley cried alan dick in breath chapter xiv face to face be indeed mr randolph vernon sorley who spread out hand to fire in crouching attitude woefully changed from debonair juvenile gentleman of former day aggressively shabby overcoat worn boot showed that have idea of disguising since have money clothes at command to dress better be unshaven cheek chin being covered with silvery stubble in sunken eye there lurked hunted look man looked broken up broken down have aged at least twenty year since alan have last set eye on terror displayed when young man entered room showed how apprehensive be of being arrested by police oh alan gasped with sigh of relief when newcomer in sheer surprise called out name im glad only friend be fuller friend remarked latimer with emphasis not yours ah sorley shivered cringed fearfully youre against too be to find enemy in also alan said young man briefly never kick man when be down im glad to hear alan for be very down indeed few day ago must hold up head with best now be hunted for crime if be guilty swear be not interrupted sorley voice rising to scream on soul swear to of be not then why did run away asked dick because after reading newspaper interview with vile woman saw that appearance be against fled to gain time time for what mr sorley to prepare defence oh said latimer doubtfully staring at limp figure of fugitive then have defence yesthat be cani canoh alan wailed sorley piteously in heaven name give wine brandy have scarcely touched food since left belstone be that weak can scarcely speak give drink food then can talk fuller nodded silently went to cupboard whence brought out loaf of bread butter jar of pt de foie gras have be given to dick by friend together with bottle of good port wine hunted man who have sought sanctuary of hearthstone staggered to table began to eat drink with avidity men pitied unfortunate creature whose arrogance have be

found letter wrote making appointment with grison on very night about very time when poor devil be killed showed that letter to alan be in favor of leaving matter alone since have sympathy for a uncle of miss inderwick declined to compound felony went to inspector moon to explain that be criminal be not criminal cried sorley furiously did not murder man a to jotty showing letter then admit letter demanded dick swiftly certainly do why must not boy never told that have acted in such juda way came down to see with copy of latest news in pocket when read interview went away on impulse of moment

wrote letter admitted sorley swiftly andbut one moment mr latimer have better present with full statement of evidence upon police base charge against then will be able to defend hope so sincerely murmured alan who sat back in chair with folded arm allowed dick to conduct conversation journalist wasted time in preliminary explanation bluntly set forth whole story from time have entered that very room in november to report murder down to moment when marie departed from victoria station for belstone via lewes sorley still crouching still haggard in look though stronger in voice listened intently did not interrupt alan noticed however at certain portion of recital trembled probably from overstrained nerve when dick ended relighted pipe old man nodded gravely be indeed in dangerous position said striving to steady voice must quiver with ill concealed alarm same be entirely innocent swear to judge jury will not believe in such swearing without proof said fuller shaking head proof proof what proof can give only louisa grison can prove that peacock be brought to monastery without knowledge hate too greatly to confess a much do think cried sorley bitterly that will spoil trap have set not know venomous nature too well there letter know dick reminded yes letter dont deny letter juda of boy showed to betrayed saved interpolated alan quickly for money in case sneered other if truth be to be found that lad know if so be aware that be guiltless thus may have come to warn because conscience smote scarcely think that jotty be sufficiently evolved to posse conscience said latimer dryly helped for five pound a betrayed for two pound be question of money since insist so strongly upon innocence mr sorley must like to hear on what ground do so on ground miss grison brought bird to yes yes letter presence at rotherhithe on night about time crime be committed put in alan hastily for felt that be losing time old man be silent for few moment finger played in senile manner on unshaven chin then appeared to gain sudden strength from steady look of companion spoke with dignity considerable strength make admission to said in surprisingly clear tone knew that grison have peacock oh said listener simultaneously looked at one wondering if sorley be about to confess guilt man saw smiled in sardonic manner if be what suppose to be said coldly must scarcely admit a much being innocent can do so for many year believed that louisa grison have stolen peacock out of revenge because dismissed brother alan nodded at point a have heard woman acknowledge a much did not interrupt be twelve month ago when became aware that grison possessed wrote letter saying that must not live long be ready to give up peacock on condition came to hear on what term be prepared to surrender went up to town to rotherhithe to dreadful woman house mother slaigs suppose did ride motor bicycle did not have twelve month ago said sorley quickly went up found grison better than expected have rallied since writing to refused when met to give up peacock departed laterin few week went up again when saw that be very sick indeed with profligate way said that if must promise to give sister half of treasure when be discovered must hand back peacock refused a have right to dispose of mary property in way alan smiled grimly when remembered how scrupulous man have disposed of furniture belonged to niece whose good be supposed to safeguard however did not make remark on point asked pertinent question have grison discovered secret no have tried to have failed a everyone else have done up to present said sorley continuing narrative with effort for appeared to be very weary when refused to give up treasure declined to restore golden bird up till november last continued to call on urge to return what sister have stolen be because of frequent visit purchased motor bicycle ah said dick who be nursing chin didnt want visit to be known to railway authority be quite wrong mr latimer if chose to go up to town now then be business of anyone have contemplated murder might indeed have shirked giving color to doings by travelling so often by train bought bicycle to save expense in one way because found easier to slip out of house up to town in style hum murmured latimer to whom explanation sounded weak well admit so much for time being well sir well said sorley taking notice of implied doubt went up down constantly sometimes grison when sick must agree to give up peacock without term then when well must refuse to surrender on condition also sometimes wanted treasure for sister sinceas put itshe have stuck by in fall finally so a to get bird try to unravel secret compromised by offering to give third of jewel to louisa have right to promise without submitting proposition to marie said alan didnt want marie to know anything about business until be entirely settled jewel be in possession said sorley doggedly never dreamed that went so frequently to london for be often by for day have meal alone when got motor bicycle other woman more than ever be unable to learn about movement thing went on in way until november last must hing with grison who be a obstinate a mule then wrote saying that wanted to see on evening of thirteenth november time must really make term replied must be there at eight oclock seven oclock corrected alan quickly thank be seven memory be not so good a be boy went up on bicycle saw grison at appointed time at mother slaigs be a difficult to manage a ever came away about eight quite angry at constant failure to get what desired rode back during night gained monastery a usual next day rather day after heard through medium of newspaper about murder having regard to time place presence on spot saw in what danger stood so held peace in one way fancied must not be taxed with commission of crime since have not peacock then found in old place after unexpected visit of miss grison guessed that have brought guessed alsosince knew that brother have possessed itshe be setting trap of sort have be wise looked frankly at young men must have told police at once about matter saw then a see nowand a mr latimer have so plainly set before that everything be in favor of guilt dick nodded pulled mustache meditatively didnt improve matter by bolting when jotty warned remarked pointedly lost nerve gasped other man pale face becoming still more pale on impulse of moment fled why did fly here asked alan irritated by problem presented to a to letting man go handing over to inspector moon have told twice boy wish to help long ago told that believed louisa grison be laying trap for with peacock now can see be right evidence spoke a did will help at trial at trial dick looked swiftly at fugitive then yes intend to give up sorley rose stood up lean haggard yet with something of old self assertion before doing so wish to come with to thimble square see miss grison why demanded fuller jumping up with inquiring look desire to face in presence accuse of having brought peacock down to monastery to get into trouble how must get from brother when jotty said that saw on night of murder in grison possession cant explain said sorley with vexed air be sure that louisa hate too much to do so may have induced to give back lest must return to knew of visit did know of visit must have baldwin doubtless told for never must keep own counsel being a weak a water if did hold peace be very sure that jotty did not boy saw frequently yes said alan reflectively told that did described sorley smiled bitterly revengefully boy seems to have given away thoroughly have come to must have paid more than two pound must have done so to close mouth regain that letter be just a well that jotty did speak out have placed in present position said latimer coldly for if miss grison did lay trap speak of exposure must only have come about in way daresay be right sighed old man putting on shabby cap also formed portion of disguise after jotty by coming down to warn gave chance of escape hum said alan after pause flight only lent color to suspicion against on evidence gave to moon be just probable since jotty be in league with miss grisonfor believe brat isthat warning be arranged so that must incriminate will do so no longer said sorley opening door come of with need not fear that will try to escape a quite intend to give up knowing complete innocence if doubt take of arm oh well trust said latimer with shrug much to alans relief same dick intended to keep sharp eye on man since talk might be mainly for effect there be knowing if escape might not be attempted when trio got outside proved to be night very propitious to fugitive since unexpected fog have rolled down on city london be enveloped in dense gray smoking cloud chilly clammy intensely disagreeable alan friend have after to take sorleys arm to guide out of court through rusty iron gate went along so passively between that latimer became ashamed of suspicion since old man appeared to be acting very straightforwardly be not easy even for who knew neighborhood to get out of labyrinth surrounding barker inn for dense fog

breath waiter threw up hand explained that boy have gone away have not returned madame be greatly vexed by absence hum said dick to when waiter finally departed to announce arrival jotty seems to have engineered sorleys escape on own account fear lest mistress must turn crusty shortly swiss came back conducted up stair into private room of miss grison looking more acid than ever stood by fireplace to receive smiled in wintry fashion when two young menwho have sent up namesentered hadfor obvious reasonsomitted to inform that brought companion with miss grison face grew hard malignant when saw sorley steal in behind willow blue eye flashed like sapphire if look must have killed enemy sorley must have fallen dead that very instant hate be written over wasted face how dare bring beast here

be against only can prove did not take peacock from brother be innocent swear before heaven be innocent hush dont make row said dick who did not wish house to be disturbed for next ten minute alan be trying to reduce excited man to quieter frame of mind miss grison be absent quite that time if not few moment longer when returned look be much stronger more composed why did bring man here demanded again took up defiant position on hearthrug wish to ask question said sorley feebly for wrath have almost worn out felt that be at mercy of enemy ask question echoed contemptuously police wish to ask one two youyou criminal iii be not criminal panted other sitting down suddenly be inspector moon have be to see related how mr latimerand thank mr latimer for doing sogave letter wrote to baldwin prof

possession when be murdered since have pointed accusing finger at sorley who winced wilted be guilty brought to monastery to trap said man resolutely did not retorted equally resolutely two argued question on on on until alan dick felt head reeling for almost hour conversation continued latimer sometimes putting in question sometimes alan suggesting explanation time result be that miss grison refused to acknowledge that have taken peacock to belstone then while be in full tide of talk rose unexpectedly pointed towards door come in come in almost shouted be beast inspector moon appeared behind be two policeman in plain clothes chapter xv black bag sorley shivered shrank back when saw uniform of inspector moon two men behind miss grison with exulting look on hard face pointed to prey glorying in way have trapped that be trap fuller now truly believed since police have appeared at so opportune moment for capture there be cried woman excitedly take away beast moon moved forward laid heavy hand on shoulder of wretched man who moaned trembled at fatal touch arrest randolph sorley in name of king for murder of baldwin grison said in unemotional tone reciting regulation formula

for police then be not ill said latimer taken aback answered coolly be acting didnt act well told be wicked woman moaned sorley who stood passively between two plain clothes men wicked repeated miss grison with scorn if be wicked what be inspector moon made sign that must be silent explained speedy presence quietly miss grison telephoned to at rotherhithe said a happened to have business in bow street police office clerk repeated telephonic message to place be thus enabled to drive here in cab with men in spite of fog although must say that drove very slowly however looked at sorley be in excellent time may ask what two gentleman be doing here brought sorley to see miss grison at request said latimer must have sent for a lady did rebuked moon sharply there be need put in alan mr sorley intended to give up moon smiled derisively doubt that seeing how ran away from own house at belstone did so on impulse of moment cried sorley drawing up with dignity later saw that flight gave color to charge against a be quite innocent intended to give up so that matter must be inquired into do so now because cant help said moon with shrug come away sir at once have cab at door oh shant try to

sneered warned that must be punished for iniquity now time have come time have not come said sorley furiously have involved in difficulty somehow be trapped believe that indian who life here have be used by to bring about disgrace also knew about peacock come come interrupted moon in peremptory manner remember what say will be used in evidence against better hold tongue come away at once regret to say stepped forward clinking handcuff almost screamed sorley backing against wall with gesture of refusal there be need for shame wont run away intended to give up indeed did did put on put on cried miss grison clapping hand with delight murdered baldwin deserves punishment wont run away wont run away whimpered sorley piteously alan sorry for man interfered indeed dont think that there be need to take precaution mr inspector really came to mr latimer evening to surrender to law dick nodded agree with fuller remarked sorley cast grateful look in direction a moon after moment hesitation placed handcuff in pocket wont put on in house said graciously so when go one will see that have be arrested on so serious charge in cab dont mind said sorley eagerly only spare shame of being seen with on by fellow creature oh dear be quite innocent maundered on in senile way quite innocent when come said inspector imperiously dont wish to use force must drum out of house with rogue march said miss grison laughing fiercely beast that be sorley did not reply for be already tottering towards door between two officer followed by inspector a passed out of room turned looked significantly at alan black bag dont forget black bag said a moon touched on shoulder went stumbling out of sight strange to say one attached much meaning to last word alan be bewildered what dickens doe mean something bad may be sure retorted miss grison malignantly think sorley be better man than admit to be remarked young man indignantly dick where be going intend to follow sorley moon answered latimer come with said fuller with glance at landlady wish to ask miss grison few question wont be answered cried miss grison exultingly enemy have be trapped there be nothing left for to wish for latimer be so annoyed at malignity of woman that turned at door a victim have done let remind of excellent proverb miss grison said quietly there many slip twixt cup lip then went out quietly there will be slip except of sorley when be hanged said woman savagely now can go mr fuller have quarrel with there be one on part however said alan taking seat have disgraced marie by arrest of uncle oh indeed say that

permitted to be at peace for indian advanced eagerly eye sparkling have mr sorley be arrested asked swiftly anxiously yes answered fuller shortly on charge of murder yes how did come here think have better ask question of miss grison will do so rejoined bakche calmly when be gone there be one may not be able to answer probably alan shrugged shoulder with feigned indifference guessing what question be not choosing to reply to immediately bakche be not to be put off by contemptuous manner have mr sorley given up peacock to police demanded can not say if have police will give back to why must be given back to because be property of miss inderwick until uncle be free intend to look after interest other man sneered can understand that if do there be necessity for to ask question rejoined alan coolly be client of mine mr bakche must be better for if be fail to see that want peacock dont intend that must have treasure belong to cried indian angrily think not a interest be opposed can scarcely expect to reply to question further if join force will be stronger to learn truth possibly if discovery of truthi suppose mean in connection with whereabouts of treasuremeans having jewel prefer to work alone fuller thought for moment then added slowly of course miss inderwick may be willing to make term with regarding sharing of gem on one condition what be demanded bakche eagerly with flashing eye belief uncle to be innocent be half inclined to agree with notwithstanding weight of evidence against now if can prove innocence thus do service to miss inderwick why then how can prove innocence asked bakche in puzzled manner know nothing about murder never supposed did however proving of sorleys innocence be affair if want to get share in jewel bakche took turn up down room may know more of affair than think said abruptly probably do since say so well well if get mr sorley released can take word for certainly can take word replied fuller stiffly offer be such sporting one that be not worth while committing to paper bakche nodded have always found that english gentleman keep word sir said cordially so on term will hunt for assassin of grison dont then believe that sorley be guilty asked alan suddenly on term will hunt for assassin of grison said bakche once more decline to speak further stopped short a miss grison re entered room moved towards door

rightfully belong to wish to help will do so no belong to miss inderwick intend to marry miss inderwick said woman with hard laugh well be wise mr bakche be rightful owner on what ground begum jewel gave george inderwick be temple treasure must not have be parted with hum said alan meditatively remember bakche saying something about priest be one answered woman quietly be rightful heir to jewel a can see from snake on right arm dont see how prof ownership many of ornament be in form of snake set with gem still dont see persisted fuller doubtfully miss grison sat down impatiently a apparently late excitement have affected nerve im sure cant explain further mr bakche declared that jewel be sacred that want to get back snake sign mention be tattooed on right forearm twisting in spiral up from wrist to elbow ask to show to dont think interest said fuller dryly mr bakche assuredly will not get mary property if can prevent think peacock prevents said miss grison spitefully until guess

give peacock to mr morad bakche have sworn to have have sworn that will not have do think that be afraid of black man miss grison moreover have not got bird oh shrugged shoulder daresay sorley have concealed somewhere will tell where to find before be hanged never will be hanged yes will cant escape unless can be proved that took peacock to belstone never did said miss orison coldly sorley made up story to account for possession to implicate well said alan rising will ask jotty for verily believe be aware of much more than chooses to say have never told anything snapped woman moreover be most ungrateful little reptile ever met gave good home new name food clothes chance of being respectable yet ran away heaven only know where be cant tell whereabouts now miss grison can tell in what direction went on leaving house few day ago for first time landlady showed curiosity where did go to belstone with copy of interview in pocket to warn sorley that got further for miss grison jumped up with hard blue eye flashing with rage traitor said in ominously calm voice after did for tried to save sorley did for money of course boy be born miser well if return here will know how to punish never mind how dont ask may box ear may have put in jail for theft since have given chance of being respectable why ruin because have sided with enemy why do hate sorley so questioned fuller bluntly wish to know then will hate because ruined brother baldwin because murdered brother baldwin because deserted twenty year ago what do mean mean what say mr fuller do know who be dont well be mr sorley alan stared wife deserted wife corrected woman bitterly yes randolph married because be pretty girl grew tired of then wanted to make rich lady wife yes have heard that said alan recalling story of mother about miss marchmont be secret marriage said miss grison asked to keep secret a feared lest sister mr inderwick must ask to leave monastery if learned what have done lady wished to make wife died must have spoken out baldwin forged check sole way in must prevent randolph from putting in dock be by promising to hold tongue for ever gave money came here to set up boarding house took peacock to punish afterwards giving to baldwin randolph fought said must destroy if used force thenwell broke off abruptly can blame for hating man ruined brother ruined ihush whats mr latimer be indeed dick who came hastily into room alan alan come with to police office what be matter sorley have escaped escaped miss grison screamed then suppressed emotion lest more trouble must be caused in house howhow did escape asked clenching hand so tightly that nail be driven into flesh dick be recovering breath by degree when cab stopped at bow street police office alightedthat be when moon officer sorley alighted for followed in cabsorley suddenly darted away be lost in fog there be look of mingled dismay anger on miss grison face at unexpected intelligence tried to speak must not so fuller asked necessary question didnt detective hold when alighted yes there came in sorleys cleverness on way out of house managed to slip arm out of sleeve of overcoat wore simply left buttoned on shoulder when one of men held by arm suddenly slipped coat ran away of course moon underling followed fog be so thick that must not catch arrived moment later then came back here to tell be guilty be guilty said miss grison persistently what do say now mr fuller alan be puzzled certainly gave up remarked intended to give detective moon slip whenever have chance retorted landlady bah dont tell man be murderer of brother came here to try force to prove innocence by admitting took peacock down to belstone certainly did not what be opinion mr latimer cant say replied dick with perplexed air to night since man be giving up so frankly half believed that be innocent have doubt now be very puzzling case ended dick with sigh fuller preparing to take leave buttoned up coat picked up hat there be one thing to be said in sorleys favor remarked addressing miss grison if did murder brother did service threw back head scornfully oh indeed must like to know in what way mr fuller heardand latimer there be informantthat brother murdered man just outside opium den frequented in order to rob of watch money general jewelry since be case sorley saved brother from being hanged name from being further disgraced miss grison head drooped inspector moon told about matter admitted how watch have be traced dont believe baldwin killed anyone be much too kind thoughtful dear lady said latimer impatiently let point out that one entertains good opinion of late brother according to everyone else be bad lot regret having to say must be just if sorley have acted wickedlyand of can not be sureyour brother be not free from blame that murdered man be certain so own violent death be simple justice dont believe what say mr latimer be prejudiced in favor of beast on contrary a mr fuller will tell have be hot against man miss grison now have doubt of guilt in spite of escape yes be perplexing case until can gain more evidence be not prepared to give opinion why do hate so woman gave same answer to latimer a have given already to alan detailing circumstance led to become enemy wife emphasizing desertion kept silent for baldwin sake ended in grating voice be dead so there be longer reason for to deny be mr sorley not that will ever take real name seeing how husband have disgraced now dont want to make remark thank mr latimer can go can be sure that will do best to get randolph arrested again wont find easy to discover in fog said dick dryly with alan took immediate leave for there seemed necessity to remain listen to miss grison wrath be that of unreasonable woman obsessed by one bitter idea fog be still thick fuller remarked that wondered how moon have managed to get cab couldnt do dick fog get lighter at time then thick again said latimer absently suppose when moon took cab traffic be resumed for moment seems to have stopped now answered alan trying to peer into darkness blurred by street lamp let go home why do want to go to bow street office again only wished to learn latest detail with eye to copy said dick think will leave thing until to morrow a be quite tired out having arrived at conclusion two groped way back to chancery lane to barker inn true reason why latimer have so readily yielded to fuller suggestion be that greatly desired to learn if sorley have again sought shelter with on entering chamber found that one have come during absence dick heaved sigh of relief be echoed by alan im glad didnt come back remarked alan must have have to give up think knew a much so did not return however fog will afford excellent chance of escape doubt if will be caught

fuller detailed have taken place on previous night by time be in library with door closed alan related story seated in deep armchair with marie balancing on table poor dear uncle ran said when fuller ended wished to give horrid miss grison chance of confessing guilt confessing guilt what do mean marie mean that know more about murder than admits that be in league with nasty indian to ruin uncle

pouted miss inderwick did so want to do something to help uncle ran have visit helped mother slaig may be wrong about bakche may have mistaken lascar for there be question of mistaking anyone retorted marie quickly for mother slaig did not know name described mr bakche a did said that have seen man of descriptionthe snake man called snake man repeated alan swiftly why on right arm from wrist to elbow have snake tattooed in spiral fuller slapped knee spoke excitedly mother slaig be right dear so be miss grison told that bakche have mark then must have be at rotherhithe known mr grison said miss inderwick certainly since mother slaig must otherwise have known nothing about tattooed snake tell exactly what said marie miss inderwick did so omitting nothing shortly fuller be in possession of have taken place at rotherhithe recital so excited that rose to foot began to pace room bakche denied that visited rotherhithe knew grison cried marie have undoubtedly found valuable evidence may help to clear uncle character admit that be quite sure that uncle ran be innocent miss grison be conspiring with mr bakche to ruin said marie firmly alan shook head dear dont think that there be conspiracy between if bakche gained peacock by murder certainly must not have sent to uncle if miss grison knew that have bird must have guessed that stabbed dearly beloved brother in case must have denounced of course denies having brought peacock down here if did baldwin gave to before death if did not mr bakche must have sent why must do to get uncle ran into trouble dear bakche did not wish to get mr sorley into trouble all desired still desire be to obtain peacock then why did haunt rotherhithe to get peacock repeated alan if did get certainly must not have given to uncle marie fuller shrugged shoulder what have discovered implicates bakche plainly enough doe not solve mystery of death be a great riddle a ever what be to be done now then asked girl fuming at judicious way in lover talked must tell inspector moon about bakches visit to rotherhithe then indian can be questioned will do to morrow meanwhile alan opened black baglook at marie greatly admired peacock a be first time have set eye on beautiful object glitter of gold radiance of many gem appealed to feminine love of color clapped hand with delight when gorgeous ornament glowed like rainbow hued star in sunlight lover sat down admired luck of inderwicks held secret hard to solve secret must if guessed bring fortune to last member of family restore faded splendor of line girl with eye fixed on treasure murmured word from ancient prophecy jewel gold from over sea will bring peace joy ease alan nodded if be applied to bird said slowly be perfectly true since riddle when guessed mean gigantic fortune will be wealthy woman marie then will have hesitation in keeping to engagement oh alan darling why asked girl jumping up in dismay people might call fortune hunter dont see how must seeing that love now when have next to nothing if fortune be found will be through dearest so will have right to share after ended marie earnestly inconsequently what doe matter what people say seeing that love one alan kissed that being case marie promise that wealth will part have not better put peacock away wont try solve riddle impossible ive tried in way to do so be still quite in dark a to how jewelled bird can indicate hiding place marie took up luck of family turned round upside down looked at from side doe seem impossible confessed with reluctant sigh suppose must give up trying to guess riddle for present where will put alan in cupboard suppose said lawyer carelessly pointing to dark oak press out of sorley have produced peacock when first appeared on scene have always be there if so said marie shrewdly someonemiss grison for onemay know where to find be quite capable of telling mr bakche who be in league with be sure alan will put along with uncle rans private collection of gem moved towards panel marked with cross fuller remembered very well can open marie asked walking beside to place yes see touched hidden spring panel slid aside into groove uncle ran showed how to work before left in caseas saidhe must never come back hum muttered alan staring into dark recess with many shelf seems to have doubt a to whether innocence will ever be clearly proved put peacock back on table marie let look at gem if uncle doe not return belong to yes said that replied miss inderwick putting down peacock near black bag many of gem be bought with money always thought that be hard on uncle ran dear saved money for marie have wish to think well of uncle confessed alan seems to that doe not act quite straightly for one thing undoubtedly treated miss grison very badly fuller checked a did not seem necessary at moment to reveal strange truth regarding woman claim to be mr sorley what dear asked girl innocently nothing will tell later let think best can of uncle examine gem have seen before must like to admire again bring tray to table marie girl did so tray after tray of jewel be placed in flood of sunshine streamed through window of room until whole table glittered with rainbow fire when shelf be empty marie put hand in groped round to see if have missed gem suddenly uttered exclamation brought out long steel instrument with silver handle set with rough turquoise stone oh alan look at dear said bringing to lover fuller started frowned remembering how grison have be stabbed with slender instrument stiletto for choice here be stiletto in secret hiding place of sorleys jewel there be blood on handle young man looked at with shudder be sorley guilty after be stain life blood of baldwin grison must seem so thought thought showed in face for marie uttered exclamation grew pale oh alan dear dont think that do asked piteously think what dear asked in turn evasively that uncle ran murdered mr grison with stiletto have made use of very word mentioned at inquest look like dear said fuller sadly evidence showed that grison be murdered with weapon of sort now that find in secret place known only to uncle miss grison know also cried marie determined to believe nothing against relative cant be sure of dear if did must not have placed weapon there surely dont think killed brother oh oh still if only to revenge on uncle ran because heas saysruined mr grison may have marie be use building up theory interrupted alan firmly presence of stiletto look bad dont deny still mr sorley may have explanation to make of presence be sure be innocent will return to explain everything said marie obstinately nothing will ever make believe that uncle ran killed poor thing wont think anything more about matter until come back ended returned stiletto to hiding place if ever doe come back murmured alan under breath for looked on presence of weaponand stained with blood a wasas very good proof of man guilt however so a not to vex marie because must not in legal word prove case made remark for next quarter of hour examined gem becoming absorbed in one so beautiful be object quite forgot discovery of stiletto seemed to incriminate collector marie tried effect of several jewel against fair skin admired in mirror over fireplace amongst loose ornamentsfor of gem be set in goldshe found curious ring of silver entirely circled by precious stone isnt that odd alan asked slipping on finger how uncomfortable to wear dear stone go right round hurt one so between finger oh pulled off must never wear that with pleasure perhaps be nose ringone of begum treasure fuller examined object be broad band of silver set with gem at various interval entirely round circle not of indian workmanship marie said after pause there english look about wonder why stone be set round though marie peering over shoulder pointed out point have escaped alans attention see there be letter observed k look alan between bit of coral pearl so there be wonder what k mean alan mused then threw back head trying to remember something have heard of ring set round with stone before said thoughtfully be explained to why gem be over who have that ring oha memory suddenly came into

triangle oh be sure of because word be red stone of triangle be ruby by heaven marie believe be right of course be simon ferrier came back to england to hide jewel marie returned to give to julian inderwick since man be profligate must have squandered ferrier evidently hid somewhere about st peter well pool a call on tail of bird marked hiding place with red triangle of course if george inderwick have be able to read riddle must easily have found gem word alan stared at golden bird now reft of secret have held for so long to think that solution be so easy after why ring such a have described grandmother having be by mean rare believe simon ferrier did make silver one said marie fingering article thoughtfully since be kind of key to riddle alan shrugged shoulder believe that george inderwick found a hard to guess a mystery of peacock at event never arrived at solution of thing so easy so easy after perhaps very ease made difficult to guess suggested marie like columbus egg laughed fuller taking back tray of gem to hiding place let put away marie then go down to well must close panel in case that man moon left behind must come in learn too much be thinking of stiletto a spoke oh be right said miss inderwick assisting to replace jewel went away morning inspector moon sent wire saying be to go back to town oh said alan thoughtfully a closed panel resumed innocent look expect moon have given up hope of sorley returning to place well expect be right must be foolish of uncle dear to thrust head into lion jaw be sure will return prove innocence cried marie resolutely wont be pleased when learns that have found begum jewel alan havent found yet answered fuller determined in own mind that whether innocent guilty man must not meddle with girl property let go look marie ask henny jenny for crowbar what for must pry up stone under treasure be hidden expect a suggest that be marked with red triangle dont expect have crowbar said miss inderwick dubiously went into back part of house on errand nevertheless while alan took way to st peter dell surveyed what ferrier have called pool in cryptogram expected that have done so since there

easily hang how easy be after said alan who must not get over point then while awaiting coming of marie surveyed well there be standing amongst still leafless tree amidst rank slushy grass circle of stone surmounted by wooden canopy with mellow red roof windlass be rotten with age rope formerly used to wind up bucket be conspicuous by absence a be bucket fuller peered into depth saw water far down twinkling like star in uncertain light filtered to depth side of well be of massive masonry green with moss slime while circle above ground be overgrown with herbage in hope of finding marked

why do drag away grass alan explained saw necessity of helping although to save tender hand transferred glove to two buoyed up with hope of treasure went to work with will soon cemented circle of gray stone round well be quite bare alan searched a did marie on stone must find desired red triangle must be down well said fuller with shrug im not going to trust rotten windlass tie rope to tree said marie pointing to young beech be growing close to opening a alan thought be excellent ideahe gave kiss for suggestionhe fastened rope to trunk then made slipknot bound under arm now dear take turn on rope round tree lower gently will prevent strain being too great hope so said miss inderwick doing a be told dont want to be drowned alan slipped over edge of well rope grew taunt from to beech where several twist round trunk stopped drag being too great on marie nevertheless felt anxious when saw lover disappear into dark depth oh do take care darling cried holding on to rope at part beyond twist round beech tree trunk do take care laugh came up sounded very clearly for alan be only few foot below surface looked round round twisting with hand thrusting toe into crevice of stone to gain

row of stoneson one big one be tie up rope marie give crowbar wont need to descend further girl did a be told leaning over edge of well handed lover crowbar already alan have worked away at interstice of marked stone with knife point deepened sufficiently to slip in point of crowbar be rather blunt then began to strain in effort to loosen block marie anxiously looking down heard breathing hard with effort implored to take rest fuller be too anxious to find treasure to do so with aching arm legsfor be resting weight on with toe in creviceworked away desperately little by little mortar in interstice of block crumbled a drove in crowbar finally stone became so loose that must ease with finger again shouted time with relief a big stone splashed down into dark water below have got alan cried marie quite sick with excitement yes think so be feeling in dark hole displaced stone have revealed doesnt seem to be very much only small box oh marie there cant be many jewel in handed up a

perhaps big diamond said marie watching lover pry open locked lid with edge of spade perhaps assented alan dubiously worked away hard be not easy job in spite of box being merely tin in end managed to get lid off huh only paper be paper wrapped up in linen to preserve from damp though box be dry enough since have be hermetically sealed by stone block one paper on examination proved to be statement signed by begum rajah of kam vizier saying that jewel be enumerated have be given to george inderwick because have saved life of royal woman son then there be letter to inderwick written by ferrier

miss inderwick marie be about to indignantly assert that alone have right to name when alan prevented be very natural question sir remarked opening black bag perhaps will assure of identity of young lady berwick stared when peacock in glittering glory be placed under electric light ruddy face grew trifle pale a pushed back chair uneasily peacock muttered know about peacock then questioned alan sharply yes when taking charge of affair of yarburys bank looked into business old new also searching amongst old document examining deed paper dealing with various transaction be in strong room below

to safeguard interest of bank precaution mr fuller stammered manager uneasily also continued lawyer imperturbably have read account in newspaper of interview with miss louisa grison declared therein that if peacock be discovered assassin of brother must be brought to justice be that not so yes admitted berwick readily be so since have brought peacock be necessary to do in order for miss inderwick to obtain possession of box deposited here over one hundred year ago by simon ferrier naturally wish to know how come to posse surely mr berwick doesnt think that murdered grison to obtain said marie indignantly touching glowing splendor of bird no manager assured hastily nothing be further from thought dear young lady a mr fuller sensibly observes be necessary for to safeguard interest of bank same did think that mr fuller have killed mr grison persisted marie obstinacy again coming uppermost really really never mind remarked alan impatiently cutting short man protestation be natural that

box be at yarburys bank addressed miss inderwick did anyone else mr berwick only when mr fuller guessed riddle did learn whereabouts of box be here then certainly mr berwick assured promptly have be

english be odd to say least of handwriting be crabbedapparently that of somewhat uneducated personhe be time deciphering what be before marie alan waited pleasure quietly be quite satisfied said when finished reading that be necessary paper key can speak for if fit lock of steel box meanwhile until two friend arrive mr fuller perhaps miss inderwick will explain how came to guess riddle be referred to in letter from simon ferrier to master can tell also how come to have peacock said marie who still felt annoyed by suspicious attitude of berwick although be considerably modified by production of paper key said alan decisively will tell that when moon latimer arrive there be need to repeat story twice will serve to while away time if tell mr berwick about riddle certainly will said manager in lively tone dont be angry with miss inderwick must protect interest of bank know marie smiled began to be somewhat ashamed of irritation must excuse mr berwick said cleverly discovery of fortune have somewhat excited nerve very natural very natural indeed well mr fuller what about riddle fuller lost time related various stage by marie have be led to guess mystery of peacock tail produced silver ring by way of illustration finally convinced mr berwick of manner in secret have be discovered annoying part of whole business concluded alan be that riddle be so easy when guessed mr fuller when guessed said berwick staring at peacock assure that dont wonder have be hard to solve have not accident of silver ring rather that of letter k on silver ring led to truth doubt if must ever have solved berwick still eyed bird steadily most extraordinary ferrier be too clever however if may say so concealed treasure so well that man intended to benefit never did fate bowed gallantly to marie reserved gem of begum for fairer hand then will give box said marie timidly of course rightfully belongs to since have fulfilled condition of ferriers letter of instruction to then manager of yarburys bank here be key peacock letter of ferrier to master assignment of jewel to same person by ruler of kam oh yes miss inderwick fortune be yours congratulate be value of jewel asked alan abruptly

remember mr inspector that when be taking away called out to to remember black bag did not know what meant when mr latimer returned to chamber found bag there in golden peacock seemed satisfactory to moon especially a latimer vouched for truth of story sorley be undoubtedly guilty remarked alan have to press mary arm to prevent bursting out with indignant denial must have brought peacock to not at mr inspector said fuller coolly resolutely be property of miss inderwick here be stolen by miss grison over twenty year ago because thought that mr sorley have treated brother in cruel way be only just that must return to owner dont think that can take possession of said moon reluctantly suppose not since miss inderwick certainly posse legally came by itaccording to story vouched for by mr

uncle be perfectly innocent for sake sincerely trust that be miss inderwick said moon in grave tone hope will prove trust in by giving up to law be not time place to talk of thing wish to spoil pleasure in inheriting fortune of gem sufficiently beautiful to make queen envious will devote fortune to proving uncle innocence said marie haughtily stubbornly in meanwhile mr berwick put box back

fugitive believe miss inderwick by refusing to compound felonyfor be what silence in matter amount to a alan will tell youi be doing mr sorley greater service than think agree with dick said fuller

deeply interested that did not object to twice told tale then marie chattered about good fortune quoted prophecy certainly now seemed to be fulfilled speculated on amount of money sale of gem must bring talked of improvement must make in family mansion may seem rather heartless when uncle be under cloud of suspicion girl be so thoroughly convinced that man be innocent that newly acquired fortune must enable to prove innocence by employing best detective talent to hunt down true criminal that did not worry over matter so much a might have be expected moreover uncle have always behaved selfishly to so did not think that trouble must harm for time being indeed hoped that might improve into something egotistical on arriving at lewes found mr fuller in person waiting for in pony chaise bubbling over with unexpected news be glad have returned marie said a assisted girl to get in man have be asking for who be indian gentleman called morad bakche interrupted alan breathlessly with

why must objected dick lighting pipe assignment of gem to george inderwick put out of court marie want to use of money to clear uncle name explained alan gravely although dont like sorley be willing that must do so will be worth money that depends if bakche can say anything useful growled dick doubtfully be certain that can since hinted something of sort to knew grison at rotherhithe also knew

will have mind set at rest always ended indian taking off cap always presuming that boy be confronted with do hint jotty be guilty asked fuller suddenly bakche who be turning away looked back with enigmatic smile weak arm can drive stiletto into sleeping man a easily a can strong one sir still smiling walked off rapidly in direction of lewes evidently objecting to further question by heaven muttered alan aghast know truth seems so observed dick with thoughtful frown dont go after alan will tell to morrow neednt be afraid of running away since revelation mean that get share of gem have to confront with jotty where be boy dick shrugged shoulder a resumed walk to belstone who know even if doesnt appear bakche wont keep silent for in case will lose reward hum wonder if jottyas infersmurdered grison well jotty be greedy little beast admired peacock a be protg of grison must run in out of room at will might be that stole in when man be sleeping killed bakche seems to hint at then added fuller warming to theme remember how miss grison took charge of lad perhaps gave peacock stiletto took down to monastery to implicate sorley revenge on denied plainly enough that took bird to belstone replied latimer shaking head if jotty have peacock must have guessed that have murdered brother seeing how loved man must not have condoned jottys crime in way alan dont agree with theory better wait hear what bakche have to say then can be certain stiletto thought that be missing from mother slaigs house said alan quickly marie found in secret cupboard where sorley keep own private collection of jewel be guilty concealed there jottywho came to warn himdid so miss grison did in way manage to get weapon hide then possession of must certainly entail knowing truth must notas said beforespare murderer of brother whom loved so dearly perhaps bakche be guilty be using jotty a screen suggested dick with shrug however be use speculating alan what have to do be to watch to night in monastery in hope that sorley have returned there to morrow hear what indian have to say be very good advice under circumstance young men took very natural course arrived at vicarage in time for dinner after calling at big house to arrange with granny trent about sleeping there for night evening vicar wife asked question about gem built castle in air along with marie a to best use to be made of money mention be made in course of evening by mr fuller that miss grison be staying with dressmaker friend when alan dick left to take up quarter at monastery felt convinced that woman have idea of whereabouts of enemy shes on watch said fuller a walked to big hole if sorley really have returned to hide will smell out daresay treated brother badly dick for sorley be utterly selfish creature perhaps deserves what have endured what vindictive person miss grison be hell hath fury like woman scorned quoted latimer sententiously since sorley scorned true wife by making love to woman used love for brother to free can scarcely wonder that hate a devil hate holy water must be more than human if did not be sorry for miss grison rather a must call mr sorley doesnt want to take name said alan shaking head if husband get off through bakches evidence may do so in order to show up spite a long a sorley life will have to pay for behavior serve jolly well right said latimer grimly conversation ended on step of great house where henny trent stood to receive granny be annoyed that young mistress be sleeping at vicarage a maintained that noise be only due to ghost that there be nothing to be feared scouted idea sorley have returned although admitted that old mansion be full of hiding place where must conceal point be same a marie have mentioned that fugitive must require food knowing that in house must be loyal to must not have hesitated to reveal have actually sought refuge at monastery young men heard argument passively without seeking to contradict then retired to bed wondering if granny be right be wrong if reverse be case be not quite precise to say that retired to bed for did not remove clothes simply lay down ready to spring up when noise called attention wore slipper however instead of boot so a to move softly about place thus pounce unawares on anyonemiss grison sorleywho might be haunting place if be ghost alan dodging preparation wont be of much use dont believe in ghost said alan curtly do said dick with equal terseness be too tired to argue knotty point then lay down clothed a be to snatch few moment of sleep latimer certainly fell into deep slumber friend be too excited to follow example occurred to that if sorley really be in house given to exploration by night that must assuredly haunt library if only to look at beloved jewel hour after hour young man dwelt on point by small hour of morning have worked up to pitch of excitement that must no longer endure inaction without disturbing dick who be sleeping in adjoining chamber rose stole down stair cautiously making scarcely sound since carried slipper in hand walked in sock also have revolver in hip pocket lest intruder must prove to be bakche admitted by miss grison through one of numerous secret entrance indian must be certain to show fight even if woman did not of course a yet alan have heard sound be beginning to think that mary report be due to imagination opened library door cautiously shading candle carried with hand after thrusting slipper into pocket of tweed coat room be in complete darkness a shutter be closed there be sign that anyone be about however a alan assured once more sorley if on spot must certainly come to library so young man extinguished candle concealed behind indian screen near middle french window here lay down on carpet waited patiently hour passed then night wore on to dawn still room be quiet alan at length began to feel drowsy for long vigil be telling on tired body through shutter saw thread of cold light showed that day be breaking heard early outburst of song with bird greeted dawn shifted into more comfortable position closed eye when suddenly opened again widely sense intensified power there be certainly noisethat of shuffling footstep hesitating dragging doubtful a though individual be in deadly terror of discovery then after pause came cautious opening of library door alan peering round corner of screen saw gleam of light came from candle held in man hand glimmer shone faintly on haggard face newcomer be randolph vernon sorley looked like ghost of former self bowed down white faced lean closing door went to cupboard where golden bird have be found by opened same in moment so alan heard sound of eating saw that sorley be eagerly devouring food apparently in prosperous day have established larder in cupboard against time when might be hunted down sight gave idea that man might be guilty after since otherwise must not have prepared for such contingency however there be small time to consider reason that for sorley having eaten might slip away to hiding place then in rambling old mansion must be impossible to discover when man left cupboard came to table placed candle thereon took long drink from flaskit probably contained whisky waterand then shuffled to panel marked with cross slipping aside held candle so that might admire jewel alan thought be now time to make presence known in least startling way possible mr sorley said softly rising with caution oh god gasped man dropping light suppressing scream in darkness alan groped way forward dont be afraid be alan fuller be friend alan young man heard click of door knew that fugitive be making for hiding place halted when hearing voice name alan said sorley in darkness quavering voice hinted at relief oh thank heaven have come how did guess marie granny heard certain noise said alan quickly yes muttered sorley lighting candle apparently took out of pocket since fallen one be lying near panel be not so careful a must have be must not go on for ever so be glad have come alan want help voice trembled piteously yes want help to escape in turn young man lighted candle have kept beside in radiance of two taper surveyed broken down creature before who looked quite age if not more face hand be black with dust dirt clothes be stained torn while beard have grown considerably despair lurked in sunken eye in place of alert soldierly man of yore alan beheld trembling shivering cringing thing wincing at sound shrinking from shadow guilty not sorley be surely paying in full for sin since agony terror of soul be made manifest in body be innocent muttered again again if be innocent why do wish to help to escape asked mr fuller gravely because cant prove innocence said sorley with sudden energy be in net woven by infernal woman wife oh so told that did yes admit be wife bitter one have be to be not time place to talk of thing must defend on score if necessary there be need place in safety alan can explain everything believe that be guilty surely dont looked piteously at young man shaking like leaf cant say that be absolutely convinced of guilt admitted alan cautiously when gave up why did run away again can explain replied sorley with cunning look only give time will be explained got away in fog came down here on motor bicycle have kept ready in town now be hiding here in secret place below earthdown in cellar there be range range of cellar here know alan come up here at night to get food long ago placed in cupboardhe pointed to recess with trembling handbiscuits potted meat whisky

that for saw from peephole yesterday evening wandering round house daresay entered for know secret a well a do if find mehe gripped alans coatshe will give up must get away help to fly beyond sea until such time a can prove innocence wont take peacock with went on eagerly can have can find treasure will only take own jewel glanced at panel be still open treasure have be found mr sorley whatwhatwhat man must have fallen have not fuller held up marie solved riddle to quieten babbling creature alan hurriedly related everything in a few word a possible peacock jewel be now at yarburys bank so thing be right in respect marie be now wealthy have jewel muttered old man jealously oh beautiful jewel be beautiful be not alan dont trouble about what be not yours said fuller sharply what have to do be to come to understanding miss grison be here staying with mr millington while morad bakche be at red fox shrewdly suspect that inspector moon will come down very day since guess that be here because marie let drop word so about noise heard sorley staggered to door be surrounded by enemy gasped shant give in will go back to cellar hide alan ran forward grasped arm no said strongly
