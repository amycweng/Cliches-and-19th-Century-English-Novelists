word sir juryman facetiously did think good looking miss molly witness tossing head well not what call handsome sir there be knowing what other girl think with parting shot miss chickles retired to usual place in bar gossiped to outsider about present aspect of case while sergeant spill head of jarlchester police force came forward to give evidence crisp dry looking man sergeant with crisp dry manner sharp ring in tone of voice economical in word decisive in speech charles spill sir sergeant of police in jarlchester jim bulkins reported death of deceased came here saw body lying in bed clothes drawn up to chin in opinion deceased died in sleep examined bag of deceased contained linen not marked suit of clothes not marked toilet utensil of usual kind drawing block lead pencil much used coroner prompted by london detective be there drawing witness sir coroner sketch face on block witness sir clothes worn by deceased dark blue serge suit double breasted coroner name on clothes witness sir tag used to hang up coat on tailor name generally placed torn off searched pocket found penknife loose silver twelve shilling sixpence box of pill laid before jury silver watch on dressing table silver chain attached silver sovereign purse containing six sovereign nothing else coroner nothing likely to lead to name of deceased witness absolutely nothing sir searched found name inquired discovered name case puzzled so wired to london for detective mr fanks now sitting on left sergeant spill having thus discharged duty saluted in wooden fashion substituting joe stagger coachman for took up rigid attitude beside like toy figure in noah ark evidence of joe stagger horsey gentleman large red fat smothered voice suggestive of drink god on box seat behind four horse mere mortal given to drink when on ground joseph stagger sur 'ees sur druv coaach fro winchester t ' jarlchest r ten year more two day ago be toosd ' y co t ' bay 'oss cast shoe be waitin ' at station genbean corpus come up t ' ' s e 'jarlchest r ' inquiring like `` ee sur s ' up e git ' off go ' e sat aside ' talked of plaace 'ees sur s e 'this be foine arter lunnon coroner oh did say have come from london witness doggedly e s what sed afore sur talked foine sur did knaw 'oss fro ' cow mr stagger evidence unanimously pronounced by jury to be worse than useless opinion not shared by mr fanks of london detective who scratched down something in secretive little book with vicious little pencil coroner call dr drewey most important witness dr drewey having made post mortem examination of body jury hitherto somewhat languid now wake up mr fanks turn over new page in secretive little book dr drewey bland gentlemanlike in suit of sober black gravely smiling professional smile give opinion of thing with great unction have examined body of deceased be that of man of about eight twenty year of age very badly nourished with comparatively little food in stomach stomach be healthy found vessel of head unusually turgid throughout there be also great fluidity of blood serous effusion in ventricle pupil of eye be much contracted judging from appearance from turgescence of vessel of brain have hesitation in declaring that deceased died from overdose of morphia of opium coroner then think deceased took overdose of poison witness with bland reproof say died from overdose be not prepared to say that took juryman then one administered dose witness ca say anything about juryman when do think deceased died witness be very difficult question to answer in most case of poisoning by opium death take place within from six to twelve hour examined body of deceased between one two o'clock next day from appearance have be dead ten hour according to evidence of miss chickles went to bed at nine o'clock so if took dose of opium then a be most likely must have died about four o'clock in morning coroner during sleep witness presumably so opium being narcotic coroner prompted by london detective did stomach look like of habitual opium eater witness not at coroner according to deceased must have taken poison at nine o'clock when went to bed on looking at evidence of miss chickles see that deceased stated that took tonic pill regularly before went to bed now did strike that might have taken two pill by mistake must account for death witness hesitating acknowledge that explanation certainly did occur to analysed three pill selected at random from box when did so found be impossible such pill must have caused death coroner obviously bewildered why so witness because tonic pill contain arsenic there be not grain of morphia to be found in if deceased have died from overdose of pill must have found trace of arsenic in stomach a died from effect of morphia opium be not prepared to say tonic pill have nothing to do with death decisive statement considerably puzzled jury deceased died of overdose of morphia pill contained nothing arsenic so being clearly proved that pill have nothing to do with death deceased must have obtained morphia opium in other fashion sergeant spill be recalled on chance that deceased might have purchased poison from jarlchester chemist in evidence however sergeant spill stated that have by direction of dr drewey inquired into matter have be assured by chemist that deceased have never be near shop room have be thoroughly searched drug medicine of kind have be discovered except box of tonic pill now before jury there be absolutely nothing to show how deceased have come by death be have died of overdose of morphia how morphia have come into possession be undiscoverable so jury be quite bewildered obtainable evidence having be taken coroner gave opinion thereon in neat speech speech showed how undecided be in own mind a to real fact of peculiar case think gentleman that will agree with in acknowledging affair to be remarkably mysterious one deceased come down here from london a proved by evidence of joseph stagger for few day rest evidence of miss chickles give name have name initial marked on linen bag clothes not even letter card to throw light on identity entirely unknown enters door of inn entirely unknown dy next morning carrying secret of name position into next world from account testified by evidence of several witness be quite cheerful evidently can not be sure evidently have idea of committing suicide looking at question broadly gentleman idea of suicide must no doubt have to be abandoned looking at case from point of view whole affair be peculiarly suggestive of self destruction gentleman now deceased come down here be careful to give address showed that wished friend to remain ignorant of death be very cheerful talk about exploring neighbourhood next day mere blind gentleman of jury a firmly believe after writing letter doubtless one of farewell to friend retires quietly to bed be found dead next morning post mortem examination undertaken by dr drewey show that died from effect of overdose of morphia opium now gentleman must have taken morphia opium one else must have administered a be not known in jarlchester having be here only few hour when death occurred so no one have reason to give poison regarding pill now before have be analysed by dr drewey be found to contain only arsenic so may dismiss pill altogether died of morphia must have taken a have be administered violently by person sound of struggle must have be heard sound be heard however so prof to mind that killed wilfully trace of drug saving pill alluded to be found in room a proved by sergeant spill bought drug from local chemist so only one presumption remains deceased must have brought here from london sufficient quantity of morphia to kill took died leaving trace of drug behind unknown unnamed unfriended deceased came to town one must have administered poison of died gentleman a well a myself have heard evidence of intelligent witness will therefore give verdict in accordance with evidence from have be stated from whole peculiar circumstance of case firmly believe in own mind gentleman that deceased died by own hand thus far sapient coroner who delivered address with solemn air much to satisfaction of jury who be dull minded men quite prepared to be guided by master spirit such a regarded coroner during speech indeed scornful smile might have be seen on thin lip of mr fanks one noticed so intent be on word of wisdom fell from lip of mr coroner carr under inspiration therefore of coroner twelve lawful men true brought in verdict quite in accordance with own coroner idea on subject that deceased name unknown died on morning of th of november through overdose of morphia taken by during temporary fit of insanity having thus relieved mind to own satisfaction assemblage of worthy asinine for most part went several way quite convinced that have solved jarlchester mystery fool said mr fanks scornfully slipping pill box have be left on table into pocket think have got to bottom of affair why know what be talking about think be suicide asked sergeant spill crisply rather nettled at poor opinion mr fanks entertained of jarlchester brain retorted detective coolly think be murder uncommonly clever murder too reason demanded spill with wooden severity ah reason replied mr fanks reflectively well yes have got reason must be intelligible to extract from detective note book curious case jarlchester mystery must confess puzzled from drewey evidence deceased died of morphia pill only contain arsenic ca be connection between death pill ca find out where deceased purchased morphia perhaps coroner right brought from london examined clothes of deceased well made fashionable shabby qy seedy swell one might commit suicide doubtful a to nerve understand open door ajar nervous man must sleep with door ajar absurd qy must one have entered room during night impossible a deceased stranger here mem to find out if one slept in adjacent room examine pill box sudden idea about same fancy will be able to find name of deceased if so look for motive of murder questionable very if idea will lead to anything still will try case pique curiosity be murder suicide must discover chapter curious coincidence night after comfortable dinner hungry man dinner be something to be remembered mr fanks sat in front of fire staring into chaos of burning coal thinking deeply be in commercial room of course there be commercial traveller present mr fanks with world of thought in shrewd face be only occupant of room sat within cheery circle of light proceeding from red glare of fire yellow flame of lamp while at back place be in semi darkness cold too nipping chilly frosty feeling a if winter be giving world foretaste of christmas quality outside on four tall window beat steady rain while occasionally gust of wind made frame rattle here however in oasis of light in desert of gloom everything be pleasant agreeable except perchance mr fanks who sat with cup of coffee standing on table at elbow untasted while frowned thoughtfully at chaotic fire a though have personal spite against clever face very clever face clean shaven with sharply cut feature dark hair touched with gray at temple cut short in military fashion keen eye of bluish tint with shrewd twinkle in depth thin lipped resolute mouth perhaps trifle too resolute for so young man be not more than thirty then mr fanks although young in year be old in experience line on feature be record of something learned at cost of something lost on account never forgotten smart alert figure too have mr fanks well clothed in rough gray tweed suit slender sinewy hand with ring signet ring on little finger of left one well formed foot neatly shod in boot of tanned gentleman yes decidedly london detective be gentleman must be seen by whole appearance a to dress well wore clothes like man who went to good tailor valued accordingly quoth mr fanks after minute of deep thought during removed keen eye from gazing fire ward looked doubtfully at pill box held in left hand be only clue can possibly obtain chemist who made up pill have kindly put name address in print on box if then go to chemist will be able to find out name of dead man after that circumstance of life then well after may be wrong country bumpkin right may be case of suicide suppose under circumstance must hardly bring in other verdict yet be so strange why must have poisoned with morphia when must have done so with overdose of pill easier death dare say morphia be narcotic arsenic irritant humph be strange case altogether very strange know exactly what to make of relapsed into silence slipped pill box into pocket taking cup from table began to sip coffee slowly coffee black coffee hot strong a mr fanks be now taking clear brain render intensely sharp wakeful so after few minute detective put down cup thrusting hand into trouser pocket stretched out long leg began to think aloud once more a be fashion when alone be fine profession that of detective one get tired of commonplace murder however be commonplace murder query be murder at jury say ' say 'yes eh wonder who be right egotism on part probably believe in own idea why must man come down to out of way place to die why must take trouble to explain that intends to stop here for week if intended to commit suicide ca wo believe be suicide a to theory of carr that brought just enough morphia to poison rubbish suicide take so much trouble a rule belief continued mr fanks reflectively belief be that took something innocently killed now what must take innocently pill of course yet if killed must be arsenic not morphia hang what deuce doe mean there being answer to question caught chin between finger thumb staring hard at fire meanwhile a if thereby to solve doubt hard case jarlchester mystery difficult case yet fascinated mr fanks by very difficulty be fond of difficulty young man in childish day chinese puzzle most perplexing of mystery have be delight a schoolboy adored algebraical problem newspaper cryptogram so now in early manhood found true vocation in solving inexplicable enigma criminal class very often non criminal class principally latter present to world for solution mr fanks be suddenly aroused from problematical musing by sudden opening of door on turning head with start saw be being closed by tall young man who immediately afterwards advanced slowly towards fire a be warmest room in house said new comer carelessly have ventured to intrude company upon for hour so very pleased indeed murmured mr fanks pushing chair to one side so a to allow stranger to have fair share of fire be dull work sitting alone movement on part of mr fanks sitting down of stranger brought face within mellow radiance of lamp whereupon sudden look of recognition flashed into eye of roger axton cried detective springing to foot fanks said other also rising cordially clasping hand held out to dear old schoolfellow dear old schoolfellow nickname also remarked fanks a shook hand heartily what curious coincidence to be sure be only mountain never meet ten year ago said axton resuming seat with sigh ten year ago octavius seems like yesterday observed octavius smiling strange must meet little axton at jarlchester of place in world what brought here old boy own leg said roger complacently be in poet trade have be trying to draw inspiration from nature during walking tour poet eh yes remember rhapsody about shelley keats at school so have followed in footstep roger child father of man be bible be have got hazy idea wordsworth said something like responded axton drily yes be poet be prose to poetry study nature study man taken pope advice no doubt novelist no not paying line nowadays overcrowded schoolmaster worse still ca all be arnold let say phrenologist pooh do look like charlatan indeed fanks eh fanks repeated axton struck with sudden idea pushing chair away from that of companion why be detective down here about suicide what wonderful penetration said octavius laughing how did hit upon idea friend roger axton hand went up to fair moustache hardly concealed quivering of lip laughed in uneasy manner circumstantial evidence said at last hurriedly barmaid told that london detective called fang be down here on account of suicide allowing for misuse of name unexpected presence here struck that must be man finished fanks shooting keen glance at somewhat careworn face of school friend well be perfectly right be octavius fanks of scotland yard detective formerly octavius rixton of nowhere in particular idler seem to relish idea of being bloodhound of law er well certainly see why detective must be a respectable a other man still there be kind of dr fell dislike towards responded octavius composedly yes that be true enough though intensely ridiculous people always seem to be afraid of detective know why unless maybe be guilty conscience conscience faltered axton with obvious effort said guilty conscience ' corrected fanks with emphasis will tell about roger first take face out of shadow let have look at want to see how boy of seventeen look a man of seven twenty reluctantly very reluctantly roger axton did a be requested when yellow light shone full on face detective stared steadily at with keen look of one accustomed to read line wrinkle light shadow on feature of fellow men skilled to understand meaning thereof be handsome young face of fresh coloured saxon type just now looked strangely haggard careworn dark circle under bright blue eye complexion faded from healthy hue to dull unnatural white yellow hair tossed in careless disorder from off high forehead whereon deep line between arched eyebrow betrayed vexation secret trouble perhaps face must have worn merry smile did not lip must have shown white teeth in happy laugh did not eye must have burned with poetic fire with jocund good humour with love fire did not no face be young must have looked young bore impress of disturbed mind of spirit ill at ease keen eyed detective withdrawing gaze with sigh from face let rest on figure of roger axton effeminacy there in spite of girlish delicacy of face gentle look in blue eye on contrary stalwart muscular frame well developed heavily knit plenty of bone flesh muscle over six foot in height undefinable look of latent strength of easy consciousness of power yes roger axton be not antagonist to be despised looked more like fighting man at arm than peaceful poet bore scrutiny of mr fanks however with obvious discomposure hand holding well worn briar root be filling from tobacco pouch trembled slightly in spite of effort to steady muscle well said at length striking match see bring detective habit into private life must be pleasant for friend may ask if be satisfied face observed octavius leisurely waving hand to disperse smoke cloud rolling from briar root of companion face be not that of happy man must be very curious if be replied axton sulkily seeing that owner be not happy youth good look genius health said fanks reflectively with ought to be happy roger doubt what ought to be what be be two very different thing judging by face certainly be retorted detective drily what be matter with grumbler be hard up have sufficiency of world good critic have be abusing last poem perhaps pooh be used to ah then there be only one reason left be in love true oh king said roger drawing hard at pipe be in love tell about said fanks curling up luxuriously in chair adore love confidence when be small nuisance at school told trouble consoled do so now cried axton suddenly ca console now one can do that remains to be seen said fanks smiling come now roger tell trouble though have be parted for ten year have often thought of school friend unburden heart to will relieve mind if doe nothing else thus adjured roger brightened up settling comfortably in chair put foot against mantelpiece blew thick cloud of smoke began to tell story be afraid story have merit of novelty said candidly after left school remained a know then parent died within few month of other found well provided orphan when say well provided mean have income of three hundred year one can always live comfortably on six pound week if not extravagant being thus independent of world flesh devil meaning thereby employer publisher critic went in for writing poetry did pay of course being age of sensational literature verse manufacturing amused wandered over england continent in desultory sort of way kind of grand tour in poet line midway between poverty of goldsmith luxury of byron published book of poem critic abused found plenty of fault virtue well be wrathful at new massacre of literary innocent fled to land of egypt in plain english went down to ventnor in isle of wight there met with large h ' of course murmured mr fanks sympathetically for second time then ah may ask where met for first time oh in other place said roger evasively be got nothing to do with subject first time met well be first time did think be second fond lover understand second time be critical one exactly be last august said axton speaking rapidly so a to give fanks further opportunity of interrupting be a have stated at ventnor with idea of writing drama shakespearean of course elizabethan style understand with dash of modern cynicism fin de sicle flippancy in wandering about ventnor came across judith varlins for second time of asking mean meeting interpolated fanks lightly so name be judith heroic name suggestive of queenly woman dark browed cleopatra sort of thing picture to myself grand semiramis roger shook head be not handsome woman tall graceful dark browed if like not pretty pshaw who ever called regal semiramis pretty such weak adjective guess meaning mind be more beautiful than face if face have be a beautiful a mind sir replied axton in johnsonian style must have be most beautiful woman in world like dulcinea eh don quixote roger well met often juxtaposition be fatal love sprang up like jonah gourd in one night be not woman to be lightly won judith have with cousin pretty golden haired damsel whom worshipped have met golden hair before yes did take much notice of of course preferred brunette to blonde decidedly well florry marson blue eyed darling yes florry marson be foolish frivolous little thing who have be confided to judith care by dead mother whose dead mother florry judith asked fanks lightly florry be of course replied roger impatiently judith looked after like apple of eye though be afraid have rather hard task for miss marson be one of irritating girl who did manner of thing without thinking be engaged to marry man called spolger anything to do with bepolger soother good night rest ' be owner oh frivolous florry did like how do know asked roger in startled tone because have seen spolger soother be not pretty enough for such empty headed minx a describe miss marson be right be engaged to by father desire loved scamp good looking of course with money have be exiled to ventnor to escape eh be quite romance said fanks gaily what be scamp name roger fidgeted in chair before replying action did not escape lynx eye of mr fanks who said nothing waited know said roger turning away head be lie thought octavius a saw manner in mr axton replied to seemingly simple question queer why must tell such useless lie know anything about scamp went on axton hurriedly be cause of unhappiness how so because judith miss varlins refused to marry on account what loved also fascinating scamp know if loved exactly said axton in musing tone reason gave for rejection of proposal be that must not leave cousin florence seemed strangely moved when spoke of of florry lover remember name asked fanks noticing momentary hesitation replied roger angrily why do keep asking that question oh nothing said octavius quietly only thought that a two girl have told so much about might have told more judith varlins be very reserved woman miss marson did see much of answered roger moodily did wish to frivolous little minx who came between happiness well there be nothing more to tell after rejection left ventnor for london ultimately came down here on walking tour have not seen miss varlins since suppose again roger turned away head again action be noted by mr fanks replied axton in low voice have not seen since lie number two thought octavius wonderingly what doe mean do correspond with asked aloud confound fanks put in witness box cried roger rising to foot beg pardon old fellow said octavius meekly be habit have got very bad one be afraid well hope thing will go well with marriage with miss varlins will take place roger who be walking rapidly up down long room now vanishing into chill shadow anon emerging into warm lamp light stopped at sound of name flung up arm with low cry of anguish never never cried bitterly will never marry poor old chap do seem to be hard hit said octavius sympathetically hope for best florry will marry patent medicine man forget scamp judith will marry forget florry so thing will come out straight in long run hope so said axton resuming seat rather ashamed of emotion look very promising at present ah well be use fighting destiny do remember grim view old sophocles take of deity classic juggernaut crushing who oppose trust wo be one of victim be doubtful however now have told story what about own mine said mr fanks lightly bless roger be like canning knife grinder have got none to tell a know be eighth son of impoverished country gentleman hence name octavius brother be put into army navy church sort of thing so when turn came to make dbut in life there be nothing left for to do father at wit end suggested colony refuge for destitute younger son did care about turning digger sheep farmer positively refused to be exiled came up to london to look round made choice being fond of puzzle cryptogram thought must turn ingenuity in unravelling enigma to practical account became detective family cast off however did mind that left off name of rixton took that of fanks old school name remember so did disgrace rixtons of derbyshire being gentleman doe mean bread butter in democratic day though pedigree a long a tail of kite be quite a useless in commercial sense besides detective business be just a honourable a other also very exciting so regret having gone in for get well paid also life suit be father reconciled to yet oh yes in sort of way vidocq business stick in throat ca swallow however visit paternal acre sometimes one think octavius rixton gentleman have anything to do with octavius fanks detective like profession adore mystery have wonderful charm for human nature there be marvellous fascination in joining together criminal puzzle have have kind of queer case through hand dealing with seamy side of humanity have be uniformly successful with lot affair however puzzle dreadfully be horrible thing said roger relighting pipe have gone out went for long walk to day so a to avoid inquest ah poet have not got strong nerve be afraid not hear verdict be suicide yes agree with verdict roger turned round quickly looked straight at companion who be staring absently at fire indeed said at length why not eh oh know have got reason replied fanks coolly evidently not wishing to continue subject by way how long be going to stop here just for to night be off to morrow so be london be going to continue walking tour ah sly dog cried fanks gaily understand be going to look up miss varlins again roger bit nether lip hard replied coldly in somewhat sober fashion affirming denying insinuation wo find down here at event oh then be still at ventnor miss marson have gone home really where be home dear fanks cross examination be most trying beg pardon said octavius ceremoniously be not aware have asked impertinent question have dear fellow cried axton cordially mind bad temper ca help nerve be unstrung with horrible business of inquest there be reason why must not tell where miss varlins life oh never mind said fanks trifle coldly want to know get offended at nothing octavius replied roger in injured tone will tell if be only to make amends for rudeness miss varlins life at ironfields detective jumped to foot with sudden ejaculation at axton also arose looking pale alarmed what be matter fanks asked hurriedly for answer octavius fanks drew pill box from pocket placing silently on table pointed to inscription on lid wosk co chemist ironfields chapter purely theoretical roger axton stood looking at pill box on table octavius fanks stood looking at roger axton former lost in fit of painful musing evident from pale face twitching lip startled expression latter keenly observant according to usual habit at last roger with deep sigh drew hand across brow resumed seat while mr fanks picking up pill box gave cheerful rattle a followed example what strange coincidence said thoughtfully be not astonished sort of thing occurs in real life a well a in novel be stranger than fiction know who first made that remark be wise man may depend wonderfully observant of event before crystallised experience in five word certainly be curious replied roger absently a though be thinking of something else fancy finding name of town where with large s of course where life printed on pill box finished roger then after pause what do think of fanks think repeated octavius thoughtfully oh think be clue to whole mystery why what do mean asked roger in startled tone what say retorted fanks twirling pill box round round be not difficult of comprehension man name unknown come down here dy shortly after arrival inquest verdict suicide fiddle de dee murder pill box be first link in chain will bind criminal by way said octavius suddenly struck with new idea how long have be at jarlchester week oh then be here when man died be humph excuse witness box manner apologise said roger quietly cross examine a much a like seems second nature with detective to suspect one suspect repeated octavius in injured tone good heaven axton what be talking about 'd a soon think of suspecting peppery young as be anxious to find out about affair naturally ask people who lived under same roof a dead man be one of people so ask ask what oh several thing well go on warn know nothing said roger gloomily tell what young man observed mr fanks sententiously need shaking up bit love affair have made view thing in most bilious fashion overdose of love poetry solitude incapacitates human being for enjoying life so if be wise beg leave to doubt will brace up nerve by helping to find out mystery be afraid 'd make sorry detective octavius remains to be proved see here old boy be called down here about case a wiseacre of jarlchester have settled to own satisfaction that there be to mind more need for service be discharged dismissed turned out by jarlchester co a often get such clever case to look after be going to find out whole affair for own pleasure seems disease with insatiable curiosity to find out thing ay that be call detective fever join in case will find suffering from disease in wonderfully short space of time thank prefer freedom idleness well go own way roger if wo take medicine prescribe certainly wo be cured unrequited love will lie heavy on heart health work will suffer in consequence will be dull between doctor critic will have high old time of dear boy what nonsense do talk said roger fretfully eh do think so perhaps be like touchstone use folly a stalking horse behind to shoot wit be not sure if be quoting rightly moral be apparent however be not to point to point mean if have not got detective fever have so will use a medicine to allay disease fire away old fellow said axton turning chair half round so a to place tell tale face in shadow thereby rendering undecipherable to fanks be attention octavius at once produced secretive little note book vicious little pencil latter assumed dramatic significance in nervous finger held be ready said fanks letting pencil point jest on clean white page question first did know dead man good heaven even know name appearance have never seen how must have seen be exploring neighbourhood generally start on travel in morning early return late man arrived at five went to bed at nine a did come back till ten o'clock did see on night next morning be dead did not see corpse said roger with shudder care for such 'wormy circumstance ' wormy circumstance be good remarked fanks approvingly keats think yes thought so see care for horror be not of poe baudelaire school of grave digging corpse craving poesy hardly believe in going to gutter for inspiration ah now be thinking of mm zola gondrecourt friend dear how one thing doe lead to be discussing literature instead of murder let return to first love why did attend inquest because did want to sufficient reason indeed remarked mr fanks drily making dig at book with pencil wonder be called a witness necessity know nothing of affair absolutely nothing interrogative absolutely nothing decisive mr fanks twirled vicious little pencil in finger closed secretive little book with snap replaced in pocket with sigh be most unsatisfactory medicine dear roger have done nothing to cure detective fever be so bad a come now will tell one thing slept in room next to of dead man did yes heard nothing on night if walked twenty mile during day fanks must have be too tired to listen for sound of possible murder yes yes of course what pity ca look twenty four hour ahead of thing must save such lot of trouble prevent such lot of murder if such prophetic power be given to humanity be afraid occupation must be gone remark yes of course be sorry slept so soundly on night a one might have be in dead man room why do think so asked roger quickly because door be slightly ajar replied fanks sagaciously nervous man must not have slept with door like be sure heard nothing quite sure be pity great pity by way have ever be to ironfields roger hesitated turned uneasily in chair at last blurted out have never be to ironfields humph said fanks looking doubtfully at thought might have met miss varlins there for first time so might replied roger equably at same time might have met in london so know anything about ironfields only that be manufacturing town given over to domination of foundry millionaire in iron interest to be simply geographical expression plead guilty to same state of ignorance will shortly be wiser because be going down to ironfields what for demanded roger with start must let into secret of prison house said mr fanks severely a be beine own familiar friend ' shakespeare again ubiquitous poet well a be mine own familiar friend mind telling in confidence be going down to see wosk co of ironfields chemist object be to find out name of gentleman who bought pill see what good will do blind quite blind said octavius nodding head mournfully will unfold immortal bard for third time when find out name of deceased can do through pill box will be able to find out about antecedent satisfied on point be possible nay probable may find one who have ill feeling towards therefore poison in jarlchester while remain at ironfields said roger ironically congratulate on clear sightedness be puzzling certainly very puzzling replied fanks rubbing head with air of vexation have got absolutely nothing to work on be going to work on pish sandy foundation now look here roger cried detective with great energy let survey case from common sense point of view man must have come down to jarlchester to commit suicide must have done at ironfields perhaps wanted to spare friend if have pain of knowing that died by own hand rubbish suicide be not so considerate a rule generally make away with in most public manner so a to draw attention to wrong ca wo believe that man who gave hint of wishing to die came down here to do so then if did not kill who did ah be what have got to find out yes what if find out perhaps yes perhaps murder will out clever remark to continue always look on side of question may be case of suicide be case of suicide believe jury be right said roger firmly seem very certain about remarked fanks trifle annoyed only judge from what have heard rumour mere rumour not at fact friend fact allude to evidence at inquest octavius made reply at first jumping up from chair began to walk to fro with frown on face dare say be right said at length taking evidence a whole suppose jury must only bring in verdict of suicide one must have poisoned one here knew therefore have reason to get rid of took that morphia opium whatever be sure enough firmly believe of own free will judging from theory look decidedly like suicide then again may have taken morphia not knowing be poison must not have be pill for only contain arsenic might certainly have taken morphia in order to get to sleep a from account suffered from insomnia nerve suppose then portion of what took must have be found if not that then bottle held drug sleeping draught nothing be found absolutely nothing be discovered dead from overdose of morphia trace of morphia bottle otherwise be found in room if be suicide must not have taken such precaution seeing have nothing to gain by concealing mode of death if be murder one must have administered to under guise of harmless drug then one here knew so one must have done so see therefore dear roger from statement of case be absolutely at stand still yes think can hing so best plan be to accept verdict of suicide forget about pill box well gain nothing from except name of place where dead man bought if go to chemist will find out name certainly circumstance of life also forget that such discovery will hardly account for murder here if find out from inquiry at ironfields that dead man have enemy will have to prove how enemy came down here secretly poisoned judging from evidence there be trace of poison left behind one have be staying in inn except so really see how be going to bring crime home to particular person having finished speech roger arose to foot with yawn knocked ash out of pipe against mantelpiece where be going asked fanks stopping in walk to bed of course have have long day continue walking tour to morrow yes start at ten o'clock be going down to ironfields on wild goose chase remains to be proved retorted fanks grimly be certain of so wisest plan be to accept inevitable give case up replied axton holding out hand good night good night old

little note book in wrote down address with gay laugh have have like literary men start with law leave for profit of poetry pshaw eh who know scribbler carry laureate ship in brain by way if see miss varlins at ironfields will give message wo have anything to do with replied roger dismally have doubt will get married day wo be to judith varlins ardent lover said fanks laughing well good night pleasant dream with body upstairs ugh cried roger axton vanished with shudder mr fanks stood beside dying fire leaning two elbow on mantelpiece thinking deeply be very much altered thought drearily

took candle from miss chickles returned to bed a closed door of room thought reverted to roger axton once more told two deliberate lie thought with puzzled expression on face must see that by face rather manner humph like having placed candle on dressing table mr fanks sat down having produced secretive note book proceeded to make therein memorandum in shorthand of conversation with axton reason for doing so certainly not still name on pill box ironfields residence of judith varlins ironfields curious coincidence very nothing may come of highly improbable anything must come of still few line of queer sign recording unimportant conversation may be of use in future who know ah who indeed there be good deal in chance fate sometimes put thread into hand conduct through tangled labyrinth to unknown issue two lie said mr fanks for third time a rolled up in bed clothes blew out candle have seen since ventnor have heard from since ventnor wonderful self denial for young man in

acidulated lady of uncertain age ruled with rod of iron perhaps from fact that have child over whom to domineer mr wosk however must not rule assistant much a desired to do so not that made show of opposition always twisted way turned that in eel like fashion until did not know quite where to have in fact assistant ruled mr wosk of rule have kind of uneasy consciousness a mr wosk ruled mr wosk including co m jules guinaud may have be said to have ruled whole household hard name to pronounce especially in ironfields where french be in main unknown tongue so suburban ironfields by common consent forgot surname of assistant called in friendly fashion munseer joolees by appellation be known for considerable time mr wosk however who meddled good deal with shop saw good deal of assistant being learned in biblical lore a wife of deacon must be found certain resemblance suggested by name appearance of assistant between munseer joolees juda iscariot whereupon with virulent wit christened by latter name monsieur joolees became widely known a monsieur juda name pleased ironfields worthy being easy to pronounce containing certain epigrammatic flavour name suited too slender undersized man with stealthy step of cat unsteady greenish eye appeared to see nothing yet took in everything smooth shining red hair plastered tightly down on egg shaped skull delicate pink white complexioned hairless face bore impress of kind of evil beauty yes name suited admirably a took exception to being in suburban ironfields opinion atheist therefore ignorant of biblical significance of title nobody

raising so a to display full optic yes may look at be most guileless person narrowing to mere slit like pupil of cat eye beware be dangerous so forth of in conjunction with aforesaid shrug pantomimic action of hand made conversation of monsieur juda very intelligible indeed in spite of foreign accent french observation be raining on particular morning seasonable weather of course a far a rain went month be same in ironfields thick black fog pervaded atmosphere cold clammy fog with sooty flavour crept slowly through street into house like wounded snake dragging along here there pedestrian looming large in opaque cloud like gigantic apparition gas lamp flaring drearily in thick air cab cart carriage moving cautiously along like endless funeral only two o'clock in afternoon surely darkness spread over land of egypt must be worse than nay perhaps be better egypt being tropical lacking chill unwholesome moisture permeated air wrapping dingy house noisy foundry cheerless street in dull sodden pall gas glared in shop of wosk co behind glass door kept out a much of fog a be able gas gave forth dim yellow light to mr wosk behind screen looking over prescription to monsieur juda at counter making up neat package of medicine bottle at little window at back looked into wosk dwelling house occasional vision of mr wosk head appeared like of cross cherub keeping eye on chemist assistant bur r r say monsieur juda blowing on lean finger be to most coldness of time aha le brouillard make to be place to day seasonable seasonable murmur mr wosk washing hand in contemplative fashion good for ahem good for business be business in line ahem eh monsieur vosks mais oui mon ami answered frenchman raising eyebrow for de what call de coffin man l'homme de funerailles that ahem

faced young gentleman with sharp decisive manner wosk co eh queried stranger who be none other than mr octavius fanks yes sir said mr wosk advancing name ahem name sir be in front of shop sir so be fog replied detective drily leaning over counter must hardly see shop much le name de fog be still heavier monsieur said juda taking in appearance of mr fanks in comprehensive fashion octavius swung sharply round at sound of foreign voice instantly took intuitive dislike to appearance of red haired young man oui replied looking at sharply es vous pa franais monsieur beaucoup de pntration said juda startled at hearing own tongue eye have narrowed into dangerous slit betokened that be on guard against clever too clever englishman two men looked at one steadily for moment two idea flashed rapidly through respective mind fanks idea suggested by suspicious appearance to detective of monsieur juda man have past be always on guard guinaud idea inspired by naturally suspicious nature englishman be possible enemy must be careful there be really ground for such uncomplimentary idea on part of two men who now met for first time except instinctive repulsion spring from collision of two nature antipathetic to one mr wosk being warned by apparition of mr wosk head at little window that be wasting time addressed at once to customer in business fashion what can do for sir octavius withdrew eye from face of assistant producing pill box laid down on counter before mr wosk want to know name of gentleman for whom made up pill rather difficult to say sir said mr wosk taking up box make up so many box like be made up for gentleman who left ironfields shortly afterwards chemist never very clear headed at time looked perfectly bewildered at being called upon to make such sudden

suspicion be a follows will monsieur permit to ask few question otherwise said juda with shrug can not hope to find name monsieur requires ask question like doe monsieur know when gentleman left town mr fanks made rapid calculation answered promptly be not quite sure after th before th of present month best plan will be to go back from th of november certainly monsieur juda disappeared behind neat screen rapidly turned up order book beginning with th of november a directed be tonic pill see monsieur called out yes be marked on box in moment fanks exclamation of surprise behind screen shortly

octavius fanks have difficulty in finding residence of dr jacob japix for kind hearted gentleman be well known in ironfields not alone in village suburb throughout great city where beaming face cheery word open hand be much appreciated especially in quarter of poor not professional philanthropist large man with large heart for laboured among poverty vice from innate desire to do good not from hope that work must be blazoned forth in paper have wife family relation so devoted money time talent to service of pauper who must not afford to give anything in return except gratitude did not always give even of course have rich patient also oh yes many rich people came to jacob japix to be cured generally went away satisfied for be clever physician having eye of hawk intuition of galen for kind of mysterious disease money rich took from poor in way of scant payment for labour done went back to pocket of poor via dr japix so illustrated in own small way law of compensation mr fanks knew doctor very well having met in connection with celebrated poisoning case at manchester where have attended a witness in character of expert octavius therefore be very much delighted at chance having thrown japix in way for special affair a be beginning to be troubled with vague fear existence of persistently refused to acknowledge to dr japix being big man inhabited big house just on outskirt of town on ringing noisy bell octavius be admitted by big footman who said in big voice that doctor be engaged at present must be at liberty soon soon be for just a big footman be about to show fanks into waiting room on right party of three two lady one gentleman accompanied by japix emerged from door on left one lady be tall dark stately with serious cast of countenance other small fair vivacious veritable fairy sparkle sunshine gentleman be long lean man with saturnine expression not by mean prepossessing burly dr japix with big frame big voice big laugh accompanied trio to door talking in subdued roar whole time will set up set up miss florry never fear nerve pooh have have have nerve in bridegroom who ever heard of such thing ah see be bachelor said golden haired fairy gaily horrid old bachelor who doe know anything except how to give people nasty medicine hey now have have be too bad always make medicine nice wait till be matron will make nasty when be matron said

have may be condemned to live on own physic if be m vidocq eh dear doctor voici duma dear physician have read three musqueteers of course have have if start quoting already roared japix rolling ponderously into study followed by fanks give in at once memory mr thief catcher be cast iron mine be so surrender at discretion now will be bound continued doctor waggishly sitting in huge chair know where quotation come from replied fanks after moment thought sitting down score one dear doctor by way call thief catcher certainly not jonathan wild that why not m fouche third be worst of at present be nothing mr rixton own name dr japix a told octavius fanks be in seventh circle of hell at back of north wind in nubibus anywhere except where mr rixton be have have hey be down here on business private business ho ho name mary anne be housemaid love oh love heart must discover pish pshaw 'hence vain deluding joy milton dear doctor best poem really want to be serious be serious by mean said japix complacently business first pleasure afterwards dine with to night have got engagement say seven to morrow accept 'when found make note of ' remarked doctor scribbled few line in memoranda book eh author dickens captain cuttle very good go up top be going to be serious said fanks in despair dear rixton be serious replied dr japix composing feature proceed first who be people who left a came in now what deuce do want to know for said japix looking puzzled because think one lady be miss judith varlins other miss florry marson correct so far how gentleman name japix lean lank man look like ancient mariner in shore clothes jackson spolger patent medicine millionaire inherited from papa spolger large fortune disagreeable man engaged to marry miss marson biography in nutshell said fanks calmly surely not engaged why not be in love with thought sebastian melstane dr japix uttered ejaculation not complimentary to mr melstane turned fiercely on fanks sebastian melstane be interrupted octavius holding up warning hand perhaps be already what do mean be dead dead yes have read jarlchester mystery that suicide business of course did not think dead man be melstane neither did until hour ago how did find out asked japix gravely by mean of answered fanks placing pill box on table tonic pill read dr japix wonderingly eh oh yes of course prescribed tonic pill for melstane nerve see how found out name by how connect name of scamp melstane with man who died at jarlchester be melstane scamp out out said japix emphatically must have be bad if speak ill of observed fanks reflectively kind of man to have enemy suppose must say plenty humph dare say dare say what talk about jarlchester mystery what be mystery also eh doctor said fanks with smile well wo give trouble of guessing will explain doctor settled in large chair placed large hand on of large knee observed in large voice now then whereupon octavius told experience during jarlchester inquest suppressed conversation name of roger axton finished up by describing how have discovered dead man name from wosk co so see japix said detective decisively saw name on prescription came at once to see a want to analyse eight pill according to prescription according to mr wosk according to assistant twelve pill be made up delivered to melstane can account for half of twelve so ought to leave six in box will find eight now be not right certainly not remarked doctor gravely regarding pill six from twelve leave eight at least not by rule of arithmetic be acquainted with so there be two extra pill so see two extra pill not made up by wosk co now question be said fanks seriously laying hand on one of doctor large knee question be what do two extra pill mean doctor said nothing looked inquiringly at pill box a if expected to answer own resumed fanks leaning back in chair own be half inclined to agree with verdict of juror looked like suicide have kind of uneasy feeling look in case be deceptive so thought must like to know name of dead man in order to find out if there be anything in past life likely to lead to self destruction found name a have told also discovered that there be two extra pill in box have be added after left hand of wosk co understand perfectly now pill can not have be added by melstane a have reason to do so twelve pill be enough for man even with nerve so why must make twelve into fourteen ah why indeed said japix ponderously theory be simply say melstane be scamp naturally must have have enemy now firmly believe that two extra pill contain poison say morphia of melstane died be placed in box surreptitiously by one of enemy natural enough melstane continued fanks impressively leaning forward took one of extra pill according to usual custom before going to bed quite innocent of doing harm in morning melstane be found dead there be evidence to show how came by death horrible horrible observe said fanks emphasizing remark with forefinger observe how 'vaulting ambition o'er leap ' again divine william doctor in other word observe how anxiety of murderer to ensure death of victim have led to danger of own discovery if allude to murderer have put in one pill making thirteen must have be lucky number for undiscovered criminal victim must have taken absolutely trace must have be discovered unluckily however for criminal afraid one morphia pill may not effectively do work put in two morphia pill result sebastian melstane in perfect innocence take one dy other pill damning evidence dear doctor be one of eight in box want to analyse whole eight pill in order to find special one suppose find said japix putting box on table in case theory fall to ground sebastian melstane death will remain mystery to men a sure a sit here dr japix will find deadly morphia pill among seven harmless tonic pill theory remarked japix heavily be remarkably ingenious may mind say be may be correct will analyse pill let know result to morrow if find here said doctor laying one massive hand on pill box if find here morphia pill will establish theory in certain sense think will establish theory in sense retorted fanks impetuously dr japix shook large head slowly delivered oracularly let not said looking at fanks from under shaggy eyebrow let not jump to conclusion may find morphia pill harmless deadly possibly harmless said japix firmly probably deadly rejoined octavius stubbornly if deadly continued doctor quietly grant theory be correct one sebastian melstane met death at hand of person who put two extra pill in box if harmless however said japix raising voice establishes nothing melstane may have suffered from sleeplessness seeing nerve be wrong must say be very probable did taken morphia pill purchased from perhaps london chemist in order to get good night rest why two morphia pill objected octavius earnestly chemist sell morphia pill in objection sir be not without merit said japix approvingly still two pill may have be balance of box placed in one so a to obviate trouble of carrying two box possible certainly not probable no dear doctor need not try to upset theory wait till analyse pill will do so to night to morrow will have answer suppose did give melstane morphia pill said fanks a arose to take leave believe in morphia pill for sleepless people except in extreme case generally give chloral a did to mr jackson spolger to day oh ancient mariner said octavius carelessly doe suffer from sleeplessness yes on account of approaching marriage presume with miss marson exactly by way observed fanks suddenly be not engaged to melstane not engaged exactly replied japix thoughtfully be in love with strange how woman adore scamp be long story dear rixton to morrow night when dine across walnut wine will tell to thee tale divine have have see be poet eh yes plagiarist also second line be tennyson really mr bucket dickens observe be a sharp after rhyme a after thief with active brain wonder suffer from insomnia when do will come to for morphia pill said octavius laughing not sort in box though want to die yet believe in morphia pill remarked japix rising to accompany guest to door never prescribe oh yes by way did prescribe for mr axton octavius who be going out of door turned suddenly round with cry of horror roger axton yes do know why good gracious what be matter for octavius fanks trembling in limb have sunk into chair near door be ill be ill roared doctor anxiously here let get brandy said fanks recovering with great effort though face be a pale a death be right used to know roger axton name startled unpleasant association growled japix rubbing large head in vexed manner hope not dear dear trust not liked young fellow good lad very good lad fanks at once hastened to dispel doctor distrust no nothing unpleasant said

possibility said judith quickly if letter have gone astray what be to do well if hush laid hand suddenly on arm to arrest speech for at moment voice thin peevish of mr spolger be heard saying name sebastian melstane judith roger looked at one cheek pale manner agitated be about to speak again when stopped for second time listen must hear quite plainly for pair at end of room have moved unthinkingly near spolger be talking shrilly to mr marson about man of whom be then thinking came up to see before went away be very ill must see have most agitating interview told that loved florry told affianced husband said that must never marry that must prevent marriage then insulted yes held out box of pill asked if have idea beyond such thing knocked box out of hand insisted upon leaving house went for be firm very firm though much agitated left box behind yes found after be gone sent servant down with to boarding house oh be terribly agitated be so bold wo come back again no wo come back how do know cried roger starting to foot in spite of judith warning touch what be listening said mr spolger angrily coming near to young man must hardly help hearing seeing raised voice retorted roger sharply most dishonourable most dishonourable sir gentleman gentleman said francis marson plainly be in house beg pardon mr marson said roger ceremoniously only asked mr spolger simple question to decline to reply replied mr spolger coolly why judith have risen to foot be clinging to francis marson arm while roger spolger looked steadily at one whole four of be so intent upon conversation that did not see little figure enter door pause on threshold at sound of angry voice agitate said valetudinarian angrily be not used to be agitated sir be telling friend private story must not have listened apologise replied roger bowing did not intend to give offence wondered how be guessed melstane must never return little figure stole nearer what do mean asked spolger quickly judith leaned on marson arm with face deadly white eye dilated waiting waiting for what dreaded to think mean about jarlchester mystery mr marson said nothing with face a pale a of woman on arm stared steadily at roger axton at mention of jarlchester figure behind came slowly along until florry marson with look of terror on face stood still a statue behind lover have read in paper about jarlchester mystery said spolger in altered tone guessed a much be reason said melstane must not return what do mean mean that sebastian melstane died at jarlchester know sebastian turned round there stood florry with one hand clasped over heart other grasping chair to steady by sebastian whispered with white lip be be dead roger turned head dead cried with cry of terror dead murdered fell fainting on floor chapter terrible suspicion eight o'clock in evening by remarkably incorrect clock on mantelpiece eight thirty by mr fanks watch be never wrong gentleman be seated in private room of foundryman hotel waiting arrival of roger axton foundryman be not first class hotel be private room first class apartment be comfortable enough mr fanks be too much worried in own mind to pay much attention to personal want be much disturbed about old schoolfellow a everything now seemed to point to axton a possible murderer conversation at jarlchester evidence of dr japix delicately insinuated suspicion of juda seemed a though doubt must exist that roger axton be person responsible for death of sebastian melstane in spite however of circumstantial evidence detective hoped against hope resolved within own honest heart not to believe roger guilty until have heard explanation of affair knew well that circumstantial evidence be not always to be depended upon axton prompt arrival in answer to letter have inspired with belief that young man must be innocent otherwise must hardly dare to place in position of such peril so mr fanks with perplexity of mind showing even in usually impassive face sat watch in hand awaiting roger arrival casting absent glance round room comfortable room enough in old fashioned way furniture seemed to have be made at primeval period when ironfields be village here there meretricious hotel decoration spoiled effect of whole heavy mahogany arm chair heavy mahogany table heavy mahogany sideboard stood on gaudy carpet with dingy white ground sprawling red rose mixed with painfully green leaf antique carved mantelpiece cupid flower foliage on staring square mirror with ornate gilt frame swathed in yellow gauze in front of gimcrack french timepiece with aggressively loud tick vividly painted vas of coarse china containing tawdry paper flower two ragged fan of peacock feather curtain of one window be drawn cheerful fire burned under antique mantelpiece with modern barbarism evil smelling lamp with dull yellow flame illuminated apartment mr fanks sat in grandfatherly armchair drawn close to fire pondered over curious aspect of affair while rain outside swept down crooked street wind howled at window a if wanted to get in to comfortable warmth out of damp cold knock at door disturbed sombre meditation of octavius in response to answer roger walked into room with flushed face somewhat nervous manner did not attempt to shake hand feeling have right to do so until have explained previous behaviour at jarlchester sat down near fire opposite to friend looked rather defiantly at impassive face of gentleman who gave cool nod well said at length breaking somewhat awkward silence have lost time in answering letter be glad of roger responded fanks gravely give great hope how be not criminal suppose fanks said nothing looked sadly at suspicious face of young man silence give consent see said axton throwing back in chair with harsh laugh well be sorry man thought friend must think so ill of what else can think roger call roger said axton with effort at gaiety why not prisoner at bar convict in jail secret poisoner because believe to be none of three friend replied fanks candidly roger looked at with sudden flush of shame involuntarily held out hand drew back quickly before other must clasp not yet said hastily will not clasp hand in friendship until clear in eye demand explanation well be here to give be glad of replied fanks for second time be quite aware continued roger flushing now be at ironfields must be aware that concealed certain fact in conversation with yes said have not be to ironfields that did not correspond with miss varlins statement be false may ask on whose authority speak so confidently demanded axton coldly certainly on authority of dr japix japix repeated roger starting do know yes met time ago in manchester renewed acquaintance with down here why because wanted to analyse pill found in melstane room after death looked sharply at roger a spoke that young man met gaze serenely without flinching seemed to give fanks great satisfaction for withdrew eye with sigh of relief octavius said roger after pause do remember conversation at jarlchester mr fanks deliberately produced secretive little note book tapped delicately with long finger conversation be set down here oh said roger with sardonic politeness be not aware carried detective principle so far a to take note of interview with friend do a rule responded fanks coolly have instinct that interview might be useful in connection with melstane case be right see roger cried with burst of natural feeling why did not trust roger turned away face upon burned flush of shame because be afraid replied in low voice of being accused of murder yes can exculpate said fanks in startled tone hope so replied roger gloomily on word of honour fanks be innocent have read 'edwin drood ' yes responded fanks rather puzzled at what appeared to be irrelevant question several time do remember what dickens say in novel said axton slowly 'circumstances may accumulate so strongly even against innocent man directed sharpened pointed may slay ' true true answered fanks approvingly nodding head such thing have occurred before may occur again cried axton with look of apprehension know that suspect know that circumstantial evidence must be brought against must put life in danger on soul fanks be innocent of melstane death feel certain be answered octavius gently a say circumstance be strong against tell everything without reserve may be able to advise otherwise be completely in dark believe be friend fanks said roger earnestly believe know too well to think must be guilty of such dreadful crime yes will tell everything place unreservedly in hand first tell how be be so sure be murder not suicide certainly be well must be on common ground for better understanding of explanation regarding death of melstane own at jarlchester be half inclined to believe in suicide theory have not be for name ironfields on pill box gave clue must probably have acquiesced in verdict of jury following up clue however went to chemist wosk co where pill be made up discovered that originally there be twelve in box must account for disposal of six so ought to have left balance of dozen true if remember when counted at jarlchester there be eight exactly two extra pill be placed in box by unknown person whom believe to be murderer of melstane why because took pill to dr japix analysed whole eight seven be harmless tonic pill eighth compounded of deadly morphia what cried roger starting to foot melstane died of morphia did now do understand murderer whoever be placed two morphia pill sufficient to cause death in box melstane took one in complete innocence died other be analysed by japix found to contain sufficient morphia to kill two men be wonderful how have worked out said roger with hearty admiration how do connect with murder did not say connected with murder replied fanks hastily only said there be suspicious circumstance against for instance have morphia pill in possession how do know asked roger with start of surprise japix told yes japix prescribed cried axton starting to foot own doe look suspicious can set mind at rest on point will permit to withdraw for moment talk nonsense roger said fanks angrily of course will axton said nothing left room leaving fanks considerably puzzled a to cause of departure in few minute however returned placed in detective hand box of pill there said resuming seat if count pill will find there be eleven original number be twelve only took one finding did good left rest in box be correct be replied fanks who have counted pill there be eleven here if have further doubt can ask wosk co who made up pill there be need believe must prefer doing so said roger urgently very well replied fanks calmly putting box in pocket will see about to morrow now have set mind at rest on point have told story tell roger paled little at request remained silent for few moment fanks said at last with great solemnity have suspicion of now perhaps when tell may consider to be confirmed what then what then echoed fanks cheerfully simply knowing character a do believe must be guilty of cold blooded murder so when tell story will put head together try to find out true criminal will be only too glad to do said roger gratefully if only to regain confidence have lost well go on with story told good deal of at jarlchester replied axton looking at fire thoughtfully will reveal now what concealed then first time met judith varlins be in town came down with letter of introduction from london friend to mr marson made free of house in fact wanted to stay there though be poor be proud so preferred to put up at binter boarding house yes know that place how so went there to see monsieur guinaud then saw uncommonly good specimen of scoundrel be great friend of melstane hated like poison know why juda be nickname here did melstane have grudge against because put stop to secret meeting with florry marson by telling judith why did do because melstane be out out scoundrel did not want to marry silly little thing if have done so must have broken heart well when judith became aware of meeting took florry off to ventnor escorted to london where stayed for time then went on to isle of wight shortly afterwards followed told took place there on return to ironfields about middle of october believed melstane met florry by stealth taxed with have furious row went off to london while there received letter from miss varlins telling that florry be engaged to mr spolger that melstane be leaving ironfields for jarlchester how did know asked fanks sharply know perhaps florry told of course must easily learn from lover what puzzle be why melstane went to jarlchester at have idea said octavius looking at keenly not least in world be quite at sea a to reason humph go on judith asked to go to jarlchester await arrival of melstane in order to obtain from packet of letter written by florry have in possession yes said fanks eagerly go on went down to jarlchester ostensibly on walking tour received second letter from judith telling melstane have left ironfields be on way down on day be expected to arrive went for walk intending to return early unfortunately however lost way did not get back until late at night found melstane have arrived gone to bed did ask if mr melstane have arrived no asked casually if stranger have arrived told one have come from london described so of course knew at once why mystery judith implored to be careful said roger quickly see florry good name be at stake wanted to get packet of letter back with a little publicity a possible nevertheless rather overdid mystery business well what did do when found melstane have gone to bed went to bed also made up mind to see next morning thinking of letter however knowing be in next room must not sleep so a be not then twelve o'clock thought must go in see curious thing to make visit to man room at time dare say replied axton tartly see be anxious to get letter knowing that melstane be nervous man particularly at night fancied might get back by playing on fear most original idea rather wild perhaps not without merit well put on thing took candle went into room ho ho so be that left door ajar be went into room quietly saw be sound asleep on table near bed be bundle of letter have evidently be reading how did know be bundle wanted because recognised miss marson writing on top letter well seeing be bundle be in search of what did do rather mean thing stole stole upon word roger be nice young man in fighting with man like melstane have to make use of own weapon retorted roger coolly seems dishonourable to for to go into man room steal bundle of letter be dealing with scoundrel letter contained honour of young inexperienced girl whom held at mercy if have awakened there must have be row must have raised alarm must have got into trouble so did best thing only thing to be done under circumstance stole letter did see pill box when be in room be in such hurry to go having once secured what wanted did not stop to look at anything went back to room leaving door of ajar said fanks reprovingly foolish man ah see be not experienced in midnight burglary well after got back to own room what did do went to bed slept soundly next morning sent packet of letter to judith went off on stroll when came back at night be horrified to learn sebastian melstane be dead rest know when spoke to did really truly believe have committed suicide yes did replied roger honestly thought have found out loss of letter seeing that hold over florry marson be lost have committed suicide in desperation how did account for morphia did attempt to account for knew be that have secured letter melstane be dead florry be safe so be wish have told at jarlchester tell be afraid to do so look how black case appears against fight with man here follow down to jarlchester have morphia pill in possession go into room at night in morning be found dead of morphia why if have told must have be arrested florry name must have come up that infernal monsieur juda must have put spoke in must very probably have be hanged on circumstantial evidence wonder be afraid replied octavius thoughtfully seeing be friend might just a well have trusted be detective be old schoolfellow then believe be innocent do if be guilty must not have told story so dead against will shake hand then asked roger colouring holding out hand by mean replied fanks solemnly two friend shook hand with honest fervour now then said octavius when ceremony be concluded next thing to be done be to find out who killed melstane be impossibility cried roger in despair say that answered fanks coolly at jarlchester have nothing to go upon yet look what have discovered be genius octavius egad have need to be to unravel case said octavius smiling be most difficult affair ever took in hand do suspect one ca say at present till get thing more in order first thing want to know be be content of letter can not tell did not read of course simply packed up sent to miss varlins oh then have got have where be then lost lost how so ca tell said roger helplessly see miss varlins did not want sent to hall a florry marson might have got hold of if have be such little fool be so much in love with melstane that probably must have sent straight back well a did not go to hall where did go to post office in place postmistress however know miss varlins have packet be addressed in name must have sent up at once to hall to make thing safe however directed letter to miss judith post office suburban ironfields be to call for suppose called yes day postmistress said packet have arrived strange postal arrangement be very good a rule letter often go astray addressed to miss judith say yes fanks pinched chin thoughtfully between finger thumb looked frowningly at fire then looked up suddenly be postmistress here intelligent no reverse snuffy old idiot oh said fanks smiling to then must be surprised if have delivered that packet to wrong person there be one else about here called judith mr fanks did not reply leaving chair went to sideboard brought back pen ink paper placed on table near roger be very bad writer said calmly arranging paper worse than usual run of literary men be sorry for printer if be case letter sent here saying be coming be most illegible well that letter have nothing to do with case said roger impatiently think have good deal to do with seeing told be coming down here replied fanks coolly however be not to point take up pen roger did so looking considerably bewildered at manner in friend be behaving now write down address put on packet axton obeyed quickly produced following scrawl illustration handwritten address on packet miss judith post office suburban ironfields humph said fanks looking at specimen of caligraphy most careless writing observe use old fashioned ' dot `` s ' cross ' moreover curve `` towards next letter in fashion of ' ' so far so good now write m juda illustration handwritten be juda ' roger did so with idea of what friend have in mind there observed fanks when be completed do see much difference between judith juda according to writing said roger honestly looking at ca say that do what do mean mean that postmistress old stupid a say be have made mistake delivered packet to monsieur juda absurd not at judith varlins be generally called miss varlins presume so christian name judith must not occur to old woman on other hand odd name juda must knowing that extraordinary looking frenchman to be called juda mean postmistress must naturally hand packet over to surely must refuse to receive know so much about in first place might have thought packet be for in second natural curiosity must make take home to examine when found what packet contained kept why must keep how dense be roger said fanks irritably be friend of melstane seeing letter be addressed to melstane very likely kept by to return to brother scamp then think monsieur juda have packet be certain of will call see what can do to morrow right why be so anxious to get packet for several reason believe that packet to contain letter to melstane not only from miss marson from father also further believe continued fanks sinking voice to whisper that in packet be contained secret of melstane death surely suspect mr marson cried roger aghast octavius rolled up paper upon roger have be writing threw into fire a answered with marked emphasis on latter part of reply suspect one at present extract from detective note book feel much more at ease now have seen roger have explained away suspicion be true that story tell very much against to mind fact assures of innocence a guilty man must tell story so much against yes be sure be not guilty acted foolishly in obeying miss varlins instruction in keeping truth from at jarlchester nevertheless conduct have not be that of guilty man whosoever poisoned sebastian melstane be certainly not roger axton be much troubled about disappearance of letter must like to see there must be something in may throw light on mysterious affair have ground for declaring think so if mr marson who did not want daughter to marry melstane wrote letter must be in packet be letter wish to see now however by unfortunate mistake of postmistress letter be in possession of juda again implicates in affair like attitude of juda at must be impossible have motive sebastian melstane be friend so there be reason must wish out of way believe that juda hold letter in order to make capital out of with mr marson will thwart on point however mem to see postmistress to morrow find out for certain if packet be delivered a verily believe to juda chapter missing letter suburban ironfields being a have be stated poor relation of opulent city fared badly enough in respect after fashion of poor relation comfort luxury improvement pertaining to nineteenth century civilisation be to be

question postman told delivered packet to juda judith uttered exclamation of horror upon hearing detective glanced sharply at be afraid of juda seeing letter asked quickly miss varlins passed handkerchief across dry lip after pause answered with great deliberation showing thereby how strong be self control know anything of man said quickly beyond that be friend of mr melstane that in be sufficient to make anxious letter contain nothing more than usual romantic nonsense girl must write at same time knowing frenchman to be a verily believe unscrupulous wretch be afraid may use letter for own end what can gain by showing said fanks sagaciously seeing contain nothing of importance spoke with such pointed significance emphasis that judith fiery tempered by nature flashed out suddenly with great spirit know how much mr axton have told sir question right to speak to in manner oh fanks doe mean anything interposed roger unthinkingly fanks cried judith with start looking at octavius

jarlchester mystery know have case in hand if be so perhaps will help in matter can not help said faintly again passing handkerchief over lip can in one way said fanks quietly looked at sharply unable to read anything on impassive countenance threw back in carriage with uneasy laugh how so by letting read letter now in possession of juda said so firmly that fanks axton glanced at in surprise upon leaned forward with pale face spoke hurriedly there be nothing really nothing in letter beyond foolish girlish talk assure mr rixton there be nothing at then why refuse to let see asked octavius quickly be private not when law desire to see be law intend to see letter what do mean fanks said roger angrily indignant at tone being used to miss varlins what say responded fanks coolly axton miss

spolger came about in wise roger be very indignant with friend for speaking so plainly to judith told so in somewhat strong language when carriage have departed fanks said nothing at first being much exercised in own mind over peculiar attitude taken up towards by miss varlins axton be so very free in condemnation that for moment lost self control answered sharply have taken up case roger intend to carry out to bitter end if only for sake must let act in way a think best otherwise otherwise repeated axton angrily a octavius paused will throw up whole affair must not do said roger quickly want

fanks friend axton found by practical experience when dined with unwedded host gave capital meal undeniable wine a three men be good conversationalist have very delightful dinner afterwards went to doctor study particularly comfortable room smoked wonderfully good cigar over first rate coffee study be private snuggery especially affected by doctor who have in book few comfortable chair enticing looking writing table good etching by eminent artist plenty of warm red drapery to keep out cold wind so general in ironfields on night there be blazing fire in polished grate around sat japix two guest enjoying soothing weed talking about jarlchester case luckily japix be perfectly free on special night unless unexpected call must be made on be permitted by hard law regulate life of medical men to enjoy smoke talk to friend a pleased three have plenty to say a night wore on towards small hour gradually began to talk of melstane murder topic to everything have be tending for considerable time be true that have referred to in desultory fashion be not until ten o'clock that settled down to steady analysis of case most extraordinary said japix in subdued roar reflects great credit on fanks for way in have found out have not got to end of journey yet replied octavius grimly so wo holloa till be out of wood be out of jarlchester wood at event yes only to plunge into deeper recess of ironfields wood well said axton reflectively have proved conclusively that did not commit crime shouted japix in amazement yes replied roger serenely just fancy doctor be sitting with suspected murderer not now remonstrated fanks good humouredly if did suspect for moment soon cleared in eye must admit thing looked black against so black assented axton quickly have detective be other than must now be in prison awaiting trial on charge of attempted murder possibly answered fanks lighting fresh cigar not only that even probably however have proved innocence spolger have proved did suspect also asked doctor chuckling thought a much from question to day monsieur fouch well have fatal pill box in possession us morphia for soothers hated melstane so altogether there be very nice little case against finished japix with gigantic laugh oh know profession monsieur lecoq have read gaboriau romance be afraid be not so infallible a great lecoq pooh why not dare say be modelled on vidocq at event have now got enigma must delight monsieur gaboriau real life be more difficult than fiction there be wrong fiction be reflection of real life holding of mirror up to nature eh author shakespeare said octavius promptly quoted wrongly never mind spirit if not form be there have strayed from subject observed axton smiling regarding case since spolger be innocent who be guilty ask something easier do know good vidocq remarked japix contemplating large foot that wonder have not turned attention to monsieur juda have done so said octavius quietly can bring nothing home to be very clever scoundrel virtue yes scoundrel safety did tell other day that thought juda held thread of case in hand said roger turning to fanks fancy said something like replied octavius slowly if mistake not have suspicion of juda have said roger emphatically have have suspicion of juda be pretty sure that committed murder finished doctor oh be not prepared to go far said fanks quickly a regard monsieur guinaud will tell one thing be custom understand for master to check assistant with regard to number of pill in box yes be usual custom well understood from juda that such be case with melstane tonic pill having suspicion however went saw wosk what did say that counted pill in box then handed back to juda open oh said axton suddenly then think be juda put two extra pill in box might have done so what must be motive in getting rid of melstane ah there be difficulty in answering that replied fanks quickly appears juda love miss marson to distraction melstane stood in way so might have got rid of by pill method granted said japix eagerly even if did remove melstane by morphia method must be nearer object of love than before chemist assistant be not fitting match for heiress of francis marson true true besides said axton taking up defence why must juda take trouble to kill melstane at jarlchester when must have done so at ironfields oh be merely question of safety replied octavius thoughtfully if melstane have died here awkward question might have be asked must have be difficult for guinaud to answer at jarlchester man dy there be nothing to connect juda one else with death pill idea be devilish ingenious one quite worthy of frenchman pooh virtuous english can easily hold own in respect for extraordinary case in paris can find equivalent in london by way cried japix suddenly deserting line of conversation in favour of new one went to see miss marson to day be very ill know fault said roger regretfully blurting out fact of melstane death well go on said fanks impatiently what be going to say japix visited miss marson to day have said that what else saw father who told most extraordinary thing wait bit said detective with great excitement will bet fiver can tell what told deuce can replied japix in astonishment well will take bet marson said that juda have written asking for interview right how wo swear how by be sacred did find out juda also said be about document right again believe be magician fanks not at inductive reasoning wish 'd stop talking riddle broke in roger irritably tell what deuce mean wo be very pleasant to ear go on know what be going to say said roger excitedly mind be going to know truth about business japix looked at two guest with astonishment depicted on broad good humoured face judged best to say nothing until octavius explained matter did speedily dear japix said quietly there be packet of letter roger obtained from melstane at jarlchester forwarded to miss varlins addressed to by first name miss judith precisely well that stupid old postmistress muddled up name with of juda sent packet to met miss varlins went together to get packet from guinaud asked to let see packet refused at first ultimately consented on condition that let look over letter first agreed to that did so found nothing well well said japix quickly see anything strange in do if there have be nothing particular in packet miss varlins must not have objected to seeing so belief be that juda abstracted letter did not want to see have gone to marson to show to well well repeated fanks angrily see letter stolen by juda bear indirectly on death of melstane if be case why must juda show to marson fanks fidgeted uneasily in chair looked at floor ceiling doctor everywhere at roger really ca tell said at length very lamely yes can shouted roger rising quickly suspect have said name replied fanks very pale rising in turn will roger will tell declare be lie lie good heaven cried japix rising what doe mean looked at men for answer obtained from roger mean that old schoolfellow suspect woman love of crime judith varlins yes judith varlins japix looked at fanks to see if must repeat accusation detective said nothing dear axton be dreaming said soothingly 'd a soon think of suspecting roger seized large hand of doctor shook heartily thank heaven there be one belief innocent said with half sob tut tut answered doctor quietly sit down dear boy sit down there must be explanation of if roger must not be so impetuous said fanks who have resumed seat must like to tell something roger looked at friend with gleam of hope in eye sat down in sullen silence say suspect miss varlins explained fanks with faint hesitation simply because said juda have taken certain document to marson how do know may not suspect one else whom miss varlins observed fanks leisurely may for know be acting very noble part may be trying to screen person for instance mr francis marson what shouted japix roger in one breath be not certain by mean certain have suspicion of marson said japix scornfully pooh nonsense there be more respected man in ironfields be generally respected person who fancy can sin with impunity not be found out on account of very respectability may ask few question japix by mean why did marson want pretty daughter to marry ugly wreck of spolger japix hesitated moment before answering know nothing for fact said at length with great reluctance common rumour common rumour by mean there be smoke without fire detestable proverb said japix frowning well rumour say that marson will smash if money be not put into business florry marson be to be price of spolger finding for marson son requisite money think be most powerful reason for crime have have yet of listener answered remark a seemed instinctively to feel that fatal net be closing round marson through relentless logic of detective in case of axton resumed fanks coolly motive for crime appeared to be love in case of spolger love in case of juda love very well hardly strong enough motive to make man put rope round neck in case of marson however what do find bankruptcy loss of position loss of money loss of name in fact loss of everything that man hold most dear strong motive think ca stand cried roger jumping up quickly confound fanks 'd argue man guilty without chance of defence tell motive for crime certainly how did marson do when did have pill box where must obtain morphia juda know juda yes believe juda be accomplice of marson between two of killed melstane in remarkably ingenious manner ca believe said japix a two visitor arose to take leave probably not replied fanks calmly will give plenty of proof shortly why what do intend to do be going to see monsieur juda will find match for said doctor grimly a accompanied guest to door then will see marson humph two stool will fall to ground will take chance of said fanks cheerfully a stepped out into darkness with roger good night japix will be able to give key to jarlchester mystery next week extract from detective note book just returned from evening with japix r j have long conversation about case conversation have left in state of great perplexity told japix must give key to mystery next week spoke more boldly than have reason to be true be narrowing down circle suspect two people with possible third marson judith varlins juda be very humiliating fact to confess indecision even to myself detective be not infallible save in novel be perplexed have suspected axton wrongfully have suspected spolger wrongfully now let make note of motif of of three people suspect now marson be on verge of bankruptcy only one person can save viz jackson spolger however decline to help unless marries florry marson wo marry spolger because of love for melstane strong motive here for marson to get rid of melstane miss varlins motive for getting rid of melstane think be mixture of love jealousy strong motif with woman juda love miss marson also with loose morality must have hesitation in putting melstane out of way want florry marson want money melstane stand in way of obtaining in case juda be just man from reading of character to commit crime again employment a chemist offer peculiar advantage for obtaining morphia must be difficult for marson miss varlins to obtain morphia in large quantity juda must easily get in ordinary course of business be going to see juda from second conversation may perhaps learn something useful be crafty still may betray at event be worth while trying mem to see juda to morrow night chapter monsieur juda at bay monsieur jules guinaud be not quite satisfied in own mind with regard to result of interview of previous night be true that by using document have stolen from melstane packet have succeeded in obtaining marson consent to marriage with florry be also true that have found unexpected obstacle to plan in person of judith varlins be cynical in estimate of female sex regarding a being quite inferior to male at same time be too clever man to underestimate result of quick witted woman opposing to will florry be mere cypher whom loved in sensual fashion for beauty in worldly fashion for money judith be quite different stamp of woman to negative type of inane loveliness have masculine brain have strong will have fearless nature guinaud dreaded upshot of interference on part genius man genius in wicked way with wonderful capability of arranging plan brushing aside obstacle might interfere with fulfilment in case judith interfered so juda taking rapid survey of situation saw mean by must silence effectively determined to do so without delay wished to marry florry marson wished to enjoy income position benefit derived from being son in law of marson be consequently determined to let nothing stand in way of realisation of hope juda be not brave man be wonderfully crafty fox a rule gain end where lion fails so frenchman determined to go up to hall on night following first interview see judith let know at once what to expect if meddled with arrangement be very nicely arranged if monsieur guinaud have be undisturbed must no doubt have succeeded in wicked little plan fate not approving of usurpation of role a arbitrator of human life interfered octavius fanks be instrument used to defeat frenchman scheme in playing with fate goddess have nasty habit of forcing opponent hand before desire to show be what did now to great discomfiture of monsieur juda be about eight o'clock on night following that momentous interview at hall mr binter boarder have left jail on ticket of leave system except juda who sat in drawing room cell arranging everything in crafty brain before setting out on errand to miss varlins head jailer have several time entered room intimated that have better run out for breath of fresh air juda saying must go later on kept seat by diminutive fire declined to obey mr binter much to good lady disgust why drat man said in stony fashion to one of under warder what doe mean by wastin coal ' ile why walk dinner off by usin ' leg instead of robbin of profit by takin ' out of thirty shillin weekly under warder suggested respectfully that monsieur juda might be expecting friend night a on previous occasion to jailer made prompt reply oh dare say that friend have here be furriner heard 'em talking french gabble be more like turkey gobblin ' than man talkin ' why furriners learn english there be front door bell p ' r'aps be that friend again will go go did to find mr fanks waiting on doorstep thinking be expected by juda seeing that gentleman have waited in took in charge formally conducted to drawing room cell gentleman for munseer said glaring at lodger who have arisen to foot in surprise please use too many coal sir for coal be coal however much may think waste paper having thus relieved feeling mr binter retired to basement where amused with badgering mr binter fanks be left alone with chemist assistant

kind foreboding storm like two skilful fencer watched one warily ready to take advantage of first opportunity to break down guard of other be difficult to say who must win for be equally clever equally watchful equally merciless of underestimated acuteness of adversary duel of brain men on guard fanks made first attack be aware monsieur guinaud that stand in very dangerous position faith not at then be a well must know at once be detective a know be investigating affair of late friend suspect one of murder very well monsieur axton no dear spolgers juda shrugged shoulder faith know not then man suspect yes do suspect monsieur jules guinaud frenchman be by mean startled laughed jeeringly eh monsieur que diable faites vous dans cette galre need not jest be in earnest truly will monsieur speak plainly certainly say be friend of melstane be lie hated because be successful rival with miss marson wished dead so that must be free to make suit to young lady box of tonic pill left hand for of melstane pardon went first into hand of monsieur vosk trouble to tell lie guinaud have asked wosk say counted pill then gave box again open be lie reserve defence if please when got that

monsieur be not afraid of law of libel evidently there be witness present ah scheme well pshaw what answer can make to statement monsieur juda smiled blandly shrugged shoulder spread out lean hand with deprecating gesture ala can say nothing that have a strong case against a have against dear friend monsieur roger fanks reddened angrily be aware that have blundered two three time during case still be not pleasant to be taunted thus by smiling adversary who indulged in fine irony led to believe axton be guilty said meekly eh be mistake told what knew be not fault if affair reflects upon monsieur roger do know can arrest on suspicion of murder truly then do so be ready fanks bit nail in impotent wrath feeling quite helpless to deal with man must not arrest because have not sufficient evidence to warrant doing so must not force to speak a have mean of commanding altogether be completely at mercy of juda in way juda saw chuckled can tell monsieur anything else confound sir have told nothing eh be because do know nothing be lie guinaud believe know about case monsieur doe too much honour be very provoking certainly fanks seeing uselessness of prolonging discussion be about to

soon a can obtain warrant once be in clutch of english law wo get out of till tell know about case octavius be simply playing game of bluff with juda trusting to frenchman ignorance of english law to win game be right in case a guinaud did not know how far arm of justice must stretch in england thought might be arrested for theft of letter if so must be fatal to scheme a desired to avoid publicity in way arrest at present meant tumbling down of carefully built house of card having thus taken rapid survey of position made up mind to save by sacrifice of one else fixed upon judith who have tried to thwart a victim with idea politely desired fanks to be seated again request that gentleman obeyed with feeling of great relief a have played last card in desperate game be grateful to find that

puzzled be reason frenchman have for such betrayal in order to secure success of scheme be necessary that must keep silent yet have evidently voluntarily revealed secret knowledge thus rendered useless to design only way in marson must account for detective request be that must have learned secret of juda otherwise there must be reason why must seek interview filled with idea marson summoned up courage prepared to meet coming storm with a brave front a possible wrote to fanks told must be prepared to see at eight o'clock night then shut up in study for rest of day plunged in gloomy

marson be almost distracted by nervous terror dread of impending evil so did not think wise to reveal to dangerous position in be placed must learn in due time meanwhile preserved gloomy silence told adopted father that must be by side during ordeal in order to support to best of ability poor soul knew how futile that support must be with stern self repression kept foreboding locked in own heart francis marson felt to great extent comforted in knowing that have at least one friend to stand by in hour of peril be nearly eight o'clock when judith entered study found marson seated at writing
