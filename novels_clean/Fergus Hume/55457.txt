most of day wandered about most of night in soft cool moonlight when verona looked much more romantic than in garish blaze of italian sun be on one of night adventure happened to adventure in be involved by merest chance although confess that vice of curiosity have good deal to do with entanglement therein after dining at hotel went out for customary stroll having lighted pipe a preventive against evil odour seem inseparable from italian town wandered on through deserted street in listless aimless fashion contrasting in own mind magnificent verona of past with dismal verona of present taken up with fantastic dreaming did not notice particularly where be going how quickly time be passing until found on ponte aleardi iron bridge span adige heard church bell chiming hour of eleven moon be shining in darkly blue sky amid brilliant star leaden water of river shone like band of steel in pale silvery light on side of stream lowered dark mass of house from window of gleamed here there orange coloured light while against clear sky arose tall steeple of church serrated outline of full foliaged tree be wonderfully beautiful soft wind blowing through night rippled swift water to line of ever vanishing white so leaning over balustrade of bridge dreamed smoked smoked dreamed until chiming of half hour warned to return to hotel night however be so beautiful cool must not think of hot sleeping chamber with repugnance feeling disinclined for rest made up mind to stroll onward for time might have visited that fraudulent tomb of juliet in moonlight a have already seen by day must not feel enthusiastic about palpable deception refused to be further victimised crossed over bridge to left shore of river be somewhat solitary there be not afraid of robber a have little money jewellery on moreover felt must occasion arise must use fist sufficiently well to protect being thus at ease regarding personal safety lighted cigar luckily happened to be in pocket wandered on until came within sight of cemetery now firmly believe that one have in vein of superstition be developed in accordance with surroundings place man at midday in bustling city scoff at idea of supernatural let find at midnight alone on solitary moor with shadow of moonlight on side inherent superstition will start to life peopling surrounding solitude with unseen phantom more terrible than of arabian night whether be time of night proximity of burial ground know felt breast fill with vague fear hastened to leave uncanny spot a quickly a possible fate however be against for in blind speed instead of crossing bridge turned to left unexpectedly found in vicinity of burial ground be apparently much older than one have first seen there be ruined wall around overtopped by tall melancholy cypress looming black funereal against midnight sky by time have recovered nerve feeling somewhat ashamed of former ignominious flight determined to punish by entering antique abode of dead examining thoroughly with idea climbed over portion of broken wall in shadow of cypress tree shadow dense a darkness of egypt viewed mournful scene before with mingled feeling of curiosity dread be evidently very old for even under softening light of moon near tomb looked discoloured time worn saw soft swell of green turf betokening graf upon grew grass long rank milky gleam of slender white column broken at top to typify short life of who slept below while yonder in frowning grey stone stood solemn pyramid built in imitation of egyptian monster by nile here near at hand miniature temple of white marble delicate fragile in construction hinted at graceful architecture of greece among myriad tomb arose slender lance shaped cypress tree dark form alternating with gleaming cross of white marble sombre pyramid classic temple innumerable line of tall column gave to singular scene aspect of visionary city of dead have become visible to mortal eye by enchantment of moon fascinated by weirdness of solitude let cigar fall to ground hidden in gloom of cypress tree stared long earnestly at last abode of old veronese when suddenly hair bristled at root cold sweat broke out on forehead nervous shudder made frame tremble a if with ague cause of sudden fear be that while wrapt in contemplation of desolate necropolis laugh low wicked laugh seemed to come from bowel of earth be now nearly midnight that hour when dead be said to come forth wander among living whose nightly sleep so strangely mock semblance of still repose chain spectre to tomb during day idea pierced brain like knife for moment under influence of hour ghastly scene evil laugh believed be about to witness terrible resurrection tried to turn fly limb be paralyzed like statue of stone stood there rooted to earth feeling a if be under influence of horrible nightmare again heard that wicked laugh time seemed to come from tomb near square block of gray stone in centre of be iron door evidently entrance to vault beside portal stood life sized figure in white marble of angel of death guarding entrance with flaming sword undulating blade of seemed to startled eye to waver against blackness of door round strange tomb grass grew long thick half veiled by tangled herbage star shaped flower glimmered in moonlight in moment must have fled when for third time heard evil laugh iron door of tomb slowly opened dark figure appeared on threshold sight be so terrifying tried to mutter prayer feeling at time a firm belief in visitation of dead a old woman throat be so dry must hing remain silent in hiding place stare at ghoul vampire wraith whatever be leaving tomb to add to horror of situation moon have obscured behind thick cloud there be now deep darkness over graveyard darkness in must see nothing only hear faint sigh of wind rustle of dry grass loud beating of heart suddenly felt that creature of night be passing near in abject terror shrank back against rough trunk of tree under be standing heard nothing in still night saw nothing in thick darkness felt pas by sixth sense be possessed by who have highly strung nerve in moment moon emerged from behind cloud in splendour burst of light gave courage for without considering danger material immaterial rushed quickly towards broken wall in direction judged unseen ghoul have gone white moonlight flooded whole space between burial ground river so saw clearly figure walking quickly away in direction of ponte aleardi be draped in long black cloak with monkish hood with trailing noiseless garment seemed to glide along in moonlight like shadow have be so quick in pursuit that be only little distance away a peered cautiously over broken wall paused for moment throwing back hood looked towards place where be hiding space between be so small moonlight so lustrous must see face head plainly rising from amid dark drapery face be that of woman beautiful woman with full crimson lip large dark eye great mass of reddish coloured hair for even in cold moonlight must see warm bronze glint of tress one hand slender white clasped dark robe to breast looked towards darkness of broken wall a if knew that one have seen terrible resurrection on delicate feature there be cold stern look like of ancient medusa truly felt a if be turning into stone before cruel glare of eye seemed to pierce gloom in lay hid will be said that describe somewhat minutely appearance of ghoul seeing that only beheld for moment in pale uncertain gleam of moon so close be to wall so highly strung be nerve by weirdness of situation that sudden apparition of creature of night photographed indelibly on brain at last seemed satisfied with gazing at burial ground from whence have emerged again drawing hood over face glided rapidly away towards ponte aleardi moved by curiosity supernatural fear determined to follow spectre find out where be going so without moment hesitation jumped down keeping in shadow of wall stole after noiselessly swiftly who be unhappy ghost of antique verona who have committed one of terrible crime invented by lucrezia borgia who be condemned by god to nightly revisit scene of former splendour a punishment for evil life ghoul who left feast of dead in order to prey upon living vampire lusting for blood hastening towards sleeping city to select victim drain of life blood wild weird tale have heard recurred to memory terrible legend of brittany of east of spain of savage north memory of witch rifling dead for unholy need of wizard holding orgy in lonely churchyard of magician evoking silent tenant of grave by powerful spell of demon entering body of newly dead in order to roam midnight world gruesome idea surged in brain like delirium of fever fear have passed away felt intensely curious to know errand upon woman be bent with faculty sharpened by danger sped swiftly after flying spectre looking to right left glided rapidly onward towards sleeping city of verona chapter ii boccaccian adventure italian town be very perplexing to stranger keep to principal thoroughfare built in modern day may have reasonable hope of finding way about once get enmeshed in crooked narrow winding street of period of middle age be lost italian like nature delight in curve narrow alley with cobble stone pavement side walk dignified by name of street twist in out here there between forbidding house seven eight story in height under heavy archway threaten to fall crush unwary stranger down steep flight of worn step until become quite bewildered by labyrinthian winding then house be built high in order to exclude burning sun from alley cold humid feeling pervades entire network of street so that what with gloom twisting treacherous pitfall in dark corner one feel like orpheus going down to hades in search of lost eurydice having be warned of difficulty of exploring unknown depth have mostly confined wandering to broad modern street populous piazza therefore a long a spectre guide kept to via pallone begin at ponte aleardi end at piazza vittoria emanuele felt quite safe when however after leaving piazza plunged into narrow street of medieval period hesitated at first to follow did not know way be stranger unarmed moreover knew not into what unknown danger might be led by mysterious woman who have emerged from graveyard curiosity however prevailed over fear a at moment might lose sight of thereby never discover if be of other world followed boldly into intense gloom into have vanished eye must hardly pierce darkness feared must not be able to keep in sight when luckily portion of cloak became disarranged saw vivid glimmer of white dress on kept eye fastened a guiding star here there in house light be burning dimly hour being late people be in street a followed noiseless phantom along solitary alley with dark house on hand white gleam of moonlit sky above felt a if be moving in dream onward glided turning down here climbing up there until foot be weary with walking besides not knowing way stumbled frequently gave many bruise darkness however seemed obstacle to ghoul who walked onward a rapidly a if be still in moonlight on contrary be only by greatest care must grope way sufficiently quickly to keep in sight prevent from discovering by frequent stumble be about to give up chase in despair when suddenly led out on to small square hastening across disappeared into palace at further end remained in alley until vanished a feared if followed too closely might perceive in moonlight place occupied whole of one side of square be richly decorated building with great arched portal in centre have time to examine closely for fearful of losing ghoul ran quickly across square came to portal be stopped by iron gate be one of heavy iron gate common to italian palace stretching across from wall to wall afford view of inner court be only open on festive occasion to admit vehicle knew entrance be ordinarily afforded by side door without doubt be way have gone unless indeed being supernatural found bolt bar hindrance determined to pursue strange adventure to end sought side door on finding discovered to vexation that be locked must not enter way bar of iron gate be so close together that man of size must not possibly squeeze through so to appearance adventure a far a be concerned be finished making one last effort however felt iron bar singly to see if one be loose in case must remove thus slip through when to astonishment on left side of gate furthest from door found that one of bar have be wrenched away without waiting to consider be curious to say least of concluded that woman if indeed be flesh blood have entered by breach in gate so at once took advantage of discovery soon found in courtyard palace appeared to be quite deserted a window be broken ironwork of balcony ran round four side of courtyard at different height be twisted out of shape besides mosaic pavement upon stood be smashed in several place grass grew between interstice must see plainly in moonlight moreover a great door at end of courtyard opposite iron gate be slightly ajar while other smaller door be closed came to conclusion that ghoul have gone in there conjecture proved correct for a hiding in shadow peered into gloom of building saw sudden flare of torch woman have just fired with in hand began to climb up flight of step at least so judged from seeing torch rise higher higher in darkness until vanished altogether lightning of torch made believe have to do with flesh blood a certainly phantom must use natural way mean in preference to supernatural so directly light disappeared stole cautiously across what appeared to be large hall grasping walking stick tightly in case of surprise must not disguise from that curiosity have led into very perilous adventure a since affair of torch have quite recovered nerve went resolutely forward feeling way carefully in dark climbed up staircase at first turning of ascent be still in darkness on taking second turning saw torch gleaming like fierce yellow star in gloom of long corridor luckily have very light thin shoe on trod cautiously otherwise echo of footstep must most surely have betrayed to mysterious torch bearer palace be certainly not inhabited a heard nothing to support belief a hastened along wide corridor through window on left side streamed pale moonlight saw that glass in window be painted to represent coat of arm so without doubt deserted mansion have once be residence of great veronese noble what be ghoul doing here why have come from vault in churchyard to neglected habitation again fear seized that creature be phantom of splendid lady of middle age come to revisit scene antique magnificence cold air a passed along seemed full of strange perfume of sandalwood sensuous odour in conjunction with flitting torch coloured shadow cast on floor by moonlight streaming in through painted window state of nervous excitement in be made feel like hero of one of amorous adventure be described in glowing page of boccaccio once more torch disappeared round corner to left in moment have again in sight flight of willow step short corridor at end arched door through phantom disappeared at door paused to consider what must do next a if rashly entered room might pay for temerity with life so stood irresolutely at half open door ready to fly at least sign of danger a stood at door in intense gloom for there be window in corridor saw faint glimmer of light in room within light remaining stationary for considerable time judged that lady of sepulchre have left torch there retired into inner chamber resolving therefore to risk attempt peered into apartment saw torch stuck in socket made in small table in centre of small hall be hung with ancient tapestry at end opposite portal through be looking be opening draped with heavy red curtain embroidered with gold for now then a stirred saw dull glitter of tarnished metal determined not to be discovered thought capital plan to hide between tapestry wall so a to secure good concealment then steal along wall until arrived at curtained opening through hoped to be able to see into room beyond just a made up mind to put plan into practice torch have be burning very low flickered went out so that hall be in complete darkness in gloom however ray of bright light shone through embroidered curtain heard murmur of voice then sharp clear note of mandolin ghoul evidently have one with perhaps unfortunate individual whom proposed to devour so a time be to be lost slipped into apartment enconced between tapestry wall on left of door prepared to creep along if possible to curtained archway while paused moment to regain breath courage for certainly situation be not without element of danger metallic note of mandolin ceased man voice began singing italian song one with in spite of knowledge of music be not acquainted be slow sensuous melody of passionate sweetness with undercurrent of sadness singer have remarkably fine tenor voice sounding full rich even through heavy curtain prevented hearing word clearly evidently be amorous rendezvous why be taking place in deserted palace why have lady come from vault in graveyard to keep at once singer stopped abruptly in middle of phrase heard mandolin suddenly smashing on marble floor then sounded low wicked laugh have first heard at burial ground filled with anxiety to learn meaning of strange event glided rapidly along wall speedily arrived at curtained opening being afraid to pull to one side lest must be discovered took out penknife made slit in heavy embroidery then looking through opening thus obtained beheld most extraordinary spectacle circular chamber not very large very lofty surrounded by eight half pillar of veined white marble built into wall supporting domed ceiling richly painted with garland of flower from amid peered smiling face of beautiful woman between noble pillar hung voluminous drapery of darkly red velvet magnificently embroidered with fantastic design in tarnished gold thread curiously enough apartment have window in ceiling at side so took place within must not be seen save through curtained archway in centre of white marble floor stood low heavy table richly gilt covered with remains of splendid feast gorgeousness of vessel thereon be truly marvellous consisting a did of elaborately chased silver epergne filled with brilliantly coloured fruit many branched candelabra of gold bearing slender wax taper to illuminate apartment gracefully carved jug of wonderful design must have emanated from brain of cellini strangely shaped antique goblet put in mind of sacramental cup used in italian church at celebration of mass voluptuous scent of sandalwood pervaded heavy atmosphere of chamber gold silver crystal shone in mellow light of myriad taper whole appearance of sensuous banquet be like of former age presided over by can grande splendour loving csar borgia thought be in dreamland more so when saw bizarre costume worn by two occupant of room one be lady have followed from graveyard who having thrown off heavy cloak now appeared in white silk dress of antique cut richly embroidered with gold round slender neck wore old fashioned necklace of superb ruby set in silver flashed forth crimson flame with heave of snowy bosom while string of soft shining pearl be twisted in magnificent red hair eastern girdle of gold fretwork encircled waist broad gold bracelet radiant with gem clasped milk white arm profusion of jewel wore scintillated with motion throwing out spark of many coloured fire looked like one of proud dame of venice who smile so haughtily in picture of titian face oh heaven what beautiful cruel relentless face tigerish look in splendid eye wicked laugh of full red lip be truly woman fiend sent upon earth to lure men to hell by fascination of evil beauty if woman be curiously dressed for modern day companion handsome young man of seven twenty be still more so a wore doublet of pale blue velvet slashed with white satin diapered with gold embroidery small ruff round neck high riding boot of black leather reaching to thigh with gilt spur short mantle of azure silk drooped gracefully from shoulder have rapier at girdle hung small poniard handle of be thickly encrusted with gem on velvet covered chair beside lay large cloak small mask of black velvet rubbed eye pinched to see if be really awake for whole fantastic scene looked like one of have doubtless taken place at verona in opulent day of splendour be mad asleep intoxicated thought a looked at boccaccian feast at boccaccian lover what doe mean must be phantom of lucrezia borgia who have risen from tomb to meet one of dead lover renew for time joy of past oh be mad asleep will wake up find be dream fantasy of brain created by delirium of fever between lover lay broken mandolin woman pointing to talked volubly while young man stood listening with scornful smile on lip not being very good italian scholar must not follow rapid talk without great difficulty from what must gather seemed to that phantom of lucrezia borgia be accusing lover of infidelity at length when seemed exhausted caught up mantle mask a if about to go fell prostrate before seemed to implore to stay shook head then springing to foot in anger snatched poniard from belt tried to strike young man warded off thrust with left arm round be wrapped heavy black cloak whereupon let dagger fall began to beseech again must not understand meaning of terrible dumb show more than must curious dress antique chamber deserted palace be phantasmagoria of dream seen by soft light of taper brain being quite upset by strange event of night entirely forgot nineteenth century seemed to live to breathe to tremble on threshold of one of fatal chamber wherein medici scaligers borgia feasted loved betrayed slew friend lover enemy woman evidently seeing be useless stopped beseeching young man upon picked up dagger throwing fold of cloak over right shoulder advanced towards door without saying good bye to lady withdrew quickly fearful of discovery when just a hand be on curtain voice sounded once more slow deliberate so be able to understand what said so leave for ever yes replied with same deliberation for ever then before go let drink to future happiness with pleasure madame appeared to hesitate at first after saying word heard move away from curtain upon looked again saw standing by chair while woman with face turned away be filling goblet with wine back be towards so that must not see what be doing must perceive least action filled two goblet with wine then taking something from breast dropped into one of turning round with smile presented cup to flashed across that be trying to poison lover must have called out to warn extreme peril of position terrible appearance of woman uselessness of interference kept silent during supreme moment young man took cup gave drained with bow while simply touched lip with other goblet smiled again to future happiness said in significant voice set goblet down on table talked together after reconciliation for time seemed better friend than before saw that woman kept furtively glancing at face with wicked smile on lip at length handed mask evidently did not belong to after kissing hand be about to turn in direction of archway when suddenly grew pale put hand to head quickly grasped chair near stood to keep from falling why what be cried in hoarse strained voice gran dio what doe mean bent forward with wicked laugh ruby flashed forth venomous red flame in soft light mean that have betrayed have revenged looked at with dazed expression made step forward a if to kill terrible woman who dangling

forward denounce demon in woman shape who have so vilely perpetrated cold blooded murder overcome with horror reeled away from curtain fell fell into arm of one who held with powerful grip gasped with alarm be about to call out when felt handkerchief dashed suddenly over face wet with liquid in spite of struggle be held firmly there gradually felt sens leave until knew more when came to myself be early morning be seated on stone bench in piazza vittoria emanuele surrounded by group of curious onlooker where be asked in english one answered repeated question in italian upon fat woman spoke up signor be in piazza vittoria said in husky voice found here when came first palace woman poison said stupidly for head be aching terribly peasant looked at one with meaning smile shook head saw that thought have be drinking so giving piece of money to fat woman who have spoken took way at once to hotel reached in state of bewilderment better imagined than described chapter iii feast of ghost be dream common sense said yes bruise said certainly whole affair be most remarkable quite out of ordinary kind of event take place in prosaic nineteenth century have done with romantic episode in hero heroine of boccaccio le sage m duma pre take part in searching light of press lantern be nowadays turned on thing on men be impossible to encounter strange event of middle age judging from experience of previous night have be entangled in terrible intrigue might have taken place under henri trois lorenzo di medici yet a past can never become present whole affair be manifest anachronism be inclined to think have be sport of italian puck a there be fairy nowadays idea be absurd so only feasible explanation of bizarre occurrence be that have be dreaming have certainly gone to old burial ground have seen phantom of lucrezia borgia emerge from old veronese tomb a certainly have followed to piazza vittoria emanuele here without doubt reality ended fiction began evidently have sat down upon stone bench where be discovered by peasant have there fallen asleep to undergo extravagant adventure in vision of night in sleep have dreamed dream after fashion of athenian lover in shakespeare comedy antique chamber quaint costume phantom character have be idle vision of brain have played several part in medival phantasmagoria to put entirely to one side impossibility of living people dressing in rococo costume in order to play fantastic comedy tragedy in deserted place if have really seen imagined how did find in piazza vittoria emanuele at daybreak visionary pursuit of lady of sepulchre have be long one certainly must not have walked back such distance to piazza without knowing something about memory ceased at fainting at door of fatal chamber revived on finding on stone bench in piazza therefore granting that whole adventure have actually occurred how have be taken from deserted palace to piazza idling over midday meal at hotel d'este thought of extraordinary series of event in have taken part kept puzzling brain a to whether have really occurred whether have be victim of grotesque nightmare have received letter from maestro angello saying must not give usual lesson therefore determined to devote whole day be thus at disposal to finding out truth falsehood of mysterious adventure bruise be very painful doctored a best must so that without much difficulty be able to walk doubtless have received bruise whilst pursuing unknown from graveyard to piazza vittoria emanuele thus far be certain of actuality of adventure with idea in head made up mind to go to old graveyard discover if possible who be buried in tomb from ghoul have emerged by finding out name might possibly ascertain that of lady a there must certainly have be connection between person buried in mysterious vault sooner have thus sketched out plan of action than put at once into execution a found difficulty in walking sent for peppino fiacre in order to drive to cemetery peppino be merry little florentine whose service employed for two reason one being that spoke excellent italian so understood easier than did general run of northern italian who usually gabble vile patois englishman can understand without constant practice acquaintance with modern latin tongue be not sufficient to warrant indulging in liberty with other reason be that peppino having lived long time in verona knew town thoroughly must be able to tell better than one if deserted palace a have dreamed of really existed besides be also very amusing companion fiacre duly arrived on going outside found peppino grinning like small black monkey a held door open for to enter dio said peppino in commiserating tone seeing how leaned on stick be signor not well oh yes quite well peppino only fell yesterday hurt so see have to get to drive to day bene replied peppino philosophically mounting box ill of one be good of to where signore to cemetery near porto vittoria new old one signore old cemetery peppino cast queer look at over shoulder muttering something about mad english drove away towards via pallone a be on box seat fiacre made good deal of noise going over rugged stone pavement in addition to incessant jingling of bell must not question a desired to do so making up mind to wait until arrived at graveyard leaned back in carriage gave up to own thought then curious thing occurred made certain that event of previous night have actually taken place for without least effort of memory on part strange melody sung by young man in palace came into head must not possibly have dreamed that must not possibly have composed air so concluded that have really heard song having excellent musical ear have impressed on memory of course did not recollect word only tune thinking might prove useful a link in chain of circumstance hummed over twice thrice so a to keep in mind therefore concluded from piece of evidence have actually be to deserted palace witnessed that strange feast if so how have found at dawn in piazza vittoria emanuele be use puzzling brain more over mysterious affair so wisest plan must be to wait until found out name on tomb then perhaps peppino must be able to tell about palace in case with two fact to go on might hope to discover meaning of extraordinary event meanwhile fiacre have left via pallone crossed over ponte aleardi be now being driven rapidly along left bank of adige past campo marzo speedily arrived at old burial ground peppino stopping horse near gate assisted to alight from carriage peppino said when be done tie horse up somewhere come with into cemetery diamine replied peppino crossing with superstitious reverence like not field of dead be broad daylight coward besides wish to tell about tomb why doe not signor go to

soon found in old hiding place peppino looked at with considerable curiosity a must not conceive object in coming to dreary locality ultimately shrugging shoulder put down to freak on part of mad englishman waited for to speak tomb looked scarcely le forbidding gloomy in daytime than did at night with massive looking architecture stern faced angel guarding iron door advancing through long grass grew round looked where for name must find none then tried to open iron door to great dismay of peppino signore said in faltering voice let out ghost there be ghost here peppino have departed replied finding door locked dio be not so sure of illustrious many dead be in there oh have be dead so long that ghost must have grown weary of gloomy sepulchre yes signore ghost of mad count buried

seeing be in earnest tried to think of name evidently must not recall signore have memory of beppo who forgot mother who bore name will be here illustrious for certain see if can find peppino replied sitting down on stone near iron door be anxious to know to whom tomb belongs peppino being more conversant with italian tomb than went to look for name in wonderfully short space of time came back with satisfied smile on face signore tomb be that of morone morone yes signore be great family of verona a great a cursed medici of beautiful florence count who died last year be descendant dio

value bitterly regretted that stiff knee kept confined to house everything however be for best before saw palazzo morone fresh light be thrown upon event of night in most unexpected manner after one day of enforced idleness be fully determined to seek conclusion of adventure next when on following morning received note from maestro angello asking to be sure come to lesson a maestro be always annoyed at non appearance of pupil judged wise to go arranged with peppino to search for palazzo morone in afternoon lesson must only last hour must thus have plenty of time to carry out intention a peppino knowing palazzo must be able to take there direct felt much better second day after adventure a pain have quite left knee so having thus arranged plan for afternoon started in very contented frame of mind for casa angello be dreary day for there be dreary day even in italy at interval there fell heavy shower made feel somewhat depressed pedestrian be hurrying along with large umbrella of gamp specie red being prevailing colour what with sloppy street gloomy house absence of chattering italian populace whole place looked infinitely melancholy so in order to keep up spirit hummed weird air have heard in palazzo morone maestro angello lived in narrow street more like drain than anything else entered into damp courtyard through dismal little tunnel barred by iron gate portinaia who lived in glass fronted room a if be unique specimen of human race preserved in case nodded head to intimate that maestro be at home so climbed up evil smelling stone stair went up side of courtyard soon arrived at angello door ringing little bell tinkled in most irritating manner be admitted into dingy ante chamber by petronella short fat good natured woman who managed whole household made great deal of noise over doing so be dressed in untidy print gown with bright red shawl over shoulder wore wooden clog clattered noisily on terra cotta floor plenteous hair be roughly twisted into knot stuck through with large brass pin gave spiky appearance about head curious apparition saluted with jolly smile in gruff voice with usual familiarity of italian servant sta bene signore ah maestro povero maestro what be matter with petronella eh signore can not live much longer a angello be considerably over eighty year of age thought highly probable be about to condole with petronella over illness when saved trouble of reply by bursting out into long speech delivered with much dramatic effect be nothing trouble signore such fine young man piccola loved so will surely place maestro among saint four mass for soul signore priest be such thief said 'no lesson ' maestro be mule for having own way let teach say will divert mind there signore go in with always thought must come four time heard cock crowing bad sign a saint peter knew there there madonna aid not understanding in least what petronella be talking about allowed to be pushed mechanically into inner room in state of bewilderment maestro seated in usual chair be waiting for granddaughter bianca who assisted in lesson be looking out of window at falling rain atmosphere of sadness seemed to pervade dull grey room a bianca advanced to meet saw that eye be red with cry while old angello stared at in listless indifferent manner being so old a to be past sympathetic feeling be mere mummy old man who have be celebrated a teacher of singing in day of pasta malibran faint shadow of former self only kept alive by mechanical exercise of art yet in spite of great age ear be wonderfully keen true sense of hearing from continuous cultivation being only one have survived wreck of faculty with assistance of bianca be still enabled to teach wonderful system in intelligible manner many of pupil have be european celebrity on operatic stage during past fifty year room in milan be crowded with souvenir of famous artist of undying fame child with exception of bianca grandchild be dead friend acquaintance generation knew have passed away nestor of lyrical art still survived alone sad amid ruin of past white haired wrinkled blear eyed silent sat daily in great armchair taking little notice of life around save to ask childish question talk about dead gone singer whose fame have once filled world place baton in hand strike piano lift voice apparent corpse awoke to life beat time corrected least false note explained necessary instruction in faltering voice during lesson bore at least semblance of life when be finished baton fell from withered hand a relapsed into former apathy one must have thought that must have be glad to rest in old age such be love for art that insisted upon teaching still be alone kept alive granddaughter bianca trained in family tradition be enabled to interpret word a system of singing be unique in spite of apparent uselessness have many pupil bianca be charming italian girl of twenty more like graceful white lily in appearance than anything else so fragile so delicate so pallid did seem mournful eye dark soft a of gazelle seemed too large for pale oval face figure small slender always put in mind of of fairy indeed in sport sometimes called fairy of midnight after poet fancy haunted brain for strength seemed to have gone into glorious mass of raven black hair coiled so smoothly round small head portraiture seems to give idea that bianca be melancholy young person yet such be not case for have seen a gay a bird on bright day when received letter from lover yes have lover to whom be engaged to be married curiously enough knew nothing about lover not being intimate enough with bianca to be confidant of tender little secret unknown lover be always away in other part of italy when did visit bianca be during absence so used to joke with signorina about visionary being with one delicate finger on lip arch smile of glee must tell that never mentioned name that have actual existence day must see in person at verona well here be verona here be bianca lover have not appeared so must have jestingly asked fairy of midnight reason of absence have not real grief expressed on face deterred signorina be in trouble yes yes signore great trouble can not help one can help perhaps signore be useless come must have lesson at once maestro be dull to day need amusement so come lesson be very cruel of to make joke of lesson signorina bianca made reply to jesting remark heaving little sigh placed ivory baton in hand of maestro sat down at piano mummy finding service required woke up have little conversation with before beginning lesson eh signor inglse croaked being name for london be dark have fearful prejudice against london have once visited at foggy season always made above remark to english pupil one ever thought of contradicting yes yes said nodding old head like chinese mandarin london be always dark yes maestro have not be working indeed have maestro come then signor inglse will see lesson commenced oh lesson what agony suffered during trying to attain impossible to how many fit of despair have given way in failing time after time to manage breathing be breathing deep drawing in slow letting out exercise of internal muscle of have never heard even name weariness of incessantly practising note in still small voice hardly audible be enough to discourage most persevering of female pupil believe cried with vexation when not able to do what be required by severe maestro who denied existence of word impossible in connection with singing not being woman be reduced to swearing certainly relieved feeling after battle with particularly aggravating exercise even now when be successful in art often turn cold a think of apparently insurmountable obstacle have to overcome with painful memory there be mixed at same time kindly thought of noble old maestro so patient so courteous so painstaking whose devotion to art be so great who be so severe on least fault so encouraging of least success in conquering difficulty well lesson went on slowly with frequent interruption from maestro who be satisfied with nothing le than perfection breathed according to direction sang ah eh ee in tiny tiny voice until at end of hour be glad to sit down rest before departing felt tired out felt hungry a weather be bad felt cross at same time felt curious to know what be matter with maestro having remarked encouragingly have voice of goose must never sing in la scala relapsed into silence evidently thinking of colezione be being prepared in kitchen with trouble judging from raised tone of petronella voice a bianca still sat at piano striking random chord there be nothing for to do to take departure be not prepared to tell trouble indeed have reason to do so feeling anxious to aid poor child if must ventured to speak to on subject chapter v lost while be wondering be best way to approach somewhat delicate matter door be flung open to fullest extent petronella stalked majestically into room there be wrathful look on strongly marked feature bianca trembled in expectation of storm maestro be terribly afraid of petronella who ruled household looked after a must couple of child so now that frowned acted like child be cowed by eagle eye petronella surveyed three of grimly being satisfied that entrance have produced effect spoke with dramatic gesture rachel might have envied be enraged to day let one speak to neither maestro bianca seemed inclined to accept tread on tail of coat challenge so petronella looked from one to other to see on whom must pour out vial of wrath ultimately chose bianca ah be signorina be who enrage for why ask holy saint ask why because sit there like statue in duoma will bring back say signora let bad young man go ecco guiseppe be not bad young man cried bianca rising angrily to foot be older than be piccola have be married like be then let speak child that be men be bad ask signor there men be bad petronella made comprehensive sweep of arm so a to indicate whole masculine portion of human race seeing opportunity of finding out what be matter did not attempt to defend masculine depravity in way artfully asked question can hardly say know what be talking about eh have signore ear speak of guiseppe pallanza what tenor at teatro ezzelino yes signore be engaged one of signorina here enough enough petronella cried bianca face flushing trouble signor with chattering oh be trouble replied quickly perhaps can help signorina if require help eh eh assented petronella approvingly english have long head piccola tell will find out what others can not find out maestro colezione be ready tenderly led old man into next room be thus left alone with bianca who have retreated to window where stood twisting handkerchief with nervous confusion tell signorina if must rather not said gently ah signore if thought must be friend certainly will be friend maestro be so old petronella be so foolish know none in verona can hing for poor guiseppe lover signorina yes promised must see at verona now ah now perhaps have heard singing at ezzelino have not be to opera since arrival here what be matter with be ill know not know not be lost lost yes signore guiseppe have disappeared one know where be must there be connection between disappearance of guiseppe death of young man have seen in fatal chamber thought flashed across a spoke dismissed a idle want one to look for signor pallanza yes yes well will undertake task signore cried joyfully will search for certainly signorina promised to be friend now sit down tell about lover disappearance may be able to do more for than think fact be that by subtle instinct connected disappearance of young man with curious event of two night before leading bianca to seat prepared to listen attentively to recital signore began in flute like voice have be engaged to marry guiseppe pallanza for month be pupil of maestro loved other when first met ah signore be poor then must not marry now be rich famous yes have heard of tenor pallanza have never seen on stage have voice of god signore at la scala two season ago signore be talk of whole city paper called new mario be so handsome like angel after la scala went to florence to naples then to rome where sang in 'faust ' at apollo then came on here week ago for season at ezzelino now be lost dio how unhappy be covered face with hand wept quietly for few minute impatient a be to hear particular of affair did not dare to disturb grief after time dried tear went on again came to verona on saturday signore be so happy together talking about marriage on monday sang in 'faust at ezzelino went to theatre with petronella be last time saw oh then disappeared on monday night asked quickly feeling heart begin to beat rapidly with excitement for be on monday night extraordinary adventure have taken place yes signore be to come opera to tell maestro how have sung know how anxious maestro be over pupil never came next day so morning went to ask at ezzelino told have disappeared be curious never heard of disappearance of popular tenor be not common thing signore sang on monday be to sing again to night so nothing be thought about not coming to theatre yesterday morning sent to lodging to find that have not be there since left ezzelino after opera on paper will be full of to night ah will not bring back said poor little bianca in melancholy tone shaking small head drooped like faded flower be now certain that adventure on monday night have something to do with disappearance of guiseppe pallanza doubtless young man have seen in deserted palace be missing tenor antique dress amorous rendezvous needed explanation be in love with one signorina be cruel necessary question angered bianca who threw back little head with great haughtiness signore loved one else have reason for disappearing signore forgive if appear rude said in deprecating tone indeed signorina to find out must know well signore be telling replied petulantly be most strange going away from theatre how so left ezzelino in stage dress ah jumped to foot in state of uncontrollable excitement for saw at once be on right track antique dress be explained now be dress wore in last act of faust surely signorina be very extraordinary said pausing in walk one must walk street of verona in dress like can explain that signore when guiseppe came from rome friend came with who be very ill baritone singer who be in same company at apollo be told at ezzelino just before last act of opera guiseppe received note saying that friend be dying so a soon a curtain fell threw on cloak hid dress went away a quickly a possible so a to see friend before died oh be friend dead yet know signore story of dying friend might be true yet to seemed highly improbable guessed that people at theatre have told fiction to pacify fear of signorina angello to whom knew that pallanza be engaged real truth of matter be doubtless that letter came from woman have followed asking to meet at deserted palazzo morone have gone there innocently enough to be poisoned a have seen explained great deal did not explain why meeting must have taken place at extraordinary spot why woman must have come from burial ground to keep appointment taking circumstance into consideration be certain that be pallanza have seen murdered on monday night in order to be quite sure of identity asked bianca if have photograph of betrothed of surety signore replied going to album on table brought cabinet portrait be guiseppe a faust dress in left theatre be a surmised portrait be coloured saw exact representation of young man have beheld at palazzo morone typical italian face with black curly hair dark eye small moustache sallow skin slender figure arrayed in doublet of blue velvet slashed with white satin azure silk cloak poniard high riding boot nothing be wanting successful tenor of portrait be man who have taken poison from hand of lady of sepulchre still be use telling bianca of suspicion until have discovered whole secret besides a guiseppe be dead naturally shrank from being bearer of such bad news suppose face betrayed thought for saw signorina watching anxiously so to lull fancy might have made first remark came into head never saw faust in riding boot before ah signore replied girl with fond look guiseppe be artist a well a singer designed own dress said that a faust in last act be going to fly with marguerite mephistopheles speaks of horse waiting be natural that must wear riding dress explanation be quite satisfactory having thus learned identity of young man whom have seen murdered prepared to go when idea entered head going over to piano began to play by ear strange air have heard at palazzo morone bianca gave cry of surprise a heard melody came over to piano with puzzled look on face ah know signorina said turning round quickly yes in fact gave to guiseppe be old air by palestrina found among music of maestro to guiseppe set word be very fond of sings great deal ah signore must have heard sing for one else have copy turned off matter with careless remark not caring to tell bianca where have heard now being quite certain must be able to unravel whole mystery wanted to get away a quickly a possible in order to arrange plan addio signorina said giving hand when see again may be able to give news good news yes hope so signorina replied hurriedly a petronella appeared at door anticipate evil beg of have doubt guiseppe be quite well oh hope so trust so addio signor hugo will come back soon to morrow signorina ah see have brought back smile said petronella gruff voice a ushered out what do think of evil one going away signore be going to have four mass if be dead priest be such thief ecco why must think be dead petronella eh signore love piccola so much that nothing death must keep away except know what must say signore except woman well maybe men be bad have be married signore know know well think be particularly bad petronella eh then be not true man signore retorted petronella closing argument door at same time chapter vi haunted palace need hardly say be very much excited over strange discovery have made a there now appeared to be reasonable chance of clearing up mystery of palazzo morone have discovered name of unhappy young man gave most important clue to reading of enigma have yet to find out name of lady who have behaved in such extraordinary manner committed so daring crime after hearing peppino story fancied that might perchance be contessa morone have later on dismissed idea a idle seeing that have be absent from verona for many month now that bianca have told that pallanza have come straight from rome began to suspect have be right in surmise according to peppino contessa have taken up residence at italian capital so what be more likely than have fallen in love with guiseppe while be singing at teatro apollo following to verona have killed by mean of poison in revenge for determination to leave so far everything be feasible enough two point of affair perplexed very much one being choosing of deserted palace a place of meeting other visit to burial ground by woman live in time of borgia when noble lady can thus rid of lover with impunity else might have believed that phantom of donna lucrezia have gone to old veronese cemetery to select grave for unfortunate young man intended to murder to think thus however be foolish although guessed that have used old palace of family a safe place for lover meeting seeing gruesome reputation secured from public curiosity yet be quite unable to explain cemetery mystery one thing however appeared to to be certain that guiseppe pallanza have be carrying on intrigue with contessa presuming ghoul to be that have gone to palazzo morone on night in question at request a to sick friend now greatly mistrusted that sick friend story so many fast young englishman whom knew have adopted same lie to cover little peccadillo be quite sure pallanza have employed same fiction to prevent scandal of intrigue with unknown woman from reaching ear of fiance bianca be very proud girl felt certain from what little have seen of character that if discovered guiseppe be playing false must at once break off engagement at cost like italian woman when loved loved with whole soul expected same single hearted return to passion so that discovery of lover infidelity must only be punished sufficiently according to idea by everlasting parting between pallanza knew therefore tried to hide guilt by plausible story of dying friend appeared to to be such remarkably weak fabrication that before going to palazzo morone determined to find out if mythical invalid existed curiously enough although be studying for musical profession be devoted to operatic performance have not be to teatro ezzelino since arrival at verona preferring to wander about street of romantic old city in moonlight to sitting night after night in stifling atmosphere of heat glare noise made up mind however to go on special night in hope might hear talk about pallanza disappearance be guided thereby in future movement meantime went to theatre in afternoon introducing to impresario a friend of guiseppe asked if have heard news of missing tenor impresario dingy old man of doubtful cleanliness be in despair raged against absent pallanza like garrick of gutter have heard nothing of birbnte ladrone who have thus disappeared left honest impresario in lurch faust be success of season without pallanza there must be faust season must be failure what be to do cospetto be luck of devil why have scellerato run away sick friend bah there be sick friend be woman who have enticed away pazzo dying friend from rome be not very likely story lie large magnificent lie here be basso of company who have be singing with pallanza at apollo ask truth be on lip behold good man signor basso profundo advanced though truth might have be on lip certainly be not apparent on face for more deceitful countenance never beheld however have doubt spoke truth on occasion a there be money to be made by telling lie confirmed word of wrathful impresario sick friend be myth in rome pallanza have be friendly with lady per bacco great lady name be unknown to appeared that signor basso profundo dressed in same room a pallanza be just before last act of faust guiseppe received note told basso profundo that be from dying friend have departed quickly when opera be ended in stage dress with cloak wrapped round basso profundo be sure note be from lady impresario be also sure devoted lady in question to infernal god with richness of expression have never heard equalled in language having thus found out what suspected from first that dying friend be mere invention to cloak intrigue left impresario to tear hair call guiseppe name in company with signor basso profundo went back to hotel where found peppino waiting with fiacre to drive to palazzo morone be still unwilling to take to place of evil reputation made one last effort to shake determination by gruesome story of people who have gone into palazzo never came out again laughed at hobgoblin romance getting into fiacre told to drive off at once did after crossing twice so a to secure own safety must ghost of palazzo morone take fancy to carry off a heretic speedily left broad modern street rattled down gloomy medival passage humid atmosphere of chilled to bone in spite of heat of day fiacre with jingling bell bumped on uneven stone turned abruptly round unexpected corner corkscrewed between narrow wall crept under low archway after innumerable dodging twisting hairbreadth escape from upsettings perilous balancing on edge of drain at length emerged into queer little piazza at end of saw great faade of richly decorated palace have beheld in moonlight of two night before have be ardent student of baedeker since arrival in italy from fortified appearance of palazzo judged that have be built by michelo sammicheli who according to guide book be greatest military architect of middle age building be four story high with long line of narrow window closely barred by curiously ornamented iron cage bulged outward a protection against thief enemy whole front be adorned with almost obliterated painting after style of genoese palace in addition to brush chisel have done work wreath of flower grinning mask nude figure of boy girl elaborate crest armorial device with fish bird triton shell fruit be sculptured round window along fortified castellated top over great portal square in front of splendid specimen of renaissance art be overgrown with grass house on side be also deserted what with broken window empty piazza closed door everything have melancholy desolate appearance a if curse rested upon whole neighbourhood peppino evidently be of opinion for although be broad daylight hot sunlight poured down on grass grown square yet kept muttering prayer in low voice if by chance looked towards palazza always crossed with great devoutness be not however going to be baulked of intention by superstitious feeling on part of italian cab driver so ordered peppino to tie up horse come with into palace modest request however so horrified peppino that absolutely squeaked with horror like rabbit caught in snare signore whimpered touching relic on breast dio not to be king of italy must go into house if be wise signore look come away lest evil befall cospetto signore remember frate think of madonna matilda what about madonna matilda peppino eh illustrious do not know be friend of holiness at canossa though woman wanted to celebrate mass il cristo burnt to ash with fire from above died ecco cospetto signore be foolish to meddle with holy thing well ca call palace holy peppino illustrious be accursed replied italian crossing there be fire below a well a above be heretic mean that have better beware of devil eh peppino well well be not afraid so will enter palace if see carried off by ghost can tell carabinieri dio illustrious jest if will go must go will wait here pray for soul peppino be a obstinate a mule in fear of ghost so leaving to smoke long italian cigar watch brown lizard scuttling over hot stone in sunshine advanced towards palace with determination to find out secret chamber a knew must be dark therein owing to want of window have taken precaution to provide with candle box of match feeling that be safe in pocket went to iron gate entered courtyard in same way a have done on night time however examined ironwork found to surprise that missing bar have be half filed through then wrenched away mark left be quite fresh have be done so recently that bar have not have time to grow rusty discovery astonished not little a did not see reason of entrance being made if be contessa who used palace must have key of side door must thus admit lover at pleasure while breach must only have be made by one who must not enter in other way thought of person into whose arm have fallen person who have placed handkerchief wet with liquid over face although according to peppino story watcher at door be phantom of count mastino morone yet dismissing such explanation a due to superstition began to think that person have followed lady of sepulchre besides yes there must be doubt about third person have tracked to palazzo unable to enter in ordinary way have filed through broken iron bar in gate gaining access to interior of palazzo in way unknown have penetrated to secret chamber doubtless have witnessed same strange scene a have done presence have be discovered to preserve for unknown reason secret of terrible chamber have be seized rendered insensible by chloroform taken to piazza vittorio emanuele so must be unable to re discover palazzo morone thought flashed through brain with rapidity of lightning wondered whom unknown must be friend of pallanza accomplice of contessa did not know what to think so leaving such conjecture to more seasonable time crossed over dreary courtyard entered great hall be magnificent entrance when thronged with courtier men at arm page lady must have presented noble appearance of enormous size high wall lofty roof be painted with glowing fresco representing ancient glory of republic floor be brilliant with gorgeous mosaic of coat of arm fantastic figure painted window on side of huge portal blazed with variegated tint bright sun streaming in through glass a many coloured a joseph coat dyed floor with vivid light gaudy hue ancient tapestry hung here there between two line of black marble column running down side of hall wind stealing in through open door shook grey dust from mouldering splendour of loom at end of immense vestibule arose broad staircase of white marble with balustrade of elaborate bronze fretwork from first landing two other flight sloped off to right left of main branch air be filled with floating shadow soft wind moved hanging without sound be alone in deserted hall over brooded intense silence made shiver in chill atmosphere pervading abode of desolation however afternoon be passing quickly a have plenty to do before rapidly ascended willow stair turning to right be way unknown lady have taken other night soon found in long corridor with window looking out on to courtyard many of be broken others be quite whole colour a bright glowing a when have first be placed there at end of corridor turned to left found short flight of willow step however led up into darkness so that before ascending have to light candle luckily there be draught for air be absolutely still flame of candle burned clear steadily up step went entered short corridor paused before heavy door gave admission into ante chamber of fatal room realizing what have taken place inside on fatal night dreaded to enter lest must find corpse of unfortunate pallanza on floor overcoming emotion with strong effort thrust open door entered tapestried chamber presented exactly same appearance with small table in centre burnt out torch lying on floor at end rich fold of gold worked curtain veiling entrance to inner apartment stood on threshold half expecting to hear shrill note of mandolin passionate song ring through silence be still mute a if be indeed tomb of dead expected to find at last with thrill of dread parted heavy curtain found in circular chamber faint light of candle just hollowed out gulf in cimmerian darkness saw dim glitter of gold silver on table ghastly glimmer of white cloth spark of weak fire flashing from tarnished gold embroidery of curtain be a have seen eight white pillar dull red hanging with arabesque pattern of golden thread gilt table massive metal goblet silver candelabra even half eaten fruit with everything on table in disorder somewhat to relief found nothing else dead body have seen lying at foot of terrible woman have vanished although searched over inch of chamber must find trace of fearful crime have be committed demon who have enticed unhappy young man to ruin have completed evil work by secreting body began to think that trace of guiseppe pallanza have disappeared from earth for evermore who be woman who in room have so wickedly slain lover who be man felt sure be man who have seized at door borne insensible from palace must answer of question have not be for story of bianca for disappearance of pallanza must have fancied whole hideous dream nightmare of medieval devilry have filled brain with phantasmagoria of delirium everything however be too real too terrible to admit of such explanation so a must discover nothing more from examining chamber prepared to leave atmosphere yet have faint aroma of sandalwood perfume emanated from unknown woman at foot still lay broken mandolin rich wine cup still glittered in dim light no longer wondered at such wealth being left here undefended for superstition more of safeguard than bolt bar protected cave of aladdin from thievish italian finger even if thief have known of rich doubt whether must have have courage to dare unseen horror of palazzo for standing there in perfumed atmosphere with light just showing intense gloom dim glitter of gold silver absolute stillness horrible memory of chamber felt a though be in presence of dead at table sat phantom of donna renata lover smiling at one with hatred in ghostly heart at door watched evil face of outraged husband awaiting consummation of tragedy in imagination must see wicked smile of woman scowl of husband loathing look on face of lover breath coming quick fast made flame of candle flicker flare until overcome by horror of room by working of imagination turned fled fled from evil gloom from blood stained splendour out into blessed sunshine pure air of heaven dio cried peppino a walked quickly out into square how pale be illustrious eh signore have ghost have seen ghost peppino have felt presence cospetto did not warn signore against accursed place come illustrious jump in will leave abode of devil very well peppino replied entering fiacre drive slowly a want to know way to palazzo dio signore will not come again yes be coming night month saint signore be mad lost muttered peppino with pale face then hastily gathering up rein drove rapidly away from lonely square leaving gruesome palace to night to feast of ghost chapter vii at teatro ezzelino from mother have inherited one of highly strung organization be largely affected by surroundings like olian harp to sighing wind vibrate with breath of passion pass over organization take colour bias desire from last event occurs be entirely in sympathy with predominating feeling of moment in childhood dangerous spirit of mood fancy have be fostered by old scottish nurse who used to thrill with wild story of highland superstition with weird ballad of elfish fantasy since have mixed in world have learned to control sway imaginative faculty have thus acquired command over a said before superstition be in one wax wane according to surroundings so terror of childish tale have be half forgotten in bustle of worldly life now came upon soul with full force in haunted city of verona burial ground ghostly room accursed palace phantom of evil seeming peopled chamber of brain with unreal horror until became so nervous unstrung that sudden noise unexpected sound shadowy comer made thrill with supernatural fear a if be again child listening to tale of devildom knew mood be bad one must have sought cheerful society to drive away evil spirit have known where to seek there be english at hotel in present state of affair casa angello be not particularly cheerful so a did not care about spending lonely evening methought of intention to go to teatro ezzelino on glancing at paper saw that opera for night be lucrezia borgia name gave renewed sensation of horror lady of sepulchre have taken in imagination semblance of ferrara duchess memory of terrible daughter of pope alexander seemed never to leave have come from graveyard have supped in fatal chamber have murdered lover now when have vanished into thin air be to see represented on stage in magnificent wickedness have good mind not to go seeing that there be ballet after opera thought must brave phantom of brain find in lightness of dancing antidote to gloomy terror of lyrical drama cooking at hotel be somewhat better than usual run of italian culinary idea so made excellent dinner drank asti spumati agreeable wine of exhilarating nature felt much better when started for ezzelino be one of perfect italian evening such a one see depicted by glowing brush of turner there yet lingered in quiet evening sky faint purple reflection of sunset glory moon a yet here there burning star throbbing in deep heart of sky under peaceful heaven weather worn red roof grey wall of antique verona mellowed to warm loveliness in twilight shadow beautiful a be however with memory of eerie night still on have desire to renew moonlight wandering so without pausing to admire enchanting scene hastened on to theatre to be in time for first note of donnizetti opera teatro ezzelino be very charming opera house built in light airy fashion with plenty of ventilation thing to be grateful for on hot summer night decoration be white gold so that have delightfully cool appearance nevertheless what with warmth of season without glaring heat of gas within felt unpleasantly hot gallery stall be crowded a be only eight o'clock most of box be empty knew must not be filled until late in evening by who tired of well known music of lucrezia wanted to see new ballet having glanced round theatre bought book of word hired opera glass from obsequious attendant settled comfortably for evening orchestra very excellent one directed by maestro feraldi of milan played prelude in sufficiently good style pictured curtain arose on well known venetian scene have so often beheld chorus in heterogeneous costume of known age wandered about in usual aimless fashion shouted approval of smiling venice in ordinary indifferent style very good contralto who sang orsini having delivered first aria with great dramatic fervour vanished from stage leaving sleeping genaro to be contemplated by lucrezia borgia be disappointed with duchess when arrived must say that majestic evil lady of sepulchre looked far more like regal sister of csar borgia than diminutive singer with big voice who raged round stage like spitfire gave one idea of terrible medusa of ferrara whose smile be death to lover friend alike tenor be long individual lucrezia being so small duet in point of physical appearance be sufficiently ridiculous a sang well together rendering of character artistically speaking be enjoyable chorus entered discovered lucrezia with prima donna defied with look way of cross child there be usual dramatic chorus curtain fell on prologue with slight applause did not go out a felt very comfortable so amused with looking round house when during first act of opera two officer entered theatre took seat in front of mine be two gay young men who talked great deal about one thing in such raised voice must hear said of be not particularly edifying during first act succeeds prologue be comparatively quiet when lucrezia entered in second to sing celebrated duet with alfonso be loud in expression of disapproval concerning appearance music of part of opera be particularly loud noisy even through crash of orchestra must hear expression of disapproval voice be not bad appearance acting oime eh teodoro what must donna lucrezia be not on stage not on stage said teodoro in astonished tone ebbene where be look at box yonder per bacco contessa morone started a heard name looking in same direction a young men saw woman seated far back in shadow of box fourth fifth from stage be talking to three gentleman face be turned away so must not see feature judging from glimpse caught of head bust seemed to be very majestic woman contessa morone be then in verona after discovery removed doubt concerning identity of ghoul be woman who have left vault in burial ground be woman who have slain guiseppe pallanza in secret chamber of deserted palace be woman seated in shadow of box talking idly a though have terrible crime to burden conscience if must only see face must then recognise a if have presentiment of danger persistently looked everywhere in direction a gazed moved slightly bright light of lamp shone on neck saw sudden tongue of red flame flash through semi twilight of box at once reminded of necklace of ruby worn by terrible vampire of graveyard eager to know about woman whom felt sure be murderess of pallanza listened breathlessly to two officer who be still talking about be year since morone died said teodoro lowering opera glass have lived since at rome where met why have returned here eh who know perhaps to reside again at palazzo morone tomb diamine must become ghost to live there ebbene teodoro ghost of lucrezia borgia why doe not marry again who know must like to be husband in spite of money corpo di bacco woman who see in dark like cat evil eye yes everything else be wicked like signora at che peccato might marry money ecco laughed act being ended left seat also went out into corridor for smoke breath of fresh air feeling deeply sorry that interesting conversation have be interrupted from what one of officer have said be evidently nyctalopyst must see in dark accounted at once for unerring way in have threaded dark street be also reason that now remained secluded in shadow of box preferring darkness to light puzzling over thing wondering how must get glimpse of face lighted cigarette strolled about in vestibule of theatre with rest of crowd there be goodly number of civilian of size age complexion while military element be represented by fair sprinkling of officer in picturesque uniform of italian army air be thick with tobacco smoke there be clatter of vivacious voice great door of theatre be thrown wide open to admit fresh night air into overpoweringly hot atmosphere being wrapt up in idea about

by chance thrown in way of finding out if contessa morone have anything to do with burial ground episode that only replied to beltrami chatter by uneasy laugh suffered to be led unresistingly along marchese did not take into box into one of small ante room on opposite side of corridor be used by italian lady a reception saloon for friend when at theatre heard loud chatter of many voice a beltrami opened door there standing under glare of gas lamp with wicked smile on lip pearl in hair ruby necklace round throat saw woman who have come from vault woman who have poisoned pallanza in secret room phantom of lucrezia borgia chapter viii phantom of lucrezia borgia be duly introduced by marchese signora morone received in most amiable manner be certainly very charming woman have not known true character must doubtless have be fascinated by gracious affability in spite of courtesy must hardly speak to without feeling of repulsion beautiful woman so suave so smiling so seductive inspired with sensation of absolute dread one experience at sight of sleek velvet footed pantheress comely beast to admire terrible one to caress replied to polite inquiry in somewhat mechanical fashion doubtless put down to imperfect knowledge of italian for in spite of effort to feel at ease in society yet be unable to do more than behave with strained courtesy towards woman whose mask have torn off whose secret have penetrated wickedness of whose heart knew there be several other gentleman in room who talked gaily with contessa amused by eating bonbon crystallised fruit provided for refreshment last act of opera have not yet commenced so signora morone sank gracefully into velvet cushioned chair permitted courtier to retail news of day for amusement be afraid description sound somewhat hyperbolical indeed be only way in can describe woman whose movement be full of sinuous grace feline treachery cat tigress pantheress a be claw be now sheathed in velvet paw claw be there same must doubtless scratch at least provocation people believe in transmigration be true disciple of pythagoras in bizarre doctrine firmly believe that in former existence soul of giulietta morone have animated body of tawny tigress who have stolen through jungle beneath burning sky of hindostan slaying devouring victim in conformity with instinct of savage nature now be woman fair majestic woman instinct of beast be there desire for slaughter lust for blood what made indulge still more in fancy be colour of dress wore black yellow twisted in out with curious resemblance to sleek fur of beast to have likened soft glimmer of pearl string twined in magnificent red hair seemed out of place a ornament for woman ruby suited nature well red angry ruby shot flash of purple fire from neck at heave of white bosom leaning back in deep chair with cruel smile on full crimson lip glimmer of pearl fire glint of fierce tinted gem bizarre mixture of amber black in dress slowly waved sandalwood fan to fro diffusing strange sleepy perfume through room looking what verily believed to be type of incarnate evil in repose while be thinking in fanciful fashion contessa be talking to friend in slow rich voice beltrami well beltrami be watching closely do know that strange sensation of being watched that uneasy consciousness that unseen eye be observing least movement yes of course do one have felt in more le degree according to nervous susceptibility at present time with sens on alert for unexpected event be therefore little to be wondered at felt magnetism of beltrami gaze on looking up saw keen black eye fixed upon with enigmatical expression for moment be startled immediately that feeling passed away for well knew strange nature of marchese be peculiar mixture of good evil of kindness cruelty of hate love must have proceeded from aberration of subtle intellect beltrami face always put in mind of sinister countenance of sigismondo malatesta sneer so malevolently at curious onlooker from wall of duomo at rimini have same treacherous droop of eyelid same thin nose with wide sensitive nostril same malignant smile on thin lip yet be handsome enough young italian face in spite of friendship repelled in le degree be true still repelled in like manner a did that of contessa morone so be going to marry well be certainly well matched in respect if man have not active wickedness of woman still capability of evil be there must awaken to life when necessary to be exercised beltrami future wife be anachronism in nineteenth century must have lived smiled died in time of renaissance when must have be fitted companion of italian despot of whom machiavelli give typical example in book prince marchese saw inquiring look with enigmatic smile walked across to where be standing in warm yellow light ebbene signor hugo whispered with swift glance at contessa tell what think of choice doe credit marchese will have beautiful wife loving one hope tell mon ami do not envy hesitated moment before replying then blurted out truth honestly speaking signor luigi dame why well can hardly tell reason have nevertheless beltrami looked hard at with inquisitive look in dark eye satirical smile on thin lip be not complimentary friend said turning away with supercilious laugh laid hand on shoulder explained pardon beltrami understand eh apologise understand better than think be evidently not at offended felt puzzled by manner be true have candidly acknowledged that be making marriage for money surely must also love woman whose ripe beauty be so attractive to passionate nature of italian yet judging from mode of speech evidently have mistrust mistrust for must not account must know nothing of affair at palazzo morone so there certainly must be reason for suspicion on part be beautiful woman rich woman attractive woman so with trinity of perfection decidedly merited warmer love than beltrami appeared inclined to give must be that evil beauty repelled a did be impossible seeing according to idea nature be wonderfully alike altogether whole demeanour of marchesa perplexed by strangeness watched narrowly a approached contessa to see if perceived lack of warmth on part of lover to surprise a bent over chair to speak shrank away with gesture of disdain ruby shot forth red flame a if to warn lover that there be danger in pressing upon woman unwelcome attention unwelcome be sure be for a adjusted cloak aided to rise in order to return to box saw that accepted politeness with forced civility cold smile so then did not love have almost openly acknowledged to that did not love yet two people who have feeling of love in heart be about to marry be most extraordinary marvelled greatly at juxtaposition of two human being who evidently hated one heartily at moment contessa spoke of man have murdered be horrified in cold callous tone in veiled iniquity do know gentleman if anything have be heard of lost tenor beltrami shot keen glance at then second at felt more bewildered than ever by strange action nothing have be heard of contessa said quickly before others must speak have vanished altogether doubt will appear again ah think so observed contessa with cruel smile be sure of winced looked at in startled manner upon impelled by mysterious impulse know not what joined in conversation on contrary madame think signor pallanza will ever be seen again present turned round in surprise contessa darted look at seemed to pierce soul only beltrami be unmoved with smile on face laid hand upon shoulder eh signor hugo why do think so mere fancy marchese nothing more ma foi fancy may turn out true be annoyed at having yielded to impulse spoken out a unless told about adventure must not substantiate statement be certainly not going to reveal anything knew particularly in presence of woman so deeply implicated in affair beltrami mocking manner irritated fearfully more so a be so very unaccountable be about to make sharp reply when opening chorus of last act sounded gentleman after making adieu to contessa left room marchese offered arm to madame morone dismissed with haughty gesture one moment marchese wish to speak with signor for few minute beltrami darted one of enigmatic look at with low bow to conceal smile on lip left room a soon a have disappeared madame morone turned round on with quick gesture of surprise signor hugo why did say tenor pallanza must never be seen again have reason signora replied being determined to baffle curiosity merely spoke on impulse of moment do know signor pallanza madame have not pleasure of acquaintance ah heaved sigh of relief looked at long earnestly a if to see whether be speaking truth apparently be satisfied with scrutiny for laughed softly placed hand within arm confess now signor hugo think most mysterious will tell why speak thus heard pallanza at rome when sang at apollo hoped to see again here therefore be annoyed at disappearance anxious for to be found selfish wish signor hugo for be only desire to hear sing again ecco think wish at selfish madame for hear be charming singer oh yes new mario call in milan will not hear rest of opera in box if will excuse madame will say no a have engagement be lie be so fearful of betraying to terrible woman who have evidently half suspicion that knew something of pallanza be anxious to get away a soon a possible saying good night in cold polite manner re entered box be moving away when beltrami suddenly appeared eh hugo how cruel contessa tell must go yes will see again marchese to morrow then if not next day here be card be always at home in afternoon fail to come mon ami wish to speak to about about paused asked curiously about what eh dame forget will tell at next meeting ' rivederci signor hugo forget old friend will quarrel with nodded smiled vanished then took departure from theatre wandered up down street in moonlight felt that to sit out ballet must be more than must bear a be so excited over meeting with contessa morone therefore strolled up down street smoking thinking a time passed on grew calmer thought must return to ezzelino not to see ballet to catch glimpse of contessa once more a reached portico of theatre be just coming down step to carriage leaning on arm of beltrami hidden in crowd must see looking hither thither a if searching for one must not see in order to satisfy in way a to identity with creature of night have seen leave graveyard with sudden inspiration hummed few bar of strange song have heard in fatal chamber being close to must hear quite plainly gave kind of gasping cry a fell back into arm of beltrami just a be helping into carriage what be matter cara asked quickly clutched arm with so powerful grasp that made wince heard mutter with white lip pallanza pallanza be wanted to hear fearful of discovery threaded way quickly among crowd hastened home to hotel have recognised guiseppe have found woman who have slain have yet to discover where have hidden body of victim then well future movement must be guided by circumstance chapter ix fiore della casa did not get much sleep night after excitement of day towards morning fell into uneasy slumber during have fragmentary dream in pallanza contessa antique chamber be mixed up together one moment be at iron door of tomb guardian angel took semblance of signora morone next be kneeling beside corpse of pallanza illuminated by faint light of candle ever saw pallid shade of donna renata pointing towards watchful face of husband filled with ghastly meaning in dim shadow wonder after terrific vision blended real ideal awoke in grey morning light unrefreshed haggard so when waiter brought roll coffee left untouched lying quietly in bed wondered what step be necessary to take next in solving riddle riddle do say no be riddle longer save a to visit of contessa to vault of family for otherwise everything be clear enough have met pallanza at rome have fallen in love with handsome face young man flattered by attention of great lady have yielded readily enough to charm of situation growing tired of intrigue have come to verona where bianca awaited with intention of breaking off with woman of giulietta morone fiery nature sequel can easily be guessed have followed hither having in way forced to come to deserted palace have there poisoned out of revenge for contemplated infidelity of course be theoretical from one thing guessed that must be only feasible way of accounting for whole affair two point however remained to be cleared up before reading of riddle must be successfully accomplished first being reason of burial ground episode second strange disappearance of dead man body in thinking over legend related by peppino one thing struck a peculiar that donna renata have never be seen again after husband entered chamber guessed from that there be secret oubliette alcove in room with concealed entrance in mastino morone have entombed guilty wife a punishment for crime doubtless from tradition from old family paper madame morone knew of secret hiding place having killed pallanza have put body therein so a to destroy evidence of criminality one have seen pallanza enter deserted palace so once body be hidden in secret alcove must remain there for ever undiscovered human being save contessa herself must ever tell what have become of for own sake must remain silent thus guiseppe pallanza fate must remain mystery for evermore fortunately however god who have thus permitted evil woman to conceive carry out crime have also permitted to behold murder so secure a doubt felt of safety yet one word from whole affair must be revealed never thought however of going to veronese police telling what have seen a in suspicion of foreigner must doubtless regard a accessory thus must get into trouble have desire to do therefore determined to once more go to fatal chamber make final effort to discover what have become of body of unfortunate pallanza so far so good now question arose how much of story be to reveal to bianca must not tell whole for if body of lover be discovered poor child must suffer quite enough without additional information of guiseppe infidelity so making virtue of necessity determined upon telling pious lie to do be necessary to leave out contessa morone altogether a least mention of woman name must arose bianca suspicion for contessa substituted robber who have decoyed guiseppe to deserted palace by mean of false letter there ended life of course be somewhat difficult to be consistent in narrative be so anxious to hide cruel truth of pallanza worthlessness from bianca went over story have invented again again until thought have whole pious fraud quite perfect having thus arranged plan arose finished roll coffee then having dressed rapidly set off at once for casa angello a be nearly time for lesson bruise be now quite well yet felt very depressed downcast a state of nervous excitement have be in for last few day have told terribly on system however having once put hand to plough must not with satisfaction to myself turn back although heartily dreaded coming interview with bianca yet be unavoidable a poor child be so anxious over lost lover that be necessary to tell fictitious story without delay in order to set mind at rest on arrival at casa angello found one there bianca who be anxiously awaiting appeared that maestro have taken into head that must like walk in sunshine have gone out under care of petronella a bianca knew be coming to take usual lesson be anxious to hear if have news of lover remained indoors to speak to fior della casa a old petronella tenderly called in poetic language of italian looked even paler than usual dark shadow under dark eye made appear wonderfully large star like have bunch of delicate lily of valley in bosom of white dress looked a pale blanched a frail flower lying back on green covered sofa on be seated reminded of late snowflake resting on emerald grass of early spring at moment might vanish under pale ray of sun be talking together in room in generally have lesson eye wandered from one thing to with vague hesitation a looked everywhere on face of delicate girl to whom have to tell cruel story for soften a might story be cruel must not fail to affect terribly object in apartment photographed on memory with terrible distinctness even after lapse of year by simply closing eye can recall whole scene with utmost truthfulness dull red of terra cotta floor heavy time worn furniture covered with faded green rep small ebony piano with glistening white key alternating with black mirror fronted press in petronella kept everything from food to clothes many photograph of operatic celebrity gaudily painted picture of st paul maestro patron saint encircled by faded wreath of withered laurel leaf dead flower flung to favourite pupil in hour of triumph even view from window can recall with slender campanile tower from whence quarter rang brazen bell then faltering voice of bianca fior della casa stealing like melancholy wind through silence of room signor said twisting thin white hand nervously together have something to tell of guiseppe can see in face be good evil what doe face tell signorina evil evil eye be sad mouth doe not smile oh tell quickly what know be found be ill be dead brought out last word in shrill scream with dilated eye that almost terrified by fear expressed in dreading effect of sudden shock on fragile child hastily replied in negative signorina look so fearful pray be not dead child be sure be not dead then have not found yet have not found think know where be to be found what do mean signor hugo tell tell see be strong can bear wish to know everything note guiseppe pallanza received at ezzelino be not from friend from enemy enemy yes from one who wished ill thinking be from dying friend obeyed letter be lured to deserted palazzo morone know that palazzo signor be stranger in verona know where be signorina for on night be wandering about near when saw pallanza go into alone knowing evil reputation of place followed although be stranger to went to room in palace where enemy met yes yes signor for love of saint go on can tell more signorina except believe guiseppe left that room again believe be there still perhaps held captive by robber who lured thither in hope of obtaining ransom bianca looked at searchingly be simple little thing a rule ridiculous story have manufactured of brigand in heart of verona be too much even for confiding nature made gesture of disbelief be not true be not true cried vehemently why do deceive signor be not deceiving enemy false letter deserted palace held captive oh can not believe if be true why did not rescue because one know seized from behind a watched rendering insensible with chloroform bore away from palace have great difficulty in finding again assure signor story be that of dream can not believe be true nevertheless bianca said nothing tapped little foot on ground with thoughtful frown on small face be glad that task be over for absurd a be story have told be more merciful than truth now have to extent quieted fear by telling that guiseppe be alive thing ala must not be certain of hoped to get away at once to palazzo morone make one last effort to find body if failed there must be nothing left for to do to inform police in interest of bianca be unwilling to do until have exhausted mean of solving mystery suddenly bianca face cleared looked at with steady determination signor know palazzo yes signorina room where think guiseppe be held captive do signorina then take to at once started to foot with deep flush on face threw out hand towards with appealing gesture a for sat still transfixed with astonishment at spirit displayed by gentle girl who be thus willing to dare danger of unknown in order to save lover take to at once repeated quickly signorina can not be mad to think of thing be story true false signor hugo true yes be true then will judge of truth with own eye wait will put on hat will take to palazzo at once signorina not word have made up mind promised to be friend signor hugo hold to promise ecco be gone before must utter further remonstrance during absence reflected rapidly be true that guiseppe be dead that believed body be concealed somewhere in room so perhaps after be best that bianca must come a quick woman wit might succeed where have failed knew nothing about implication of contessa morone in affair palazzo must be quite deserted during daytime so must be able to take there let examine room if by chance truth be revealed that guiseppe be dead must be more merciful way than by lip of stranger yes must take there at once if failed in mission must be wiser than before if succeeded ah how pitied poor child if succeeded in finding out terrible secret of contessa at moment returned trembling with ill suppressed excitement well signor hugo be ready be willing to help with heart signorina come then ran lightly out of room followed with heavy heart for have presentiment of evil feared that fatal chamber held so many impure memory feared discovery of dead feared for child who went forward in ignorance to face such horror chapter x voice in darkness on returning from last visit to palace have carefully noted way thereto so be able to escort signorina angello without calling in service of peppino be unwilling to drive there a presence of fiacre even in deserted piazza might be noticed did not want comment made by scandal loving italian populace on visit to out of way locality so in company with bianca who have put on veil who said nothing to from time left casa angello being apparently occupied with own reflection walked down gloomy narrow street towards that terrible palazzo morone very idea of inspired with horror dismay be one of burning day common to time of year in italy much a despised cursed drain like alley in wet weather yet now saw there be method in madness of style of building for cool shadow humid atmosphere be wonderfully pleasant after glare dust heat of great piazza walked on broad carriage way be le painful to foot than cobble stone paving between now then saw typical picture of italian life dark faced woman with red handkerchief twisted carelessly round head leaning from high balcony on iron railing of be displayed family washing purple cloud of wisteria blooming in pergola near red roof top sleek grey donkey laden with pannier stepping complacently along narrow way slender italian men presiding over fruit stall piled high with picturesque content over vivacious clatter din of voice struck through at time with sharp metallic note of mandolin be very charming must have enjoyed thoroughly artistically speaking have not be for local odour oh smell of picturesque street be too terrible for description how italian be not swept off face of earth by plague of typhoid be more than can understand smoked cigarette most of time a preventive against infection on beholding ideal painting of italian scene always shudder at memory of malodorous reality on arriving in well drained london again first prayer be one of thanks for having escaped from ill smelling italy thought during portentous walk be be afraid rather frivolous so fearful have be strain on nerve for past few day that be great relief to think idly of anything one not so bianca even through veil must see glisten of tear catch sound of quick indrawn breath a strove to fight down emotion threatened to overwhelm saw that poor child be nearly hysterical with effort to control stopped short in dismay signorina be not well go to palazzo yes yes must signor hugo can not pas night in state of suspense must know at once be palazzo morone far off be just at signorina so be for at moment entered silent grass grown square at end of stood palazzo looking gruesome even in sunshine with broken window damp disfigured wall general air of weird solitude swallow be shooting through still air twittering round rich sculpture of faade merry chirpings only added to eerie feeling inspired by great mansion feeling noticed thrilled bianca with fear a paused shuddering under grinning mask unlovely face peering downward from arched entrance oh how must come to terrible place at night cried crossing with look of fear in eye desolate a be in sun what must be when moon shine be abode of dead tomb tomb dio tomb signorina affright thus thing may not be so bad a think be like inferno of dante turn blood cold with fear will not go back must find guiseppe even if cost life come signor presto there be time to lose crossed once more then flitted through opening in iron gate like noiseless winged bird upon hastily followed stood for moment in lonely courtyard gazing at great portal of door leading to hall stood half open signorina will lead to room be not afraid tremble ah be afraid do tremble signor for be only girl lead on love will make strong will protect give hand signor be not afraid when hold hand with fleeting smile on pale lip placed hand in mine a grasped cold whiteness guessed how terrified delicate superstitious girl be of unholy place for resolute look on pallid face must have insisted upon turning back be useless to urge retreat now so with name guiseppe guiseppe on lip a if to inspire with courage almost dragged through half closed door into hall of shadow ah mother mary be like church be like church like old deserted church filled with chill atmosphere of grave slow movement of wind shaken tapestry glimmer of ghostly white stair in dim distance solemnity of huge pillar of black marble made think of god cursed city of thousand one night whose silence be only broken by voice of one survivor chanting melancholy verse of koran bianca overpowered by mute spectacle of dead past clung convulsively to arm with faltering prayer on lip became afraid lest by feeling of sympathy terror must unnerve also so with cheerful laugh echoed dismally through vast vestibule led onward towards grand staircase come signorina be afraid be quite safe with yes yes guiseppe guiseppe slowly ascended staircase gained corridor at length arrived at second flight of willow step leading to secret room here bianca seeing darkness nearly fainted with nervous fear for deeply imbued with grim italian superstition beheld unseen terror in shadowy corner again wanted to return with wilful obstinacy refused so a luckily have pocket flask of brandy with made take little to revive fiery spirit put new life into sinking limb after lighting candle a usual led up step through short corridor through tapestried ante chamber until at last stood in fatal room here signor hugo yes flung back veil with feverish gesture peered into darkness be hardly broken by feeble light of small candle carried suddenly thought struck at once put into execution lighted taper yet remaining in candelabra on table to darkness succeeded blaze of mellow light bianca with look of surprise on face gazed round singular room with white pillar ominous blood red hanging banquet of dead set forth with such splendid display on gilt table what strange room said timidly signor hugo what doe mean have told know signorina lover be lured to room saw pas through door then be drugged a have said did not then see who received here did not first part of lie be difficult to utter on account of choking feeling in throat last sentence came out with tolerable grace think guiseppe left room again be afraid not signorina then where can be asked with anxious look around think be concealed in secret cell entrance to be from apartment oh signor hugo let look for at once certainly meal on table gold silver be robber cave signor y e suppose so come let be quick then robber may arrive looked nervously towards door taking candle off table reassured with gay laugh be afraid signorina one come here during day hush what be infected by terror heart gave jump listened intently must hear sound be nothing signorina nerve be unstrung can hear one be coming listen in order to humour fancy remained silent with sens on alert with feeling of dread heard sound light fall of footstep rustle of silken dress dress full horror of situation rushed on at once must be contessa morone in moment have blown out candle dragging bianca with retreated in darkness to far end of room girl gave little cry a light disappeared pressed hand significantly hush signorina not word at time heard step be at door of ante chamber where new comer be evidently pausing moment a curtain of inner room have be half drawn aside on entrance be for reason have heard so clearly step recommenced soft light fall on marble floor rustle of silken gown like sound of dry leaf in autumnal wind then felt that woman be standing in arched doorway looking straight at shrinking girl through darkness why be here signor hugo who be that woman be voice of contessa gave cry of horror a suddenly remembered how ineffectual darkness be to conceal from eye of nyctalopist bianca however knew nothing of woman of gift of seeing in dark so overcome with fear at demoniac power believed unknown possessed gave shriek of terror sank fainting at foot what doe mean again voice of contessa sounded cruel menacing in tone so feeling at disadvantage in dark through not possessing terrible attribute of woman staggered forward lighted candle at once out of gloom sprang that evil face with frown on white brow deadly glitter in cruel eye ominous tightening of thin lip think can call coward at moment blood ran cold at horror of medusa like countenance stood before phantom of lucrezia borgia a if turned into stone unable to move speak contessa moved forward to table looked at steadily with wicked smile frozen on red lip reply signor hugo begin to understand have be here before yes hardly recognised own voice so hoarse broken did sound stealing in whisper from between dry lip still looked at steadily felt fascinated with dread by snake like glare of cruel eye when be here signor on monday night saw nothing said in meaning tone yes replied lifting head boldly saw receive guiseppe pallanza saw give poisoned cup gave cry of rage like trapped animal made step forward restraining with powerful effort sank into chair leaned elbow on table dressed in heavy black garment of velvet silk looked more like borgia than ever ruby necklace constantly wore flashed forth ray of red fire in glimmer of tremulous light understand now why said guiseppe pallanza must not come back said with scornful smile thought last night knew more than told eh signor be who sang at door of ezzelino yes be meddlesome englishman that be do not fear that will treat a treated that false one mistrust wine true signor machiavella forewarned be forearmed so came here to look for pallanza came to look for body madame morone know where be will find who be woman guiseppe betrothed contessa gave cry of rage rising from seat rushed towards unconscious girl where lay in darkness owing to singular gift needed light to see by examined face of rival minutely in gloom have stepped forward fearing lest carried away by jealous anger must do poor child injury such be not intention for after minute examination arose from stooping position with burst of wicked laughter so be for white faced thing that be going to leave giulietta morone eh feel much flattered at having rival why be here signor hugo to find pallanza replied shortly will never find be lost to for ever added with wicked smile be not afraid of betraying signor hugo be not afraid of poor fool who thought to take guiseppe from so will revenge revenge yes have said came here like thief in night saw what be not meant to see come in daylight to seek lover well will see wait till revives will blast eye with sight of what be now be demon be wronged woman whom man sought to deceive ecco behold then englishman that be how italian woman revenge stepped past unconscious body of girl going to one of pillar on right side of room apparently touched spring for whole pillar a have described before be half built into wall revolved slowly with grating sound displayed cavity bent forward with shudder of horror saw nothing cavity be empty signora morone gazed at with look of horror on wild beauty of face then with cry of rage of fear of dread rushed out of room heard shriek lost lost lost three time then sound of retreating footstep died away in distance be left alone in ghastly gloom with unconscious girl at foot agony in heart such a never hope to feel again in life how got out of accursed room hardly know faintly remember lifting bianca in arm guided by instinct stagger through dark corridor down silent stair out into courtyard fresh air seemed to revive collecting scattered sens together with gigantic effort looked round for mean by to bring bianca out of faint length of alarmed terribly in corner of courtyard there be sculptured trough late rain have brimmed over so hastening towards filled cap with water returning to bianca threw in face revived slowly with shuddering sigh looked round vacantly then with sudden recollection of what have come through flung into arm with imploring cry oh voice that voice take away from cruel voice chapter xi marchese beltrami managed to take bianca home without much difficulty for be good fortune to meet disengaged fiacre in one of narrow street leading to piazza vittorio emanuele placing poor girl therein drove straight to casa angello signorina be in very excited state a menacing voice issuing out of darkness have quite unnerved so placing in charge of petronella who made lie down went for doctor being stranger in verona be difficult to find one at last did so took at once to see bianca for whom prescribed soothing draught assured that must be right after few hour sleep trouble therefore being off mind went back to hotel in order to consider what be best to be done in present emergency now saw that surmise be right that contessa have hidden body of unfortunate pallanza in concealed tomb contrived by count mastino morone for guilty wife be horribly ingenious idea that revolving pillar one must have guessed ghastly secret without being shown doubtless wicked donna renata shut up in circular prison have there starved slowly to death in upright position for of course cavity be too narrow too willow to admit of human being lying down skilful devilry of device made feel quite ill especially when thought how worthy descendant of borgia accursed daughter have utilised secret cell for own infamous purpose in frightful oubliette body of guiseppe pallanza must have remained for ever concealed then according to evidence of own eye body be not there that contessa have placed corpse in pillar have not slightest doubt a in showing hiding place evidently expected to overwhelm by hideous evidence of barbarous criminality that cavity be empty be a much surprise to a to shriek of terror have given when flying from chamber showed that be overpowered with fear at thought that gruesome secret be shared by person for putting out of question altogether there appeared to be third party implicated in singular affair for own part believed to be man who have watched with at curtained archway who after drugging bore insensible from terrible place after doing so thus according to idea putting out of power to re discover palace have returned to post seen contessa conceal body of victim in cavity of pillar on departure for reason best known to have removed corpse hidden somewhere else be doubt true story of affair who be man who have watched at door who have taken away body of pallanza be impossible to guess reason for behaving in mysterious way contessa be evidently a ignorant a myself of action judging from terrified flight on discovering truth whomsoever unknown person be to appearance held key to whole riddle must find must doubtless learn reason of madame morone visit to burial ground final fate of unhappy tenor whom have lured to destruction how to find be question one to must find satisfactory answer so in dilemma in thus found involved decided to tell luigi beltrami a only friend have in verona whole devilish story in addition to desire felt of asking advice opinion thought right that must know real character of woman be about to marry not discover too late that be tied for life to ghoul vampire murderess with determination looked for card marchese have given finding in one of pocket discovered that italian friend lived in via cartoni a have mentioned that be always at home in afternoon doubtless to take siesta during heat of day on finishing midday meal went out to pay visit in spite of assertion that be poor beltrami have sufficient income to warrant living in moderately expensive manner on arrival at room in via cartoni be shown into very well furnished apartment a marchese be stationed with regiment at verona for considerable time have evidently brought portion of furniture from florentine palazzo for room be too handsome to be that of ordinary class of furnished apartment a usual ceiling be charmingly painted floor be of marble covered here therewith square turkish carpet in addition to piano there be plenty of picture photograph showing artistic taste of owner of place beltrami dressed a usual in uniform be seated at desk placed in window writing letter desisted when be announced arose to greet with marked cordiality ma foi hugo be kind of to call so soon said when be comfortably established in chair be just writing letter asking to dine with go to ezzelino to night a be here note be useless fact be dear marchese have called on selfish errand indeed yes still be one concern also how so mon ami come tell mystery about know nothing know everything first here be excellent cigarette russian friend not italian dame tobacco of country be horrible will have wine thank beltrami will be glad to smoke bene help pushed box towards after have taken cigarette followed example then throwing into chair near nodded head to show that be ready to hear what have to say marchese said after slight hesitation think be old enough friend to admit of speaking to freely eh certainly trust will not be offended beltrami blew wreath of smoke laying back handsome head on cushion of chair laughed heartily doubting englishman promise will not be offended at anything say luigi be about contessa morone eh about contessa thought a much how so asked in surprise face of marchese assumed that cruel cunning look so much disliked to see eyed in nonchalant manner dame signor hugo will tell when hear story of contessa thus committed to narrative told beltrami whole story of adventure from time have seen contessa at graveyard to hour when have fled in dismay from palazzo morone listened attentively when have finished remained silent for few minute with thoughtful look on dark face why do tell mon ami asked at length twisting moustache in reflective manner for two reason first may be able to aid in search for pallanza second must have be ignorant of character of woman be going to marry a to first reason hugo be right a to second be wrong what know know most of story have told a to signora morone mon dieu know better than doe then why marry beltrami shrugged shoulder selected cigarette eh be rich be poor be time ranged a french say can not afford to marry poor wife besides besides what rather like task of taming demon of woman madame morone be satan mistress in matter of temper know come of race who broke will of wife asked interrogatively killed be rather risky nowadays marchese live in time of renaissance remember let leave off discussion of madame morone have told story say knew most of before say truly now listen cold blooded islander see if can not disturb phlegmatic disposition paused moment to give greater weight to remark conclusion of impatiently awaited be man who drugged have carried to piazza vittorio be man who carried away body of guiseppe pallanza be man who knowing what do calmly with open eye have made up mind to marry madame morone be so overwhelmed with disclosure made by beltrami must only sit thunderstruck in chair looking like idiot repeating parrot fashion beltrami enjoyed confusion for time then went on speaking with mocking smile eh astonish hugo well admit treated rather badly friend then at time did not know whom be dame can not see in dark like madame gatta marchese then be man who held key to enigma far from being offended at rough treatment of on fatal night be only too delighted at discovering unknown person who in strange repetition of old legend have played part of count mastino morone have rather startled fancy hugo said beltrami with ironical laugh must be fool to deny now that dramatic surprise have come off so excellently perhaps will tell what mean without doubt confidence for confidence besides want help to carry comedy to legitimate conclusion comedy call to mind be more like tragedy there be wrong mon ami in tragedy there must be death well forget pallanza not at hugo be whole point pallanza be not dead stared at marchese in astonishment pallanza not dead impossible saw die on night dame saw fall insensible at foot of contessa morone insensibility be not death then be alive naturally one must either be alive dead a devil of tenor be not latter must therefore be former then where be eh be part of story epigrammatic fencing on part of beltrami annoyed greatly a piqued curiosity without satisfying threw half smoked cigarette away with outburst of bad temper dear luigi have promised to tell story of mystery instead of doing so fire off epigrammatic squib like pasquin during carnival story story beg of eh certainly then take cigarette will tell 'thousand second night ' romance chapter xii death in life be such long story hugo said trifle maliciously that must really have wine want wine want thousand second night bene will have marchese arose summoned servant who brought up bottle of barbera that rough tasting wine be so pleasant cool in hot weather for sake of companionship took with beltrami haying thus attended to duty of hospitality signed to servant to withdraw without further preamble began tale eh hugo mon ami said settling comfortably in chair must be charming story for m bourget that modern balzac who analysis heart of lady of generation in so masterly fashion dame must like to give madame morone to dissect 'd find strange thing there yet must believe woman worthy to be sister of lucrezia borgia came out of convent to marry poor friend morone knew then ma foi must think so for many year people said be mad only mad action committed to mind be in marrying giulietta rossana yet propose to do same thing true posse mean of taming tigress of unfortunate giorgio morone knew nothing be great chemist poor count particularly fond of toxicology dangerous science with wife a found out to cost cospetto must not care about forging weapon for to use against be exactly what morone did poisoned eh nobody say so yet everybody think so for part believe contessa capable of anything at event morone died very suddenly be duly buried in old ancestral vault to devoted wife year after death paid visit well before died morone grew suspicious of contessa a have just invented rediscovered poison left trace of having be used also antidote to same determined not to give signora opportunity of exercising on so toxicological secret be buried with ah see now why went to graveyard be to get poison exactly whether be put in coffin of dead man merely hidden in vault know will go see to what end have poison certainly believe that after seeing exercised upon pallanza have not got antidote how do know beltrami because contessa know nothing of existence of antidote morone talked enough about poison only mentioned antidote to one man be see hugo thought madame might try little of own poison on in case must be able to give antidote must have taken no poison doe not kill unless given in large quantity five drop make feel chill listless ten drop take away sens convert into what may paradoxically call breathing corpse fifteen drop kill so if madame have given husband fifteen drop must have lapsed into stupor died unless antidote be given so be why bestowed on well killed after yes with poison not of home manufacture eh what must hugo contessa be not going to be thwarted by husband who kept laboratory locked however tricked over particular poison for gave instruction that be to be put into coffin without knowledge of dear wife hid in vault a hinted to one day intended to do there be doubt then that contessa went to vault for poison what about antidote be in possession unfortunately mon ami be ordered away from verona gave back antidote to count on return here heard casually that have left letter for to be delivered after death went to rome where contessa be one of ornament of court asked for letter of course denied ever having heard of what do think be in letter eh ma foi believe told where poison be hidden in vault that dear contessa found letter went to vault on night saw obtained poison also antidote dame be not so sure of knew about antidote so well that think morone must have mentioned in letter in case must meet eye of wife mon ami have poison of course antidote believe be still in vault where will look for for what reason diamine to revive devil of tenor who have have misfortune to take ten drop of signora morone mixture where be pallanza all in good time in good time must tell rest of story first be impatience beltrami marchese saw be enjoying conversation a subject matter be of involved difficult character appealed to subtlety of italian nature chance of playing part in intrigue worthy of court of lorenzo di medici delighted beyond measure be a have said before anachronism everyday commonplace life of nineteenth century offered field for exercise of cunning brain delicate diplomacy revelled in bizarre complication full of sophistry double meaning distinguished intricate statecraft of italian republic wonder continued marchese reflectively wonder doubt after hearing opinion about contessa morone must care to marry a told before there be reason be poor be rich marry for money be brutal be not then see look at matter from latin point of view from english a euclid whom by way always hated say 'two parallel straight line can not meet ' be use arguing over point a neither of must convince other be question of race hugo nothing more ebbene other reason be that wish to tame woman with heart of tigress be wearied of dulness of present life task of fencing with signora morone will be perpetual excitement particularly a know will not be unattended with danger be also question of race theory of straight line applies so again will not argue can see one thing plainly want to marry contessa yes can see wonder at daring straight line for third time signor hugo ebbene although wanted to marry contessa hating detesting with whole soul a friend of late husband must not listen to at so a must not go to altar willingly determined to force there made business to find out about life devil of life be can tell pallanza be not first lover daughter of venus have smiled on oh broke out in disgust how can think of marrying infamous woman murderess poisoner fiend in human form dio have given reason straitlaced that be can not understand however will talk of again meantime to continue contessa be so madly in love with pallanza who grant be handsome fellow with charming voice foresaw when attempted to leave there must be trouble discovered that be engaged to signorina of milan that be at verona that pallanza be going to sing at verona so when did arrive be in nowise astonished at appearance of madame morone at ezzelino thing be coming to climax so watched for bursting of storm rendezvous of lover must be knew at deserted palazzo morone how did know mon cher ami be simplicity have not told that knew contessa when lived at verona with husband well be not first time have used that palazzo played at boccaccian story in room know fancy like lucrezia borgia try to imitate picturesque feast to ferrara duchess be so addicted yes even to use of poison dame thought be at opera when saw supper other night how did get into palazzo ah be adventure worthy of gil bias filed through bar in gate wrenched out thought so for entered same way guessed a much friend ebbene watched palace from time madame morone arrived in verona patience be rewarded on monday night by seeing picturesque tenor use key enter by side door be not alone for greatly mistrusted madame morone must discover in lonely palazzo so a have two men absolutely devoted to took with be very brave to go near ghastly palace considering reputation have ma foi be florentine know nothing about verona ancestor have be in service of mine for many year in eye beltrami can do wrong now be that not wonderful in present age of ducat steam engine so wonderful marchese can hardly believe cospetto be true tell men be absolutely devoted to think much greater man than umberto of savoy ebbene posted two men in dark corner of palazzo with instruction not to move until told then went after tenor found strumming on mandolin while awaited arrival of contessa ah have gone to burial ground yes did not know that until told however hid behind tapestry in outer room waited contessa arrived to surprise also appeared caught glimpse of at door before torch went out of course did not recognise be puzzled to account for presence there luckily have bottle of chloroform in pocket took with to palace in case of accident what good must chloroform do dame have ever seen madame morone in rage then be not pretty sight can tell that woman be devil for know might have have one in palace to do bidding if have be found there taken at disadvantage might have occupied that delightful pillar never be seen again ah smile mon ami remember be italy not england with woman like contessa who recall borgia time so admirably be always well to be prepared if have discovered chloroform might have come in useful certainly did in case ma foi have told before did not know be only beheld stranger thinking that stranger might interfere with plan stole across ante chamber when fell back well used chloroform then left lying hidden behind tapestry went on watching madame morone at borgian supper be dragging pallanza body to pillar having safely shut up there departed with satisfied smile on face so be left alone with two apparently dead men pallanza in pillar behind tapestry sufficiently dramatic situation think marchese eh doubt there be more drama in life especially in italian life than people think there be even stranger event than comedy of palazzo morone take place in midst from what have seen of people luigi quite believe well about dramatic situation what did do next cospetto played part on stage with great judgment can tell when be sure that madame morone have left palazzo re lighted candle went to see what appearance man behind tapestry presented to surprise recognised signor hugo cranston may fancy be considerably astonished a must not understand how have become mixed up in boccaccian adventure friendship said bevive apologize ' caution remarked from palazzo let think event of night dream oh adopted advice of caution diavolo what else must do might have interfered with plan besides always intended to give explanation when contessa became marchesa beltrami circumstance however have brought about explanation sooner than intended so see replied drily however removed from palace yes called up two men telling be well overcome by bacchus ordered to take to piazza vittorio emanuele leave there ecco oh beltrami eh reproach well doubt deserve reproach be best excuse must think of a doe do to trust servant too much ebbene took away left in piazza where awoke in morning did with confounded headache ma foi be chloroform doubt having thus arranged little matter went to pillar released guiseppe pallanza be not dead then gave ten drop tell so that although be not actually dead have appearance of corpse must not revive a have not antidote so when two men returned have brought here here in house precisely be in next room will go look at presently to continue next day called upon contessa told have seen suppressing however fact have carried off unfortunate lover accounted for surprise to day on seeing pillar empty of course never dreamed must meddle with work well gave choice of explaining little adventure to authority thus run chance of being imprisoned for life of becoming wife of two evil chose least so now be engaged to marry will become marchesa beltrami next month interesting be not hugo be use arguing with man who a said looked at affair in totally different light from what did did not know whether to loathe brutal candour to despise mercenary design to admire undoubted courage in marrying woman however reflected that subtle intriguing must undoubtedly be sufficiently punished by marriage with tigress of contessa a only desire be to restore pallanza to arm of bianca condemned praised beltrami singular conduct seemed admirable in own eye simply complimented on adroitness in following precept of niccolo machiavelli listened to cold remark with disbelieving smile on face laughed mockingly when ceased speaking eh hugo approve of idea well wonder at fire water be not more different than italian englishman cool blood come from generation of church going straight laced ancestor whose belief ruled life in simple manner fiery blood burned in vein of condottieri of renaissance who be at war with king pope republic who constantly stood on verge of unseen precipice who needed craft courage iron nerve to preserve life fortune dame let talk more of such contrast come with will show missing lover of madame morone acquiesced eagerly in proposal followed beltrami who led into bedroom having unlocked door in opposite wall ushered into small bare apartment containing bed on lay still form of guiseppe pallanza there be dressed same a on that fatal night with eye closed frozen look on white face hand crossed on breast lying thus in antique garb put in mind of one of coloured statue adorn tomb of great men where face hair vestment be tinted so a to produce semblance of life be life here in body of young man who lay so passively before with closed eye a though be indeed buried in sepulchre of dead oh be alive said beltrami guessing thought a shrank back from bed be case of suspended animation lasting three four day dame yes must last much longer have doubt ten drop produce life in death state see fifteen drop same thing one end in death after certain time other doe not why did not go to vault find antidote at once well to tell truth hugo thought must be useless errand a know where to look for fancied that madame morone might have found bottle of damnable poison never struck until heard story that have read letter addressed by morone to gone to vault for poison be to do now go to vault to be sure look for antidote vault be locked true forgot said beltrami with thoughtful frown however think can procure key from madame morone dame must put on guard at once want to think pallanza be still in cataleptic state otherwise wo marry a power over will be gone will get key somehow if not one of men know something about picking lock so will take with reputable servant truly eh what must said beltrami carelessly a led way out of room locked door even lock picking be useful on occasion witness present one well be ready to go to vault with to night at night beltrami most certainly if went in daytime verona must be in commotion must go at midnight when one be about have courage think so hope madame morone will not be there there be fear of a have reason to pay second visit to remains of husband have got poison know nothing about antidote so make easy on score ecco what be going to do now marchesa see if can obtain that key if fail to obtain will bring matteo with a for friend go take something to eat meet on ponte aleardi at midnight will be there beltrami good bye for present revederci hugo be obliged for confidence a have solved difficulty of knowing what to do with signor cupid went different way beltrami to search for key to hasten home to hotel prepare for fatigue of midnight excursion however much appealed to marchese sense of romantic be certainly not relished by chapter xiii down among dead men do know gruesome old ballad with sombre refrain of down down down among dead men friend of mine with deep bass voice used to sing in order to display lower note upon not without reason flattered greatly in after year never heard sung without shudder so vividly did recall to mind grotesque horror of midnight visit to tomb of morone in old burial ground of verona of late have be so much mixed up with ghost vault ghoul crime be by mean anxious to continue category must have infinitely preferred to have let beltrami who liked such uncomfortable thing go alone being englishman have to uphold honour of country so never thought for moment of showing white feather besides only chance of saving pallanza be by obtaining possession of antidote in spite of repugnance to errand fully made up mind to be on ponte aleardi at appointed time meanwhile fortified against possible horror by having excellent dinner supplemented by small bottle of champagne must not afford that luxurious wine be sinfully extravagant of to waste small stock of money upon thing in face of midnight adventure really felt that little stimulant must comfort under circumstance result be admirable for nervous apprehension disappeared sat in smoking room puffing at after dinner pipe in very contented frame of mind considering what awaited at twelve o'clock pm be coward think so many men who have physical fear must ride gaily enough into battle shrink with superstitious awe from eerie neighbourhood of dead owing to cause have stated before be of class come then ye dauntless scoffer who must dare anything in broad daylight let see if must contemplate midnight visit to antique vault with equanimity think not for however brave man may be be law of nature that must thrill with fear at approach of supernatural sat smoking thinking in twilight be bad preparation for event a twilight thought be invariably mournful own dear dead one seemed to throng in dusky shadow of room reproaching in voiceless grief for intention have of profaning sanctity of tomb to rid of melancholy reflection banish from brain mute crowd of ghost went out for walk intending to call at casa angello in order to ask after signorina bianca petronella told that poor child be much better exhausted by shock have sustained at palazzo morone have fallen into deep sleep must do more good than drug of doctor worthy domestic be very wrathful at wanted to know what have told piccola put off with excuse a have desire that must know event of day on taking departure gave petronella note for signorina contained only three word wait hope with instruction that be to be delivered to when woke up petronella somewhat mollified by assurance that must be right promised to fulfil commission returned to hotel very contented with present aspect of affair on regaining bedroom lay down about eight o'clock in order to get little sleep remedy be worse than disease for when eye be closed phantom of waking hour reappeared still more vividly to inner sens however fought against dread threatened to overwhelm fell into comparatively dreamless slumber from awoke shortly after eleven rising from bed upon have thrown half dressed hurriedly completed toilette bathed burning face in cold water on arrival in milan have bought one of picturesque italian cloak one only see in england on operatic stage throwing around put on soft black wide awake so what with mantle draped around naturally dark face looked very much like native of italy lighting cigarette took heavy stick thus prepared went out to keep appointment with luigi beltrami on ponte aleardi to hot day have succeeded hot night strong dry wind be blowing drove filmy cloud across face of haggard looking moon few star peeped out here there through frail woof chill moonlight waxed waned with appearing disappearing of pale planet almost lost amid wild confluence of drifting cloud misty circle round moon be prophetic of rain under wild wind vexed sky lay sleeping city dark sombre with rough blast sweeping drearily down lonely street in spite of heat so eerie be aspect of night drew cloak around with shiver of nervous fear leaving piazza vittorio emanuele hastened along via pallone in direction of ponte aleardi arrived there just a clock of st fermo sounded three quarter a beltrami be not yet at meeting place leaned on balustrade of bridge watched grey water swirling under fitful light of moon must not help thinking of strange event have taken place since have last occupied same position antique chamber with association of love crime teatro ezzelino where have beheld phantom of lucrezia borgia grief pain of poor little bianca extraordinary conversation have held with beltrami few hour before be most unreal feverish mediaeval intrigue into have be drawn question if student of singing have ever before be involved in such bizarre adventure adventure hoped prayed trusted must end to night buried in sombre reflection did not hear sound of approaching footstep be only when felt hand on shoulder turned round with sudden start to see marchesa standing beside wrapped in military cloak accompanied by man who waited little way off in respectful silence bravo signor hugo cried marchesa in cheerful tone have be waiting long about quarter of hour so have not obtained key beltrami unfortunately have not however here be matteo daresay will manage to get door open in way come caro continued beltrami taking arm have time to lose ecco believe beltrami have nerve for whole way to burial ground chatted cheerfully about antidote contessa tenor not appearing to be at impressed with solemnity of affair what matteo felt know a never opened mouth glided after like shadow until arrived at broken wall marchesa climbed over first long sabre clashing heavily against stone a jumped down on other side followed without delay matteo having joined went on through dense shade of cypress tree until arrived at forbidding looking tomb sight of put in mind of uncanny adventure beltrami undeterred by flaming sword of guardian angel tried iron door on chance that might be unlocked finding fast closed signed to matteo to get to work at once without word man obeyed a moon be now shining down in full splendour must see perfectly well without aid of artificial light for although carried torch beltrami did not wish lighted in case glare must attract attention while matteo be working away at lock took seat on fallen stone near door beltrami throwing off cloak flung down on grass beside dio how hot be exclaimed wiping brow how very imprudent luigi remember be in uniform ma foi be never in anything else retorted marchese gaily trouble hugo one will dare to come near cemetery at hour so uniform uniform be safe from observation will have cigar thank surely intend to smoke now why not said beltrami lighting cigar can not harm signior morone have wish to go down into evil smelling vault without taking precaution against fever ecco oh well do a will replied indifferently beginning to grow callous want to ask something luigi ebbene be count giorgio morone really mad eh be not sure one said be did not think so dame call man mad who have brain above fellow morone be clever man though to be sure be curious hiding poison in vault instead of destroying altogether must certainly have be wisest plan very likely see wise englishman morone have tenderness for child of brain must not bear to destroy work oh inventor be wonderful egotist assure at moment matteo who have be working in silence for considerable time approached master eccellenza be open bene cried beltrami springing to foot wrapping cloak around again give torch come signor hugo let go down matteo stay at door see that be not interrupted si eccellenza beltrami stepped cautiously into tomb followed then half closing iron door so that light might not attract attention fired torch flame of shot upward with red flare resinous odour of smoke showing that stood on top of flight of steep step led downward into darkness chill humid atmosphere pervaded abode of dead seemed to penetrate into very bone notwithstanding heavy cloak wore for moment paused on height looking downward into thick gloom then beltrami descended step slowly tossing flaring torch up down to fro in order to illuminate darkness a followed smoke with pungent odour streamed backward towards face bat startled by glare flew round head with rapid sweep of noiseless wing then vanished through half open door into night beyond like escaping spectre of tomb at last reached floor of vault be paved with broad black marble slab so highly polished that crimson blaze of torch be reflected therein around in niche be innumerable coffin covered with tattered velvet pall while others stood out grim bare in leaden hideousness covering having long since mouldered away in gloom there w then must be perceived glimmer of white figure sculptured on massive wall glitter of tarnished silver ornament outline of painted device while smoky torch with angry flame cast strange gleam upon mouldy splendour of dead in centre on square stone hidden by rich pall of black velvet embroidered with armorial device in silver braid rested gorgeous coffin of last morone presume be to remain there until death of contessa when must be removed to already prepared niche to make way for sole survivor of proud race marchesa at once advanced to coffin waving torch above examined decoration closely true to determination be smoking gave unpleasant shock to see cloaked figure behaving so disrespectfully in solemn presence of dead bene said at length in satisfied tone there be one thing certain be not in coffin how do know beltrami because lid be screwed down contessa who a say be alone must not have taken off besides even if did madame morone know value of time too well to waste in replacing lid be not in coffin be somewhere about coffin what make think so luigi elaborate silver work there be too much of to be there without reason caro hugo just hold torch will make examination took torch in silence watched action with great curiosity coffin a said be most elaborately adorned with silver work representing arm of morone family interspersed with wreath of flower tangled seaweed on lid be broad silver plate similarly adorned setting forth name title date of death of deceased round oblong side of shell ran broad wreath of flower shell crest seaweed designed in same style a decoration on lid beltrami who be clever prestidigitateur must perform most marvellous trick with card have wonderfully delicate sense of touch trusting to more than to eye ran slender finger rapidly over raised silver ornament on lid of coffin saw at once that suspected useless silver ornamentation concealed secret hiding place in bottle of poison antidote be hidden must not help admiring wonderful cleverness of man in thinking of such extraordinary idea particularly a saw at once that if poison be anywhere must be in such ingenious hiding place after running hand twice thrice over lid shook head with angry ejaculation desisted from apparently useless task dame be not on top be certain said stamping foot with vexation finger never deceive be sure have missed anything from what have told think can be within coffin ecco let try side carefully wiped tip of finger with handkerchief beginning at side nearest head ran finger delicately along cold silver work nothing be discoverable at side when came to end of coffin at foot of corpse gave cry of triumph brought at once to side bravo hugo what did tell poison bottle be in silver work behold infidel how truly speak ecco decoration at narrow end be heart shape shield bearing arm of morone family wreathed with flower shield curved outward have spring at top in touching whole shield fell downward working on single hinge there be cavity in small bottle might easily be concealed see hiding place beltrami where be poison eh have forgotten visit of contessa mon ami of course not doubt took poison away daresay antidote with mon cher will never make anything of cried marchese in despair what did tell about letter said that doubt a count be afraid of being found by wife must only mention where poison be concealed keep silent about antidote ebbene contessa knew nothing of existence of antidote so when found poison thought have found be that not so stupid englishman yes suppose so good well knowing of existence of antidote not mentioned in letter only finding poison at foot must naturally look for antidote where daresay at head suggested after pause upon beltrami laughed walked to other end of coffin of course must be most natural thing to do behold mon ami touched top of similar shield at head of coffin fell stiffly outward lo in hollow of curve lay small bottle beltrami took in hand then restored shield to former position luigi be most wonderful man cried with burst of genuine admiration at clever way in have guessed riddle only use brain replied with gratified laugh poison being at foot be not difficult to guess antidote be at head particularly a decoration on end of coffin be same precisely dame if contessa have only known antidote be in existence must have argued in same way a have done carried off a have done poison well can now restore unfortunate pallanza to life yes suppose so said marchese slipping bottle containing antidote into pocket though certainly doe not deserve to have chance of existence a be inconvenient keeping in house suppose must send away on leg ecco come along hugo have what desire care not for abode of death went up stair out of iron door where found matteo still keeping guard be quite relief to get out of fetid atmosphere of tomb into cool fresh air again felt like released prisoner who be free for first time after many year marchese however man of iron a be did not seem to be affected in way wrapping cloak round prepared to go can close that door again matteo eccellenza be done bene let go in fact moment emerged matteo knowing task be concluded have reclosed door by trick known to so three climbed over broken wall took way to ponte aleardi when be going to give pallanza antidote asked a walked along arm in arm eh signor hugo to morrow why not to night ma foi be tired few hour will not make much

good news that lover be alive well be true beltrami have asserted that antidote must awaken young man from death like slumber remembering that have now be in state of catalepsy for nearly week felt doubtful a to success of experiment however few hour must now decide fate of pallanza for life death in event of antidote acting according to expectation of marchese promised must be first to carry joyful news of wonderful resurrection to signorina bianca when two o'clock struck must no longer restrain impatience set off without further delay to see beltrami at apartment have just returned from

to pour red liquid drop by drop into mouth avenza bent forward eagerly to watch operation held breath with anxiety a marchese counted slowly one two three four five six seven eight nine ten body made movement beltrami drew back looking somewhat anxious dio be afraid ten drop be not enough wait said avenza taking watch out of pocket placing finger on pulse of seemingly dead man can not expect antidote to act at once minute passed slowly three remained with eye eagerly watching for sign of life on still face while avenza occasionally glanced at chronometer pulse beat said at length in low voice faintly be true still beat heaved sigh of relief beltrami remained silently looking at face of pallanza with anxious frown can not have given fifteen muttered under breath if so must have be

gorgeously painted with mythological figure even at moment must not help recalling george sand remark anent contrast between two however have time to admire clumsy jupiter throwing fire brand thunderbolt for at moment petronella who have seen through dingy glass of own little sanctum opened door be about to burst into torrent of greeting when stopped to ask if signora pallanza be at home

if beltrami have noticed obstacle to sudden entrance into room instead of appearing dismayed have grim satisfied smile on lip a if rather approved than otherwise of table blocking up doorway puzzled at withdrew eye from face looked again into room beyond where marchesa beltrami be seated talking to bianca in what appeared to be very friendly fashion must be remembered that bianca knew nothing about contessa morone intrigue with husband a guiseppe have carefully kept knowledge of affair from moreover owing to nervous agitation have not recognized voice of marchesa when spoke to in darkness of fatal chamber at verona consequently be completely in ignorance of real character of visitor only beheld in lady who have called to see signor pallanza about important business a afterwards learned being excuse gave for presence in casa angello be truly terrible to see two woman seated together in friendly discourse one so innocent of danger be in other so ruthless in determination to revenge on rival pure white dove be in clutch of relentless hawk who while watching victim so closely be meditating a to best mean of carrying out plan oh be horrible murmured turning pale with emotion hush whispered beltrami with sinister look will fall into own pit what did mean by strange word must not understand have time desire to ask for explanation a terrible drama being played out in next room riveted attention so with violent effort of self repression resumed post of observation listened to conversation between two actress in tragedy be idle frivolous conversation of two stranger who have nothing to talk about merest commonplace frivolity have for ghastly meaning commonplace concealed frightful intention so signora pallanza have never heard husband mention name madame be strange said marchesa smiling for in rome did what must to help in profession eh yes heard singing faust at apollo told friend to go hear new mario be what call here signora replied bianca proudly indeed be kind

into glass must have cried out only voice of bianca arrested be perfectly well madame will not take wine since day be so warm certainly if will drink with said madame beltrami turning round with calm smile indeed wine will do good seem to faint poured out glass of chianti for herself be about to take fatal drink to bianca when latter called quickly from window madame quick come here guiseppe be coming down street out of courtesy marchesa be forced to obey call of hostess went quickly to window leaving two wine glass close together on table one on left containing poison destined for bianca

be doing have only be gone little over two minute between time have last looked in room moment resumed post of observation during period marchesa evidently afraid of entrance of pallanza have given bianca fatal wine girl be drinking at window madame beltrami with rather pale face devilish look in eye have just set down glass upon table empty moment after bianca having drained fatal draught to dreg came across to table placed glass beside of marchesa with merry laugh be glad persuaded to have wine signora be so refreshing yes think will find so replied marchesa with strange smile whole of terrible scene have passed so rapidly that have time to interfere tongue clove to roof of mouth a saw bianca drink borgian wine yet with mighty effort be about to cry out when beltrami seized arm in powerful grasp dared with lurid eye to utter sound marchesa having completed devilish work be about to go for heard say something to bianca about seeing pallanza on stair when suddenly heard guiseppe gay voice talking to petronella who strove to detain with merry laugh brushed past moment afterwards be in room standing there in grasp of beltrami hidden by curtain there seemed to be silence lasting eternity then heard guiseppe give terrible cry of rage fear despair giulietta here demon what be doing slow soft like hiss of snake came answer doing to what did to poison bianca poor girl gave terrible shriek of agony flung into arm of husband while again there sounded wicked laugh of marchesa ah can not save now traitor perjurer that be will die there be sudden smash of glass a beltrami hurled through archway stood before terrible wife lie wretch here be antidote bianca be lying unconscious in guiseppe arm with cry of joy stretched out hand for phial beltrami standing midway between

life in desire to doom rival there amid brilliant sunshine amid blood red jewel scattered around with crime devilry wickedness on head lay dead body of creature of night have seen issue like vampire from old sepulchre to fulfil evil destiny over with folded arm sinister cruel towered man who a instrument of god have sent back to hell from whence have emerged chapter xviii last word be at paris opera house that last saw beltrami three year after death of terrible woman thing have gone exceedingly well with since student life in milan can say without vanity that signor hugo urbino hold very good position among operatic artist of to day after leaving angello devoted year to hard study be finally pronounced fit to appear before italian audience by last maestro however be only battle for now having gained complete control of vocal power have to take lesson in scena from maestro biagio in other word have to study art of acting elected to make dbt in fine part of renato in verdi opera un ballo in maschera having learned music thoroughly biagio taught how to render character dramatically speaking took time a movement action gesture have to be studied with perseverance overcame difficulty at length found capable of rendering character of renato in sufficiently good style in passing may say that a far a have found be ridiculous to think that acting come instinctively doubt histrionic genius be able to give gesture strike attitude during emotion engendered by performance of part must always hold well under control broadly speaking act character a studied in cold blood otherwise carried away by power must do thing likely to upset entire mechanism of scene have sung part of renato many time since first appearance critic be pleased to consider striking performance touch on spur of moment have introduced broad rendering of character always remains precisely same a taught to by maestro biagio being thus in position to sing act part greatest difficulty commenced can safely say that never met more unscrupulous set of scoundrel than sixth rate impresario who go about milan like degraded satan seeking whom may devour english student being popularly supposed to be made of money be favourite victim demand from sum of four five hundred franc a price of scrittura ie appearance on stage in playful ironical fashion call sum present suppose after fashion of henry viii think be that king who dubbed tax benevolence if make impresario present certainly will not get appearance in italy with money take theatre in small town put on opera in desire to sing even then be doubtful whether dbt so dearly purchased will come off at first impresario with whom have to deal be dingy individual who according to own account have brought out greatest singer of europe for last twenty year having made present of two hundred franc be modest man asked more be arranged must make dbt at como on arriving there for rehearsal found that present impresario have vanished like macbeth witch into thin air considerably disheartened by sample of italian honesty yet have sufficient faith to trust gentleman in same fashion must have be brother of first impresario for too vanished now began to perceive that there be still brigand in italy that having become civilised be either hotel keeper impresario a two unfortunate attempt to get scrittura have ended in disaster be not very anxious to make one third present however be use turning back when within sight of goal so consulted maestro biagio who kindly interested on behalf introduced to honest impresario who required necessary present nevertheless fulfilled promise of introducing to italian public made dbt at brescia with great success at conclusion of season for of course did not receive penny have plenty of offer from part of continent to make long story short sang everywhere possibly must having secured excellent reputation by unexpected stroke of good fortune be engaged to sing at paris opera
