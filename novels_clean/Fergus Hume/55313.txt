herbert attention for be well looking well to do of good yeoman family father knew must approve of such match a own inclination leaned towards grudged herbert company conversation be true that have be wild that there be many tale current in district about attention to other girl that be reported that have once be in love with gipsy girl rachel looked upon thing a folly of past herbert be now reformed character went to chapel attended to farm cast glance at woman while rachel be by although have said word of love to quite looked on a future husband be prepared to become mr mayne whenever

later police be bound to question when reached field herbert found that inspector chard have arrived from poldew by direction body of tera be carried into grimleigh there laid out in empty building close to police office notified that dead woman be mr johnson ward mr inspector after making few inquiry paid visit to minister a luck must have met coming out of garden looked somewhat scared when

to about mr johnson to speak to repeated minister whose face looked emaciated painfully white why what have to do with know who have be murdered asked chard with keen glance how must mother be in town just now returned with story of crime having be committed be rather deaf heard detail be coming to police office to make inquiry will answer inquiry now sir please take within door who be asked johnson who did not recognize officer inspector chard of poldew police office come to ask few question about what said johnson conducting inspector into study about dead woman ah johnson dropped into chair with gasp woman victim then be woman looked swiftly at stern police officer passed tongue over dry lip what question can answer know nothing of poor soul pardon sir think be not quite correct

upon admission how did know be careful sir for own sake be careful minister be heeding not at indeed in then state of mind be questionable whether even heard man certainly in wise took in meaning of warning tera moaned resting forehead on table oh bithiah who be bithiah asked chard still on alert for clue bithiah be tera said johnson lifting haggard face when received into fold named bithiah now be dead dead who killed demanded with sudden fierceness be what wish to learn mr johnson if will be so good a to answer question may perhaps arrive at clue to lead to discovery of assassin minister wiped perspiration from forehead drew long breath chard must see that man nerve be shattered that be suffering from severe mental excitement physical prostration how long have be ill asked inspector suddenly be not ill be worried oh there be world of meaning in chard ejaculation then how long have be so worried know will say month by time minister be beginning to see that there be something strange in officer attitude why month asked a new fear filled body found have be lying in field for quite month man cried johnson with wild stare mean to infer killed infer nothing sir be here to procure information to ask question not to answer dead woman be ward left a understand month ago have not be heard of since to day find dead body in cornfield belonging to mr carwell be duty to learn how came there how came to be strangled strangled be strangled yes said chard dryly be strangled body be hidden in thick of standing corn very clever method of concealment think ever heard of cornfield being used for such purpose before moreover mr inspector leaned forward body have be robbed robbed yes pearl know pearl repeated johnson vacantly oh yes pearl what be what be anything compared with death oh loved how loved be dead leaned head on hand wept chard be becoming trifle impatient man be in such state of mental excitement physical debility that seemed unlikely must prove of much use at present at event still be person of others from whom detail regarding past life of dead girl must best be learned in past life might be found motive sufficiently strong to lead to clue ever prepared for emergency chard produced flask of brandy from pocket pouring little of into cup handed to johnson a odour of spirit struck nostril minister recoiled with look of disgust be abstainer said waving away may be rejoined chard imperturbably be broken up weak now little wine for stomach sake ' a st paul say can hardly go against st paul sir drink added sharply insist upon drinking have right to speak to in way mr chard have right of jack in office retorted inspector wish to learn about woman can supply information require though at present be hardly fit to do so drink brandy say pull together be quite able to answer question without aid of alcohol thank replied johnson in so dignified tone that officer did not press further what be seek to know chard shrugged shoulder drank off brandy slipping flask into pocket commenced brisk examination who be rather who be girl asked taking out pocket book to note down answer to inquiry polynesian girl from island of koiau in south sea how did happen to be in england be brought here by mr inspector for year more be missionary in koiau while there gained good will of buli high chief inclined ear to faith believe must have become

return to koiau oh be about to return say yes father being old frail wished to come back that might claim a successor sent home missionary named korah brand to escort back be only shortly before death that told brand must take away say loved johnson flushed looked troubled confession escaped in sorrow said in low voice must ask to respect privacy of statement made under such circumstance nevertheless fear must speak of said chard if be to trace murderer of poor creature must know about well care who know cried minister recklessly have nothing to be ashamed of yes mr inspector loved asked to marry refused declaring be in love with man named jack finland oh here be fresh element who be finland may ask sailor nephew of farmer carwell h be said chard be in farmer carwell field body

certain that be innocent men be presumed to be innocent until be found guilty said officer dryly where be mr finland now at sea for know left grimleigh three week ago to join ship in london do happen to know ship name no replied johnson coldly be not sufficiently interested in finland to ask farmer carwell may know will ask said mr inspector making note in book now mr johnson tell when girl ran

to take key with when returned bithiah pearl be gone then be that crossed mind might have run away with finland johnson shook head finland be questioned by mr brand about said denied having seen girl left grimleigh week after disappearance do think finland be guilty have already said that mr chard loved girl be quite willing to marry give up fortune so see what motive must have have to kill sir finland be innocent have girl enemy not that know of can surmise who killed johnson raised head solemnly a lord god liveth can not said answer have solemnity of oath ended examination for time being

tera have affected in unusual degree a in truth have for without tera brand did not care to return to koiau if did must be at risk of life for on learning of daughter death buli must a likely a not sacrifice luckless missionary on altar of god be therefore with very great good will that submitted to be stopped by raw boned goliath who be asked korah with growl jeremiah slade replied officer be police constable in town be on way to serve mr johnson with subpoena oh shame shame have fallen on bethgamul said brand in tone of deep grief dear sister be taken pastor have to bow down in temple of

slade whose meaning at once seized do know reason why must be warrant asked sharply have own idea sir what be idea slade took time to consider pulled red moustache see here mr brand said softly do want disgrace to fall on chapel of yours why must do anything to avert well then sir ask question about parson missionary bent shaggy brow on man stroked beard do suspect mr johnson yes do nobody else doe except brand started back in dismay 'get thee behind satan ' why must suspect jeremiah tapped on chest if hold tongue can hold mine said turned away in moment brand be after clutching arm man what do mean gammon know johnson killed that girl oh brand withdrew arm with moan feared so greatly feared so how do know will tell if will answer question work with question can answer will work with why must do to get parson chap arrested think of disgrace to bethgamul want saved from consequence of sin will think about when prove guilt said slade dryly see here be chance of escape be offering if tell chard know wo get parson off can tell want to find out truth of mystery to get promotion help to find out who killed girl will perhaps make thing safe for man a done be purely treacherous offer a slade knew that must not get promotion unless murderer of tera be discovered hanged however korah brand did not know hoping to save johnson for sake of chapel really wished to do at once decided to accept slade offer will help can said on condition that tell inspector must find out truth be bargain then slade be delighted with result of diplomacy already felt worthy to rank with hero of of favourite novel now then mr johnson in debt be yes deeply in debt folly of youth now know how true be text sure thy sin will find thee out will find truer when have done with said jeremiah grimly well sir pearl girl have with yes took away pearl johnson said so very good then johnson murdered for pearl so that might sell pay debt how do know be theory very bad one said brand worldly nature appearing through religious veneer girl left house with pearl during johnson absence yes johnson followed what of did not see say did not oh cried slade contemptuously 'd say anything to save neck why mr herbert mayne met coming from cornfield in body be found that very night believe mr brand johnson met girl there strangled sold pearl hid body in corn ca prove that can prove between mr brand can prove a johnson be sweet on girl 'd have nothing to do with can swear a ' e 'ad pearl servant by bill letter picked up can show that be in debt mr mayne can declare a mr johnson left cornfield on night girl ran away be merely circumstantial evidence argued missionary men have be hanged on a much before now dare say can make case stronger be going to serve on mr johnson so in study maybe will see something of pearl if have pearl may be sure have disposed of by time said brand with sudden thought after bithiah disappeared went up to london be away for week said be to search for dare say be to sell pearl might be sir if be got money for will have paid debt must find out if have very good leave that part of to now sir will get to business wait for here will come back after have have squint round that room tell yer impression ca do much in so short time can watch face any'ow a serve subpoena if ' e guilty guess will twig trust ai read detective story for nothin ' with complacent nod slade made off brand watched enter minister house be absent for ten minute during time korah stood staring at sea wondered how must return to mission work at koiau without tera absorbed in thought failed to hear slade returning footstep be only when felt touch on shoulder that turned to see triumphant face of man what have found asked guessing that slade have made discovery well saw johnson took subpoena turning a pale a villain then looked about bit noticed curtain on winder know know groaned brand vanity vexation gaud of world gay curtain be tied back with red white blue cord yes one of cord be gone mr brand cried slade exultingly have got that girl be strangled with red white blue cord ai drawing back curtain now sir be round throat chapter vii minister debt slade be present at inquest be deeply interested in proceeding now then might have be seen to smile in saturnine way for own purpose have impressed on brand necessity of absolute silence concerning discovery in johnson study that one of curtain cord be used to choke girl prof good deal said emphasizing with stumpy finger on palm of hand quite show a johnson killed girl even before found out about cord be sure that be guilty be sure now mr brand be want certain fact to build up complete case against fact a ca deny now window cord be one fact for one might have be in room took just to get johnson into trouble now wife jemima be a sharp a sharp be be speaking to old mr johnson who talk lot mr johnson say a girl son have quarrel over refusing afore murder strengthens case against mr johnson hold on sir mr johnson say a window cord be missing three day afore that row took place now sir if johnson killed girl must have got ready cord taken away so long afore needed if be murderer killed girl in fit of passion 'cos be running away with pearl a wanted to pay debt with going on evidence sir one must have stolen that cord with idea of murder that one by reasoning aforesaid a lawyer say be george johnson then think that pastor be innocent said brand hopefully say nothing sir because see clear wait till see at inquest then will talk so at inquest slade be observant of minister demeanour however gained little from scrutiny johnson have exhausted earlier grief be cool collected perfectly willing to repeat story have told chard answered question be put to made voluntary statement by adopting course be able to keep secret of lost restored bill yet several time be in mind to tell chard of stealthy footstep theft be just possible thought that one might have seen looking at pearl afterwards ascertaining in same way that tera have taken have followed girl to murder for sake after debating subject in mind decided to hold peace evidence gave while exonerating must throw light on darkness environed case have chard procured other evidence likely to elucidate matter at have not heard story of herbert mayne meeting with johnson on night of tera disappearance near field in body have afterwards be found herbert have told only to rachel policeman slade first have remained silent lest pastor whom admired must be accused of crime be certain have not committed second after relating incident to brand have agreed with until found fresh evidence be best to hold tongue therefore one three knew that johnson have actually be near scene of crime in minister admission to chard have merely stated that have searched two hour for girl johnson repeated former story jury did best must with for other evidence be procurable there be indeed talk of finland departure a one knew that loved tera must have secured girl pearl by marrying course to be generally known a willing to consent one thought of taxing with crime peculiarity of silken tri coloured cord used passed unnoticed strange to say london detective must have be struck by immediately chard subordinate be unaccustomed to such finnicky data escaped altogether on such spare evidence can easily be guessed what verdict be given by thickheaded jury chosen from grimleigh wiseacre decided that tera alias bithiah native of polynesia have be murdered by person person unknown when proceeding terminated present thought have heard last of matter slade chuckled rubbed hand for now chard seemed likely to abandon inquiry a useless must go to work at leisure build up case a chose so far have suspected johnson alone on reconsidering incident of curtain cord having be stolen three day before tera disappearance concluded that other person also be concerned in matter who that person might be slade in present state of indecision be not prepared to say having fulfilled official part of duty inspector chard returned to grimleigh police office for rest preparatory to riding back to poldew while there be informed that korah brand wished to speak to on assumption that man having be connected with tera might have something of importance to say admitted at once to interview well mr brand said chard genially what can do for want to know about poor girl murder sir replied brand in heavy solemn way what be going to do now why mr brand have very definite plan may tell intend to search for pearl what will do reveal identity of murderer there be doubt in mind can there be in yours that tera be murdered for sake of pearl now have will surely turn into money to do so must sell to jeweller pawnbroker intend to communicate with london police on point may discover who sold pawned thus be able to lay hand on man be in search of what make think of looking in london mr chard because sailor finland went up there week after girl disappeared went to join ship said brand who believed in jack innocence so said replied mr inspector dryly very good excuse to get away from town without suspicion see why must think finland guilty assured most solemnly that never set eye on bithiah on night oh dare say finland be carwell nephew body be found in one of carwell field so be not beyond bound of probability that finland placed there believe cried brand vigorously bithiah believe ran away to marry finland by such marriage must have secured pearl why must kill when korah placed matter in light inspector chard be puzzled unable to answer question lost temper pretend to be infallible said harshly may be mistaken same believe finland to be guilty then why arrest because have not sufficient evidence to enable to get warrant replied inspector tartly do know where man be however be intention to find out if possible whereabouts of pearl for girl be murdered when learn who disposed of will be able to capture murderer wo be finland sir that will see retorted chard closed interview in felt be getting worst of argument brand left police office with conviction that tera murderer must never be discovered by mulish officer slade have twice man brain decision korah resolved to rely on for conduct of case looked round for policeman not finding feeling must talk with one about matter hurried up hill to johnson house a slade suspected johnson a queer incident of lost window cord proved that there be ground for such suspicion brand thought must do little business on own account question minister in course of conversation thought evidence might be discovered likely to incriminate johnson korah be inclined to beseech young man to fly lest must be arrested lest disgrace must fall upon chapel people of grimleigh even a matter stood now johnson be in dangerous position on entering study brand cast glance at window saw that a slade have stated one of tri coloured cord be missing fact made wonder if johnson have really strangled girl with if so whether have committed crime in order to secure pearl for payment of debt in fit of despair caused by rejection of love if haggard look might be outcome of remorse went for anything johnson be guilty for man be white worried looking dark circle be under eye manner of greeting visitor be uneasy looked a though have not slept for hour on other hand physical deterioration might be caused by grief for tera death do wish to see particularly brother korah asked johnson lifting heavy eye with weary look be scarcely fit to talk brand sat down assumed stern demeanour be sorrow on account of earthly passion brother because immortal soul have be lost bithiah soul have not be lost cried johnson stirred out of apathy to honest indignation be good girl true christian death be martyrdom yet died in sin persisted narrow minded missionary fled from house with evil in heart with pearl pearl be own property brother be entrusted to care by buli that might buy good for civilization of kioau be steward have right to remove pearl from keeping matter added brand taking more worldly tone can discus at leisure question now one about came to see be funeral have arranged with inspector chard about funeral said johnson wearily to morrow poor remains be to be buried in own cemetery will read service over dead poor tera be can do for will bury bithiah christian not tera pagan brother do think be wise to appear at funeral why not brother korah there may be riot riot johnson looked surprised why must there be riot if appear missionary looked perplexed tugged at grey beard brother brother said in tone of remonstrance do not know that public opinion credit with crime johnson rose slowly with look of horror on colourless face speedily gave way to expression of indignation who dare to say such thing demanded be general opinion rejoined korah coldly be near field where body be found on very night bithiah disappeared on very night when if go by medical evidence girl be murdered be looking for bithiah often walked near field thought likely must find there kill swear to brand must a soon have killed a loved dearly why then must commit crime contrary to earthly love to religious principle accuse public voice doe that replied brand still cold unsympathetic be known to be in debt be not in debt now interrupted johnson hurriedly debt be paid paid debt paid brand be thunderstruck for be last thing expected to hear how did pay demanded with sudden suspicion did not pay brand then who did know be johnson extraordinary reply brand looked at sternly droned out proverb will eat of fruit of own way be filled with own device quoted what do mean brother brother repeated korah rising with indignation be not brother to man of sin a be debt be paid yes believe that know who paid liar paid with wage of sin sin gasped johnson aghast add deceit to iniquity man killed that girl stole pearl when went to london be to sell now have paid debt at cost of bithiah life 'be sure thy sin will find thee out have found out murderer be murderer cried minister vehemently a be living man have hand in death never saw after left house searched in vain who paid debt know yesterday found pile of receipted bill on table who put there know more than do can not impose upon by story said brand coldly debt like yours be not paid by unknown people if such be case have to do be to see creditor ask who paid intend to a yet have not have time after funeral of tera be going to london to see creditor learn truth brand smiled be going to london repeated that be intend to seek safety in flight well be best thing can do will not betray secret intend to fly have done nothing wrong man man why will try to deceive be friend for sake for sake of bethesda implore to fly what will congregation say if pastor be hanged for murder johnson drew back with shudder hanged dare not be innocent have yet to prove brand cried wretched man imploringly believe that killed tera from soul believe did replied korah sternly if did duty must deliver to justice for sake of bethgamul refrain man fly repent of terrible sin god help for can not with gesture of casting off sinner brand walked out of room chapter viii captain jacob tera funeral be function of importance well nigh entire population of grimleigh crowded into little cemetery above town of be drawn there in true compassion for terrible fate of poor girl others from sheer morbidness perhaps greater part of people be attracted by expectation of riot be vaguely understood that in inexplicable way johnson be responsible for tera death be rumoured that if have not killed one be bold enough to make assertion be at least mean of driving to destruction consequently public feeling ran high against minister be generally thought that if read service over victim there must be trouble chard believed accordingly attended funeral in person with posse of constabulary however precaution proved unnecessary for johnson be wise enough not to put in appearance much le take active part in ceremony whether deterred by advice of brand by threat of townspeople remained absent tera be buried by minister from poldew who nearly created riot on own account by sensational reference to death farmer carwell daughter herbert mayne miss arnott be of present be with feeling of shame indignation that saw ceremony presided over by strange divine when crowd have dispersed carwell looked at newly made grave for moment in ominous silence then turned to korah brand who stood by side pride a elder of bethgamul be hurt if pastor can not clear character said sternly must be removed from conduct of congregation bethgamul can not be shadowed thus by shame surely believe that pastor be guilty father urged rachel before brand must speak say that be guilty neither do uphold innocence rejoined carwell be suspected know be for to deny accusation absence to day only give colour to charge therefore say until refutes accuser must be out off from congregation of just so say brother carwell cried brand eye for eye tooth for tooth still must give chance let then call meeting of brother demand that disprove charge confess if be guiltless lord will protect own believe mr johnson killed bethiah said rachel doe herbert oh be quite neutral interposed mayne hastily be for against pastor though grant be strange that must have met where did on very night of girl disappearance no more strange than that must have be there surely well really suppose mean to infer have anything to do with girl disappearance hardly knew converse have with be in presence rachel be not accusing mr mayne said brand coldly be zealous in support of pastor doe nothing credit trust zeal may not prove to be misplaced must hope for best do believe in mr johnson guilt asked rachel sharply believe disbelieve replied korah after pause know certain fact be suspicious with will tax when be before on trial will see elder at once said

bit queer must make out game made up mind to keep eye on that trip came back here two week later skedaddled to london be perfectly true admitted johnson quietly went up again to london in connection with debt owed oh rat went up about pearl let waive question for moment captain jacob admit be in london two week after visit to about disappearance of bithiah may ask how knew there ai harm in

murdered if 'd knowed cried jacob with show of virtuous wrath 'd yanked into quod must by thunder johnson listened to man without moving muscle looked calmly in face captain shackel said coldly allow to inform that there be not word of truth in statement by mean of propose to blackmail visited london first time to inquire if have seen ward who thought might have gone to for shelter denied that have be with so believing statement returned to grimleigh two week after disappearance be in great trouble about money owed from unknown person received several bill receipted be placed on very desk one day when be out visiting much astonished went to london saw creditor to learn if possible who have paid money one refused to inform a have promised benefactor not to reveal name failing in attempt returned for second time to grimleigh since then have hardly left home tera have be murdered know who murdered be wholly innocent never saw pearl after night disappeared be never near hatton garden know nothing of pawnshop mention of jew owner name of moss be unknown to in short captain shackel deny accusation jacob in wise put about by denial winked one eye became vulgarly familiar that be right sonny stick to said be only chance of saving neck see here though johnson added in more threatening tone hold in hollow of hand have got schooner of sort a be sailing round horn in to do trading

sudden like finland 'ull give twelve hour to think about finland be with guess so first mate be coming here to smash for murdering sweetheart sent off to uncle carwell come in place being milder like well what be to be done nothing so far a be concerned can go twelve hour son threatened captain making for door be five hundred pound to gaol gallows for figure out own way so long wrinkled embodiment of evil left room with utmost nonchalance evidently captain jacob be satisfied that game be in own hand left to johnson gave up to survey of position be almost in despair be not first disagreeable interview through have gone that day for before funeral brand have be with urging to flight in desire to save johnson avert disgrace from bethgamul korah have broken promise to slade have related discovery of stolen curtain cord tri coloured silken rope have be taken from study tri coloured silken rope have be used to strangle tera be one same certainly seemed so who must have stolen who must have committed murder johnson be strong in consciousness of own innocence be sustained by belief in justice of god evidence against be so explicit that must not see how difficult must be to extricate from position in be placed have be near field very night on tera have be killed there debt have be paid by person whom must not even name cord used to strangle girl have be taken from study public opinion be dead against a actual criminal wretched man knew not how best to combat evil how to disprove evidence felt that be in net mesh of be gradually closing round be better perhaps to adopt brand suggestion fly lest worse must befall be friendly advice said johnson to with groan yet dare accept after how do know brand be friend if be true friend must hardly spy on on shackel behalf suggested flight may be snare to make inculpate selling of pearl how can show did not sell be in london shackel swears that saw enter abraham moss shop murderer must have be disguised a in order to throw guilt on shoulder what can do tell thing to chard then stand in immediate danger of arrest can offer defence fly by doing make tacit acknowledgment of guilt o god in thy mercy inspire with plan of action tera honour good name gone now life be in danger what will do to help paced up down narrow room in frenzy of anguish futile thought then growing calmer determined to question mother a to tera movement behaviour on night disappeared might be that girl have have enemy of whom knew nothing might perchance have let fall word if followed up might be likely to elucidate mystery of terrible death in case there be chance that mother might know something must prove of use to help drowning man will clutch at straw johnson in state of distraction looked on mother a straw went to look for hope of aid be faint still be hope be something mother said a watched peeling potato want to tell what bithiah did on night disappeared johnson looked up querulously name of murdered girl disturbed gave pious moan such a sometimes gave vent to in chapel when moved by word of sermon bithiah george oh talk of have gone into outer darkness be not quite satisfied about soul misery have have over poor heathen must believe bithiah be not heathen mother christian duly received into fold tell did bithiah do on evening nothing more than usual replied mr johnson with moan be mostly in bedroom attending to clothes be quite angry at george indeed be for supper be behind must not help indeed after leaving room sat in parlour like fine lady talking to miss arnott what cried johnson seizing on admission be miss arnott here on that evening did tell george of course did miss arnott asked not to a did not wish to know about quarrel with bithiah amaze mother why must miss arnott quarrel in house ah moaned mr johnson wagging head over potato why indeed heart of man likewise woman be bad wicked miss arnott bithiah quarrelled over son johnson looked at mother in amazement quarrelled over said blankly loved bitter smile curved minister lip at least bithiah did not said nonsense replied mr johnson why even struck miss arnott out of love for be glad be gone be sorry be dead must not have son marry heathen besides be most careless about housekeeping too 'd much better marry miss arnott george be not young be rich godly hated bithiah johnson waited to hear more returned to study miss arnott loved hated bithiah word rang in ear fresh thought be born of at first refused to entertain forced upon formed into question into series of question have miss arnott followed strangled bithiah be miss arnott who have concealed girl body in field have frequently be in study have quarrelled with bithiah on very night of latter disappearance so might have stolen cord killed tera be actress once muttered johnson in spite of grace may have yielded to temptation shuddered even if woman doe love must not have lost soul by murder to put end to new doubt with be battling johnson made up mind to call on miss arnott since rumour against have be rife in town have be shy of going out in instance there be need for to go far miss arnott be next door neighbour very few step must bring to door only broken fence of slab divided garden from there be really need for to step outside boundary of own ground however determined to pay call with due ceremony putting on tall hat stepped out of own gate through of miss arnott whilom actress be tall stately woman have be beautiful be even now not without remains of early beauty figure be still shapely graceful not even somewhat formless garment now wore must hide completely curve of figure in truth be forty year of age although life of rigorous asceticism denial made look much older eye be large dark wonderfully eloquent in expression there be mistaking look of devotion with fixed on johnson a be shown into drawing room be indeed honour said giving hand with much grace pray sit down mr johnson must have tea thank replied minister who felt rather uncomfortable in presence have come to talk seriously miss arnott be duty call a pastor asked woman biting lip have come to talk religion to have come to talk about bithiah miss arnott thin hand clenched on lap flashed anxious glance on visitor about poor murdered heathen yes about tera although be heathen do know miss arnott be accused of having murdered have heard lie said miss arnott with quiet scorn need hardly tell that believe thank mother tell that saw bithiah shortly before left house fancied might have said something in presence likely to throw light perhaps on darkness of mystery miss arnott flushed through sallow skin kept black eye on minister asked mother to say nothing about meeting remarked angrily bithiah acted like savage be know did miss arnott be deeply sorry to know be of course because poor girl passion be of partially uncivilized being that so far forgot a to strike did strike said miss arnott drawing long breath struck tore ear ring from left ear be ring of gold hand sleeve caught in so roughly that clasp gave way ear bled from savage attack be deeply grieved said johnson horrified at instance of tera savage nature a have said be half civilized be sufficiently civilized to steal ear ring however retorted miss arnott never got back must see to what did quarr johnson stopped suddenly for remembered what mother have said be cause of quarrel quarrelled about said miss arnott in low voice yes can now acknowledge love for without shame while be prosperous popular with stainless name kept silent there be other course open to now that be despised accused of murder can tell how dear be to if have not come to to day must still have told minister rose to foot horrified at bold a seemed to shameless confession miss arnott stammered can not listen to must go stay cried with theatrical gesture have claim on claim on replied johnson must not understand miss arnott looked at steadily be who paid debt said chapter x fresh piece of evidence johnson made further attempt to leave sat down again be too much taken aback to speak yet mechanically repeated word of miss arnott a if more clearly to convey meaning to mind paid debt for what reason may ask because love how did know that owed money inquired minister ignoring confession in truth confused beyond measure miss arnott smiled indebtedness be everybody secret replied quietly servant found account carelessly left lying about a servant will talked about freely must not hear something of gossip in fact heard be in difficulty wondered how best must help decided that first thing to do be to obtain list of liability without knowledge of course why so have spoken openly to must not have accepted help oh believe know proud nature not even devotional life have have effect upon at least must have wanted to know reason for wishing to help must not have given at time for stood well with world then can tell to now in one word love love for love of one christian for hope no be not miss arnott struck breast theatrically whole attitude now be reminiscent of early profession be love of woman for man passion once in lifetime be born in breast of mortal woman ay of man be artificial creation of christianity speak wickedly said minister agitated shocked speak humanly a woman whose life happiness be at stake misunderstand mr johnson joined denomination knowing full well that be for salvation of immortal soul be called to grace left life of amusement worldly vanity old leaven be here here struck breast again for ten year have laboured to erase evil of past life have laboured in vain when saw loved even faith seemed a nothing then beside hope of becoming wife wife wife let say came between creator try a must to banish from thought in vain in vain in vain be prayer nature be nature be too strong for love love let else go miss arnott really can not listen to said johnson absolute abandonment scandalized pained rose to go sit down said imperiously must understand other first then let discus position see how best can escape danger threatens may be able to help think so johnson shook head despondently nevertheless resumed seat will see woman wit can oftentimes achieve more than man logic order for woman to be silent be mistake on part of st paul nine men out of ten owe what be best in life to advice of wife mother tell how matter stand with believe be glad to make confidante miss arnott god know need friend be friend more than friend have not proved at least desire for welfare trivial perhaps of action in paying bill show that be who placed receipt on study table johnson looked up quickly then be who took away bill be rejoined miss arnott composedly what else must do be necessary must have list of creditor so watched at window to see where left account came through fence divide house from mine know be broken in several part then be footstep heard be mr johnson saw looking at pearl account feared lest in great stress might be tempted to sell girl treasure determined to have bill on hearing step came out left on table yes did must not see of course not moment saw move stepped back into own ground replaced pearl in bag when looked round be behind fence watching then when saw go out into street seized opportunity ran in quickly took bill copied name address of creditor with amount owing to day so later restored account during absence then went to london paid one of creditor one promised absolute silence one day watched opportunity placed receipt on desk looked gloomily at woman seemed to attach little importance to what have done there be nothing theatrical about now told quite simply kept looking at have done kindness said thank for by doing have unconsciously added to difficulty of position be known that debt have be paid be suspected of having stolen bithiah pearl in order to pay how be to repudiate easily enough can tell congregation of bethgamul what have told may exonerate in part miss arnott will be severely censured by congregation for having accepted monetary aid from woman stranger so to speak there be two answer to replied miss arnott quietly in first place aided without knowledge in second have only to tell congregation that be promised wife one of can say word johnson became agitated can not say that be promised wife said can not lie to why need be lie can not marry love must learn to love such passion a mine surely deserves return must not be most ungrateful of men have not done best to serve did not ask to alone know that mr johnson one else doe if choose to confess truth to congregation will be exonerated if say accepted help wittingly willingly there be nothing for to do to amend position by saying that be to marry miss arnott place in most difficult position be just also show way out of way can not dare not take said minister desperately then woman passion got better of rose furious yet dare to slight reject love have saved from disgrace oh know well that loved bithiah that wretched heathen creature be dead be glad that be dead for now there can be hope for mad passion must forget must marry will marry will not said johnson rising in turn speaking word distinctly overstep bound of modesty miss arnott love never must love heart be buried in grave of tera woman turned pale sank back into chair then be wickedness in vain moaned what do mean asked minister be struck by peculiarity of phrase know well what mean have fought that woman for have beaten once be out of way thought must win for seems be wrong yet what can do without good name be gone be suspected of murdering girl of robbing of paying debt with wage of sin do think congregation will keep a preacher will be cast out of fold will be disgraced penniless where will go what will do without name without money be rich can save refuse help god will help said johnson moving towards door know be innocent will god help cried miss arnott wildly know that be not innocent go go leave to reap harvest of folly have loved too well be reward leave say go looked so furious yet so imperious in wrath wrath of woman scorned that minister left room without word in present state of mind be idle to argue with deep in thought johnson returned to home have expected interview to end differently most assuredly have not anticipated that element of love must so have dominated miss arnott mad passion quarrel with dead girl payment of debt thing perplexed sorely knew not what to think of knowledge that be so attractive to woman gave pleasure on contrary rather did cause to shudder to wince a at contact of evil must release from snare murmured to that can only be done by paying back money yet where be to get five hundred pound be hampered on side if bribe shackel will accuse of selling poor tera pearl already be suspected of murder one be working against be best perhaps to follow brand suggestion fly here may be arrested at moment position be terrible did not see way out of at more thought more perplexed confused became at length seized hat went out in hope that fresh air rapid motion must clear brain knowing how unpopular be kept away from town climbed hill by lonely path here in meditation jostled against man coming opposite way stranger be tall slender a brown a tera have be keen black eye hawk like nose must belong only to romany having seen before johnson have difficulty in recognizing man pharaoh lee said minister stopping in surprise did not know be here be with people on common yonder replied pharaoh gloomily came back other day rye on very pleasant errand be sorry to hear that pharaoh what be matter woman be matter a usual d remember zara lovell rye yes be to marry be now husband wife pharaoh brow grew black muttered gipsy oath will never be husband wife in life rye whatever may be in next said bitterly zara fell in love with one of gentile masher here have gone back to who be wish knew cried lee fiercely 'd knife hush hush rebuked johnson shivering at thought of murder must not speak like be dangerous not always rye why gorgio cove killed girl here other day tell have not be caught dare say deceived be talking of bithiah know what name be body be found in cornfield be body of ward bithiah explained johnson sadly must remember pharaoh dark handsome girl job cried gipsy smiting thigh come to now be like gentle romany in look so be rye be why did kill who man a did deceived doubt strangled be wrong pharaoh be love tragedy how bithiah came by death one know beg of not to let terrible crime form precedent in dealing with zara where be now know said lee becoming sullen again be up north asked to marry over poker tongs a 'd be vowed for month to one then told of marriage in gentile way with gorgio tried to get name out of knew how ready knife must be refused to tell in night ran away a guessed 'd come back here to husband moved people down a quick a must here be where zara be know curse on hush swear lee who be man know have idea a to who be yes be man called slade mayne by name be always hanging round camp when be here last zara be with oftener than liked believe be one other pharaoh must be wrong slade policeman have be married for quite year although mr mayne be still bachelor be probable that will make miss carwell wife so see can be of who can swear to retorted lee gorgios make nothing of deceiving woman folk be not of race law be not for if zara be not married to one of two gentile speak of know who be married to can tell if choose will force to speak out added gipsy fiercely when know truth will lee implore to hing rash will mend honour in own way rye be oath with dramatic declaration on lip lee swung off down hill to escape further reproof entreaty johnson knowing fierce nature of wanderer looked after with air of doubt when pharaoh evil passion be roused struck at once swift true a wounded snake seemed a if tera murder be to be followed by johnson sighed a thought of have happened so suddenly to trouble hitherto smoothly flowing current of life since have fallen in love with tera there have be nothing trouble must not see how where be to end anxious minded hopeless of aid minister resumed upward way shortly reached brow of hill where corn land stretched towards poldew unconsciously foot have led into very path along bithiah must have passed to mysterious death omen chilled for moment shaking off superstition a incompatible with calling a teacher stepped resolutely along grassy way meandered through stubble field power drew almost against will towards fatal spot a walked along caught sight of burly figure bending down in field a approached recognized jeremiah slade knowing man ambition interest took in case johnson wondered what be doing so near place where body have be found curiosity being excited crossed ridgy furrow walked up to policeman what be looking for slade jeremiah straightened light came into dull blue eye ai lookin ' now said cunningly a have found something already something a be worth findin too what be seem mighty anxious to know sir be constable reply with suspicious glance naturally wish to know anything bearing upon fate of poor bithiah ah grunted slade there be more than sir a want information of kind why be so perticler may ask if ai offence for two reason rejoined johnson quietly one be that wish assassin of poor ward to be secured punished other be that desire to clear own character from suspicion have fallen upon mean sir a folk suspect of murder do need hardly say that be innocent well said policeman reflectively of course sir be bound to say that to save own neck thought a did one time for there ai denyin a evidence be dead against what have found now 'as altered bit really then be good enough to exonerate in own mind believe guilty said johnson ironically not a principal anyway be come to a poor girl be strangled by woman woman how do know that 'cos found on very spot where girl body lay slade opened hand in palm lay golden ear ring johnson recognized a miss arnott chapter xi thou art man two men looked at ear ring slade with triumph johnson with dismay there be doubt belonged to miss arnott have frequently seen wearing asked how came to be found on spot where body have lain miss arnott declaration that tera have wrenched ear ring from ear have carried away might be mere fiction carried away a be by feeling be impossible to rely upon what said if statement be untrue discovery of ornament on scene of crime went to show that miss arnott have be on spot there perhaps during struggle with victim have lost ear ring in word piece of evidence inculpated somewhat seriously remembering agitation strange remark johnson began to think that have committed murder out of jealousy be very feasible more thought of more likely seemed minister determined to keep suspicion to be not for on whose account have sinned if have sinned to denounce be for sake have broken that terrible sixth commandment therefore judged right if not righteous to deny knowledge of ornament have seen before sir asked slade keeping watchful eye on face of minister answered johnson with effort to appear calm never saw before doe not belong to bithiah wore ornament in ear then must be property of other woman probably woman who killed mr johnson how do know woman killed ear ring point way anyhow expect two woman met quarrelled about something one perhaps came to blow perhaps while murderess be trying to strangle girl have torn from ear be evident that woman mixed up in matter slade paused looked again at ornament be gipsy ear ring said how do know slade policeman scratched head in embarrassment flat circle of gold be ai well sir have seen gipsy woman wearing thing of sort zara lovell for instance observed johnson with sudden inspiration zara lovell stammered slade retreating step looking anything comfortable what do know of mr johnson only so much a learned from lee lee pharaoh lee gipsy have seen be speaking with quarter of hour before met slade be looking for zara be lost then must seem so pharaoh be to have married told that be already married to one in neighbourhood then ran away from gipsy camp thinking came on here to husband whoever be lee followed be now looking for slade said johnson gravely gipsy declared that mr mayne must be husband of girl slade changed from red to white evaded minister eye knew zara well enough year ago said doggedly have liking for one a to marriage never came into mind have wife now only one ever have if hears tale lord know what will do be never done talking of zara a be well mr mayne oh liked zara too think intended to marry why be set on marryin ' miss carwell who else be there that know girl be intimate with policeman reflectively slipped ear ring into pocket began to think suddenly started slapped thigh why did think of before cried finland be finland of course nonsense said minister somewhat sharply for mention of sailor made wince finland be in love with bithiah what be matter asked question with astonishment for slade with uncouth glee be performing kind of war dance lord said joyfully how plain be how plain what be murder of course be woman killed bithiah tera call be pretty conclusive well woman be zara what gipsy girl pharaoh be looking for oh be looking for said slade gleefully wo find be made scarce because of murder ear ring be zara know now mr johnson saw pair of 'em in ear finland made love to zara last year be dead gone on expect heard of going on with girl came back to make thing hot know if finland married if did zara hurried back here to claim a husband dare say met tera here in field fought over man tera tore ear ring from zara while be being strangled then zara hid body in field ran away be a clear a day slade danced again will get to poldew sure enough knowing well to whom ear ring belonged minister must not believe in zara guilt without compromising miss arnott slade theory be not to be demolished best must do be to protest against a being too fanciful why have more reason to suspect declared true enough replied slade circumstanshal evidence ai good stuff though admit be going on lot in suspecting poor girl be strangled with window know about interrupted policeman soon found that out prove a took cord always have doubt seeing be taken two three day afore murder must have made ready that time say to myself 'if killed girl did in rage so must have prepared cord beforehand ' did not kill tera protested johnson vehemently never saw after left house although searched for round field knowing be favourite walk loved too well to injure hair of head a to debt suspected doubt that be to pay killed have be discharged who paid there be harm in telling that slade promise to keep what tell secret until bid speak filled with curiosity slade gave required promise when informed that miss arnott be johnson benefactor chuckled so significantly a to bring blush to pale cheek of minister nevertheless be main point entertained suspicion against woman still harped on probability of zara guilt for might have stolen cord from study said eagerly gipsy be always stealing thing zara be never in house that know of replied johnson dryly declaration rather disconcerted slade rallied under blow when new idea struck dare say that tera took cord being bright pretty thing why must why must retorted slade be a broad a be long talk a like sir be in mind a zara killed tera stole pearl johnson reflected last remark set thinking a to advisability of telling slade about shackel proposed blackmail man seemed intelligent trustworthy ally must be invaluable if only to protect from machination of captain jacob forthwith johnson related to slade dilemma in be placed asked for policeman advice help for swear said with earnestness while in london did not go near hatton garden how be to prove 'tai difficult answered slade give couple of pound let go up to london will find out from jew who sold pearl can get leave asked johnson catching at idea oh yes for couple of day thereabouts then go hard up a be will have five pound for expense trouble who did think sold pearl must not have be zara seeing that seller be man will tell what think when come back said slade doubtfully let go to house sir get money if captain come again to just tell a matter be in hand of police wo have trouble with after will bet subsequent event proved slade to be correct johnson gave five pound having obtained leave for forty eight hour man took train to london with address of jew in pocket day after departure shackel made appearance in full belief that johnson must pay sum have demanded when minister referred to police captain jacob be considerably taken aback by victim daring protested loudly told police have yer snarled well guess want of kind messing up business 'd better straighten out thing son pay will not pay one penny answered johnson gaining courage at man manifest desire to retreat matter lie with police now if trouble more will give in charge captain jacob one eye twinkled in very evil fashion grew a red a jaundiced complexion must permit will jail will yer piped shrilly reckon two can play at game scare crow psalm singing bun faced word of sort out go said minister with spirit shackel be not to be silenced like sea captain be accustomed to implicit obedience thought to get own way by adoption of bullying tone johnson be not one of sailor moreover vituperative insolence of little scoundrel have roused so when captain jacob still proceeded to hector minister picked up be of great weight carrying out of window dropped over gate there foul mouthed extortioner said johnson loudly be place come back here again will hand over to police by thunder will see police replied shackel

to be proved said herbert defence of minister drew approving smile from rachel johnson did indeed look ill a stood on rostrum under yellow glare of oil lamp gazed down on stern face of people countenance be set like flint even of woman be harder more unsympathetic than usual felt that in heart already condemned sight of old mother weeping quietly in corner brought comfort if one else believed in innocence did brother johnson said brand rising a minister opened bible before speak from sacred volume must know if be worthy to do so be lip undefiled be heart clean within yes replied

'thou art man chapter xii welcome witness assuredly congregation have reason to complain that anticipated sensation be not forthcoming there be agitated rustle through chapel one looked eagerly at johnson wondering what reply must make to accusation of brand for moment so minister stood silent with upraised face lip moved in silent prayer for be seeking from god aid be denied to by man miss arnott white trembling violently leaned forward in expectation of denial felt certain must come for quite minute there be dead silence be broken by accused man o lord thou knowest said in word of jeremiah bemember visit revenge on persecutor paused looked quietly at rugged face of brand brother korah continued minister have borne false witness against be innocent of crime must place on shoulder what evidence can bring forward to prove that speak truly let hear ground of accusation may reply to a best can brand be considerably surprised at calmness of speech be very different from what have expected glanced with embarrassment at farmer carwell will question demanded surely brother answered carwell gravely meanest criminal have right to hearing question pastor that may learn if be still to teach if must be cast out of emmanuel fold ask for nothing better than such examination cried johnson stand here a must at judgment seat to defend name life begin brother korah on what

such act never saw girl dead took pearl from body where be know no more than do yet debt be paid be paid in full by by one whose name decline to give brand looked down with sardonic smile if honest enough man method of conducting examination be certainly open to criticism statement be incredible declared a rule men debt be not paid by unknown benefactor nevertheless mine be paid said johnson firmly besides benefactor be not unknown be ignorant of name doubtless be not name repeated korah in surprise then be woman do dare to stand there state that permitted debt to be paid by woman state nothing admit nothing debt be paid by proceeds of pearl cried brand believe fiction about woman if killed bithiah will have murderer for pastor if woman a say paid debt be not fit to occupy pulpit must appear that add profligacy to stop cried miss arnott rising coming forward with sweep style of lady macbeth forbid brother korah to blame pastor unjustly debt have be paid by woman looked round to emphasize next word bespeak attention of congregation be that woman said drawing up there be pause during miss arnott dramatic instinct be strong enough to appreciate situation there stood defiant calm with eye of amazed congregation fastened on johnson remained in seat waiting development brand taken by surprise stared at dumbfounded in old day there must have be quick curtain on situation probably much applause afterwards miss arnott in spite of conversion religion must not thrill at intrusion of melodrama into real life certainly made most of part yes repeated touching breast be woman who will dare to accuse of acting otherwise than in christian spirit be told to that pastor be in difficulty about money a be rich determined to discharge debt ye one burden saith gospel in obedience to command took pastor burden on shoulder having obtained list of creditor matter not how went to london there paid demand in full might do good in secret made paid promise to say word of deed pastor sought to learn name must not until revealed to did so said miss arnott in grandest voice because be accused of stealing pearl to discharge liability of crime must fix upon brother brand be innocent paid money still one spoke least of brand for realized that accusation have fallen to piece hopelessly miss arnott looked around saw opportunity for making effective exit seizing swept with measured step towards door there paused stretched out arm towards brand 'he that diggeth pit will fall into ' declaimed still facing congregation withdrew slowly in transpontine theatre intensity of scene must have brought down house a be good people simply sat silent stared johnson be first to recover rose solemnly honour have be vindicated said brother korah demand that withdraw accusation yes yes withdraw accusation cried congregation awaking from apathy pastor be innocent brand made a if to speak wished to question johnson concerning missing curtain cord at moment one of more enthusiastic member struck up well known others joined in lustily drowned word of missionary seeing that sympathy of greatest number be with johnson be wise enough to withdraw a singing grew louder people became more excited descended rostrum left chapel outside night be moonless starless hardly have minister taken dozen step when arm be seized by brand man be shaking with nervous excitement brother johnson said in agitated voice believe bear ill will accused in good faith lord hath spoken now know did not steal pearl to pay debt have doubt can also explain how cord with bithiah be strangled came to be missing from study that fear at present moment can not replied minister simply must believe in innocence now do do look on a enemy acted for glory of lord must have cut off a withered branch see mistake now think of pray only a friend believe accused in good faith brother korah let say more about matter brand did not speak wrung minister hand hard darted back to chapel johnson took way homeward wondering at rigid nature of man who must have ruined in honesty if thy right hand offend thee cut off be precept upon brand have acted for miss arnott evidence must have turned johnson adrift on world with dishonoured name endangered life pastor shuddered at missionary rigour silently admitted honesty of purpose then standing under star took off hat thanked god for having aided in trouble there must be question now of leaving bethgamul a drew near house saw dark form at gate few step brought beside then recognized miss arnott started a came up looked at in glare of gaslight eye be full of tear miss arnott said johnson clasping passive hand thank from soul for noble way in defended to night be only right whispered woman trembling at touch know be innocent recollecting slade discovery recalling own suspicion johnson laid hand on arm do know who murdered how must know then caught sight of expression on face shrank back surely suspect said in tone of horror miss arnott

round might have killed bithiah a say lost own ear ring in struggle if be mine bithiah must have taken with touched minister timidly believe in innocence yes be sure of thank god for must stand one doubting before johnson must stop excited woman have bent down kissed hand next moment be gone with thoughtful face johnson walked inside pondering on great love bore feeling be touched thought more about than have done since death of bithiah be possible that void in heart great a be must ever be filled up very thought of such thing seemed treason against dead next day received letter from slade caused considerable surprise contained certain instruction for own safety be necessary for to carry out amongst other thing slade stated that by threatening to denounce jew a receiver of stolen good

jacob will sling overboard will take conthtable with will have money screeched irate shylock now come along please must get warrant said slade taking arm of mr moss pulling out of room left alone with johnson chard sailor made attempt to leave sat down with sulky expression on face betrayed not least concern must seem that be not fully alive to danger of position chard looked at with bland satisfaction have better make clean breast of man said jack scowled at rudely turned chair so a to face minister mr johnson said quietly be honest man amongst land shark can trust seem to be in tight place swear be a innocent a unborn babe shackel can prove innocence so ask to take note to from johnson who have love for shackel after way in little scoundrel have tried to blackmail must have refused chard at finland back made sign to to accept trust inspector thought that jack be about to write to shackel asking to destroy evidence might implicate still further in crime at event thought letter must probably prove of value directly indirectly be glad therefore when johnson understanding signal acceded to finland request certainly will deliver note said minister gravely only hope will be able to free from critical position do believe killed tera if sold pearl certainly look very like replied johnson seeing that be taken from dead body yet a know loved girl be willing to give pearl confess have doubt a to guilt besides honestly admit that think be bad man frivolous godless profligate doubt be far from being murderer mr finland black a be appearance against can not bring to believe in guilt jack looked at minister with friendly smile stretched out large brown hand be white man said coolly will take more stock in piety when be out of fix shake minister hesitated for although really did believe in young sailor innocence yet man have be rival found difficult to be on easy term with however better nature prevailed shook hand that heartens up lot said jack cheerfully there be balm in gilead after a rachel say now will score line to blamed old idiot who have caused breeze who be that asked chard finland looked at again ignored completely in silence sat down in chair before desk vacated by minister chard kept eye on smiled at foolish manner in man be giving away honestly speaking have ill will towards jack insolent behaviour of sailor be not without effect determined when warrant came to spare in way that finland might be innocent inspector did not consider at have sold pearl a be proved plainly by evidence of moss must only have taken from dead body man coolness amazed for jack scribbled away at note quite nonchalantly utterly indifferent to sword of damocles swung over head chard marvelled what defence must have in mind to make johnson looked out of window also be puzzled by behaviour of finland on face of evidence against be impossible to doubt complicity yet minister must in way divine man motive for murder must have have pearl for asking there be need for to kill poor girl moreover finland have loved dearly be incredible that for cause must have killed yet have sold pearl there must be doubt about be nephew of man in whose field body have be so skilfully hidden how to reconcile conflicting element johnson must not see be still puzzling matter out in own mind when jack finished letter with cheery laugh will laugh on other side of mouth soon said chard testily guess be biz retorted finland addressing inspector for first time habit to squeal afore be hurt mr johnson here be letter will take kind of if will deliver to old ramshackel a soon a can will see to mr finland replied johnson slipping note into pocket whither be followed by chard with greedy eye trust for own sake uncle that will prove innocent of fearful charge well say a have got ace somewhere sir ai time to plank down yet may smoke must if be interposed chard will not get tobacco in prison know manner guess if be to turn key chard vouchsafed reply three waited in silence for return of slade in surprisingly short space of time considering errand constable returned in uniform with warrant for finland arrest now that worst have come jack turned trifle pale slipped pipe into pocket with uneasy laugh chard seemed well pleased take to lock up slade ordered will have up before magistrate at poldew to morrow will remain here mr johnson must have few word come on said slade now typical jack in office laid hand on finland collar show off mate said finland twisting free will go quiet enough let walk arm in arm then will take for brother 'tai no use kicking up dust know good bye mr chard will put spoke in wheel before crook be straightened out mr johnson be square man thank for kindness forget to give letter to skipper promise will be delivered evening jack slade departed quite affectionately arm in arm a sailor have suggested chard waited till be fairly on way then turned to minister peremptorily now then sir that letter if please johnson looked astonished ill pleased letter be for captain shackel sir afterwards perhaps first be for think be going to lose chance of making thing safe for scoundrel hanging finland be not scoundrel rejoined johnson quietly indeed begin to think be perfectly innocent a to letter remains in pocket mr johnson want to be unpleasant cried chard looking ugly must remind that be police officer have perfect right to see letter of man under arrest on criminal charge must insist upon handing over to doe law authorize to read letter yes sir doe if man be free must not law permit to gather evidence can in support of case that letter may be invaluable give to please johnson hesitated saw weakness of position wished to assist finland for believed to be innocent moreover did not wish without strongest reason to fail in trust have undertaken still chard a representative of law have right might on side if did not give up letter willingly must doubt be forced to on consideration decided must hing yield here be letter said taking from pocket trust will deliver to address when have done with depends entirely upon content said chard grimly untwisted piece of paper finland have not put into envelope reason for be soon apparent chard looked at carefully then swore mr chard reproved johnson why such language inspector clapped letter on table before johnson be that enough to make man swear rascal have written letter in cypher ran a follows illustration coded message ca understand asked johnson puzzled can snapped inspector picking up cypher not bit what will do now take to man who doe who be why said chard coolly man to whom be written captain shackel will make read to then chard went off left alone johnson sighed if finland be innocent thought fear will never know who killed poor tera chapter xiv amazing incident grimleigh hummed like hive in swarming season through slade via tattling wife news of finland arrest be spread with rapidity of influenza a usual rumour increased a snowball doe that evening town knew how finland have met tera by accident near carwell field how have quarrelled with strangled her fled with pearl to sell in london buy schooner circumstantial account be given with wealth of detail did credit to imagination of who repeated there be who declined to believe that so popular genial man a jack must be guilty of cold blooded crime man whole life gave lie to amongst who refused credence to accusation be carwell old farmer be greatly agitated by news of arrest forthwith sought out chard at grimleigh police office shortly before inspector departed for poldew for last hour chard with cypher letter in pocket have be seeking captain jacob without success skipper be not on schooner in town chard feared must be forced to postpone delivery of letter until next morning must be inconvenient a be bound to be at poldew when finland be brought up a must be next day before magistrate inspector be determined that one must deliver letter for intended to force shackel to translate finally chard resolved to take jack with to poldew on night leave slade behind with instruction to find bring on captain shackel next morning have just arranged with slade when carwell made appearance perturbed angry what be demanded old man anxiously hear that nephew have be arrested quite right mr carwell on charge of murdering native girl who be ward of mr johnson tera bithiah know name better than do be impossible that jack killed inspector loved girl be prepared to marry charge be ridiculous doubt replied chard coolly ca myself see reason for crime have proof positive that sold tera pearl in london bought share in dayspring with proceeds jack never told that understood from that be property of captain shackel shackel say differently mr carwell told that nephew bought share what be more paid for on nail impossible have not money oh yes have moss declared that finland got two thousand pound for pearl to obtain killed tera wo believe cried carwell growing very red jack be honest lad own sister son if be guilty must not return here into jaw of danger if be in fund must not want money from risk liberty neck to come here for oh so want money from doe see reason to deny truth nephew came here to ask for five hundred pound want that amount to pay seaman wage provision boat for cruise to south sea if killed girl sold pearl for amount say must not require more paid away proceeds of pearl for share in dayspring must have purchased share for le than two thousand whole boat must be bought for three be of great tonnage chard looked puzzled certainly there be reason in what carwell said finland behaviour be most inconsistent ca understand nephew mr carwell said inspector if be innocent why doe not prove innocence will if give chance have given chance said chard nettled by imputation cast on fair dealing refuse to give explanation moreover if can exonerate will have opportunity of doing so to morrow morning at poldew when be brought before magistrate can see now certainly slade will take to try persuade to tell truth if go on a be doing now will be committed for trial bail will be refused crime with be charged be serious remember jack have committed crime said carwell hotly let see hardly have old man left office with slade when door be pushed open captain jacob danced in little man be in furious rage language be worthy of occasion swore at chard for quite two minute without repeating be only when paused for want of breath that inspector managed to get in word come come said bristling with official dignity ca have sort of thing here must not behave in way must must screeched shackel shaking fist why son of gun ai run in mate how d think be going to light out for island without finland will light out a call alone if finland ca prove innocence of murder murder great csar did kill gal oh yes did know see here chard caught excited man by arm tried to blackmail mr johnson by stating that sold pearl now knew quite well that finland sold what do mean by game mind own business will run own circus snarled jacob blackmailing be business said chard go out of here until explain sha explain anything yes will letter of finland for instance chard spread out cypher on table jacob pounced on like hawk ran dirty finger along mystic line then turned to inspector with injured air what be bally rot asked know look like chinese guess finland wrote for to read said chard stupefied by unexpected ignorance then why tarnation must write in english snapped captain ca read hen scratch inspector looked glum must not say whether jacob spoke truly falsely be possible that finland might be playing trick jesting with dignity of law on other hand seemed incredible that one in so serious position must act in such way chard looked hard at sallow face of skipper apparently be speaking truth face be set like mask then new idea struck mr inspector if ca read one on board ship can declared well must smile d 'ye think carry university on board if finland have not meant letter to be read must not have written know cypher lie will knock head off if give lie retorted shackel let see finland will ask what dickens mean by playing low down on old man wo see said inspector sharply for know sight of cypher may be signal to bring together may wish to gain instruction from finland regarding removal of evidence take instruction bawled skipper why cuss ai quarter deck astride 'ud be dandy fine thing for captain jacob to obey order of second rate squawking swivel eyed son of rum puncheon here gim that letter will git chard snatched cypher off table put into pocket said if ca read be meant for stealing property now lord 'd like to give dozen at gangway 'd like to put in gaol

wash wanted to put execution on barky jerusalem hound will have law of for said inspector turning to paper clear out now man report at poldew to morrow will be worse for captain shackel backed towards door with evil grin will be there bet snapped will have holy time with can tell have seen better man than made out of mud have by time chard patience be quite exhausted caught jacob in arm dropped outside door then instructing constable to keep eye on re entered office be second time little sea captain dignity have suffered reversal anathematized chard with horrible fluency inspector be well used to such flower of speech affected little carwell returned to tell of failure nephew have be be civil grateful to refused altogether to make confidant farmer have begged commanded threatened without success jack gave clearly to understand that have own way of conducting own affair way intended to pursue be not to be drawn at so be that heavy hearted disappointed carwell be obliged to leave lad after reporting failure to chard went home in state of depression hour later inspector left grimleigh with prisoner drove over to poldew in truth have be exciting day for poldew too johnson set out early next morning on foot be particularly anxious to be present when finland be brought before magistrate still believed in jack innocence for life of must not understand reticence stepped out briskly into cool fresh air mind full of case have not gone far before met pharaoh lee thought of slade theory determined to say word two to gipsy good morning lee be glad to meet said gravely particularly wish to speak to about zara have news of rye have be talking to slade policeman about ah know something for sure be with be husband be took away from speak rye speak johnson shook head slade be married to woman said slowly think that zara be in love with man named jack finland what rye with gentile who killed lady have heard talk of be not yet able to say if finland killed ward lee have right because stand accused of such crime to judge guilty of until have have fair chance of proving innocence be to be examined at poldew to day in fact be now on way there to be present at examination whether slade have changed mind in mean while can not say day two back suspected zara of murder will wring neck for if dare to say that cried pharaoh in wrath job how doe make out oh have evidence to go upon may depend then minister related to slade discovery of ear ring deduction have drawn from mentioned too that finland have sold pearl now must seem continued johnson zara on evidence of ear ring killed bithiah out of jealousy robbed dead body of pearl gave to finland to dispose of in london for know may have returned here to take zara off to south sea in schooner bought with money do believe rye frankly believe that ear ring belonged to miss arnott that lost during quarrel with bithiah be probably dropped in field by poor girl when struggled with assailant a to finland notwithstanding disposal of pearl can not make up mind to believe guilty of murder who know rye man will do much for woman sake if sailor loved zara did not loved bithiah pharaoh deliberated for moment will go with to poldew rye said be necessary must hear truth so be lee let hope be what will hear continued way in silence be inclined to speak be late when arrived court house be already crowded johnson garb knowledge of connection with dead girl obtained entrance lee pushing close after managed to secure very good position for seeing hearing jack be already under examination before magistrate elderly gentleman with professionally bland manner prisoner appeared cool composed be apparently not least perturbed at position in found many of grimleigh folk be present amongst carwell

doubt truth of statement did not regard murder with horror of european did not think be particularly great sin in spite of christian training jack loved girl wished to marry particularly a marriage must place comfortably influentially in semi savage life found most congenial seemed that tera have killed unhappy zara in most cold blooded way with slightest of motif did not care to take murderess to bosom in mean time tera sat on cabin floor in sulky frame of mind privately considered that have tricked rachel out of money in very clever way deserved praise rather than blame must not understand why lover made fuss over small matter a murder of wretched girl must have killed dozen in koiau without causing least annoyance so sat still weeping sulking very much inclined with pettish temper of childish nature to end whole trouble by throwing overboard in spite of conversion education poor wilful tera have yet to learn b c of civilization tera said jack at length in grave voice be serious matter see that be whimpered girl did love zara did wish to kill dear kill tera looked up in amazement did kill finland be so dumfounded that must only stare did not kill repeated tera rising what make think did why why said so of course did to rachel must not give money wanted unless told who killed zara know who did must think of one else so said killed tera jack arm be round voice be shaking

lends money must see about will pay back principal interest in year two wish have known of intention before put oar in lass did what did for right pipe eye again jack patted hand now let go back to uncle will see rachel square trouble want to go back jack have come to stay here ca do tera will stay here said tera doggedly let marry go away jack scratched head did not exactly know how to deal with unreasonable native closed box turned towards door at moment opened to tera profound surprise beheld pharaoh lee chapter xxii truth be pharaoh lee very man in search of whom police be scouring country so astonished be tera at unexpected appearance that must only stare at in silence face sullen lowering lighted up with fierce joy when recognized come from farm said stepping up close to be that gentile beast yet dead stammered girl finding tongue be not going to die duvel swore lee savagely why did not strike harder job for chance will not betray will not say word said tera earnestly be glad when saw stab man be low dog how did come here police look for everywhere except in right place said finland with grin one think lee be aboard with came straight from bethdagon to grimleigh after midnight when be quiet swam out here climbed on board to see skipper when shackel heard story promised to conceal for sake knew have great love for mayne 'd be glad to give lee hand besides added jack

not let go with oh bosh said jack sharply if brand interferes will kick into kingdom come be right with psalm singer have promised to marry so will look after in mean time be not always easy to make tera see sense be a unreasonable a child at present be filled with idea that brand might part from jack thought safe only when on board dayspring indeed now that day of return to koiau be drawing near seemed to be losing little control of have acquired be particularly evidenced by refusal to respond to baptismal name of bithiah jack be by mean far seeing have shrewd suspicion by time tera reached koiau veneer of civilization must have worn off must relapse into wholly savage state natural to however idea troubled very little semi barbarian in many way preferred genuine savage to half baked article while remained in england particularly in grimleigh where rigid uncle lived be necessary to observe certain of propriety of life decided that tera must not possibly return to schooner until be married so after much arguing show of anger induced to come ashore again take up quarter with johnson tolai a tera shadow accompanied pharaoh lee who have once more relapsed into sullen humour of course remained on board have very high opinion of police deemed wise for present at event not to leave place of refuge a tera jack with tolai in close attendance walked arm in arm up hill to minister

formerly be altogether absent since suspicion against have be proved groundless have be able in large degree to resume normal habit incessant mental strain under laboured then have be removed body have responded accordingly spoke now with force decision indignation against brand be in way excusable for to be that in large degree owed terrible trouble have come upon recently that indignation now spurred on must perhaps have forgiven man have be open enemy have struck at in dark have plotted against against very life under cloak of religion brotherly love be very juda a such johnson felt behoved to unmask man therefore be prepared to spare pain to make suspicion certainty judged shrewd young sailor must prove valuable ally result proved judgment to be correct be more than angered at brand said to jack in tone of voice almost foreign to usually gentle manner of speech perhaps notice that longer call ' will be cast from out congregation of bethgamul for have done more than break
