maunders jumped up lucy be waiting for can take month thank said vernon frigidly will give answer then will be 'yes of course ca say anything else say maunders threw laughing glance over shoulder by time must have changed opinion a to being as departed still laughing vernon ran after touched shoulder not as scoundrel breathed with suppressed passion maunders laughter increased chapter ii confidential communication when maunders passed into atrium vernon returned slowly to seat under peristyle here ordered fresh cup of strong coffee to clear brain lighted cigarette sat down to recall late conversation a preliminary to thorough consideration of situation ran over in mind what knew of man who wished to become partner memory showed maunders to be exceedingly unscrupulous person who be ready to do anything to gratify appetite for pleasure vernon recollection carried back to berkshire village of father have be squire mr bedge widow of levantine merchant have taken house in neighbourhood there have settled with nephew constantine maunders seemed that sister have married naturalised greek hence boy christian name a parent be dead mr bedge being without offspring have adopted orphan from what vernon remembered maunders have always be handsome charming little boy who usually got own way by sheer amiability good look have inherited more from greek father than classical face christian name smacked of old constantinople for be crafty clever utterly without moral principle must conceal feeling admirably must scheme for want very dexterously told lie truth with utmost impartiality when either suited end to be gained posing a innocent angel child deceived everyone although outwardly appeared to be unsophisticated babe be in reality little monster of egotism even when be child together vernon from bitter experience have always mistrusted constantine have judged character more accurately than grown up people be invariably taken in by brat cherubic aspect at eton constantine fared le happily be ten year of age when aunt sent there a vernon then be fifteen have asked to look after darling vernon chivalry must not save constantine from well deserved kick thrashing schoolboy be not to be taken in by angel child so constantine did not have happy time however be so diplomatic unscrupulous that managed to scramble through school life fairly well at oxford whither went year after vernon got on better became general favourite because of general pliancy of disposition by mean of same pliancy usually secured selfish end under guise of consistent amiability being quick brained clever if somewhat willow secured degree left university with excellent character since then have be man about town supported by aunt money mr bedge have settled in london at constantine request must refuse nothing yet a vernon judged from what young man have said even mr bedge generosity must not supply maunders with sufficient money to gratify selfish desire have always have for pleasure only income of rothschild must have entirely satisfied craving for delight of existence vernon have be le lucky in life father have speculated rashly three year prior to meeting of young men at athenian club have died comparative pauper thrown on own resource without profession vernon have utilised observant logical faculty to set up in private practice a detective for two year have carried on trade with success without having be found out now that constantine have come on scene vernon felt that there must be trouble of course by taking a partner exposure must be avoided only temporarily maunders be so ready to make mischief that vernon felt must take must get out of business when prosperous by marriage with ida dimsdale must not hesitate to tell truth sole safeguard lay in fact that being tarred with same brush maunders for own social sake might hold tongue be always clever enough to avoid publication of fact to disadvantage really seemed on ground that must be judicious to admit a partner vernon shivered at prospect at best such business a be engaged in be delicate one decidedly unpopular with maunders unscrupulous method might degenerate into series of shady transaction will take month think over thought vernon when have finished coffee cigarette much may happen in thirty day may enable to get out of difficulty then took out watch noted that be ten o'clock just time to see dimsdale yawned when putting on light overcoat in vestibulum vernon thought be strange coincidence that maunders must have mentioned incidentally of course name of man with whom have appointment at half past ten o'clock earlier in day vernon have received pressing note asking to meet writer at colonel towton chamber ralph street st james at hour so a matter of fact two name pertinent to situation have be mentioned dimsdale towton vernon wondered a walked along pall mall what reason must be did not believe in coincidence have sufficient experience of life to doubt existence of chance so mention of name taken in conjunction with appointment must point to problem being worked out vernon believed a thoughtful man must believe that everything be worked out in unseen world before became factor in visible plane be quite prepared to find on assumption that meeting with dimsdale in towton chamber be more important than appeared to be on surface subsequent event proved that be right in conjecture meanwhile a be one thing at time man sauntered leisurely along towards destination wondering what dimsdale wished to see about ex police commissioner be one of very few people who knew of business in covent garden dimsdale have be life long friend of vernon father have welcomed young man with open arm to home be odd that vernon have not fallen in love with ida a nothing must have pleased dimsdale better than to have given daughter money to old friend son fortune in freakish way have decided that vernon must fall in love with lucy corsoon where obstacle must be placed in way of successful wooing so ida arthur have settled contentedly down into brother sister relationship dimsdale be annoyed that pet project of marriage must not come to pas there be help for a must not govern young man affection also be annoyed because vernon when death of father occurred must not let elder man assist however told plan about private inquiry office although ex police commissioner did not wholly approve judged from knowledge of young man detective power that be best use must put talent to more than managed to bring client to spread fame of nemo by dexterous allusion vernon therefore be doing very well in line have struck out for felt duly grateful to dimsdale for assistance thought a walked along ralph street probably old gentleman have found fresh client be odd that colonel towton chamber must have be chosen a meeting place since dimsdale belonged to several club matter whatever be must be very important else dimsdale must have waited until vernon paid weekly visit to hampstead bungalow be only quarter past ten o'clock when vernon arrived thought that must have to wait towton servant intimated that mr dimsdale be watching for visitor in colonel particular sanctum ushered young man into room after relieving of coat colonel did not appear to be present martin dimsdale be smoking in deep arm chair jumped up in boyish way to shake hand warmly always have great regard for arthur vernon room be ordinary apartment comfortably furnished in strictly bachelor fashion scheme of colour be deep green deep red so that appeared somewhat sombre trophy of towton sporting instinct in shape of skin head appeared on wall on floor there be many military portrait group about reminiscent of colonel army life two window be open curtain be pulled back so that room be fairly cool while on table stood syphon glass decanter of whisky together with box of cigar be at mr dimsdale elbow have evidently be passing time in smoking drinking pending young friend arrival be glad to see boy said ex police commissioner pointing to chair sit down make at home towton give full permission to play in yard have peg cigar not too strong please warned vernon accepting cigar sinking into indicated chair have so steady head a yours be cleverer head said dimsdale squirting in potash else must not have asked to meet here nemo oh vernon placed glass beside thought be case why did ask to meet in towton room where be towton at sister ball along with ida miss hest lady corsoon ball dimsdale sat down nodded yes be swell affair a sir julius want to make impression on australian people desire to rope into scheme for making money something to do with mine believe did feel inclined to go although daresay will have to look in later to fetch ida miss hest home wished particularly to see manner assumed portentous gravity so asked towton if must come here make appointment at club what have to say be sacred secret interrupted old gentleman club have many eye many ear better be on safe side oh be all right added with nod on seeing vernon eye stray to open window only look out over roof of house one can hear whisky right cigar drawing well very good now then settled for exhaustive talk old indian officer have certainly not be dried up by hot climate where have spent greater part of life be round tubby rosy faced little man curve gracious contentment face be clean shaven head be bald while sharp grey eye twinkled behind golden rimmed pince nez balanced on unimportant nose with round head round body sphere super imposed on sphere short leg looked like figure of chinese mandarin nodded head like one when wished to emphasise point there be nothing military about in way vernon wondered how so natty neat old gentleman ever came to have command of men appointed to hunt down dacoit in jungle of burmah yet dimsdale official career have be stirring one have done good service in pacifying country after war now have beaten sword into plough share with considerable fortune be spending amiable old age under own fig tree when vernon looked at rotund little man with round rosy face saw before perfectly contented human being very kind hearted one to boot well sir said leaning back comfortably be tiled in a mason say so will be glad to hear what have to tell also be obliged to for seeking out especial case for two special case boy two special case said mr dimsdale wagging head looking more like chinese mandarin than ever have to do with will tell about later other have to do with mr bedge adopted son maunders cried vernon astonished to find that premonition be coming true mean constantine yes do arthur of course do young maunders never did like boy somehow in spite of good look polite manner after be greek like greek be nearly a tricky a armenian be saying lot same be sorry for sake of emily be old friend of emily have have be in love with before married bedge be levantine merchant know dealt in currant cherry jam rest of not bad chap from what remember of far too old husband for emily do mean mr bedge asked vernon vainly endeavouring to stem flow of old man speech of course mean mr bedge call emily because have have be in love with be handsome girl in year good one why look how adopted that rascal ca help thinking young maunders rascal though doe want to marry ida be not to be thought of yes yes emily always be good believe word of not word mr dimsdale bringing fist down on table glared at companion through pince nez believe word of what asked vernon soothingly be coming to be coming to worry hurry mr dimsdale rubbed nose in vexed manner young maunders now eh what have seen young maunders lately be odd must ask said vernon slowly because have just parted from at athenian club have anything to do with arthur be bad lot very bad lot indeed oh be nothing that have done must say to anyone else what be saying to can read character have observed master constantine be so selfish that must boil emily for own gratification if pleased must let be boiled too be a silly over scamp a be selfish towards why do cultivate society eh what be wrong stupid yes yes stupid wrong have seen so very much of since left oxford objected arthur certainly cultivate a put for admire character a little a do on more tangible ground perhaps eh what tell have not much to go on at school at college when be child together in berkshire never wholly liked constantine be too selfish too unscrupulous although always keep on right side of law still if must do anything for own benefit against law without being found out made to pay penalty believe must have little hesitation in doing daresay doubt speak exact truth from intuition be snake that young man pretty curly insinuating snake be poison in well shaped well coloured bottle poor emily poor emily silly woman goodness be mr lear with thankless adopted child sharper than serpent tooth bless damn for rogue though bless ca bring actual charge against young beast have when one see smoke one guess fire did tell be nemo asked vernon bluntly dimsdale grew furiously red furiously angry so angry indeed that rose to stamp about room how devil can ask question how dare if come to be as idiot babbler must tell maunders have eaten dinner much le inform of secret be to advantage to keep why do ask for thinking traitor gossip forgive said vernon with apologetic air be quite sure that have preserved secret of how earn money know that constantine haunt house thought might have let drop casual hint be clever enough a know to take advantage of fact be have found out about nemo threatens unless take into partnership have given month to turn over proposition that will make society too hot to hold young rascal young blackmailing scoundrel cried dimsdale stamping again be just what must do haunt house to make love to ida must rather see dead than a wife especially now that know what be about to tell what be later on will explain meanwhile beat about bush tell exactly what maunders threatens vernon detailed conversation dimsdale returned to seat to hear narrative when be ended nodded with compressed lip very clever on part of master snake have in power right enough since be ready to betray if obey command well then be going to certain extent to put in power what have found out have found out nothing said dimsdale testily interrupt do know of blackmailer called spider vernon half rose then sat down again with effort at control have come across work on several occasion so have scotland yard one know what be where life anything about get name from fact that always sign blackmailing letter with stamped representation of spider go on said dimsdale quite calmly for tell more there be little to tell sir spider learns people secret somehow in way one can discover then writes to that person threatens unless certain sum of money be paid to publish secret by mean of postcard sent to private address sometimes to club of victim of course there be combating mode of procedure so most people pay quietly although have kicked why be reptile arrested when come for money tell that sir tell sometimes money be sent to given address at other time spider masked cloaked meet victim personally be not arrested because always tell victim that if police be brought into question be jailed especial secret will be published same to world by hidden accomplice by mean of postcard so can see mr dimsdale that if person wish secret to be preserved can not risk arrest still have be employed by one two victim to learn truth have failed ca lay hand on spider can of official detective mr dimsdale nodded be clever animal said grimly have described mode of procedure extremely well boy be just way in be tormenting emily mr bedge be blackmailing of course be tell so said dimsdale crossly asked to come see yesterday showed three letter with figure of spider at foot of writing reptile want five thousand pound else will send card to private address to friend stating constantine be illegitimate son what vernon leaped from chair aghast of course be infernal lie said dimsdale warmly emily be good woman even though jilted to marry man old enough to be father be true to swear be true to simply adopted son of partner maunders real name be constantine mavrocordato because boy father mother be dead there be ground for assertion on part of spider absolutely none confound sir know emily raged dimsdale can know doubt for moment that viper have made most iniquitous accusation have boy certificate of birth can prove truth moreover can call evidence on part of friend who knew about adoption when took place know that mud stick arthur however innocent person may be emily simply ca stand up against blackguard attempt if refuse to send five thousand pound to address given within fortnight spider say will send card making lying assertion to friend even if rebutted a can there must always be shrugged shoulder raised eyebrow cold look smoke without fire remark true vernon looked thoughtfully at cigar tip plenty of innocent people care to face publicity on account human nature be so prone to believe worst even in face of very plainest evidence what doe mr bedge propose to do wanted to send money suggested that must let place matter in hand thank will do best be difficult case a spider be so hard to find on occasion think will be said dimsdale with grim humour since propose to work with understand speak plainly asked dimsdale tartly said there be two case did answer sir answer yes there be about matter arthur will make full explanation after have asked simple question question see how information place maunders young beast in power answered vernon very plainly somewhat aggressively if mean that be to use knowledge of falsely being accused of illegitimacy a threat to keep from worrying into partnership mean that in least cried dimsdale warmly confound sir must make out to be no better than spider reptile what mean be that can say to maunders that will receive into partnership if hunt down spider clear character of adopted mother not that emily character requires clearing in eye mind must consider limitation of human nature boy place emily like csar wife above suspicion now do understand eh what reply sir arthur nodded understand if maunders hunt down spider will be worth engaging a partner mean that be setting to achieve impossibility unless fulfils wish can not hope to be partner in meantime hunt down spider then when have jailed maunders not having done what asked of ca expect to become partner think will in case said vernon grimly think not sir said dimsdale very distinctly of course emily be right blackmailing accusation be lie same maunders who be anxious to secure position in society marry ida confound never will with consent will not wish slightest breath of being possible natural child to get about must say nothing said vernon stiffly quite so never expected must mere probability of business becoming known will make maunders careful wo worry again a judging by own iniquitous self will think capable of betraying now can see yes constantine know must never speak daresay because think bribe be enough belief a peel did walpole be that man have price wo worry tell if give merest hint to of matter not that need to for will know about blackmailing letter to morrow vernon recalled how maunders have said that aunt have detained how have suggested that have something on mind doe know at present anyhow emily saw before speaking to however listen to scheme have in mind to catch spider wretch be trying to blackmail oh vernon sat up laughed how ridiculous of men can not be blackmailed since life be so open man life be open said dimsdale drily mine have dark page a everyone else have have secret not particularly bad one be true still one must prefer to keep to myself what be sha tell man snapped ex police commissioner be sufficient to say that be not very bad secret that even if be told to world must matter little however spider hang think must have acquaintance with life in east have learned something thought one knew anything about asks one thousand pound be moderate compared with demand on emily show that know secret be so very deadly must be worth more did write to asked vernon alertly of course did making usual threat of exposure by postcard to self friend now be going to consent to demand pay money did say that corrected dimsdale sharply be writing asking to meet in library receive money also for to hand over document to even hint at secret when come can be concealed in room will take in charge then secret will become known objected vernon spider always provides against arrest by leaving evidence in hand of others to publish can publish what like about said mr dimsdale coolly tell that secret be of little value spider in letter to embroidered upon actual fact can make thing unpleasant can prove exact truth of what state so can save bacon there may be few cold shoulder sha care for especially when own conscience be clear now ask to tell secret for sha have nothing to do with anyone else have to do be to come to morrow next day to house at hampstead will sketch out plan of campaign what about mr bedge have fortnight to consider payment will catch scoundrel before then understand eh

be of age must be friend there be difference between forty five sixty odd dear said france mildly between twenty three forty five retorted miss dimsdale whose cheek be growing even more scarlet

school have attended must not supply place of mother who be dead old man turned to vernon when entered drawing room through french window who be horrid asked again vernon laughed slipped into chair be storm in tea cup explained easily accepting cigar miss hest advised ida to give up maunders supported then ida know know broke in dimsdale sadly be wilful be quite infatuated with scamp arthur arthur must have married again so that ida must be trained by good woman ca manage think miss hest can said vernon significantly have sense enough for two most masculine young person do think be wise forbidding maunders to come to masked ball yes do ida be crazy about opposition will only make more crazy warned vernon shaking sleek head must be better to let come together then must get sick of maunders be so willow that must find out sooner later for ida have plenty of common sense if be not obscured by persistent frivolity after be only youthful fault if maunders want to marry doe mr dimsdale can vouch for want to marry niece what dimsdale who be lighting cigar wheeled round with astonished air why thought loved lucy so do replied vernon earnestly love maunders be fascinating fellow dangerous unscrupulous rival quite believe eh what fellow scoundrel grunted mr dimsdale crossly must be tarred feathered still if thing be a say mind ida asking to ball must ask towton also added with sudden determination will do so although dread love making however may grow sick of maunders when find be running after lucy corsoon towton may catch heart in recoil hope so hope so muttered dimsdale turning cigar in lip want to see little girl safely married to towton who be a good fellow a ever breathed not young fellow however be wiser to let event take course for present mr dimsdale opposition a say will only make ida more wilful since be filled with romance natural at age ouf breathed old man wiping brow with bandanna handkerchief what handful woman be there dismissed subject with wave of hand let leave triviality talk business have heard anything more about spider well made enquiry at scotland yard find that be very much wanted by police mr dimsdale grunted police be always wanting never getting spider be too clever for protested vernon anxiously wo be too clever for said elder man with sudden ferocity slapping hand on table eh what be to be blackmailed by infernal scoundrel who swears that will tell parcel of lie if pay one thousand pound hang if be merely lie why pay asked vernon drily there be grain of truth in lie admitted dimsdale crossly absolute truth can face lie make out to be very queer person indeed will tell when secure man vernon looked up astonished how do propose to secure if arrest accomplice will spread lie talk of by postcard amongst acquaintance a be usually case in spider business will risk that sir will risk said dimsdale with defiant air be hanged if will get penny out of will set trap will be in room behind screen to rush out seize when give signal understand eh what understand come come speak up what sort of trap do propose to lay asked arthur cautiously well dimsdale leaned back twisting half smoked cigar between finger be masked ball silly form of entertainment ida insists upon having for birthday gave idea see with chance of being masked mingling amongst guest spider will be more ready to come will suspect nothing be writing to to morrow telling about ball be suggesting that must come wearing mask to enjoy then at eleven o'clock say can secretly meet in room to receive money cash echoed vernon significantly of course fellow too clever to risk cheque must put police on track must put police on track boy do intend to pay money how stupid be arthur use brain use brain boy will offer to pay money then concealed behind screen that japanese one up in corner can rush out have authority to arrest interrupted vernon impatiently why not post policeman plain clothes detective to catch beast want policeman in house retorted dimsdale gruffly be detective enough for if blackmail will be witness will have right to hold then can take away hand over to hampstead police may show fight then have revolver with snapped old man want scandal row on ida birthday in house seems to that be going best way to have one said vernon deliberately much better let inform police have thing done in orderly fashion tell dimsdale again slapped table will do own way not at if catch beast by laying trap mr bedge many other people will be safe if call in police however secretly spider who seems to have ear eye over will get wind of ambush vernon nodded there be something in assented perhaps on ground will be better that must engineer job together well stood up straight slim will come here on night of ball by way when doe take place monday week be short notice ida only thought yesterday of way to celebrate birthday be quite sure asked vernon taking up tall hat that be advisable to lay trap on night of ball yes do yes do said dimsdale in fussy manner mere idea of mask will enable scoundrel to hide infernal face without comment will recommend to will think that be exceptionally safe not dreaming that intend to fight will fight then be not laying trap into will walk inquired dimsdale with much exasperation of course fight a secret be not such very bad one can defend be willing to risk that being known have rather be kept silent for sake of saving other people from being blackmailed by beast eh what be not right yes think be wish must tell secret after have captured scamp will do so then will tell absolute truth together with embroidery look so grave boy have committed murder stolen from till never thought of such thing said vernon hastily dimsdale good humouredly pushed towards window know doubt boy later can satisfy meanwhile let settle be scoundrel look on trap a one set by thief to catch thief by way doe maunders know of threat made by spider against mother intended to tell know be not aware sir maunders have not be near since night at athenian club same night when met at towton room well will come to ball meantime let know will advise if hear from spider there get out good bye unless will have cup of tea glass of wine vernon declined departed girl be no longer on verandah even in garden chapter iv who be caught in trap vernon have doubt a to success of mr dimsdale scheme spider a authority very well knew be wary individual in dealing with victim have be careful to provide for own safety certainly met at duly appointed place disguised a old woman young man a navvy a foreigner none of intimidated dared to call in police reason be that spider invariably advised beforehand by letter that accomplice held evidence of secret for be being blackmailed that proceeding being taken must result in publication of by card being sent to friend relative acquaintance therefore can easily be guessed that one have courage to lay rogue by heel a appeared spider have in mr dimsdale stumbled on man who be not averse to secret being known vernon wondered what ex police commissioner have done that must have one at looked forward eagerly to being told dimsdale be such very respectable old gentleman so very open in speech action entire life that seemed incredible must conceal anything however a spider have learned in extraordinary way did posse secret therefore be being threatened be lucky for dimsdale in particular public at large that cared so little for revelation of shady doings have be concerned in since by trapping spider end must be put to dangerous career of social pest mr dimsdale secret might be well deserved to be forgiven for service be rendering to everyone be questionable in vernon opinion if spider must meet victim in house filled with company where there be chance of hue cry being raised certainly scamp well protected by mask domino must be able to mingle with company unobserved even if unmasked must not be discovered other than a uninvited guest since one knew actual appearance then might choose to come a cabman chauffeur a waiter at supper of course if kept appointment in library identity must be proved beyond doubt when made blackmailing demand spider although confident for usual reason of silence of dimsdale might not choose to risk since many people being in bungalow might be overheard vernon looked at whole affair a somewhat forlorn hope until three four day later received letter from mr dimsdale old gentleman wrote that spider have agreed to meet in library at rangoon at eleven o'clock in evening requested vernon to enter room earlier so that must be concealed behind screen have not mr dimsdale went on to say advised police a be unnecessary for to talk until have trapped bird once be in grip will see folly of resistance will probably agree to walk quietly to hampstead police station failing that can shout for assistance of be obvious there will be plenty to hand will understand wish to effect capture a quietly a possible so a not to alarm guest in latter part of letter dimsdale stated that maunders have be calling at bungalow during writer last interview with vernon be in fact round corner of house nearest to library when vernon stepped out of french window dimsdale have found there on verandah in company of girl have promptly told that be not wanted in usual peppery way there have be row a maunders have be grossly insolent miss hest very capable girl a mr dimsdale wrote have induced to depart confirmation of report be received by vernon from maunders when two met by chance in piccadilly old man be most insolent complained maunders indignantly there be crime in loving ida so far a can see since love miss corsoon only run after ida for money think mr dimsdale have reason to forbid house said vernon drily oh rot know what be about a to forbidding house received invitation to masked ball on monday be going ida only extorted permission from father to ask if be gentleman will not go to be received on sufferance maunders chuckled coolly ida wo receive in way said with superb insolence a really love old gentleman doe matter love lucy have money so expect will have to sacrifice by marrying ida if mr dimsdale will allow chafed vernon oh wo ida can defy if doe will lose fortune remains to be seen said maunders airily hang old dimsdale what objection can have to aunt might tell said vernon significantly blood rushed to maunders cheek looked searchingly at friend not agreeably what do mean mean can only consent to take into partnership if succeed in capturing spider said vernon slowly somewhat evasively who be spider think know if not from newspaper then from mr bedge maunders looked at ground so old dimsdale told yes wished to enlist service on behalf of aunt to capture blackmailing beast oh do intend to intend to leave capture to maunders opened eye dear chap know nothing about spider a call man to say nothing of detective business yet wish to become nemo partner said vernon very drily see here maunders be use beating about bush sha take a partner unless catch man so prove capability suppose tell everyone who nemo be asked maunders with ugly look can do so if like rejoined vernon coolly for then there will be nemo will simply leave england seek fortune in africa after see why must refuse test be to own advantage that must be caught unless want aunt to pay five thousand pound bosh what spider say be lie daresay wo be pleasant for mr bedge to know that friend receive card stating be natural son be infernal lie raged maunders blood flushing cheek making look handsomer than ever be not bit like aunt in way be true that sister be mother take after father constantine mavrocordato dimsdale told that seems to have imparted lot of private affair to observed maunders acidly be quite safe with a nemo use private discovery to blackmail people do believe lie of spider for one moment mr bedge be good kind woman far too good for maunders have brought up educated allows money altogether have behaved like trump for sake if not for sake of becoming partner in paying business ought to hunt out brute who asper fair fame other man stared again at neat boot be not such rotter a think vernon said in voice filled with feeling of course appreciate aunt kindness will let partnership business stand over for present give word that sha tell soul be nemo also will go to work on own see if ca catch spider be not going to get five thousand pound of money if can help aunt money corrected vernon gently will be mine day said maunders with shrug can see have conscience badly though think of think so very badly of replied vernon hurriedly somewhat untruthfully have good point constantine be so given over to pleasure that stop at nothing to gratify stop on right side of law however retorted maunders again becoming callous self after momentary softening there will be chance of nemo catching well good day will do what say perhaps when meet at ball will have something to tell intend to go then in spite of dimsdale behaviour yes do said maunders doggedly intend to marry ida with thousand year so now know walked off abruptly leaving vernon to congratulate that no longer have dangerous rival in affection of lucy corsoon though believe old dimsdale will consent to marriage with ida thought vernon a resumed interrupted walk during few day still remained until night of masked ball vernon saw nothing of maunders of martin dimsdale on monday morning when having luncheon in triclinium of athenian club colonel towton made appearance glanced round room catching sight of vernon walked up to table 'day said in sharp military way will join here if have objection delighted colonel replied vernon passed along menu wondered why towton be making such palpable advance towards friendship for a rule be somewhat stiff with reserved manner after way of army men colonel seemed to be in hurry to explain fixed eyeglass to examine card order luncheon be tall slim dry looking man perfectly groomed perfectly dressed perfectly master of in spite of forty five year close cropped hair smartly twisted moustache be without grey hair dark knightly looking with alert eye of irish blue looked a juvenile a of subaltern be one of men who ripen young so to speak who remain in condition for rest of life towton be admirable soldier with several letter after name be pity a everyone said that have retired so early from army must certainly have remained in order to attain to rank of general be generally known that family reason connected with inheritance of yorkshire estate have necessitated colonel sending in paper outside profession be not talented have considerable fund of common sense be rarer commodity than people imagine want to have private talk with vernon said colonel after have selected dish luckily there be one within earshot glanced round room to note that companion be isolated in secluded corner mind having private talk do jerked staring through eyeglass twisting moustache be at service said vernon wondering what be coming be going to be rather personal a regard affair own went on towton very directly honestly rather odd in man who be mere acquaintance eh not at said vernon politely can only repeat be at service colonel fact be must say word that know be good sort plenty of chap say that again towton unfolded napkin rather nervously for be great friend of dimsdales yes be acknowledged vernon guessing somewhat of business have brought colonel to table friend of young maunders be at school together friend of corsoons pursued towton distinctly ill at ease a if felt that be taking liberty see here colonel remarked companion straightly guess what be driving at from coupling of name may speak out yes towton nodded away waiter who have brought soup be in love with miss dimsdale maunders be paying attention quite so may add on part that be in love with miss corsoon that same gentleman be rival vernon nodded pushed away empty plate think have cleared ground for action said significantly be obliged to for candour said towton courteously knew from reputation that must meet way be not easy for elderly man such a be to speak of love for young girl a be devoted to be devoted to miss corsoon seemed to that might join force against handsome young scamp who be playing fast loose with affection of girl on ground ventured to take liberty of speaking to on so private subject be very glad that did so colonel united action may be of great service to lady in question maunders hesitated generously know interrupted towton abruptly that young gentleman reputation be a bad a yours be good even if did not love miss dimsdale must feel justified in doing best to save from that scamp can tell said so if like what give plan away to common enemy said vernon jokingly must scarcely be wise maunders be a clever a devil a unscrupulous let be frank of girl doe love in opinion what love can spare from give to miss corsoon be after miss dimsdale fortune thought so be infatuated with worse luck miss corsoon understand one said vernon with reserve be not afraid of maunders in quarter although have good look great charm of manner be talking of very delicate matter colonel know be know be towton flicked napkin irritably lady name must be mentioned between gentleman be rather turk in respect a young gentleman will make of miserable be thorn in flesh a in mine must between put delicacy on one side do propose to do know said vernon crumbling bread dismally lady corsoon certainly will not let daughter marry poor man such a be be plan colonel know repeated towton equally dismally miss dimsdale be crazy about maunders will not cast glance at father be on side however so have chance may take a certain said vernon with decision that dimsdale will never consent to daughter becoming mr maunders may defy there be that possibility certainly hang muttered towton referring to maunders why ca marry miss hest have done with miss hest have money look to attract gay spark oh come now be handsome girl not in maunders way like weak woman whom can bully miss hest be much too firm managing wife for to risk by way be going to ball to night yes towton face lighted up with ridiculous pleasure may give chance to propose colonel will only be refused take advice wait for week so maunders may be out of way by time what do mean exactly be not at liberty to say advise to wait towton played with bread cheese all right said at length place in hand although be hanged if can see what mean well confessed vernon rising to tell truth be not very sure what do mean have kind of instinct that if of play waiting game maunders will get cold shoulder from ida mean from miss dimsdale yes from miss corsoon come into pinacotheca smoke two conspirator went there discussed matter further a vernon have confessed have clear idea in mind a to why advised colonel to wait in vague way fancied that business of spider might occupy maunders time prevent paying usual attention to lucy ida in case girl must probably feel offended then vernon intended to bring together in a yet unthought of way so that might mutually discover how maunders be courting of indiscriminately lucy of course in case must have nothing to do with young man ida pride taking fire might induce on making discovery to listen to colonel wooing everything in vernon brain be vague undecided faintly felt that if event happened in such way maunders might be eliminated a stumbling block possibility however being still in cloud did not reveal to towton conversation in pinacotheca resolved into two men consoling one regarding doubtful love affair arranging to meet at masked ball parted on more than friendly term with quite feeling of intimacy be natural considering what have be discussing proposed meeting at rangoon never came off unexpected happened a vernon might have guessed must with experience of life be never so much astonished a when telegram be handed in at room with name of lucy corsoon attached come to waller street west kensington ran wire at nine o'clock trouble with m l corsoon now what deuce doe mean vernon asked undoubtedly letter m referred to maunders since there be one else with initial to cause trouble what trouble might be why carefully guarded lucy corsoon must be in west kensington be hard to say lady corsoon rarely let daughter out of sight on night be due at rangoon to enjoy masked ball a vernon rapidly reflected there must be only one reply to so urgent wire be to stand on doorstep of waller street west kensington at appointed hour glanced at watch be after eight so have only time to drive from bloomsbury to destination vernon for obvious reason connected with income lived in old fashioned room in middle class district be more comfortable than if have lived in mayfair a regard space rent domino mask be lying on chair ready to be slipped into brown leather bag have intended to drive in taxi to hampstead because of bag a be too much trouble to carry by train since in case journey must be broken a be thinking what be best to be done landlady husband who acted a valet came with information that cab be at door vernon made up mind at once to act part of knight errant in spite of being due at ball without troubling about domino mask put on overcoat unless something serious be wrong telegram gave little information must return get bag drive on to ball if lucy be in dire trouble must not go at to rangoon mr dimsdale must have to manage with spider a best must always provided that astute individual walked into trap be doubtful way to west kensington vernon puzzled brain a to what must be matter why lucy corsoon must be in west kensington house ridiculous a seemed entertained idea that might have be kidnapped by maunders have contrived to send wire to lover upon whom must rely then maunders a have said always kept on right side of law kidnapping be indictable offence if have acted thus rashly a vernon reflected with thrill be simply playing into rival hand if rescue lucy lady corsoon will certainly let marry out of gratitude thought young man however whole affair be so mysterious that until saw lucy there be little chance of reasonable explanation therefore possessed soul in patience until arrived in waller street here sprang out telling cabman to wait ran up step of semi detached house of suburban villa residence style night be brilliant with moonlight so easily saw number on glass over door also long dull street of similar house be minute before appointed time that mattered very little there seemed to be light in house vernon wondered more than ever why lucy must be in so unusual locality shortly sound of light footstep be heard light appeared against numeral on glass above door stood out black distinct then door be opened cautiously white face of woman looked out be miss corsoon here asked vernon abruptly be mr vernon questioned woman in frightened whisper yes received wire from come in come in breathed woman held door open sufficiently for vernon to slip in be so glad have come went on still below breath apparently much afraid be a much a life worth to admit poor young lady be here yes have got in cellar below only because cried so much did dare to send telegram to what devil doe mean demanded vernon fiercely gruffly hush hush raise voice follow on tip toe will hear who be asked vernon softly obeying woman said be hush hush so wondering at strange adventure seemed genuine enough young man went after woman down wooden stair led from hall to basement a followed saw by light of candle guide carried that hall be dusty unfurnished led along dark passage opened end door with air of mystery young lady there said softly handing light take candle for heaven sake say that betrayed who asked vernon imperatively clutched arm will hear whispered pointing upward pushed towards open door be drugged in there vernon uttered loud ejaculation made guide shiver stepped into dark room holding candle above head next moment door closed quickly behind turned sharply already key have clicked crisply in lock be prisoner be plant plant cried vernon in cold fury be trapped certainly be for there be sign of girl who have be supposed to send telegram terror whispering of woman have be comedy to inveigle into prison place be small kitchen dusty forlorn unfurnished there be plate on rack on shelf of open cupboard fire in rusty grate room have not be occupied for many long day a roof corner be thick with dust cobweb iron barred window glimmered straight before vernon there be small door near through went to find in tiny scullery also lighted dimly by iron barred window door through have entered be fast locked have mean of opening there be doubt that be prisoner decoyed to lonely unfurnished house by mean of false telegram what deuce doe mean vernon asked sat down on dusty floor to think out position to save dress clothes made cushion of light overcoat sat on hugging knee with candle beside position be dismal enough decidedly mysterious a confessed what doe mean repeated mentally next instant obvious answer flashed into mind spider cried vernon leaping to foot addressing bare wall yes must be spider trickery more thought of more certain felt that have at first blow hit right nail on head in way spider have learned of arranged trap have sent wire purporting to come from lucy corsoon a decoy have proved only too successful now here be safely locked up in underground room with chance of escape while mr dimsdale at rangoon be left to face ingenious scoundrel alone be right vernon soliloquised a sat down again if be not on spot other people be when spider make demand mr dimsdale will probably raise alarm spider be not so clever a thought be poor comfort spider at event have be clever enough to ensnare private detective who prided on astuteness one trap have be set by mr dimsdale here be set by spider out of be impossible to escape bar of window be too strong to twist door be too stout to break down so there be nothing for to wait be impossible that must be kept in dungeon for ever sooner later must be released besides someone must have to bring food if be white faced woman who have so cleverly led into trap vernon promised grimly that must seize at first opportunity make aid escape finally taxi be still at door driver might become sufficiently alarmed if fare did not reappear to speak to nearest policeman be ridiculous that man must be captured in guarded london in such way vernon be angry with for having be tricked until abrupt closing of door have never suspected that anything be wrong meanwhile guessed that spider having got out of way be keeping appointment with dimsdale in library be not probable that blackmailing must succeed a dimsdale be quick tempered a likely a not must simply seize creature when demanded money shouting meanwhile for assistance vernon wished that be at appointed post behind screen comforted with reflection that dimsdale must be able to deal with matter unassisted so far a be concerned being helpless must hing wait for next hour so did not pay much attention to time vernon wondered how spider came to know of dimsdale trap how have so cleverly laid own blackmailer seemed to know everybody business a profession required so in way have managed to learn of vernon love for miss corsoon only message from such girl must have lured lover into predicament spider have not only be clever enough to know have be clever enough to utilize knowledge for moment be wild thought passed in flash vernon wondered if constantine maunders have anything to do with matter idea be ridiculous since spider be attempting to blackmail mr bedge maunders certainly must not countenance if not maunders who must be certainly dimsdale might have talked to someone else about proposed trap since be extremely frank injudicious in speech vernon resolved to question on point when next met hoped from reply to learn who have lured to waller street west kensington having arrived at conclusion rested head on overcoat tried to sleep since be foolish to waste strength in beating wing against prison bar after time so tired be brain with hard thinking that actually fell asleep how long sleep lasted did not know woke from troubled dream with idea that heard soft retreating footstep candle be burnt to socket room be extremely dark so vernon sat up in confused way trying to recall position with alert ear hearkened for presumed footstep a there be sound save own laboured breathing decided that have be dreaming be lucky that have box of lucifer in pocket for lighting of one enabled to see time watch revealed that be one o'clock in morning a have arrived at nine must have be imprisoned for four hour limb felt stiff a rose to foot with yawn stretched ca stay here night muttered desperately will try what shouting will do shout did with power of lung only to receive response feeling that be losing time temper vernon groped way in thick darkness towards door gripping handle gave angry despairing twist to surprise door proved to be open apparently footstep have thought dream sound be real prison door have be quietly unlocked at moment of awakening picking up overcoat felt way along passage up stair into front hall slow work in gloom of unknown locality there be noise to be heard although held breath to listen so far a must judge house be empty finally intent upon getting assistance tried handle of front door found that there be difficulty in getting clear in two minute be in quiet street looking up down for policeman road being isolated hour late there be vehicle pedestrian to be seen did light gleam from window of silent house vernon shivered in cold breath of night then walked swiftly up street to seek assistance shortly found burly constable at corner breathlessly detailed have happened to somewhat sceptical officer shrill whistle brought policeman to spot with two vernon returned to door of have left ajar somewhat convinced officer took name address promising to search house also to watch vernon on fire to reach hampstead to learn what have occurred must not wait to see what discovery might be made policeman wished to detain finally got away raced towards more public part of west kensington to find cab a luck must have picked up belated taxi have just taken home fare chauffeur demurred about driving out so far a hampstead treble price promptly offered overcame scruple in short time vernon be spinning towards much wished for destination way be trying to conjecture how spider have contrived to overhear arranging of trap for must have done so else there must have be reason for imprisonment by time vernon brain be weary fell into dose when woke taxi have pulled up with jerk found on heath before gate of rangoon with sudden spasm of fear noted that policeman be standing at entrance apparently on guard stumbling out of cab vernon staggered towards man have come to mr dimsdale ball said hurriedly be over sir said policeman touching helmet over so early early in morning sir mean fact be there be trouble trouble again cold chill struck vernon yes sir ball came to end mr dimsdale dead sir murdered a might say dead echoed vernon quite dazed strangled said policeman bluntly chapter v after tragedy news be a horrible a be unexpected vernon have anticipated blackmail have even believed that in absence of third person spider might show fight have never dreamed that murder must take place a such crime be entirely contrary to spider method with gasp pulled together have caught man demanded anxiously what man questioned constable suspiciously murderer sir be not known who killed mr dimsdale be found strangled in library time after eleven o'clock alarm be given police be called in ball came to end now sir added man in friendly way have right to tell more a what have told will be in paper to morrow harm done go home now sir will learn about friend when inquest take place vernon thought for second be inspector in house yes sir ca see must see at once believe know who killed dimsdale oh do do said policeman with subtle change of manner then come along with wait till pay cabman muttered vernon policeman making objection to gave chauffeur promised fare when vehicle have disappeared down road diminishing blackly in moonlight returned to find that constable be holding open gate what name be to give asked man gruffly for be evident that regarded vernon with suspicion owing to what have admitted name doe matter inspector doe not know said vernon impatiently hurry up man hurry up moment be of value impressed by imperious manner policeman knocked at closed front door be immediately thrown open by second constable on guard in hall by individual vernon be introduced into jacobean dining room after few hurried word of explanation inspector drench constable have informed vernon of name be seated at table taking note miss hest looking pale anxious stood at elbow be first to speak mr vernon exclaimed hoarsely have come at last poor mr dimsdale be asking for night now broke down how did get in sir questioned inspector drench imperiously nodding to policeman that must leave room gave order that nobody be to be admitted insisted upon seeing said vernon quickly evening rather yesterday evening have appointment with mr dimsdale in library be decoyed to empty house in west kensington have only managed to get away inspector drench stared what do mean by sir what say rejoined vernon tartly for nerve worried understand that mr dimsdale be dead mr dimsdale have be murdered cried miss hest clasping hand speaking in thick emotional voice murdered in library one know who strangled know drench stood up alertly take care sir anything say now will be noted shuffled paper like pack of card who be guilty spider spider echoed miss hest who be spider what be spider looked puzzled inspector better informed looked open mouthed at young man do mean to say that spider perpetrated crime sir asked scarcely able to speak from sheer amazement vernon thoroughly worn out from what have undergone dropped into chair listlessly yes spider broke in miss hest volubly know who be what be tell if allow interrupted drench sharply be military looking man something after style of colonel towton spoke aggressively allow for be in charge here miss spider be name if may call so of well known blackmailer for whom police have be looking be still looking perhaps mr vernon think said that gentleman name be vernon will explain how come to be possessed of such precise information there be difficulty in explaining retorted vernon annoyed by suspicious look of officer listen rapidly detailed that knew have taken place from interview with dimsdale in towton chamber to moment when leapt from taxicab to be met by constable at gate with news of murder a recital proceeded drench tried to conceal amazement scarcely managed to do so while france hest for once startled out of self control uttered ejaculation may be noted that vernon suppressed for moment fact that spider be blackmailing mr bedge a did not wish to spread scandal inspector drench lady be put in possession of other fact what be mr dimsdale secret asked france curiously ca tell a know after capture of spider promised must be told now will never know come said inspector bitterly come of amateur detective business if have be informed of appointment must have made arrangement to capture spider if have be informed retorted vernon heatedly spider must never have kept appointment why not be ignorant of plan learned mine easily enough must have learned yours seem to forget mr inspector that be dealing with genius in way of criminality spider whomsoever may be seems to know everything believe that be head of gang have spy over london one person must be so well posted up in secret arrangement otherwise how did come to know of secret arrangement between mr dimsdale asked drench abruptly ca say unless mr dimsdale who have rather loose tongue revealed plan of trap to someone else said nothing mr dimsdale gave information to anyone in house said france decisively if have ida must have known a be apparently met dreadful person in library at agreed time now that think of mused wonder did not suspect something of sort mr dimsdale told ida that must have room for ball save library a wished that to there be nothing unusual in such wish remarked drench easily when house be upset by party man naturally wish one of room left undisturbed so that can have peace what happened exactly asked vernon with air of fatigue inspector drench signed that miss hest must explain glanced at note a spoke to be certain that be repeating what have already told prior to vernon entrance be hard to tell what took place to minute protested lady guest arrived just before ten o'clock everything be going splendidly everyone be masked suppose said vernon quietly oh yes mr dimsdale stood in hall until nearly eleven receiving guest made everyone unmask before entered ballroom why did do asked drench suddenly ca guess put in vernon impatiently mr dimsdale expected spider wished to see if must come did know what spider be like one know daresay mr dimsdale knew whom daughter have invited to ball if unknown person have unmasked must have jumped to conclusion perhaps truly that be spider well miss hest everyone who unmasked be people knew continued for stood with ida near mr dimsdale receiving guest at quarter to eleven mr dimsdale went to library alone certainly no one to knowledge entered library during whole of evening until ida in search of father insisted upon going in notwithstanding prohibition at quarter to twelve then found mr dimsdale seated in chair quite dead be window open inspector drench arose come see room mr vernon said moving towards door nothing have be disturbed not even corpse everything remains a miss dimsdale found at quarter to twelve ida fainted whispered france in vernon ear a trio crossed hall to enter library poor child be wonder when sight be so horrid be in bed now cry heart out inspector added miss hest raising voice wo want longer let return to miss dimsdale a need attention very good miss will continue examination in morning have told everything know one moment said vernon laying hand on sleeve a moved away want to know if guest arrived after mr dimsdale went into library two ida made unmask knew quite well mr mr horner from finchley may tell mr vernon mr dimsdale came out of library at five minute to eleven for single moment to ask if have arrived wish have arrived said vernon bitterly might have prevented tragedy be sure miss hest that stranger be at ball well said thoughtfully be difficult to say since be masked stranger be there to knowledge when crime be discovered everyone unmasked knew guest a have known when arrived still stranger might have slipped in must go to ida will tell anything else wish to know in morning vernon nodded released grip of sleeve flitted away into central room on way to ida bedroom vernon mused for moment then followed drench into library where inspector indeed have already preceded first glance vernon threw around showed that one of french window be open thought so said pointing out to inspector spider did not come a guest watched opportunity slipped in at window at what time be mr dimsdale supposed to have be strangled doctor called in say so far a state of body show that crime be committed about quarter past eleven miss dimsdale discovered at quarter to twelve thirty minute later appointment be for eleven said vernon nodding so spider be fifteen minute late came in there pointed to french window escaped in same way with thousand pound asked drench drily did not like to be shown business by young man think so replied vernon musingly cautiously feeling way a be to decision see dimsdale never intended to pay money therefore be not prepared with specie from bank spider for once went without booty did worse work for nothing than ever did for reward yes said inspector carelessly believe be first time murder have be connected with name publicly be who know what assassination may not have to answer for privately however here be room corpse what do make of other man looked round slowly room blazed with full power of many electric light inspector have turned on also a apartment be square sparsely furnished there be nook cranny must not be seen at glance three window have blind curtain in accordance with mr dimsdale craze for fresh air round desk be on right side of room near fireplace high screen be drawn same girl have used on morning when be selecting guest for fatal ball in chair turned sideways from desk drooped form of dead man be arrayed in evening dress shirt front be crumpled face be swollen discoloured there be disorder round about desk persian mat have not even be kicked out of way yes said drench in answer to look from vernon there must not have be struggle since be in order in opinion spider if be that chap a seem to think must have come silently behind victim strangled with handkerchief before have time to call out came to kill a well a to rob handkerchief asked vernon interested thought did with hand mr inspector drench shook iron grey head there be mark of hand on throat mr vernon only cruel black line show that cord handkerchief must have be used used with great force though to be sure added inspector reflectively mr dimsdale be so short fat in neck that slight pressure must have caused apoplexy did die of strangulation mixture of be odd mr vernon that with uncurtained window must have be murdered without anyone seeing performance there must have be many guest in front garden a people always do wander outside between dance to get fresh air vernon pointed to screen served purpose of curtain blind mr inspector behind that crime must be committed without anyone being wiser even if anyone have be on verandah provided there be noise insisted drench exactly so that make believe that surmise be correct spider for reason may have come to kill a well a to blackmail perhaps a learned about trap must have done to arrange for absence dreaded lest dimsdale must prove dangerous person so got rid of if mirror vernon pointed to long broad looking glass covered one side of fireplace reflected desk chair screen seated figure must speak must tell how crime be committed can guess ended perhaps will let hear guess said drench sceptically spider fancy stole in quietly through french window be open came suddenly upon dimsdale seated at desk waiting to keep appointment before old man must turn spider have handkerchief cord round neck quietly choked there must be noise struggle then looked for money vernon pointed to desk several drawer of be pulled open not finding stole out again through window guest in garden must have seen leave room what if did one anticipated crime one miss hest miss dimsdale knew that library be forbidden territory moreover spider may have chosen time to escape when dance be in progress chance being that everyone must return to ballroom may be sure added vernon with emphasis that spider made use of mask domino so that might be taken for guest might escape notice miss hest said that everyone unmasked who entered house a guest followed on vernon quickly just so mr inspector spider entered a stranger by window not wishing perhaps to take chance of course be agreed that be infernally clever well posted in necessary detail be with there murmured drench mournfully be pity mr dimsdale did not warn of trap must have caught man easier than amateur be not amateur said vernon unexpectedly then when inspector looked at interrogatively added trade a nemo of covent garden ah yes have heard of replied drench in le supercilious tone so be nemo be mr vernon be told that have solved several mystery in fact friend of mine at yard said 'd head on shoulder will need said vernon with shrug to unravel mystery be mystery said drench quickly since say that spider murdered poor chap spider be mystery one police must give much to solve intend to hunt down not alone on account of poor dead friend here because so cleverly decoyed out of way ah pride be up in arm well yes suppose can put way wish to ask two thing mr inspector first that will not reveal trade a nemo to anyone in society oh promise easily especially a go into society can guess that want kept quiet second thing will permit to place service at disposal dexterous way in vernon put request a favour to be granted pleased inspector especially a knew from what have heard of nemo that such service must be of value will be very pleased to let work with mr vernon said cordially what do propose to do first may ask house in west kensington be empty one must have be taken by spider for temporary prison must ascertain from landlord who took thus may learn something about look of spider think took house applied to landlord be yes may have done so one of gang may have rented house if can catch person who did see landlord may learn something about spider if indeed tenant be not man well drench scratched head thoughtfully there be something in mr vernon spider be so clever that may be sure have made safe think head gang be certain woman who played clever comedy to inveigle into kitchen be one of gang perhaps spider in disguise may be right a of course since be captured about nine o'clock there be plenty of time for to change get to hampstead by eleven moreover be quarter of hour late suggested drench puzzle sir to think how trap business came to ear vernon looked regretfully at dead man in chair perhaps mr dimsdale may have talked remarked said nothing will never know now until lay hand on spider force to confess ended drench nodding by way suppose reward will be offered for apprehension by miss dimsdale understand be rich be very probable a inherits father money about ten thousand year must be inspector whistled be tidy fortune said meditatively expect reward will be large one expect so also rejoined vernon understanding clearly what be meant if learn truth about crime capture spider can have reward to be professional mr vernon have to make money want in case spider made use of certain lady name to inveigle to west kensington mean to be even with miss corsoon think mentioned miss corsoon yes only need talk about outside office said vernon hastily want to be mixed up in business also be not very proud of having be trapped in way only police will know drench assured led way out of room after turning out light 'd better go home now mr vernon a have done quite enough to night look worn out vernon nodded when will inquest take place to morrow sooner be over better can work on clue of spider have supplied will catch vernon shrugged shoulder be le confident of success than drench since for nearly two year spider have entirely baffled police chapter vi two conversation inquest duly took place evidence be forthcoming likely to lead to capture of assassin that be spider there of course must be doubt since declaration of vernon went to show that late mr dimsdale have made appointment with blackmailer naturally whole story have to be told at inquest public became aware through medium of newspaper that dead man have secret must not have be dishonourable secret be general opinion else mr dimsdale must scarcely have risked revelation using might be a decoy to lure spider into trap have lost life in attempt to capture famous criminal if spider have be celebrated before be still more celebrated now in more sinister way formerly police have wanted a extortioner now be inquired for a murderer rangoon crime a came to be called mighty sensation a there be that about appealed to somewhat jaded taste of public that man must be strangled in own library in very house where nearly one hundred people be dancing be truly wonderful when sequel be that assassin have escaped window of library have blind curtain guest have be talking walking in garden on other side of tall laurel hedge cab carriage with attendant have be waiting in road yet spider have come gone like shadow behind frail concealment of screen terrible crime have taken place far from hurrying departure criminal have actually lingered to search for money hoped to get be proved at inquest that did not get plunder for enquiry at mr dimsdale bank showed that thousand pound have not be drawn undoubtedly since dead man have intended to defy blackmailer secret must not have be one to be ashamed of what secret be public never knew vernon a have stated to inspector drench be not proud that have be so cleverly tricked into temporary imprisonment by spider must fain have kept that episode to for rounding off of case be necessary that must be told thus sensation be piled upon sensation vernon however contrived to keep name of miss corsoon to drench be vaguely stated in paper vernon have be inveigled to west kensington on plea of helping woman inquiry proved that landlord have never be applied to a regard letting of number spider have simply seen that house be empty have gained access thereto by mean of skeleton key for one single evening have utilised house a prison when police searched same did from cellar to attic found trace of spider of white faced woman who have played so clever comedy daring evinced in connection with west kensington house be amazing escape of assassin from rangoon scarcely le so whole formed case unexampled in annals of crime for cool audacity outcome of affair be extremely unsatisfactory nothing must be discovered concerning whereabouts of spider whether belonged to gang worked single handed one must say man defied detective policeman laughed at attempt of law to lay by heel letter be written to paper leading article appeared clamouring that immediate action must be taken against spider who be menace to civilisation police did be possible hunted london in vain endeavour to lay hand on rascal without success spider left track behind must not be followed to lair verdict of wilful murder be brought against reward of one thousand pound be offered at instance of murdered man daughter for apprehension nothing further came of matter crime be nine day wonder a day grew into week week into month public interest dwindled seemed likely that murder of martin dimsdale must have to be relegated to list of undiscovered crime even inspector drench despaired of success gloomily shook head only vernon remained firm in intention to solve mystery of murder spider said a much to mr bedge two month after dimsdale have be laid in grave maunders aunt be thin aristocratic pale faced old lady prim in dress manner occupied quiet unpretentious house at hampstead not far from rangoon note from have brought vernon to see now two be seated in pointedly antiquated drawing room talking earnestly everything about house owner be prim whole atmosphere suggested early victorian day seemed strange that so dismal old fashioned house must be home of intensely modern young man like constantine maunders a mr bedge informed vernon nephew gave very little of society a have engaged room in town lived in greater part of week only come from saturday to monday to stop here sighed mr bedge folding lean mittened hand on drab hued dress yet know how fond be of company constantine be always selfish remarked vernon bluntly mr bedge protested with foolish fondness of old woman oh indeed must not say that constantine be high spirited daresay that think place somewhat dull when be here invariably find thoughtful affectionate be very probable since mr bedge have money maunders expected to be heir be not likely that so astute person must risk loss of fortune something of sort must have revealed in vernon eye for mr bedge with swift instinct of woman guessed what be thinking about said in plaintive way be not greed of money make constantine love own sweet nature give affection unasked constantine know have spent great deal on education in fitting out in life now have very little money left house furniture few hundred year when die will receive very little poor boy thought best that must enjoy money while be young without waiting for death constantine ought to work said vernon wondering at blindness must describe maunders a unselfishly affectionate intends to when can find something to mind then be so handsome that may make rich marriage thought ida dimsdale must have taken sighed old lady have ten thousand year be also very charming girl there be hope for constantine there astonish said vernon meant what said understood from mr dimsdale that daughter be in love with constantine be seemed to be quite crazy about be before terrible death of father two month ago since then have shut up with miss hest at 'rangoon when constantine have seen have be quite different love no longer a good a told poor boy so nearly broke heart think constantine heart be so easily broken said vernon grimly relapsed into silence struck a strange that ida must cease to love handsome scamp considering how infatuated have be with for month if thing be a mr bedge stated there be chance colonel towton warm devotion must be appreciated there be also chance vernon winced when thought of that having opportunity of marrying ida pleasure loving maunders must prosecute wooing of miss corsoon with renewed vigour in case in spite of lucy pronounced liking for vernon thought dismally that there must be little likelihood of own success more dangerous rival than maunders when really put heart into love making can scarcely be imagined mr bedge broke in upon meditation what have be speaking about brings to reason why asked to come see said smoothing dress arranging old fashioned bracelet wore see a tell be not rich a have informed ida doe not love constantine a used to now want to consider if must possibly be arranged must become ida companion vernon started with astonishment did not think that mr bedge must prove very cheerful companion to young girl moreover seemed strange that at age must wish for position must be poor indeed considering how constantine have drained be scarcely to be wondered at miss hest act more a miss dimsdale companion remarked vernon with hesitation think be most dangerous woman said mr bedge warm colour flushing faded cheek be public reciter may be old fashioned think be right that young girl like ida must be so friendly with woman who appears on stage vernon laughed at echo of early victorian prudery miss hest only recites at concert home explained can scarcely be called actress look upon a such said mr bedge primly have known ida for year when father be in burmah sent to school in england always spent holiday with be how constantine came to fall in love with have be dream of life to see married especially a ida be rich need man to look after money wish to become ida companion not only because be one of oldest friend need to supplement income because hope to influence again in boy favour understand vernon smiled quietly a thought that if maunders looked after ida money there must be little of left in few year quite understood a have acknowledged affectionate scheme of fond old woman who be slave to adopted son can scarcely advise mr bedge miss hest be lady there can be doubt on point character be above reproach also be clever strong minded kind of companion miss dimsdale want for must not think added after pause miss dimsdale be capable of managing large fortune have seen very little of since funeral suppose will be proved be in possession of money there be will said mr bedge unexpectedly constantine learned that from ida merely inherited a next of kin be same thing why poor martin call mr dimsdale martin because knew for year year explained in parenthesis why poor martin never made will ca say did not strange reflected vernon musingly so business like man must certainly have made will must have thought however a miss dimsdale have inherited a next of kin doe matter failing money presume must have gone to lady corsoon certainly ida a daughter of poor martin take precedence of julia a sister think of money mr vernon being at mercy of adventuress like miss hest think be adventuress mr bedge ca see how money be at mercy see very plainly said mr bedge with asperity miss hest have most extraordinary influence over ida not healthy one since have permitted to shut up for week natural grief of miss dimsdale there be bound to grief interrupted old lady sharply young recover from sorrow quicker than do aged poor martin be good father ida doe right to mourn not to ridiculous extent of shutting up for two month with woman seem to like miss hest oh have word to say against character daresay be lady perfectly correct in behaviour be not companion for ida besides come go from 'rangoon at will be not regular companion such a girl must have miss hest so constantine tell life at isleworth with horrid old retired actor wife professor garrick gail yes told that so brazen sniffed mr bedge more prim than ever be not right tell mr vernon someone must interfere one can mr bedge miss dimsdale be own mistress being over age have own money have right to live a plea not in opinion mr vernon be not respectable must not see suggest that must sell let 'rangoon come here to live with a paid companion also must help to keep up house vernon almost laughed so selfish be proposition thought very unlikely that ida must surrender charming residence of rangoon intellectual society of miss hest to shut up with buckram old dame in stuffy second rate dwelling be not intimate enough with miss dimsdale to suggest thing be searching for assassin of father persisted mr bedge with dogged obstinacy of age out of gratitude must adopt suggestion besides must be glad to see old schoolfellow constantine settled for life be on vernon lip to say that must be sorry to see woman let alone ida dimsdale tied to selfish creature like mr maunders out of pity for infatuated old lady refrained besides since believed constantine to be angel one must ever be able to argue out of fancy other people be searching for spider also said gently so miss dimsdale have particular reason to show gratitude especially a have offered reward of one thousand pound know constantine be trying to earn deuce be sprang from vernon lip mr bedge drew up spare form folded hand like slang mr vernon then when apologised continued constantine want to earn money also if catch spider ida will surely marry out of sheer gratitude think have stronger reason to catch spider said vernon drily mr bedge coloured looked aside guess what mean a asked poor martin to speak to on subject of attempted blackmail be scandalous be not however have heard more from wicked creature think will after committing crime be not likely that spider will dare to continue in wickedness well said vernon standing up to take leave certainly have not heard of anyone being blackmailed lately perhaps spider think that have gone too far be afraid suggested to constantine that must capture spider if wished to become partner in be broke off vernon in confusion might understand said mr bedge quietly know that be nemo poor martin revealed private business when suggested that must consult about spider attempt to blackmail can be perfectly satisfied will not betray secret having smiled faintly one of own looked at inquiringly understand refer to accusation spider brought against went on mr bedge eye glittering feverishly breath coming going in gasp oh be shameful that man must dare to accuse of immorality yes there be need for to mince word mr vernon of immorality why only man ever loved be martin then went to india be worried by family into marrying mr bedge sister married partner constantine mavrocordato maunders understood name be be english name took be why son adopted boy really nephew come to be called so never liked mavrocordato to think that spider must accuse clenched thin hand primness fled be no longer precise old lady of precise epoch angry insulted woman if must find man mr vernon must strike across lip urged constantine to hunt down to gain gratitude of ida by punishing murderer of father because wish spider to be punished for insult put upon must find mr vernon spare can promise said vernon very grimly for decoying still rankled in breast still a yet can find out nothing about if blackmail again let know then can arrange trap so may be murdered like poor martin thank will see that thing doe occur second time fancy can set mind at rest mr bedge spider be too much wanted for to continue little game risk be too great daresay will turn attention to america to colony mr bedge followed to door then think that have left england inquired eagerly think so think well scarcely know what to think leave thing a be mr bedge sooner later hope to capture rascal now must leave will see ida suggest scheme to be companion know well enough to suggest bluntly will see day hint at idea please keep eye on constantine fear be ruining health with society see very little of constantine mr bedge fear must not take well meant advice might offer finally got away from prim house although mr bedge be anxious to keep in conversation when on heath breathing widely blown air drew long breath to refresh lung did not wonder that maunders remained a little a possible in tomb for be nothing else to pleasure loving lively young man accustomed to be petted by pretty woman welcomed by monied men society of aunt atmosphere of stuffy house must naturally be abhorrent constantine be not individual likely to deny merry life for sake of attending on woman to whom owed so much have absolutely idea of meaning of word gratitude most people maunders be one of know that there be such word in dictionary walking along musingly vernon remembered how dimsdale have spoken of emily bedge how also have stated a have done that be in love when young now dimsdale be dead girl have so admired be faded old woman cherishing foolish affection for one who must never return same who have intention of returning considering lonely life sad history dismal present position of mr bedge young man began to think that after must be charity to persuade ida dimsdale to take a companion in society of girl mr bedge might grow youthful again of course presence might be dangerous a must certainly do best to persuade ida into marrying constantine assuredly infatuation of ida might revive vernon wondered how have died away what cause have be at work to make ida regard with indifference handsome face of scamp from hint given by mr bedge began to believe that be work of miss hest if so be wonder that old woman spoke ill of of course mr bedge be biassed for vernon believed france hest to be clever capable woman who be likely to prove tower of strength to ida since girl character although sweet be not particularly firm then there be always chance that miss hest might become tyrant thinking in way vernon suddenly stumbled against man coming from opposite direction also deep in thought looked up with mutual apology burst out laughing newcomer be colonel towton explained a shook hand have just be to see miss dimsdale said colonel crisply gave so much to think about be in brown study have come from mr bedge who also made think observed vernon with smile hence ran into where be going colonel back to town said military man promptly be walking always walk a much a possible in london for sake of necessary exercise perhaps must rather drive prefer to walk be glad to have met towton a wished to speak with privately curious said colonel screwing glass into eye have in mind when ran into let walk down hill talk there be more privacy in open air than anywhere else well well echoed vernon a turned face towards london what do wish to say will come to point circuitously retorted colonel smartly so have be to see mr bedge poor old dimsdale told about rival aunt believe yes quaint old lady of albert period towton shuddered know style vernon stiff prudish dowdy h be rather contrast to young friend be devilish handsome infernally modern suppose old lady give plenty of money always seems to be in forefront of thing yet like somehow voice doe ring true there perhaps be prejudiced since court miss dimsdale be man not saint so feel jealous have need to be colonel eh what colonel stopped abruptly eye sparkled do mean to say that have ceased to court miss dimsdale well well went on without waiting for reply must wonder might have guessed a much for three four time have be to corsoons maunders be always there making furious love to pretty lucy of theirs have better look after if intend to make wife vernon lady corsoon always receives so coldly that scarcely dare call confessed young man dismally daresay maunders have put spoke in wheel in quarter yes hang ca mean to marry girl forget what hinted just now towton mr bedge assured with great grief a want marriage to take place miss dimsdale have ceased to care for nephew only military self control prevented colonel from throwing tall hat in air thought be kinder to to day said jubilantly never mentioned maunders name now think of do believe have chance vernon better one than ever have replied vernon heartily may be sure will endeavour to aid in way by way how be miss dimsdale have seen only once since burial of father of course then be overcome with grief towton thought for moment before replying to tell truth vernon think that dark browed young woman be good companion for in way why not vernon be rather struck that mr bedge colonel must unknowingly agree on point be clever oh daresay if ask sight too clever grumbled colonel shouldering thin umbrella like gun ida well can call ida to since have become so friendly ida be charming girl not strong minded must seek for wife if be a hate masterful woman miss hest be of sort seems to have too much control over ida in fact may be wrong must say to anyone be kind of hypnotism h be do remember what concini woman said about supposed magical influence over marie de medici that only used influence of strong mind over weak one oh think ida be weak minded said colonel hastily be sweet loving delightful girl who must make man happy miss hest be what call cat yes amiable cat so long a thing go to liking be sure must show claw if necessary doe support maunders support one seems to that find that reciting doe pay so hope to become ida companion for life if ida married 'd be nowhere fancy for reason wish to keep ida single so doe countenance maunders vernon mused remembered how have fancied that miss hest might have be person to undermine maunders chance now towton be saying same thing however said nothing while colonel walking talking vigorously continued speech besides said towton there be queer strain in family gerby hall where brother life be three mile from place brother sister be twin exactly like one hit off together gerby hall be supposed to be haunted people think hests to be mad queer deuce know what france hest doe seem to be mad said vernon drily well know head seems to be screwed on right belief in occultism sort of thing influence be unhealthy for induced ida to go to diabella who vernon nodded know diabella be fortune teller in bond street be supposed to be very clever what did tell miss dimsdale ah must find out made ill gave headache something ida said very little seemed averse to speaking about visit miss hest supplied information be full of wonderful thing diabella have told ida what wonderful thing ca say told that ida refused to speak about matter intend to find out something about diabella therefore be going to call on have appointment in three day will tell nothing about miss dimsdale of course not will be able to see what kind of woman be want ida to get under bad influence that of miss hest be quite enough be clever enough to read diabella character if possible will try prevent ida from seeing again be just a well tell what hear from fortune teller towton shrugged shoulder oh will be same old rubbish about love money marriage believe in mercenary occult people although have faith in genuine sort have met with in india now one of vernon must soon spot damned spider why not ask diabella will do so gad be idea then think occultist who take money be real truth teller however can do harm asking so will do so by way vernon have heard if police have

otherwise have avoided like poison wished to learn clearly attitude of maunders with regard to two lady be so audaciously wooing much a man loved lucy corsoon maunders love in quarter really seemed to be most honest part of loved more seemed incredible to vernon so egotistic person must risk losing world of pleasure for genuine passion sir julius corsoon be wealthy lucy be heiress if married

sign of yielding have asked to go to tea at house afternoon if hated must not ask in so friendly way almost imperceptible smile passed over full lip of maunders shrugged shoulder go to house by mean hear what have to say sneered will risk visit vernon be baffled by fencing evasion man must say yea nay be impossible to tell what intended to do if will leave field clear for with miss corsoon will take into partnership said at last entreatingly be not sure if wish to be taken in retorted maunders contemptuously be not respectable business be liar business be perfectly respectable earn money

nonsense filial feeling be out of date said maunders lightly however will tell aunt what think of talking to in way a to rest of keep out of way vernon will be worse for ah vernon faced round at door now speak clearly be to be peace war between war snapped maunders ca hurt war let be interrupted vernon opening door good day walked out smartly leaving friend rather enemy now that war have be declared rather surprised by abrupt departure when door closed maunders face grew black brow wrinkled perhaps must have driven arty to such declaration murmured young man thoughtfully be fool clever fool after although love lucy will be better for to marry ida since have money wonder how aunt emily found out about ida change towards ca last however if only take trouble to see often enough be lucy who hold back be fool a know that lucy doe care for a doe for arty wish have fought now ca harm ca maunders glanced round luxurious room sha there be too much to lose damn will fight beat there while maunders be coming to conclusion vernon be walking swiftly along piccadilly in direction of covent garden a intended to go to office wherein carried on business a nemo now that maunders have openly declared a enemy situation be somewhat adjusted vernon felt that must deal with made up mind to tackle lady corsoon very day ask if might be permitted to pay attention to lucy then in interview with girl might manage to brush aside semi hypnotic influence maunders fascinating personality seemed to exercise over if must only get mother on side must be well lady corsoon did not know that be nemo be just a well did not know also that have expectation from bachelor uncle who must leave title fortune of three thousand year if be set before might be induced to welcome a suitor although sir julius lady corsoon be said to desire nothing le than duke for only child if be case vernon wondered why lady tolerated maunders who be poor without position however when called afternoon might be able to learn reason at event expectation against maunders mere good look must probably carry day at office surprise awaited clerk dry a dust lean old fellow a silent wise looking a owl met in outer room with mysterious face informed that lady have be waiting hour for appearance of nemo have refused to give name have declared intention of remaining until saw detective vernon in business capacity be used to people who came went without giving name a business be generally shady so did not pay much attention to matter hanging up coat hat laying aside glove cane passed into inner room then received surprise aforesaid client be none other than lady corsoon arose perfectly self possessed did not appear to be surprised to see young man how be mr vernon asked holding out gracious hand perhaps must call nemo here mr nemo vernon violently red inwardly greatly upset by recognition accepted gloved hand timidly how did find out that oh enemy told finished lady corsoon sitting down enemy stammered unfortunate man nervously mr constantine maunders who vernon interrupted struck hard blow on table eye flashed dangerously then in spite of promise told what so much desired to keep secret yes said lady corsoon drily be desire to put against so that must philander with daughter shot failed to hit mark be delighted to hear that be nemo have heard something of nemo doings cleverness so information brought here a see to forbid house asked to afternoon tea to day invitation be issued after enemy betrayed sit down mr nemo become business like have much to talk about considerably surprised by attitude vernon sank into chair before desk stared at lady corsoon in dim light filtered through dingy window of room be well worth looking at in spite of age a dress be perfect look still displayed remains of considerable beauty be somewhat stout be true complexion whether due to art nature be that of young girl sparkling brown eye revealed intellect of mean order clever woman be lady corsoon within limitation must have be even more power in fashionable world than be have not be so dominated by powerful personality of husband sir julius be of long descent in youth of ruined fortune owing to spendthrift father being inborn financier however have built up aladdin palace of gold on ruin be extremely wealthy yet have heart of miser allowed wife daughter only sufficient to keep up position with care difficulty mean behaviour explains reason of lady corsoon visit to vernon in avatar of nemo a speedily understood a yet have not overcome surprise at thus finding mask torn off come come said lady corsoon tapping arm with sunshade have come to see business man not dreamer wake up mr nemo vernon winced on hearing pronounce trade name be at service said in low voice in hand rejoined lady corsoon briskly what must world say if knew that arthur vernon be private inquiry agent making money out of people secret take for spider apparently said vernon with spirit anxious through pride to repel odious accusation make money by helping people to keep secret not by betraying be on side of law not of criminal upon word ca see that man who carry on honest business to preserve secret to save unfortunate people from blackmail be worse than if indeed a bad a city rogue who trade unscrupulously on people weakness for gambling lady corsoon changed colour at last word evidently be about to make remark thereon however checked sharply replied with feigned carelessness very well argued mr vernon people be prejudiced against who seek to know secret because everyone have turned down page in book of life cried young man in business prevent page being read by who wish to be paid for reading want business known be not ashamed of why did take up because father lost money have scarcely enough to live upon retorted young man quickly proudly have expectation vernon started how do know that demanded sharply lady corsoon tapped arm again in own way have be doing little detective business be so persistent in following lucy from house to house so decidedly refused to receive 'no for answer that made inquiry to see why must have courage to offer young girl ruined fortune learned indeed that be ruined by father learned also that sir edward vernon of slimthorp in worcestershire be uncle have good income wife be eighty year of age chance be that will succeed can not keep out of title said vernon bitterly must have gained more information lady corsoon uncle hated father because father married woman loved hate because be son of woman hope to inherit money what be title without money did not explain what have discovered else must have done so since seemed useless to put forward that a plea for engagement to daughter dear man title be better than nothing be too modest besides lucy will have plenty of money know if marries a father wish hear vernon smiled bitterly that want duke want honest man upon whom can depend said lady corsoon with energy for reason have come to see in spite of fact that be nemo for very reason that be nemo retorted with lightning glance dear boy mr maunders thought to do bad turn by telling of secret business thought must certainly forbid house finally end dangling after daughter a be have done good turn a be man want for lucy for if can carry out safely business have come to see about will encourage address to lucy so far a can influence so iron natured man will win sir julius to side come be bargain oh vernon caught hand joyfully of course be never dreamed of such happiness now know why maunders smiled when told be due at house afternoon when did see immediately before came here went to ask whether wished to marry miss corsoon miss dimsdale refused to say smiled ah thought that having told be nemo intended to dismiss for ever from house when called afternoon daresay will learn that instead of enemy be friend instead of marrying lucy will be just a well added lady corsoon quietly a love although be more le fascinated by gentleman will say be fascinated lady corsoon else must scarcely have tolerated penniless man dangling after daughter tolerated a say because mr maunders know secret secret in flash vernon recalled conversation with young man under peristyle in maunders have hinted that knew something must enable to manage lady corsoon what be secret have come to tell so interrupt until have finished said lady corsoon coolly come to because know in hundred way that be what mr maunders be not honest gentleman also private detective need have one great vice mr vernon be gambler for last two year have lost heap of money at bridge to pay debt since sir julius kept always very short of money pawned certain family jewel if sir julius find that out be capable of causing scandal by forcing separation for lucy sake a well a for own want thing to take place how can find out lady corsoon fished in green gold bag be slung on arm produced elegant sheet of writing paper read that said quietly vernon started suppressed cry at foot of writing saw purple spider impressed clearly well known sign manual of scoundrel who have murdered mr dimsdale glancing eye over page read that spider have learned about pawning of certain family jewel moreover have managed by forged ticket to get same into possession be willing to sell back for two thousand pound to be paid in gold on certain date at certain place to be arranged when received lady corsoon reply reply be to be put in agony column of daily telegraph when further arrangement must be made for payment of sum handing over of jewel failing consent spider intended to apply to sir julius to reveal lady corsoon gambling propensity whole of precious epistle written very elegantly ended with ideograph of purple spider what do think of asked lady corsoon when vernon finished reading what can think of that man be blackguard want to deal with yes ca pay two thousand pound a have not got husband keep very short see that be candid then trust a doubt mr maunders why do doubt asked vernon suddenly because followed one day to pawnshop learned secret not in so many word by unmistakable hint gave to understand that open house to encouraging of love for lucy be price of silence thing have gone from bad to worse feel that be under thumb until jewel be got back again proof of madness be destroyed be keeping brave face mr vernon be truly in despair sir julius be hard man revelation of what have done mean disgrace husband will not spare for daughter sake no must remove lucy from care cast off with small income to live on ca get divorce will insist upon separation a feel certain alone can save if can agree to marriage with daughter oh cried struck by strange look in vernon eye think be selling lucy to love now that know will day have title money doe matter a sir julius may be persuaded into accepting a son in law at event if will be friend will be be bargain yes said vernon gripping hand held out for more reason than one do wish to track blackmailing beast to lair agree by line in daily telegraph to pay money in month will give time to turn round lady corsoon drew long breath of relief thank god came to a for mr maunders really believe hesitated what asked vernon looking up quickly that be spider chapter viii grief of ida vernon be not man to let grass grow under foot when there be anything to gain by hurry in case happiness of whole life be at stake visit of lady corsoon to enlist on side with bribe of supporting suit for daughter be one of unexpected card fate deal to win in game of life be veritable ace with vernon hoped to trump maunders trick hitherto handsome scamp have have everything own way now be to find serious obstacle in path with lucy love mother support course of true affection might run smoother father might be gained over by playing on instinctive dislike to maunders by news vernon have hitherto not thought worth imparting namely that have chance of becoming baronet moreover since war have be declared between two schoolfellow maunders must undoubtedly make disagreeable in case already acting treacherously have informed lady corsoon of way in vernon earned money be probable that now must inform others of course young man wished to prevent for in spite of defence of profession be aware that world doe not look amiably on one who life by learning secret of weak humanity even when aim be to preserve same secret from use by villain difficulty be to seal maunders mouth a moment noticed certainly must speedily that vernon be favoured by lady corsoon must spread scandal with zeal born of knowledge that empire be slipping from also must strive to intimidate lady corsoon more openly must not be denied what position towards aggressively upright husband be delicate one thus maunders be enemy of lady corsoon of vernon to crush therefore formed secret partnership in unity lay strength weapon vernon proposed to use towards dangerous foe be that supplied by chance remark of lady corsoon that maunders might be spider when departed with assurance that there be nothing to be afraid of for at least one month vernon sat silently in chair thinking over what have be said after did not seem impossible that maunders must be arch scoundrel for whom police be so eagerly seeking to vernon own knowledge young man did not receive large sum from mr bedge have other source of income yet a vernon have seen contrived to live like prince on nothing year perhaps like amiable talented mr rawdon crawley managed to keep up princely appearance by spending other people money be by getting deeply into debt vernon knew that maunders did not owe one penny came by information by having at request of late mr dimsdale searched into maunders private life month previously old ex police commissioner seeing that daughter be infatuated with young man hoped to learn something to discredit so asked vernon whom knew already a nemo to make examination of course vernon did not guess at time mr dimsdale wished to find something to discredit of undesirable suitor merely thought that old man be anxious to learn if maunders be fit husband for daughter in fact vernon believed that be doing old schoolfellow good turn in probing life certainly learned that maunders owed nothing always settled debt scrupulously presumably on money allowed by mr bedge so presented report to dimsdale with remark that maunders at event be honest man now case assumed different aspect with mr bedge confession of poverty confession be supported a true by anxiety to become ida paid companion since maunders paid debt lived like millionaire in embryo how did manage to fill purse lady corsoon have provided very reasonable reply to serious question be spider hang be not clever enough muttered vernon rising to pace narrow confines of office at point of meditation be cunning smart observant unscrupulous spider be genius manages affair in far seeing way doe not suggest maunders conny be willow in many way for present must sacrifice future no spider never doe that wait plan arranges operation in such way that can never be captured feasible though seems ca see constantine a master criminal again vernon reflected that when trap have be arranged between dead man window of library have be open a mr dimsdale have mentioned in subsequent letter with wrath maunders have called at moment in fact have be round corner of bungalow nearest to library with two lady now be not impossible that in passing library light footed a be maunders trod like cat might have lingered at sound of voice thus might have gained necessary knowledge of trap have afterwards utilized to inveigle vernon to west kensington house be presuming be spider name of lucy corsoon used in wire be very name maunders knowing vernon love for girl must employ finally maunders have be at ball must have be easy for masked cloaked a be to steal into library commit crime afterwards mingling with guest in apparent innocence on ground vernon began to believe that lady corsoon might be correct in assumption always there came doubt that maunders be too willow to be arch rogue be clever certainly not genius whereas spider be napoleon amongst criminal fraternity in one way can prove something said vernon to if maunders did enter library must have be absent from ballroom for time will go to 'rangoon ask question without letting be seen why ask then can learn for certain about movement on night moreover can interview miss dimsdale learn how be disposed towards colonel finally will see if be right in thinking that miss hest influence be harmful to in way having come to decision repaired ensuing day to hampstead fully determined to set doubt at rest glance at agony column of daily telegraph have assured that lady corsoon have carried out suggestion under initial x asked for one month time to consider matter of s undoubtedly must be accorded to a be spider policy never to hurry victim robbed in most graceful easy going fashion so dexterously that victim rather congratulated that have so honest criminal tradesman to deal with so lady corsoon secret be safe for month before expiration of period vernon hoped to lay hand on rogue who have baffled police for so long in heart did not expect to find maunders in grip of law at first vernon be refused admittance by butler on insisting on sending in card be shown into central hall shortly miss hest made appearance with smiling somewhat serious face looked extremely tall handsome in black browed way a advanced towards visitor how be mr vernon said shaking hand politely be business with miss dimsdale very important be not well to day have just be bathing forehead with eau de cologne oh have just come to make afternoon call replied vernon easily be sorry to hear that miss dimsdale be ill france sighed have never be same since poor father terrible death loved a dearly a loved know mr vernon so shock be great quite understand still after two month more le of quiet surely must be recovering at age one doe not remember for ever at age one have longer memory mr vernon be kind of to call ida like very much especially a be friend of poor mr dimsdale think might come in for quarter of hour vernon hesitated wish to disturb ida said doubtfully if want to be quiet oh left decision to when got card be acting a kind of nurse to poor darling ida be just like sister know professional engagement matter have made good deal of money in one way mr vernon know can afford to take rest want ida to come down to bowderstyke with stop at hall flashed into vernon suspicious mind that perhaps france wished ida to fall in love with brother ten thousand year must be very acceptable to mr hest if colonel towton story be to be believed according to brother be not millionaire what money have spent lavishly in helping parish remarked about to france a led through door at end of hall into boudoir where ida be lying hear from colonel towton brother be quite philanthropist france laughed oh colonel have be talking have brother must be quite annoyed a never liked to be praised then be not human said vernon bluntly be human enough to be annoyed with because chose to earn own living said france bitterly however let see ida then will tell about brother in fact want to ask advice why must think be capable of giving advice miss hest oh be so grave replied with smile halting at door of boudoir mr dimsdale poor man always said that be so clever in making suggestion besides know opinion ida have of ida dear passed into room here be mr vernon arthur said girl who be lying on couch near window oh be so glad to see be glad france did not send away be such tyrant a nurse perhaps need tyrant to manage ida be always too impulsive reckless of health think have changed since poor papa death feel reckless in way now will never get over never france who have taken knitting to sit in near chair frowned a girl spoke be way go on mr vernon be foolish want to go out enjoy a if must when poor papa be dead only two month cried ida sighing oh mean to lead gay life must stay here day after day without sunshine think miss hest be right ida said vernon gravely scrutinising pale face of girl be not looking well feel at well replied peevishly there be nothing organically wrong put in france quickly doctor said that ida be perfectly healthy only needed to go out lead happy life to become quite strong will never be happy again said ida with determination visitor nurse a france might be called looked at one girl evidently have made up mind to be miserable be not sensible attitude to adopt then ida be not particularly sensible girl assuredly be not brilliantly clever although possessed certain amount of brain pretty in doll like way with golden hair blue eye creamy pink complexion be excellent type of charming modest playful english girl who must make good wife devoted mother there be nothing original about being spoilt darling of elderly father be subject to mood be sick well merry sad just a fit took at one time must fatigue with theatre dance tennis tournament again with revulsion of feeling must lie on sofa day reading novel poet must have called april lady of sunshine rain ordinary human being must have found trying said great deal for miss hest true affection that put up with so whimsical being weathercock be nothing in comparison with ida dimsdale why sober elderly military man like colonel towton must desire to make such featherhead wife be problem vernon be trying to solve a stared at girl on sofa ida mood since death of father have be to play invalid certainly have suffered shock a be natural time have softened memory of tragic death vernon approved of miss hest desire to get girl away to yorkshire ought to go to gerby hall ida remarked after momentary silence few week in open air must do good in world be what tell said france severely wo come down to yorkshire a suggest will end in going away altogether ida stretched out pretty hand caught that of miss hest oh france darling know can not live without must have companion vernon thought that be good opportunity to advance mr bedge request have promised to bear in mind there be charming old lady who offer to become companion said gently ida stared shuddered like old lady who be mr bedge asked to speak to because have lost lot of money be therefore willing to accept salary a companion france laid down work clasped hand why ida be very thing for dear mr bedge be so old so sedate then can attend to business knowing be right france ida sat up on sofa looked reproachfully at friend how can talk so like mr bedge who have always be very kind to there be denying that be extremely dull besides have told that can have salary like to ask to make up for losing engagement replied that wished to be independent said miss hest stiffly like living on anyone be why left gerby hall about mr bedge dear be really capital idea sha entertain for one moment when mr bedge come will tell so with thanks of course added ida a afterthought why must speak to direct well vernon laughed be rather delicate subject however if wo have wo so there be more to be said might suggest ida a really be looking better with colour have come into cheek at suggestion that must pull up blind make room look more cheerful ida jumped up lightly did a asked mood have changed with advent of tactful young man be there anything more lordship requires asked with saucy curtsey must like cup of tea be not hospitable replied vernon delighted by change in manner ida touched button of bell be always greedy arthur then when footman appeared gave necessary order believe called le to see than to get tea ended laughing quite in old girlish fashion ida believe be ill at said vernon scrutinising imagination make ill put in france who be knitting industriously belief that be sick therefore be sick be christian science laughed ida sitting in chair instead of returning to lounge on sofa perhaps be right dear of course have fretted great deal over poor papa death fretting will not bring back ended with sigh face clouded over again what want be bright society vernon assured hurriedly suggest mr bedge be ida ironical retort never thought that be right companion for a be too staid solemn have discharged conscience by putting request to never for one moment thought that

brother be very like one france dear extremely in face form can mystify anyone when be seen together in disposition be quite unlike one be more egotistic than francis be philanthropist devotes money to improving parish six seven village owe everything to keep going mean suggested vernon idly leaning back not exactly two year ago there be great dearth of water have frequently occurred during dry weather francis determined that must not occur again so obtained permission engaged clever engineer to construct reservoir at top of bowderstyke valley be big work to undertake must have cost heap of money francis can afford said miss hest indifferently grandmother from whom inherits estate left lot of ready money francis be clever speculator work hard at stock share be always in touch with broker in london money make spends in improving parish around have repaired several church have built poorhouse also small hall for entertainment vicar work hand in hand then of course reservoir be crowning work a supplied water to at least six village oh what good man must be said ida thoughtfully here be with money doing nothing bearing in mind that fancied miss hest wished to marry ida to brother

told vernon apparently be suffering from effect of what have be told by fashionable witch of endor although what have be said towton must not find out miss hest girl have held peace on subject notwithstanding that former have talked generally on wonderful power of woman in fact have seriously advised colonel towton to interview diabella search out future for soldier have laughed a be not given to dabble in occultism nevertheless have made up mind to seek out seeress if only to discover indirectly what method of devilry be have so strongly impressed miss dimsdale towton to put plainly went a client than a spy considering that ida have very strongly marked personality be wonderful that colonel must be so deeply in love with be clever in own way not without brain power inside outside own particular military profession bravery be undeniable tact considerable have left army on account of family affair with name of one who have cut short brilliant career unnecessarily towton assuredly must have risen to be general have not retired when family estate came into possession now that have abandoned profession one aim be to marry lead quiet domestic life did not wish for clever wife wealthy wife particularly lovely wife a be too matter of fact to be romantic dream be of peaceful hearth house perfectly managed by gentle wife in ida believed that saw helpmate so greatly desired one who must make husband will law who must be cheerful companion mood believed to be result of lack of guidance flattered that when became mr towton must be able to render le freakish ida nature be so impressionable that thought must be easily moulded in doubt be right many of girl fault be due to over indulgence of father to lack of firm hand to lead in right way must have welcomed master having one of nature responsive to suggestion in unconscious way colonel appealed to a strong kind hearted man who must shelter from storm of life better than one else must in point of fact two be made for one for intrusion of maunders course of true love must have run smooth however colonel towton be extremely obstinate having decided that ida be very wife desired to preside over dinner table be determined not to let be snatched from by rival admitted with dread that maunders be formidable wooer moreover guessed with keen instinct of man in love france hest have too much control over girl for one thing have induced ida to go to diabella thing towton must never have permitted have be able to help knew from indian experience only too well that there be truth in occultism that impressionable being such a ida truly be must easily be obsessed by strong suggestion have reason to doubt miss hest did not think for one moment that be enemy in way with assistance of suggestion from diabella might lead ida into unhealthy way dealing with unseen with psychic have to do be unhealthy in colonel very material eye already a have seen for visit to diabella have upset ida so whatever harm done might be be necessary to undo by proving woman to be fraud towton therefore ascended stair to consulting room of diabella with intention of learning if fortune teller be humbug once assured of that resolved to explain method to miss dimsdale so prevent trusting a truth whatever woman have said then ida indignation at being duped a colonel believed have be must probably shake miss hest position towton felt certain that france be more friendly to maunders than to at one sweep hoped to get rid of afterwards ida must be more willing to become wife diabella office a might be called consisted of two room small outer one entered directly from passage spacious inner one overlooked street a towton tapped at door of prophetess thought suddenly flew back to many year of sojourn in far east for moment must not think what have detached so unexpectedly from england until on stepping across threshold of now open door became aware of strong pungent scent impossible to describe at once noted a smell of bazaar run without break from port said to hong kong perfume be strongest of aid to memory therefore towton thought have flashed back over many year to various indian experience body be in england soul be in east did sight met eye dispel illusion room entered attendant who welcomed be egyptian in look small apartment resembled ancient tomb a wall ceiling be painted vividly with hieroglyphic glowing in crimson blue yellow emerald green through stained glass skylight overhead dim coloured light streamed just sufficiently to reveal weird look of room be faked of course very cleverly faked a colonel secretly admitted even to attendant who apparently true eastern be attired in garb one of pharaoh fan bearer might have worn appropriately floor be covered with linoleum painted to resemble marble there be quaintly shaped table of ebony two three antique uncomfortable chair copied from furniture of xix dynasty weird looking teak sofa covered with bright yellow cushion what with grotesquely painted wall sparsity of furniture dim light scented atmosphere strangely dressed attendant who salaamed profusely colonel towton felt a though have stepped at one stride across mediterranean to resuscitated memphis man be slim straight native with handsome haughty feature of brahmin type towton wondered that have broken caste to cross black water have keen black eye took in look of english sahib in single flash notwithstanding that stood with crossed arm downcast eye towton wondered if spoke english for sake of experiment addressed in tamil dark skinned man replied in very fair english with inquisitive glance at stranger who spoke indian dialect so glibly be mistress in enquired colonel speaking tamil within sahib wait be reply in anglo saxon immediately following few word towton be led into inner room attendant closed door after leaving client alone with diabella room be decorated much in same tomb like fashion a other one there be mummy standing round wall at interval in richly adorned coffin two window looking on to bond street be draped with rich eastern stuff to entirely exclude light of day several lamp burning perfumed oil dangled from ceiling room be filled with mellow radiance eminently suited to object for be used towton shrewdly surmised that peculiar decoration exclusion of daylight for use of artificial illumination highly scented atmosphere prevailed even more strongly here than have done in outer room be meant to daze sens of diabella client so that might more readily credit assertion be cleverly conceived carried out woman be seated at end of room under kind of canopy on uncomfortable ebony wood chair inlaid with ivory before be tiny square table of same sombre wood with twisted leg on stood large crystal size of small orange diabella be seated in hieratical attitude with hand on knee like stone god wore stiff straight robe of mingled black yellow made resemble viper face struck towton most a apparently wore entire mask modelled in wax from actual egyptian mummy be surmounted by well known head dress of harsh black ringlet combed straightly to shoulder mouth of mask be partially open so that fortune teller must speak easily behind with dead looking face motionless attitude diabella looked exactly like mummy flanked right left right left also in tall iron tripod flamed spirit cast weird light on uncanny appearance nothing better must have be designed to impress weak minded in temple of illusion from lip of such strange creature boldest might be excused for believing impossible even colonel towton felt unaccustomed shudder a though be in presence of unseen wish to consult who dwell in darkness about future asked sorceress in strange metallic voice a unhuman a be look towton smiled scornfully twisted moustache have quite recovered momentary obsession by perfumed atmosphere sat down with cool air must speak egyptian to be perfect scoffed diabella disdained to notice jeer must have look in crystal spell card read hand none of three thank said towton drily do really posse power of reading thing can read past present future can tell be permitted to be told by power be unbeliever colonel chuckled wrong first shot having seen good deal of sort of thing although glanced round room scarcely so dressy place believe that gifted people have certain sens at command if not under control with can foretell thing quite appreciate remark about power permitting forbidding a be aware that such be case did not say that be unbeliever generally said diabella trying to recover lost ground that did not believe in did not put precisely in fashion retorted towton however may a well have guinea worth be there reason why must believe in demanded contemptuously quiet voice replied indifferently yes have not held hand have contacted atmosphere closely still be sufficiently in touch with to state that bring woman in aura in what asked colonel wilfully dense aura of magnetism stream from radiant a rainbow in be standing thought form of girl be not very tall have blue eye golden hair love be right sha say replied colonel secretly surprised to hear description of ida statement of feeling towards humph made half unwilling admission have psychic power after tell more give ring commanded diabella imperiously be impregnated with magnetism will thus suggest colour colour repeated colonel interrogatively removing signet ring to place on ebony table diabella picked up held in hollow of right hand human being in unseen world around have colour be prevailing hue of karmic body tinted by desire can thus recognise a appear on astral plane so can read karma of past appears in astral record thence can deduce future for good evil in great measure correctly then ca be certain that what tell be true under certain circumstance when high one permit future be revealed beyond doubt circumstance be connected only with spiritual enlightenment otherwise who have sight merely deduce what will happen by reading karma of past can be discerned in astral light claim be certainly more modest than expected said towton somewhat interested if can tell past life correctly will credit more le prophecy know name richard towton ah got that from letter asking for appointment have middle name use what be richard henry towton be full name correct where be educated at wimperly public school then at sandhurst towton nodded might be certain of sandhurst a be soldier wimperly be good go on joined regiment twenty five year ago shortly after joining be ordered to india be stationed at bombay afterwards at travancore fought in burmah where met martin dimsdale became intimate with won dso in vikram expedition interrupted colonel politely with exception of meeting with dimsdale might have read in newspaper why did retire from army cousin died left grange at bowderstyke in yorkshire gave up profession so a to get estate in order have be sadly neglected by cousin who be drunkard be impolite true said towton with grimace go on wish to marry colonel shrugged shoulder man wish to marry wish to marry girl called ida dimsdale went on passionless voice diabella refrained from making comment on remark ah now be becoming interesting why do wish to marry ida dimsdale reply be unexpected desire to get money in order to recover certain land sold by late cousin be lie towton grew trifle red spoke sharply love miss dimsdale must take without penny be how will have to take replied diabella coldly without insisting upon truth of previous statement nonsense miss dimsdale have large fortune think have ten thousand year have nothing towton felt astonishment must scarcely conceal wondered if diabella have spoken in way to ida what do mean mean that girl be not daughter of martin dimsdale what towton rose in surprise how dare say that be only reading what see said diabella wearily fortune girl be connected therefore know of past past past fumed colonel sitting down again have past in sense mean be born in burmah mother died shortly afterwards dimsdale sent home to relative afterwards went to school at hampstead five year ago returned to settle in england have be with ever since quite true be foolish to tell so much a now will say that merely echo what have mentioned have certainly not mentioned that be not dimsdale daughter be true name be ida menteith father be major in native regiment menteith be with wife in burmah at hill station called called wait until get name diabella stopped for one moment then spoke out triumphantly be called goorkah station be besieged by dacoit yes remember station not man called menteith happened before went to india what happened asked towton bluntly what be about to tell dimsdale be then police commissioner loved mr menteith who returned love hated husband believe that for one moment dimsdale be good fellow who must never make love to man wife many good fellow do said diabella sarcastically dimsdale did love mr menteith so deeply that did not save husband life when must have done so that be absolute lie insisted towton angrily how dare malign dead man who can not defend martin dimsdale friend george venery who be merchant at singapore can prove truth of what say rubbish how do know read be telling in astral light said diabella if displeases need tell more doe not so much displease a make wonder at imagination diabella still preserved immobility write to george venery will find have spoken truth seems incredible muttered towton doubtfully of course know that there be great truth in occult matter what say be too precise to be anything what must have learned perhaps from man replied fortune teller never heard name of venery before have never be to singapore even to burmah only read what see how else must know colonel made gesture of disbelief although believed in unseen from various indian experience must not credit story of masked woman go on tell more said at length later can write to mr venery verify statement ida dimsdale be daughter said diabella quietly be born in rangoon when father be being besieged in goorkah station dimsdale be in neighbourhood with force hastened to relieve friend purposely delayed approach so that station might be taken killed believe that for one moment dimsdale must not act so wickedly did act in way a venery can tell be behaviour caused breach between dimsdale hoped to get rid of menteith so marry wife plan of delay be successful station be taken by dacoit menteith be crucified perfidious friend arrived when be dying menteith be buried at goorkah station dimsdale returned to rangoon hoping to marry mr menteith now that obstacle be removed mr menteith however weak after birth of child died in few day then dimsdale be stricken with remorse brought up child a own have passed for daughter a next of kin inherits money be relation since dimsdale did not leave will how do know dimsdale left will might have seen in paper said diabella coolly did not for to sight hidden thing of dimsdale life be revealed can understand that if marry ida will get money with truth will be made known lady corsoon will inherit a be right must do towton rose so hurriedly that knocked over chair ca stand more of declared impetuously occult business be sham be making up lie insist upon removing that mask so may know who be diabella rose tall straight stiff did not seem disturbed beware colonel towton if advance step will be worse for military man laughed stepped forward must know who be a intend to make pay for telling falsehood be true be lie now know why miss dimsdale be agitated because of visit to told story also what if did truth flung up hand a colonel took step forward stand back tell take mask off insisted stretched out hand diabella swerved to one side avoided grasp then dropped into chair pressing arm of same hard immediately from mummy set round room came most unearthly cry confounded colonel not expecting such tumult weird room rang with thin wailing dismal cry be evident that mechanism connected with chair produced noise place be filled with clever contrivance to intimidate nervous people colonel towton be not nervous after first startled pause sprang forward again to seize seated figure at cost be determined to unmask sorceress learn who be then might hope to find out how have become possessed of fact concerning dimsdale past life whether same fact be simply lie designed to perplex mystify diabella never moved a towton came towards colonel soon knew why be thus certain of safety before must reach hither side of ebony table rapidly a moved be gripped from behind by two gigantic hand twisted round sharply to face tall burly hindoo arrayed in white robe wearing white turban let go dog muttered towton in tamil dialect set teeth diabella clapped hand two men closed in fierce struggle a swayed round room ebony table be upset woman cried out sentence in unknown language in metallic voice next moment native unloosened grip on englishman stepped back will go now demanded diabella quietly addressing towton no cried fiercely want mask removed whether diabella gave sign not towton be never able to say must have given signal for just a word left mouth native sprang forward with leap of tiger next moment towton found silk handkerchief round neck flashed across in way have dimsdale be killed then with tightening of handkerchief came almost insensibility rather dazed feeling bewildered brain have faint feeling of being led out of room of hearing door closed when recovered sens found seated on floor of passage quite alone first thought be to tell police what have occurred second to conceal adventure will consult with vernon thought walked unsteadily down stair feeling neck somewhat sore otherwise uninjured chapter x mystery be quite three day before colonel towton be enabled to have interview with vernon certainly wrote to at once on receiving reply telephoned only to learn that friend have be unexpectedly called from town on same evening towton therefore have to posse soul in patience remained in room recovering from assault took little time attempt at strangulation by burly hindoo who be different person to slim doorkeeper have caused colonel neck to swell a flesh be bruised chafed windpipe also felt painful owing to strong compression for twenty four hour have found difficult to swallow with ease towton recognised only too uneasily that have be within short distance of actual death perhaps must have be strangled outright have not diabella a verily believed stopped too zealous servant naturally did not wish for client death lest police must interfere put end to lucrative trade be assuredly very paying one meanwhile colonel received letter from ida saying that on ensuing day be going down to yorkshire with miss hest there breathing air like champagne enjoying perfect rest undisturbed by caller hoped to recover spirit health within month time of proposed stay what pleased towton most in letter what caused to blush like girl be hope ida expressed that must come down to country seat while stayed at hall have often told of beautiful home wrote ida amiably one of reason for staying at gerby hall be to see grange if must take fancy to run down perhaps will show to a hear from france that house be full of historical interest there be few line more to same effect really seemed a though ida wished to become acquainted with future home at least towton looked at matter in way spirit rose accordingly maunders apparently be out of favour ida have returned to first love without being unduly conceited towton be very well satisfied that girl have loved before handsome scamp have come on scene then latter look charm of manner have infatuated to alarming extent now colonel sincerely hoped that such be case momentary aberration a might be called have passed away be holding out olive branch of complete reconciliation that towton still felt unwell after rough tumble encounter with hindoo that wished to consult vernon about matter must have gone down to yorkshire at once so a to bask in sunshine of ida eye put restraint on feeling decided not without struggle to remain where be in connection with various idea have occurred to since visit to bond street fortune teller be imperative that must consult with someone ventilate various theory might might not elucidate various mystery therefore towton read smoked played patience in comfortable room watching passing of time with open eagerness on third evening be saturday vernon made appearance at eight o'clock entered with perfect coolness found facing very impatient man did wish to see colonel asked quietly found note at chamber requesting to call at once do wish to see echoed towton jumping to foot wringing vernon hand heartily why dear fellow have be sitting here on pin needle for last few day what deuce took out of town so unexpectedly beg pardon must not enquire into private business sit down have cigar whisky potash be on table at elbow oh business be not private replied vernon taking comfortable chair very excellent cigar world will know in week so know what that uncle sir edward vernon be dead be titled well to do man worth knowing never knew have uncle said towton staring be not unusual for men to have uncle said vernon drily did buck about relationship a be not best of friend family quarrel between father sir edward understand however when returned from visit to miss dimsdale found letter from uncle asking to come to slimthorp near worcester a be very ill packed up went by evening train there have be for last three day humph suppose ought to congratulate well may sir edward ca last more than week leaf heir to title mansion few thousand year be not bad old fellow went on vernon meditatively be sorry be dying deny however that death will make great change in fortune for better a be obvious will enable to marry miss corsoon said colonel nodding yes vernon thought of interview with lady corsoon replied briefly uncle edward be eighty year of age added apologetically so ca be said to have be cut off when be green be not cut off yet answered towton with shrug want to throw cold water on prospect vernon old fellow have wonderful recuperative power will be glad if get better said vernon emphatically now that be friend may be able to make life more cheerful have dismal time alone in barrack of house see why must bore with family history do said colonel unhesitatingly be because have be drawn into closer friendship by common acquaintance with maunders who be playing fast loose with two girl love have have to make common cause against enemy so be forced to speak freely besides be good chap vernon wish to work alongside better man leaning forward colonel gave friend hand grip must do must say that if knew be private detective to soften term private enquiry agent what towton nearly jumped out of chair a have money when father died explained young man steadily uncle must have nothing to do with turned power of observation to account by setting up a nemo of covent garden to hunt down criminal to help people to keep secret when threatened by blackmailer mine be perfectly honourable profession assure colonel may have prejudice well said towton after pause deny care little for detective who be too much bloodhound of law be quite sure that be driven to take up business be also quite sure added towton emphatically that business a conducted by be can be desired in way of honour why did tell if have probably maunders when found that be working together must have told struck a wise thing to take wind out of sail there be something in admitted colonel twisting moustache be glad that heard of profession from how did friend maunders find out what kept secret vernon shrugged shoulder who know seems to have wonderful nose for smelling out thing to advantage to advantage come now assure colonel be so wished to become partner lately however have changed mind promised to hold tongue to cost went on vernon slowly found that have not done so a told lady corsoon devil did then good bye to chance of daughter do think so when will soon be sir arthur vernon with eligible country seat three thousand year more le alters case whitewash a be ho ho towton laughed maliciously that will be one in eye for mr constantine maunders serve right why deuce doe play lover with two woman at once congratulate sir arthur colonel be premature never mind be just a well to take bull by horn time by forelock congratulate sir arthur for will marry miss corsoon wipe friend eye wo have girl certainly not lucy if can help said vernon hotly what about miss dimsdale rather think from what saw at interview of three day ago incline to colonel ah miss dimsdale towton nursed chin in cup of hand be about miss dimsdale amongst other thing wish to see what other thing demanded vernon bluntly diabella for one fortune teller have seen towton put hand to neck with wry smile yes jade nearly have strangled vernon dropped cigar strangled yes colonel unloosened white silk scarf wore round throat leaned forward to show fading black mark round see assure have scarcely be able to swallow since saw last that damned hindoo nearly did for hindoo did hindoo attempt to kill rather jolly nearly succeeded why because wished to tear off false face worn by diabella waxen papier mache sort of face make look like egyptian so a to be in keeping with room suppose why did wish to tear off because well said certain thing towton stopped a vernon rose quickly began to walk about room what be up now colonel do remember how gave a opinion that dimsdale have be strangled by thug ah said towton drily same idea strike also see well diabella may have something to do with matter asked to see in order that might thresh out now that know be nemo be better pleased a professional knowledge may link that together that bond street hampstead said colonel impatiently be may see connecting link between beastly nigger attempting to strangle actual strangulation of poor dimsdale in library ca see link said vernon thoughtfully diabella know nothing about dimsdale on contrary know great deal by way did tell that dimsdale be being blackmailed by confounded spider yes vernon stared wondered why question be asked have secret spider learned intended to tell to after capture of beast spider killed so vernon shrugged wonder if what diabella told be secret muttered towton stroking chin did dimsdale ever give to understand that secret whatever might have be be disgraceful one on contrary said that did mind one knowing what be said vernon promptly only added that spider have embroidered actual fact so might make thing hot for be added fact to become known to world at large towton nodded thought so thought what asked vernon impatiently that diabella mysterious spider be in league vernon dropped into chair placed hand on knee stared very hard at lean brown face of soldier what do mean listen will tell be quite sure that will come to same conclusion towton in incisive manner related what have taken place in fortune teller weird apartment effect on vernon be to produce extraordinary emotion of mingled dread relief dread because saw deep dangerous villainy at work relief a now espied gleam of light in darkness surrounding rangoon crime made remark either during towton recital after so that colonel grew impatient well what do make of asked sharply agree with that diabella spider be in league perhaps rose much agitated perhaps diabella be spider by spider always understood to be man be presumed so who know diabella may be real originator of crime may employ men to collect fee then of course a popular fortune teller have opportunity of learning people secret for who consult such creature always give away few skilfully put question few dexterous prophecy must make people loosen tongue then clever woman putting two two together must soon make four mean blackmail how deuce must learn secret of dimsdale well secret be connected with far east say that diabella employ two indian in fortune telling business may have learned from since older man one who attempted to strangle may have be soldier in burmese war so may have be connected with dimsdale then again diabella may herself have be in east may have learned about ida not being dimsdale daughter do think be true fear so a secret of birth adoption by dimsdale be not one that man must mind being made known embroidery to poor dead friend alluded consists of assertion that wilfully delayed coming to assistance of menteith for sake of man wife acted in david uriah hittite manner that embroidery be indeed worth blackmail be true believe dimsdale assertion rather than diabella story knew fact improved upon in way have mentioned colonel towton nodded then ida not being dimsdale daughter there being will can not inherit presumed father money a next of kin think not will go to lady corsoon a diabella asserted be dimsdale sister only relative will be good thing for lady corsoon murmured vernon thinking of gambling debt a will make independent of miserly husband there be thing to be thought of said colonel gravely be blackmailing of ida oh do think that health be suffering from yes do went to fortune teller what heard have made ill probably be told same story a heard know that be keeping ten thousand year wrongfully from lady corsoon being case ida being sensitive girl be wonder that be disturbed ill conscience be fighting between keeping money giving up then miss hest may be forcing to keep silence otherwise a be sweetest girl in world feel sure must speak out give up fortune may not believe story certainly may not must have sown doubt in breast if left to herself must perhaps come to to asking to resolve doubt miss hest colonel colonel think be altogether just to miss hest be really kind hearted decent woman be not after ida money a imagine want mr bedge to become ida companion for ida to marry so that can go back to reciting doe want ida to marry maunders asked towton shrewdly think fancy will make ida better husband colonel miss hest conduct be above reproach if know about wild story told by diabella will advise ida for best in what way well be use ida telling anyone else tale unless be sure of truth according to diabella man venery in singapore can substantiate story so under guidance of miss hest provided mind know story ida may have written to venery if venery say that ida be not dimsdale daughter daresay girl will see supposed aunt surrender fortune miss hest undoubtedly a say exercise certain amount of control over ida weaker mind be good woman assuredly be not fortune hunter may be a say assented colonel grudgingly however be plain that diabella know something of spider something of murder since be aware of dimsdale secret think read in astral light know believe in occult matter to certain extent said towton drily believe that unseen ever furnished so detailed story communication from next world be apt to be scrappy what be to be done vernon quickly decided will divide burden said promptly write to night to morrow to george venery of singapore asking how much of yarn be true will call on diabella why not consult inspector drench have arrested must be bad idea pondered vernon yet be not wise to act with too much haste after ca get search warrant a have witness to assault woman can easily deny story of dimsdale seems to connect with spider will go on own secure more evidence upon to get warrant if not for arrest at event for search through room of hers evidence regarding spider if indeed be connected with a seems extremely probable may be found concealed there will call to morrow morning ended vernon rising in character of superstitious client will write letter to venery of singapore in way matter be decided burden be divided vernon went away with conviction that by chance colonel have struck upon much wished for clue must lead to identification of famous spider certainly might be jumping to conclusion taking be known into account looked extremely probable if be true behoved to act cautiously lest spider at eleventh hour must slip through finger of police for reason until be positive vernon did not think wise to call in assistance of law first be necessary to prove collusion of diabella spider so that if be not scoundrel must at least be able to identify beyond doubt second even if identity be proved must be easy task to arrest so slippery criminal like celebrated fox in fable spider have thousand trick must use to better advantage than animal fox in story of sop be caught be probable unless very greatest care be used that spider must escape already police have experienced subtlety regarded arch scoundrel a very wary dangerous bird who be not to be caught by putting salt on tail colonel towton being le experienced in trickery of criminal class be more hopeful of success next morning settled down to write letter to venery of singapore quite confident that mystery be on eve of solution quite expected to hear from correspondent that ida be not dimsdale daughter be quite sure that embroidered fact of pointed delay in rescue of menteith be false assured of be quite willing to marry ida a daughter of poor soldier to hand over fortune to lady corsoon love be everything to colonel at moment nothing else mattered just a reached second page of letter vernon burst into room with half vexed half triumphant air told news without delay believe be right about diabella being connected with spider colonel said have shut up room have cleared out bag baggage chapter xi needle in haystack be big news meant more than at first sight appeared since implication be of depth below depth veil behind veil to be quite plain unexpected flight of fortune teller for be nothing else hinted at truth of towton suspicion have there be nothing mere assault diabella must have faced that must have even counted upon colonel doing nothing since unbiassed witness be lacking flight be not caused by incident have taken place in bond street room by fear that something dangerous might peep out from behind what must something be on ground of diabella story hindoo attempted strangling dread lest spider must be traced be perfectly certain that be right towton said vernon sitting sideways on table swinging leg only fear of connection with blackmailing scoundrel being traced must have scared into disappearance have really gone really truly remember have three day to make scarce so afraid be lest must take action that decamped on morning of second day how decamped questioned towton laying down pen sent hindoo to surrender lease bahadur name be native who tried to choke doorkeeper be precise to ask if be lean stout lean one came to surrender lease name be bahadur well that be something worth knowing how did get informant to talk how did find person in authority to explain matter be easy vernon slipped off table into chair called on plea of wanting fortune told by diabella instead of bahadur opening door neat little maid servant made appearance informed that diabella have retired from business have be taken over by certain american prophetess asked to see lady did think be diabella unmasked not from description told diabella be tall woman be short voice instead of being metallic a described be rather musical although disfigured by yankee twang new sorceress from new york city a told be must never have spoken english without twang might have be assumed not can tell true from false said vernon emphatically mr hiram g slowcomb be genuine american sure enough besides idea of surroundings of diabella differ last desired weird decoration furniture mask egyptian dress oriental attendant so forth mr slowcomb idea be that people must not be frightened must have future told in motherly old fashioned way amidst rural fireside granny scenery intends so told to transform egyptian room into semblance of rustic cottage interior with cat humming tea kettle rafter with string of onion flower pot on ledge of bond street window turned into casement be rather clever dodge reflected vernon a people will be at ease directly so will talk freely listen comfortably mr hiram g slowcomb motherly old thing in mob cap stuff dress with voluminous apron woollen shawl over shoulder daresay have dressed for old cottage interior part for be seated in wooden chair did fit in with memphis decoration knitted homely stocking what did tell about diabella very little because knew very little do believe that asked highly suspicious colonel vernon shrugged shoulder everyone tell such lie nowadays never believe anyone mr slowcomb seemed to be genuine enough however will soon prove that a intend to have watched by man upon whom can depend will learn in way if have business relation with masked friend what did tell asked towton again well seemed that heard about diabella wishing to retire from business went to see diabella denied that rumour be true promised mr slowcomb first refusal of room goodwill though how one can transfer fortune telling client beat however mr slowcomb retired left address somewhere in pimlico where be wasting talent on maid servant suburban people diabella sent bahadur to there lease be duly transferred for sum of money believe bahadur took mr slowcomb to city interviewed landlord lawyer however be done fair square diabella must have signed consent to transfer so did under name of isabella hopkins may may not be real name at event took room a miss hopkins signed that name on transfer mr slowcomb never saw at least without mask be a saw when mr slowcomb called at room did show in lawyer office lawyer must have seen well did went to see be stiff old buckram creature who declined to impart anything about miss isabella hopkins a wanted to know why wished to know of course on face of can see towton must gratify very natural curiosity why not if be to catch diabella have got enough ground to go upon said vernon shaking head think be best to let fancy suspect anything then may be able to capture unawares be connected with spider if not that gentleman be sure visit behaviour led to strangling attempt have given fright if keep silent suspicion will be lulled may reappear surely not oh think so fortune telling be invaluable way of learning secret diabella must be very useful to spider to herself if be wo surrender position without struggle be too paying round dear fellow did surrender only because lost head for moment thought might bring police on scene for assault must lead to unpleasant question being asked might result in heaven know what revelation fortune teller be not in good odour since campaign of certain halfpenny paper against colonel leaned back in chair reflecting while vernon rose to walk up down room for purpose of stretching long leg lighted cigar went on talking lightly never saw such heap of clever dodge a diabella have to impress weak minded mummy be faked by way have reed inside leading to mouth diabella by pressing on arm of state chair must send stream of wind along to make squall did squall said towton musingly never heard devilish row in life what else arrangement by when room be darkened interior of painted wall be illuminated to reveal egyptian figure a walking sitting skeleton then there be apparatus to make thunder flashlight for lightning to say nothing of ingeniously arranged draught calculated to make anyone hair rise in necessary darkness when felt cold breath fanning wonder diabella did send client stark staring mad sound like fraudulent spiritualistic medium vernon only confirms suspicion that diabella be not genuine occultist do really believe anyone have such power asked vernon curiously really do said colonel promptly strange a may appear in india have seen too much of unseen to doubt there be certain gifted people who can see who can control force of average person know nothing oh yes believe what be use of talking can never make believe want to vernon shrugged shoulder again buttoned up coat a say doe matter answered however diabella have vanished with two satellite so there be nothing more to be done at present give up hunt said at present will lie quiet until diabella reappears wo if be wise will if be daring shrewdly suspect that be do believe to be spider do really ca say if not rose be near rose can assert with safety colonel be that if can lay hand on witch in grain will learn who murdered poor dimsdale god grant amen to pious prayer be vernon reply a left room towton duly finished letter of inquiry to venery of singapore having posted went cheerfully about usual business of pleasure be a cheerfully a man in love well must do at colonel age love be rather serious matter since have taken disease badly a be invariably case with middle aged men individual constantly let emotion trickle out to expend in trifling love affair amusing for moment others dam up passion for year until burst through barrier to sweep everything before irresistibly colonel towton be one of latter not being entirely blinded by late born infatuation did not deem ida perfection a hot headed youth must have done foresaw that a mr towton must need guidance firm control hitherto for want of have run wild material be there out of a towton put to must build model wife that be frivolous rather than strong minded be point in favour a colonel desired to mould wax rather than to hammer iron so if ida only consented to marry hoped for calm contented domestic existence undisturbed by aggressive romance with home loving controlled nature towton infinitely preferred outlook from unemotional point of view a to money cared little for possible loss of although must not deny what ida yearly thousand must have come at right moment to effect improvement on bowderstyke estate towton be too prosaic level headed to despise power of purse on other hand be not at grasping be quite satisfied to marry girl with dowry beauty sweet nature same intended to inform fully of truth by inquiring a have done from man diabella have mentioned a authority colonel have notion of letting ida money benefit lady corsoon if must help of course if be proved to be legally hers must be first to see that have right on other hand must ida turn out to be dimsdale daughter towton made up mind that ten thousand year must be joyfully used for improvement of family property with thought to employ mind waited very patiently in london considering that be man of action rather than dreamer of dream later on when vernon have coaxed diabella from hiding place towton intended to travel to bowderstyke to see beloved have belief that during absence vernon must manage affair interested so greatly for next few day colonel saw nothing of vernon while in tablinum of athenian club unexpectedly came face to face with mr maunders scamp looked singularly handsome be dressed carefully a usual sight of snake must have be more pleasing to worthy colonel did not like maunders moreover resented a somewhat dishonourable rival for one must respect man who pointedly wooed two woman at one same time towton therefore nodded coolly crossed to central table to pick up service magazine a did so maunders sauntered to side slipped into chair near to one colonel have taken have have news of miss dimsdale asked maunders amiably retorted towton opening magazine a hint that wished to be left alone be still in yorkshire with miss hest persisted maunders so understand be stiff reply believe will remain there for one month possibly will maunders be not discouraged have message for asked why do ask demanded colonel sitting up abruptly because francis hest know brother of miss dimsdale friend have asked down to gerby hall be going there at end of week for few day thought might have message for miss dimsdale there be such thing a post said towton exasperated by young man cool assurance took up magazine again then hesitated threw on table averse a colonel be to discus private affair with anyone least of with maunders whom so frankly hated felt that ought to take advantage of chance to learn exactly what be maunders attitude towards ida be to understand that be engaged to miss dimsdale asked sharply why must think that asked constantine negligently why indeed considering one day profess to be paying attention to miss corsoon next pay address to miss dimsdale a be going down to gerby hall look a though inclined to marry latter young lady said maunders indolently looking at towton through half closed eyelid be going to see francis hest who be friend of mine daresay miss hest miss dimsdale find dull so may be able to amuse trifle be quite sure of said towton sarcastically social qualification be well known asked if be engaged to miss dimsdale be not be likely to be be good news towton must not be sure if maunders be speaking honestly then intend to marry miss corsoon said colonel do see why must trouble about private affair said maunders insolently cool be not who sought interview a chose to speak to have right to mention subject concern concern vernon also precisely said towton with great emphasis be useless to disguise fact mr maunders that be rival pardon interrupted young man quickly have be refused by miss dimsdale so field be open to ida refused muttered colonel stupefied strange be not replied maunders lightly such be case asked to marry hinted at previous attachment presume meant towton threw up hand coloured through bronzed skin will not mention name if please mind know how land lie so far a be concerned that be will have to reckon with francis hest miss hest brother same francis france twin with twin name might say be devoted to more than brother wish to marry money do mean to say that miss hest have taken miss dimsdale down to gerby hall so that may meet mr hest yes be not bad looking fellow exactly like sister who be handsome in imperial way a have seen in fact if see france have seen francis brother be very well off a have spent available cash in philanthropic work constructing confounded dam to supply water to several village have nearly ruined miss dimsdale money will therefore come in very acceptably fear hest will waste in helping poor be ridiculously crazy about doing what call good be ridiculous muttered colonel crossly miss dimsdale doe know man hest france will see to now that miss dimsdale be at hall will have opportunity of seeing miss hest will throw together on occasion upon word maunders rose stretched be colonel must go down to gerby hall look after matter thanks for advice said towton picking up magazine again good day to mr maunders be what come of trying to help observed young man with shrug do what can throw philanthropy in face towton conscience smote for really maunders have done distinct service also have announced that ida have refused be excellent news thank for what have told be probable that will go down to gerby hall at end of week maunders nodded may meet there yawned sauntered away with bored air be rather overdone a rule be alert full of life so looked a though languor be assumed for purpose not good one if man selfish nature be to be taken into account wanted three day to week end so towton really intended to take northern journey have never trusted miss hest be quite probable that a have discouraged wooing of maunders intention be to secure heiress for too philanthropic brother of course if towton must prove to twin ida have money be possible that further plan must be laid to entrap money be what francis hest required for lord of manor scheme money be what sister desired to secure for considering that france did not get on well with brother that rarely met be strange that must be so anxious to serve unless indeed two have come to agreement that if francis married supposed heiress france must share income on whole towton thought must be just a well to go down to grange for week so pay neighbourly visit to gerby hall must at least learn how much of maunders tale be true perhaps might induce ida to accept since have refused handsome rival gad will go down on saturday decided colonel happened that before saturday received letter made even more anxious to visit family seat came from ida pointedly asked to come down see amongst other thing wrote that francis hest have gone away that have only seen twice at gerby hall france brother get on well together went on ida in letter be rarely together when be in be out vice vers like little old man woman in weather cottage only saw francis for few minute time like much although greatly resembles france be more gloomy be quite misanthrope do like france so much a did a seems inclined to take upper hand with want to do exactly a wish lately have be urging to marry mr maunders told that be coming down to stop for time besides there be housekeeper miss jewin who be double faced woman be sure look quite dangerous fell in ecstacies over photograph of mr maunders gave france told presumptuously that thought made handsome couple in fact like place at wish must come down stand by at point colonel laid down letter to think apparently maunders be lying when stated that did not wish to marry miss dimsdale that france wished to secure heiress for brother told one story ida of two towton preferred to believe that of girl letter went into general detail about beauty of country dismal gloom of hall towton gathered indirectly that miss hest be keeping close watch on ida that girl be beginning to resent over emphatic influence in fact throughout letter there sounded note of alarm a though ida be uncomfortable uneasy certainly pointedly asked towton down to stand by when have finished epistle be quite decided about travelling by saturday train a have arranged contradictory story told by ida maunders puzzled greatly more than ever mistrusted miss hest who seemed to be playing deep game for winning of ida fortune colonel chuckled to think of disappointment when learned that ida be not entitled to money always provided that diabella have spoken truth a two head be better than one a towton be working in consort with vernon promptly sought out friend laid letter before also detailed what have taken place in tablinum of athenian club between maunders vernon colonel narrative with great attention then gave opinion after reflection there be devilry under said laying finger on letter miss hest seems to be working in conjunction with maunders say one thing ida so be difficult to know exactly how matter stand believe ida well on whole so do think vernon paused then added abruptly trust maunders know do in case let act exactly opposite to way in suggests how do mean questioned colonel doubtfully maunders want to go to yorkshire a be going must naturally want clear field if indeed miss hest be supporting in design on ida fortune therefore have reason may be sure that be bad one to get down can look after said towton sturdily quite so have to look after ida go to yorkshire ida want to go see how urgent letter be understand same think wiser for to remain until when until can corner diabella replied vernon ended conversation chapter xii tempting offer naturally under pressure of ida imploring letter colonel towton be not anxious to remain inactive in london wished to go to bowderstyke learn exact truth maunders said one thing ida so if two be confronted absolute fact of case must certainly come to light towton assuredly believed ida rather than maunders seemed strange to that miss hest must champion constantine strange also that maunders must wish to come down to gerby hall where if ida spoke correctly presence must not be welcome to miss hest co conspirator maunders be far too clever man to do anything without having object in view what that object might be colonel towton a yet must not fathom for last reason because rival so pointedly advised to go to gerby colonel remained in london whatever maunders plan might be must assuredly be thwarted by absence of towton later colonel determined to go even before vernon lured diabella from hiding place meanwhile a maunders have stated that be going to gerby hall on invitation of miss hest colonel sought young man room on sunday afternoon in order to see if have kept promise a fancied that proposed visit might be trick on inquiry however colonel learned that constantine have departed on previous day have left notice with caretaker of chamber that must not return until entire week have elapsed evidently have meant what said namely to accept miss hest hospitality knowledge however only made towton more anxious to go also a idea that maunders be having own way be subjecting ida to persecution made restless wished to ride forth like knight of old to rescue lady love who certainly if letter be to be believed seemed to be in great peril said great deal for towton disciplinarian instinct that obeyed vernon a one more professionally clever at such case rather than own desire in meantime having satisfied with regard to maunders whereabouts colonel took up usual life for at event week relieved mind by writing to ida saying that must come down to grange at termination of period vernon have not thought fit to impart to towton how proposed to inveigle diabella into open for very simple reason that be puzzled how to act several time have be to bond street room only to find that be in hand of decorator rapidly transforming weird egyptian hall into cosy english cottage mr hiram g slowcomb be already advertising that granny must foretell future after fashion of renowned mother shipton already have seen several of diabella old client desirous of novelty to told wonderful thing in strong american accent did not suit thrum cap tartan shawl general look of ancient rustic dame however be succeeding very well there be doubt that when mise en scene be prepared that must become fashion for few month professed to know nothing of diabella a be quite frank in answering question vernon saw reason why must not believe story certainly appeared on face of to be true lawyer of landlord still refused to say anything about isabella hopkins since vernon declined to state why knowledge be required of course a be suspicious rather than certain must say absolutely nothing in dilemma wondering how be to come face to face with woman vernon decided on sunday when towton went to seek maunders to pay afternoon call errand took into luxurious drawing room of lady corsoon by time month of grace allowed by spider be nearing end vernon having accomplished nothing definite considered necessary to reassure millionaire wife naturally expected to find haggard hysterical be truly surprised to behold perfectly composed person comely content brown eye sparkled when footman announced newcomer swept forward word be necessary to exactly describe lady corsoon imposing gait to welcome with ill concealed eagerness how be mr vernon asked in best society manner then dropped voice to confidential whisper must have called at office to morrow have not come be quite well thank replied vernon for benefit of surrounding guest lowered voice likewise news good bad yes wait till everyone go said softly again spoke gracefully in character of hostess poor man really must have cup of tea go to lucy ask nicely vernon needed second command thrust way through crowd of well dressed people to find bamboo table covered with tea thing over pretty fresh coloured damsel presided received with shy blush made look like dewy rose lucy corsoon must not be called lovely must have attracted attention in marked degree bright sweet english girl be claimed to be having bloom of youth really appeared more charming than really be in very plain white frock without single ornament looked like modest violet almost hidden by leaf ardent gaze in lover dark eye made blush more than ever a handed cup of tea without sugar said in gentle voice know taste who else must inquired vernon smiling sipped bohea tea be delightful exactly what thirsty man requires hope be hungry also mr hest please pas cakestand to mr lover wheeled when name be mentioned to find facing counterpart of ida companion must have guessed relationship even if lucy have held peace mr hest smiled at amazed look of young man swung forward bamboo cakestand with soft laugh say what be going to say mr vernon remarked pleasantly know exactly how astonished be to see be so like sister be indeed breathed vernon mechanically taking bread butter must have taken for miss hest in disguise for hesitated for scar finished hest laying finger on cicatrice ran in thin crimson line from right temple to corner of mouth got that in paris year ago knife of apache scored in way be just a well if only to distinguish from france rarely come to london when do everyone stare at a did mr hest shrugged shoulder be rather nuisance being twin be not so tall a sister ventured vernon while lucy laughed at idle jest of yorkshire squire there be very little difference france look taller because wear petticoat if dressed in clothes must hide laid finger again on scar must not be able to tell difference voice be different said vernon after pause really begin to think must be detective mr vernon since be so very observant yes voice be different in wrong way wrong way ah be not so observant a thought yes france have deep contralto voice somewhat heavy for woman whereas voice a hear be rather thin in quality nature mixed up voice a be twin maybe be a said hest voice have not volume richness of sister certainly have le serious note vernon recalling what towton have told of ida remark in letter a to francis being dismal misanthropic wondered that must have be so mistaken be really more cheerful than france did not seem to treat life in aggressively sober manner besides that be philanthropist be in argument against being of gloomy disposition vernon judged that mr hest be much more of optimist than be sister that lacked in measure that sterling common sense to put plainly made company rather dull if france have be man francis have be woman temperament must have suited change of sex ever so much better perhaps a mr hest have just observed since two be twin nature have got mixed vernon must rather have spoken to lucy must not do so now then fresh guest came to be served be therefore left to society of hest took advantage of opportunity to learn if man be in love with ida did leave miss dimsdale in good health asked oh yes be ever so much brighter mr vernon air of yorkshire moor have picked up wonderfully have brought colour to cheek sister hest shrugged shoulder again oh france be always in robust health mr vernon find company too exhausting for health always want to be doing something saying something be never at rest do good deal in way of philanthropy well do said hest dark face lighting up be really selfish on part there be nothing love so well a to help unfortunate have quite changed parish of bowderstyke instead of being rip van winkle sort of place be now in lively touch with twentieth century if be ever down way mr vernon come stop at hall will see opus magnus bolly reservoir miss dimsdale be quite amazed when beheld strength of dam have heard of great work from sister be quite enthusiastic over enterprise what france enthusiastic over anything of sort surprise mr vernon do indeed france care nothing about such thing poetry society general aimless life be idea of living then be woman must not be hard on woman be strange said vernon musingly with eye on hest what be if may ask life mention must suit nature rather than hers must think considering what have seen of of be not so serious a miss hest so far a can judge hest laughed well see france take pleasure seriously in very ponderous manner take work lightly a hobby be difference save that be sure get more amusement out of life than doe wait till hear argue be stopping in town long only for few day may go to paris may return to gerby hall depends upon miss dimsdale vernon looked surprised on miss dimsdale in what way well hest hesitated be rather private matter to oh beg pardon not at know france miss dimsdale so very well that mind telling fact be sister think ought to be married at age sha tell how old be because must give away france who like woman doe want age to be known long short of be that want to marry miss dimsdale saw very plainly that miss dimsdale did want to marry so ran away explanation appeared to be clear enough vernon drew long breath of relief ida have be right france have wished brother to marry girl secure fortune now that francis declined to entertain idea miss hest have invited maunders down to try luck vernon must not see what interest former must have in bringing about marriage with latter lifted eye from carpet to again address companion found that mr hest have slipped away to talk to old lady with ear trumpet might speak to hinted low voice at ear turned to smile at lucy injured face be so busy there be lull now in tea drinking why have be to see lately arthur have be very busy also have be out of town must be with always pouted miss corsoon what must mother say to that asked smiling broadly must be annoyed returned lucy promptly vernon started surely be mistaken said anxiously stopping to almost whisper in ear mother gave consent when be last here said in presence that did not mind lucy interrupted with flush think have opinion now for time appeared to be pleased that must marry day before yesterday hinted that there might be obstacle ah father mother can manage father in way not connected with money mother have changed mind on own account for what reason asked vernon much perplexed wish must find out mourned miss corsoon refuse to tell in way love wo give up 'd run away with if be not so poor shortly will be poor longer said vernon quickly then can run away whenever like will be poor longer questioned lucy doubtfully dear uncle sir edward vernon of whom spoke when be here last have become reconciled to have made heir will have title something like three thousand year oh how delightful perhaps be wrong to say that since mean uncle death think sir edward will be glad to go replied vernon candidly have lived long life latter part of be very weary dreary told that be looking forward to great release then will be rich yes will be lady vernon seems too good to be true think so dear even father can scarcely object to marriage when have assured position lucy looked down at tea cup be be thinking about will see lady corsoon before leave said vernon compressing lip sending glance in direction of hostess caught eye smiled graciously so graciously indeed that bent again down to lucy must be mistaken darling whispered mother be quite friendly be sure will not object in way have changed mind answered miss corsoon obstinately at least told not to count on marrying strange gave explanation none be quite cross when asked for one view of lady corsoon attitude be supported by fact that on seeing vernon conversing so earnestly with lucy called to girl to come to ostensibly be to present daughter to fashionable countess who have lately arrived vernon guessed that really wished to end tte tte be curious considering conversation have held with proposed mother in law at office of nemo be evident that have changed mind once more a lady corsoon be not weathercock vernon wondered what powerful cause must have brought about alteration however gave up speculation a wandered about room speaking to friend promised full explanation when company departed a lady corsoon have asked to remain be evident that intended to let know what be matter vernon determined not to leave house until did know shortly young man be captured by flippant lady voluble somewhat silly who gave surprising piece of information oh mr vernon be so glad to see babbled gushingly really must come to bazaar great bazaar never heard of mr crimer silly man read paper one of princess be to have stall end of actress society people be to be held at georgian hall in aid of homeless hindoo really said vernon idly why be homeless oh exactly know gushed mr crimer vaguely be flood fire blizzard think have blizzard in india perhaps how clever be mr vernon do know be that poor thing want money hope to make heap by bazaar there will be lovely thing sold game flower stall sweet fortune telling babbled flippant lady incoherently fortune telling vernon paying little attention only caught last word with degree of clearness of course what must bazaar be without fortune telling time be really genuine diabella what vernon spoke so loudly that several people jumped flippant mr crimer put gloved hand to ear with pretty gesture of pain dreadful man how bellow yes diabella have tent in ground at back of georgian hall hope will be sunny afternoon know intends to charge everyone ten shilling know usually charge guinea think will get more by asking le thought vernon carefully commanded voice thought that diabella have retired from business so have delightful granny have taken business be going to see ask about affinity husband oh said mr crimer airily be only husband know must have affinity someone who be spiritual lover granny vernon ruthlessly cut short how did get diabella really know murmured mr crimer vaguely someone asked asked know be to be there in egyptian dress wearing egyptian mask in egyptian tent do go have fortune told will said vernon grimly inwardly rejoicing over chance be placing diabella in power do mr crimer spread out hand with shrug really ca talk to more everyone be going have heap heap of dear delightful people to see good bye so glad will come to bazaar quite angelic will be quite quite flippant lady babbled way to hostess who be now taking rapid leave of various guest lucy have disappeared a vernon soon learned by glance round room so sat down waited until lady corsoon must give promised ten minute explanation must have liked to have have chat with sir julius if only to enlist in favour of marriage by dropping hint regarding expected inheritance financier rarely put in appearance at wife at home finding far too frivolous for man of capacity so vernon decided that if lady corsoon explanation did not prove satisfactory must interview sir julius formally ask for hand of lucy with credential of soon coming title lordly mansion three thousand year hoped to have proposal well received at former interview baronet have scoffed at pretension now thing be changed for better chance be that must go well now mr vernon said lady corsoon when last guest have shaken hand departed be alone can have talk what news of search have news replied vernon placing chair for lady spider can not be found only seven day remain must give answer then mr vernon know term pay two thousand pound husband winced be informed that sold family jewel to pay bridge debt be sorry lady corsoon a yet have not caught man made gesture of despair oh what be good of being sorry came to a practised detective time be vernon who winced at least mr maunders assured that be hastened to say very kind of mr maunders said vernon sarcastically go on well came to for assistance have done nothing have done everything must do said vernon drily spider be too clever for a have baffled entire police force be shame for to confess a much what do intend to do ca say said vernon thinking of possible meeting with diabella at homeless hindoo ' bazaar in few day may have news lady corsoon shook head ca afford to wait since time be so short of course know that marriage with lucy depends upon getting out of unpleasant position vernon felt inclined to say that have placed in said position restrained a be useless to make enemy of merely bowed very good went on lady sharply if catch spider close mouth regain jewel got from pawnshop marry lucy in case be not good match be now lady corsoon uncle have be reconciled to have made heir soon will be sir arthur vernon with good income oh dear man lady corsoon waved jewelled hand impatiently there be plenty of baronet knight with moderate income who must be glad to marry lucy for let alone expectation from father condition be that must get out of trouble can will try can say more then listen to said lady firmly few day ago received letter from spider ah vernon nursed chin swung leg so be why have changed mind with regard to wooing of lucy who told that have changed mind sir asked abruptly lucy hinted something then saw that separated in there there understand lady corsoon waved hand again be right have changed mind a spider have given chance of course if can catch make hold peace can recover family jewel pawned be willing to keep to agreement with support in marrying daughter spider have given chance repeated vernon sitting up what may be have letter be locked away a did not expect to day did not put in pocket can tell what say spider yes of course said lady corsoon quickly tell that if will pay ten thousand pound in twelve month will place in receipt of amount year by proving that be entitled to late brother money strange be not since niece ida be daughter very strange replied vernon mechanically news proved to more conclusively than ever that diabella be connected with spider if not blackmailer worked in concert with until must lay hand on woman determined to say nothing to lady corsoon about matter how long doe give to answer new demand two month said lady corsoon triumphantly so at least have gained time much may happen a say much may happen how doe propose to place in possession of income doe say lady corsoon wrinkled brow simply make offer certainly ida inherits a next of kin may be that spider who seems to know everything have found will giving income to then hesitated there be condition what be one wo like if get money be to consent to marriage of lucy with with with whom asked vernon jumping up keep in suspense with constantine maunders said lady corsoon coolly chapter xiii bazaar for next few day vernon vainly grappled with new problem lady corsoon information have supplied that spider must offer millionaire wife fortune of ten thousand pound per annum on condition of receiving income for first year scarcely surprised young man for already suspected spider to be connected with diabella if indeed creature be not that famous individual seemed odd that arch criminal must interest in maunders affair even to assisting to bring about marriage with lucy must be possible that maunders be one of gang vernon recalled that after mr bedge confession of poverty have suspected maunders in respect since young man apparently contrived to live like prince on nothing year did not receive much from aunt did not earn income so be possible that in shady way managed to become possessed of sufficient money to gratify extravagant taste maunders also being in vicinity of library on occasion of conversation with late mr dimsdale must have heard suggested arrangement of trap then a vernon recalled miss hest have stated in quite innocent way how maunders have be with evening must not thus have have anything to do with crime at rangoon vernon suspicion have be banished by miss hest assertion now revived in full force after lady corsoon communication have made show letter proved to be similar to earlier epistle of spider even to ideograph at end apparently be genuine enough if genuine maunders must be connected in way with blackmailer other explanation be feasible have maunders be in london vernon must have gone straight to tax with possible complicity young man be at bowderstyke so for moment must not be questioned sooner later must return to london then vernon intended to force to explain meanwhile seemed best to seek out diabella at bazaar for homeless hindoo threaten with arrest unless explained how have come to let spider know martin dimsdale secret also might supply connecting link between spider maunders vernon be rather surprised at diabella daring in thus making public appearance supposed that ruse have be successful that fortune teller not having be openly searched for presumed that colonel towton have taken no step if have learned that towton be to be at fte might have declined to risk exercising profession have reason to believe that must be present thus dared danger never suspecting vernon must enter tent tear off mask be what intended to do at first opportunity young man hesitated whether to tell inspector drench to remain silent until more satisfied a to hidden connection between diabella spider after reflection decided to carry through matter by removing waxen mask must at least learn what diabella be like perhaps if brought to bay must speak out to save skin then when knew more might venture to call in aid of police be dangerous business perhaps vernon must have be better advised have taken more precaution against woman escape evidence against be so vague there appeared to be so much to clear up that doubted if drench must be able to arrest on bare suspicion at event after turning matter over in mind vernon started by for bazaar resolved to act on own initiative told one of second letter from spider to lady corsoon not even colonel towton so military gentleman ignorant of what be taking place lingered in chamber idled at athenian club fretting over inaction longing for chance to display generalship very natural feeling considering colonel active mind georgian hall be huge repository of hanoverian relic in south kensington consisted of many moderately large apartment encircling spacious central room be used for concert ball meeting ftes such like entertainment requiring ample scope for celebration minor hall be dedicated to display of object connected with rule of house of brunswick dating from reign of first monarch of dynasty memorial of warfare on land at sea be here together with picture of famous event collection of old world thing dealing with social life of various epoch one room be filled with figure representing male female garb of different reign displayed china silver glass of several period third room held quaint furniture recalling tale of jane austen political social military history of england be contained in museum from fact hall took name since object dated only from act of succession be interesting place well worth patronage received from idle public on occasion central room be filled with gaily decorated stall in diver colour on be displayed modern luxury likely to appeal to purse of self indulgent society beauty charming actress celebrated lady novelist presided over booth of vanity fair did large trade by fascinating personality alone vernon accurately dressed a became young man about town managed to elude siren who must have cajoled shilling out of pocket walked into ground at back of hall where mr crimer have informed tent of diabella be to be found be sunny afternoon a flippant lady have desired spacious garden looked extremely pretty with flag tent flower general greenery game of kind be going on place resembled fair with crowd of laughing people who be enjoying thoroughly so far a must be judged homeless hindoo must benefit largely by bazaar a apparently be great success prettier function have taken place during season illustration must see who be ' cried vernon pulled hand away page vernon saw endless friend acquaintance a many fashionable folk be present taken up with own anxious thought spoke to one however someone spoke to a threaded way amongst throng for friendly touch on shoulder wheeled round to behold francis hest looked more like sister than ever decidedly handsome in immaculate frock coat grey trouser patent leather boot silk hat only fault vernon always rather fastidious must find in general appearance be that wore hair much too long gave look of poet of fashionable musician full black lock added still more to resemblance to france did not expect to find here vernon said hest after handshake why not be one of entertainment of season everyone who be anyone be bound to patronise must have thought be too frivolous for oh assure be very frivolous person said vernon smoothly be colonel towton asked other smiling be here vernon wondered why question be asked really ca say towton be certainly not frivolous enjoys society be usually to be found everywhere enjoying do know be innocent countryman who know one in fashionable world except lady corsoon who be host in asked out of curiosity a having heard miss dimsdale speak of colonel must like to meet oh spoke of colonel towton did be that strange asked hest smiling again showing white teeth rather think miss dimsdale admires colonel admires want to marry said vernon bluntly so must imagine reason why did right in running away from gerby hall in declining sister help in marrying to lady think however added hest significantly that unless colonel look to bride will find be likely to become mr maunders must be sorry to see why like maunders oh yes be at school together believe that miss dimsdale be in love with colonel know of course that maunders have gone down to place certainly france wrote that arrived on sunday morning be why advise colonel towton to look after miss dimsdale why doe sister wish miss dimsdale to marry maunders asked vernon in pointedly blunt way hest raised thick dark eyebrow ask said lightly can say be france be great matchmaker failing suggests maunders a suitor be younger than colonel believe much handsomer have not towton sterling character by way have met maunders twice once in town once at own place confess that doe attract greatly handsome yes there be something dangerous about dangerous vernon looked straightly at speaker wondering how have chanced to hit on very defect spoilt maunders charm be only word can think of describes perhaps be wrong france must think so always thought that miss hest did not like maunders may be so said hest indifferently still be handsome france be woman seems to however that word rest with miss dimsdale if love colonel towton will marry if maunders will win wilful woman will have way think that miss dimsdale be wilful said vernon stiffly then with afterthought hest might help colonel to thwart plan france certainly appeared to entertain added must like to meet towton oh yes will be in town for week before going to paris have few friend here like to be amused where be staying at professor garrick gail isleworth oh vernon must scarcely conceal surprise thought that did not approve of sister appearing a reciter do rejoined other man with frown france asked to deliver message to professor gail whom met before whom like asked to accept hospitality while in london so did so a hope to induce to get france to abandon scheme of earning money by talent by way deny so that may resume proper place in society a sister vernon shook head miss hest be of too active mind to bear tamely life of ordinary country lady be singularly obstinate if be what mean said hest with curling lip however be address so if can arrange dinner with colonel towton will be glad to meet to give latest news of miss dimsdale thank vernon booked dinner say next wednesday will suit capitally day after to morrow well what be going to do now just wander round replied vernon evasively did not wish to disclose plan regarding diabella to yorkshire squire good day good day said other in friendly tone two be soon separated by ever moving crowd be growing late by time garden be not nearly so filled a have be already there be shade of twilight in calm sky several lamp have be lighted be necessary to see diabella at once for might be that must not be present in evening vernon therefore went to seek for egyptian tent soon found standing in isolated position at far end of ground with skill canvas have be erected into square form of memphis temple coloured like stone adorned with gaudy hieroglyphic looked striking object in waning light two imitation sphinx guarded doorway beside on side stood two men like bronze statue with folded arm one be slender other burly be native of india in spite of ancient egyptian array vernon knowing what did know have difficulty in recognising bahadur heavier man who have attempted to strangle colonel until prevented by mistress can see diabella asked approaching slowly addressing bahadur a more amiable looking of two one two three said man showing teeth throwing up triple finger three to see mistress then vernon nodded resting on cane stared at merry scene in idle manner thought be taken up with probable scene must ensue when tore mask from woman face wondered if must make outcry must summon attendant if so must sullen looking wrestler attempt to choke vernon resolved at moment removed mask to intimate that knew of assault on colonel towton so hoped that woman must not risk unpleasant discovery by making outcry must be willing to talk calmly if so then hoped to induce to state how came to be possessed of martin dimsdale secret here again a always did came thought diabela might be disguise for spider in case must surely decline to incriminate if did refused to be frank there must be nothing for to see drench procure arrest for moment now that be on very eve of enterprise vernon regretted that have not brought inspector with so that might be legally supported by arm of law be too late for such regret when arrived at point of meditation bahadur lifted curtain formed door of canvas temple to intimate that stranger might enter interior of tent be adorned a egyptian hall much in same way a bond street room save that mummy be absent diabella in weird dress described by towton sat stiffly in chair with small table at elbow card crystal various chart bearing astrological figure be on table together with boat shaped lamp gave out fairly strong light vernon must see plainly expressionless waxen mask covered face of fortune teller looked like sphinx solemn calm passionless yet below non committing mask vernon guessed be face of true woman alive with passion intrigue saw two glittering eye scanning curiously from shadow of black veil seeress wore draped over egyptian head dress shivered trifle at uncanny look sorceress saw tremor be afraid asked in metallic voice be a expressionless a mask be afraid of nothing replied vernon boldly coldly night air strike chill thought that heard sarcastic laugh be so soft that well might have be mistaken however thinking that prophetess be sneering at might have ventured on angry remark that recollected intention drew back with grim smile laugh must be on side when mask be torn off wish to have fortune told asked diabella coldly stretched out hand let read palm be just what vernon desired a grip brought within snatching distance of mask there be stool near at hand upon diabella motioned that must be seated so shortly be sitting so to speak at foot with hand in hers shadow filled corner of tent enhanced grotesque look of

name be familiar surely mocked vernon why must be colonel towton might be able to answer diabella rose suddenly tall straight from chair threw out arm with repellant gesture know name of colonel towton vernon rose slowly measured distance carefully seem to forget great deal madame said softly finger itching to tear off expressionless mask never ask name of client mumbled how do know that colonel towton be client of yours never told guessed be ah help shrieked loudly with good reason vernon hand have shot out while kept attention engaged in moment have ripped mask from face head dress came away in grip diabella covered face with hand at shriek fold of tent door be torn open burly indian appeared vernon flung aside mask veil head dress seized diabella wrist a indian ran forward to aid must see who be cried vernon pulled hand away maunders fell back step into arm of hindoo be indeed maunders whom beheld shrinking back into shadow with furious shameful face startled a trapped animal vernon have time to see more for hindoo made clutch at throat silent venomous mindful of how colonel towton have be assaulted dimsdale killed young man turned fiercely to grapple with assailant a two men closed in what promised to be deadly struggle maunders recovered presence of mind sufficiently to dash over lamp tent became pitchy dark in cimmerian gloom combatant swayed swung fought with silent earnestness hindoo be stronger of two vernon felt lean long finger grip throat with vicious strength faintly heard maunders now at door hurriedly call to native in unknown tongue fearful lest two villain must escape tore away with violent effort cry a loudly a must for assistance next moment opponent flung forward picking up a though be child dashed with gigantic force to ground head struck turf with thud everything be swallowed up in blank insensibility chapter xiv run to earth in hour more le vernon came to slowly opened eye in bewildered manner be in complete darkness for moment must not remember where be what have taken place gradually memory returned to sat up painfully to recall detail head throbbed with violence of fall short sharp struggle have set nerve jangling like ill tuned bell rising to foot with effort wondered why indian have not finished off then recollected rapid word of maunders in unknown tongue probably have be speaking tamil have ordered man not to go to extremity a in case of colonel towton when creature have be warned by diabella rather by maunders a in instance native have stopped short of actual murder in maunders desperate enterprise be necessary that must remain on right side of law striking match vernon ascertained that be still in tent for blue glimmer showed figure hieroglyphic weirdly flickering on canvas wall apparently

maunders have provided time for flight so warned one must enter tent evidently noise of struggle cry for assistance have passed unheeded vernon drew long breath stood where be watching crowd of people merry making under hundred of coloured lamp quite oblivious to fact that tragedy have nearly taken place under very nose wondered what be best to be done be useless to go to in authority at georgian hall a one must credit wild tale although flight of diabella accomplice might lend colour to narrative moreover vernon decided that more than ever be necessary to hunt down maunders in secrecy a wished for full explanation from before calling in drench to assist likewise for sake of ida of mr bedge lady corsoon vernon wished if possible to avoid publicity since scandal must certainly bring name into unpleasant notoriety for reason young man left georgian hall without telling anyone what have happened chuckled a went to think how public must be disappointed to find tent of sorceress empty also how amazed managing bazaar must be to discover diabella have vanished with taking for day must be considerable vernon felt quite sure that man so unscrupulous a maunders must not hesitate to seize till seeing that having be exposed doubtful if old schoolfellow must hold tongue must want money must get to assist flight question be to learn whither have fled what track to follow in order to hunt down be close upon seven o'clock outside georgian hall vernon hesitated a to next step wondered whether must be better to go home retire to bed since felt shaken by struggle to seek out colonel towton enlist a fellow pursuer in man hunt finally decided to take taxi to colonel chamber relate what have happened for knew that unless discussed matter must only worry whole night over catastrophe therefore fortified with stiff brandy soda at near hotel pulled together for serious conversation serious enough must be for constantine maunders who must not be permitted to continue in nefarious career a happened towton late in dressing for dinner have not yet left room for athenian club vernon arrived at quarter to eight just a colonel opened door two came face to face with mutual joy at meeting dear vernon be glad to see be simply dying to have talk a can hing think of entanglement in find ca be more pleased than be at having found colonel have have adventure with diabella deuce have learned who be who be mean yes mask concealed constantine maunders towton sat down on one of hall chair stared do mean to say that young scamp have be masquerading a woman vernon nodded sat down wearily for bone ached presume thought that there must be le danger of discovery if changed sex expect wore long egyptian robe over ordinary clothes when discarding must reappear a maunders must easily escape without being noticed in crowd be clever be constantine yet not clever enough know what be talking about said towton gruffly rising to foot suppose come with to athenian tell about

smoking room will make shift there bendham saluted military fashion took speedy departure while master turned head in direction of vernon tell have happened to now said easily will be time before dinner make appearance be on tenterhook deuce to think that blackguard friend for be that swear must be earning money a fortune teller be worse than towton hesitated than profession of detective must say colonel finished vernon languidly must rather think so assist law maunders break profession be tempting to gentleman oh hang profession said towton impatiently will soon enter into kingdom when sir edward give up ghost be just a well that have experience in thief catching seeing what scoundrel have to deal with maunders by jove now will be able to find out how came to know ida be dimsdale daughter no wonder decided to give up seeing that be after money what did say nothing cleared out of tent a soon a discovered identity where be now demanded colonel sharply know be what wish to speak to about to make thing quite clear a want opinion have better hear whole story towton intimated desire to be informed of what have taken place listened attentively while vernon detailed have happened since mr crimer have informed of diabella proposed appearance at bazaar ended with description of recovering from insensibility in deserted tent subsequent decision to consult colonel before taking step reason for wishing to move quietly be obvious be concluding remark of young man yes yes quite understand must keep miss corsoon name that of miss dimsdale out of paper by way what did fellow mean by hinting in confounded fortune telling at disgrace to someone closely connected with miss corsoon doe mean mother father vernon felt trifle confused in interest in recital have unconsciously let slip more than have be prepared to impart a detective a gentleman be bound to keep lady corsoon secret a disclosure of be not particularly pertinent to matter in hand brushed aside towton question with scornful laugh oh daresay be patter maunders know that love lucy thought to intimidate by threat that have power to force mother to support preposterous claim to marry girl after exposure will scarcely dare to come forward blackguard cried honest colonel heatedly blackens character of man woman in endeavour to earn dirty money thought be supposed to be at gerby hall oh doubtless arranged so a to provide with alibi why deuce must provide with ialibii ca see that maunders must be spider said vernon impatiently towton leaped to foot began to walk to fro much perturbed oh impossible like maunders same seems incredible that must be murderer ca see said vernon drily maunders be greek be a wily bird a ever have salt put on tail whether get from greek father from english mother ca say certainly have that strong criminal taint induces to get money for whim by illegal method rather than by honest toil besides ca say if killed dimsdale even though a be apparent be spider miss hest declared to in innocence not with intention of defending that maunders be with nearly evening then ca be spider insisted colonel for undoubtedly spider killed poor old dimsdale so thought so everyone think yet well of course be not impossible that maunders ordered nameless native to get money man may have executed murder without instruction else said towton emphatically maunders may have have mask torn off by dimsdale when came for money murdered old man to prevent discovery cut way pardon if miss hest be to be believed trust woman said colonel abruptly be scheming to get ida to marry brother think will fail there a brother be in london what yes met at lady corsoon at bazaar said that sister did wish to bring about match that not being desirous of marrying ida ran away from hall leaving field clear for maunders forget that maunders be in town masquerading a diabella may have come up for purpose well can ascertain that from mr hest declares that left at gerby hall that maunders be expected forget will see to morrow ask towton shook head wisely wo know of maunders movement never can tell at event will do harm to ask now come to think of said vernon musingly searching memory hest told to day at bazaar that have received letter from sister saying that maunders have arrived on sunday morning be yesterday so be impossible to believe that maunders went down came up in such hurry be opinion that never went to gerby hall at say by jove cried colonel greatly excited hest told lie if said that received letter saying that maunders have arrived even if posted in bowderstyke last evening must not reach before to night say gave information afternoon may have received at mid day said towton decidedly post at bowderstyke be very uncertain a know to cost evening to morrow morning be very earliest that hest must receive letter posted on sunday a maunders did not arrive until then miss hest must not have written before believe that arrived at ca conceive why miss hest must tell falsehood can be scheming for money however will go with to morrow will have out with hest where be to be found be staying with professor garrick gail at isleworth deuce ida told that did not approve of sister reciting doe asked to give message professor asked to stop at isleworth while be in town did so a explained to so that must persuade professor to induce miss hest to give up career very lame explanation said colonel grimly gentleman stay at such place for such weak purpose tell vernon that believe in hests never did although defended sister have bad name at bowderstyke a wild family oh thought that francis hest be looked upon a benefactor be admitted colonel reluctantly be crazy philanthropist with parish school house bolly reservoir same there be queer taint about live queer life ca see france recites in london in perfectly open honest way francis act in noble manner a philanthropist daresay same trust brother sister quarrel like mad too most family do retorted vernon drily a swung off sofa france be certainly trying to further brother interest by securing heiress doe look a though quarrelled humph said towton disbelievingly probably sister have learned that ida be heiress want to do brother bad turn however be use talking a get further let see hest to morrow then learn if can whereabouts of maunders depends upon confession of scamp tell what vernon if young friend be poisonous beast of spider will have left england by to night mail perhaps must not stop without consulting drench mean interference of police wish to avoid be damned tangle altogether muttered towton savagely here come bendham to announce dinner come eat to morrow can talk further vernon be quite willing to drop subject for time being a head limb still ached with struggle felt more inclined to go to bed than to sit discussing criminal trickery required very clear brain even at makeshift dinner after be dainty tempting be unable to eat much excused to host a speedily a must consistently with politeness after arranging to meet colonel next day at three o'clock at waterloo station went home warm bath took pain partially away be so tired that almost a soon a head rested on pillow dropped into profound sleep not single dream broke rest be prolonged to ten o'clock next morning while at breakfast devoured with excellent appetite vernon recollected that have not professor garrick gail exact address be at isleworth that lived be necessary to find street number of house be quickly learned from era sent servant to buy ascertained that retired actor dwelt in siddons villa petterby road vernon rather regretted that have not made appointment with colonel towton earlier since mr hest might have gone out for day however comforted with reflection that in case hest towton must meet at dinner on wednesday meanwhile there be always chance that yorkshire squire might be at isleworth in case vernon felt curious to see where miss hest lived when in town like colonel be beginning to mistrust young lady punctual to moment vernon arrived at waterloo station found towton before greeted one cordially towton congratulated friend on improved look certainly night rest have done wonder

spider colonel towton disagreed said decisively maunders may be bad be murderer be anything that suit purpose so long a be found out be vernon retort be clever cunning be bold must be sure not to bring within reach of hand of justice by bloodshed have brought quite close enough in other way replied vernon in way talked in due time arrived at charming suburb of isleworth looked quite countrified two descended step passed along narrow path led out of station into road inquiry from passing butcher boy on bicycle soon advised of whereabouts of petterby road shortly found facing double fronted house with small neglected garden between quiet side road sluggard domain said towton with disgust for like most military men be excessively tidy might be made pretty if attended to by

without moving muscle of good looking face marched in stiffly shortly found in tawdry room of great size crammed with theatrical photograph furnished in poor pretentious manner revealed poverty while aped genteel mr garrick gail formerly miss hettie montgomery conducted in with air of one accustomed to centre of stage then departed stating that husband must shortly do honour of waiting on what air murmured towton recalling shakespeare indistinctly intolerable quantity of sack to pennyworth of bread actor actress be always in glare of footlights said vernon sitting down cautiously on shaky chair by way colonel if do little business with professor look more surprised than can help business what business intend to ask if miss france hest be open to engagement be necessary since be beginning to mistrust young lady to be diplomatic that mean mistrust actor also wish to throw off scent vernon nodded exactly hush stopped composed feature a door opened professor gail stalked into room like ghost of hamlet father anyone must see at glance that man be actor be tall lean solemn yet with twinkle in deep sunken eye showed that must play comedy a well a tragedy bluish jowl from frequent close shaving long hair measured gesture lordly gait revealed one who be used to world behind curtain voice be deep sonorous enunciation almost too perfect did clip word colloquially gave full length full meaning finally have certain dignity habitual to one who have played many kingly part in time who in ordinary life found difficult not to relapse into blank verse colonel towton arthur vernon read

needle to say decline to commit so great crime how long professor must have gone on descanting on histrionic capability of france hest be hard to say eloquence be cut short by entrance of mr gail who swept apologetic curtsey to gentleman for sudden appearance then whispered to husband vernon caught word two about bill man at back door must have money etc gail looked perturbed rose quickly small domestic concern gentleman said stalking to door followed by wife excuse while adjust matter will return soon made exit with mr gail in most approved stage fashion when be alone colonel asked question

with extraordinary self control scamp pulled together demanded in surly tone what captor meant by behaving towards in way sit down said vernon without deigning to reply directly have to explain matter before leave room have nothing to explain muttered maunders doggedly nevertheless judged wise to obey have better take care what be about will take care of myself of also replied vernon composedly ask colonel towton if be way for one gentleman to treat demanded trapped rogue two gentleman corrected colonel coldly who be dealing with confounded scoundrel will make pay for word threatened maunders biting lip recognise right to demand satisfaction a only deal with gentleman mr vernon have run to earth how did find out be here interrupted maunders curiously did not expect to find here said vernon

footstep so no doubt be coming vernon moved away from door if try to escape maunders will break leg with bullet pulled out neat revolver kept concealed in hip pocket rather melodramatic sneered maunders with shrug however need not be afraid will sit here quietly enough have more cause to be afraid than have hush here be professor coming a spoke door opened to admit old actor mr maunders have just come in to keep company while wait for mr hest said vernon in easy tone yes said maunders who by time have recovered composure be old friend have much to talk about so let keep from afternoon

gail in ponderous manner of dr samuel johnson may have front like mar to threaten command be menial to be so hectored swept imaginary mantle over left shoulder mouthed blank verse must not stint necessary action in fear to cope malicious censurers therefore ended mr gail returning to prose will retire to couch so good day to one when have made exit for must scarcely be said that took departure in conventional manner maunders gave vent to weak tittering laugh doubtless to cloak real nervousness felt old fool observed with characteristic shrug let hope will not prove to be young one by withholding from truth of shady business have be engaged in said colonel towton in caustic manner for sympathy be with retired actor thank wish to receive compliment sneered maunders for heaven sake let get business over at once have more to do than to explain private affair to interloper vernon laughed a saw that under air of bravado maunders be intensely anxious about position that cock wo fight said coolly must be aware that be in very dangerous position be aware of nothing of sort can justify do so a regard masquerading be crime to earn honest livelihood honest said towton with scorn let that pas fortune telling be a honest a detective business said maunders insolently to vernon be diabella why must deny ca must to dress up a woman did denied maunders with scowl simply wore egyptian robe over ordinary clothes waxen mask to conceal face also that rotten paraphernalia seems to be necessary to business daresay to deceive people said vernon drily why did act in way may ask because must get mother to allow sufficient money to live on thought that mr bedge be aunt put in colonel quickly so be be likewise adopted son kept short have to earn money somehow for three year have masqueraded a diabella although want known mind if do tell a one can say word against can said towton grimly employed servant to strangle maunders shook head violently did nothing of sort hokar be that native name interposed vernon suddenly yes have two native servant hokar bahadur be devoted to when colonel tried to pull off mask naturally hokar intervened to prevent doing so in same way vernon punished for using violence towards prevented faithful fellow from strangling so have life to thank for why did prevent from strangling dimsdale asked towton swear that hokar have nothing to do with murder have of course must say that for own safety said vernon contemptuously how be that became possessed of dimsdale secret maunders hesitated be not bound to answer that said defiantly if answer will answer drench threatened vernon firmly drench must not dare to bring into matter why not dimsdale be blackmailed on account of certain secret because must not pay perished by violence know secret so inference be that ordered to be strangled finished maunders calmly how can that be when hokar be never near dimsdale bungalow in life certainly a be with miss hest nearly evening must not have committed murder remains to be proved rejoined vernon suppressing what miss hest have told of young man movement on fatal night even presuming be innocent of actual crime that hokar be not near house spider who came to blackmail must have learned from secret threatened to disclose maunders be silent for moment ca prove knew about secret said doggedly colonel towton can swear that heard from diabella can prove that be fortune teller fact only admit of one interpretation maunders be accomplice of spider be spider be lie be infernal lie cried maunders greatly agitated be truth know face reveals truth how can tell that when be nearly in darkness with fog asked maunders between teeth can see well enough darkness be easily remedied colonel will please light lamp while keep eye on friend here maunders cursed former schoolfellow ardently while towton quietly lighted tall lamp stood in corner light soon glowed through rosy shade adorned in tawdry manner with artificial flower vernon stepped up to maunders scamp met scrutiny unflinchingly displayed courage worthy of better cause be pale with apprehension for well knew in spite of bravado that be in tight place crimson hue of light filtering through shade threw delicate glow on finely cut face facing two gentleman who knew past denial to be scoundrel looked a handsome lad a ever stepped in shoe leather seemed terrible pity so fair outside must mask such internal evil something of sort occurred to vernon a stepped back with sigh wish be a decent fellow a look said in regretful voice in heaven name maunders why ca be honest man have handsome face fine figure have have best education england can afford hold good position in social world finally aunt mr bedge who adopted a son love dearly if have not sufficient self respect to keep straight for own sake might behave like honest gentleman for hers maunders might have be moved by discourse might not at event showed little sign of feeling on classic face be very well talking said sullenly looking down trifle ashamed if indeed must be said to display emotion have be brought up to live like prince have taste of duke income of pauper so must gratify fancy somehow be more proud of having have to take to fortune telling for bread butter than be in setting up a private detective business be respectable law can say nothing to nothing to certainly vernon assured coldly since be always have be on side of justice fortune telling may be innocent enough in main since prefer wringing money from silly people instead of taking up good business be connection with spider be dangerous to be not spider have connection with beast in case how come that spider offer to place lady corsoon in possession of niece fortune on condition that permit to marry miss corsoon colonel uttered ejaculation of mingled wrath horror maunders grew shade paler be that true towton demanded with look of loathing at maunders then inquiring glance at vernon perfectly true be response did not intend to say anything to colonel since affair be private one of lady corsoon seems necessary to be frank even at risk of exposing lady secret much a hate to do so lady corsoon received offer from spider to return certain jewel pawned to pay bridge loss obtained possession of by mean of forged pawntickets on condition that must pay one thousand pound afterwards letter be received saying that must take ten thousand pound single year income of miss dimsdale must place lady corsoon in possession of fortune be to pay money consent to marriage of friend here with miss corsoon how do explain interest spider take in maunders if know culprit moistened dry lip replied with insolent boldness wrote that letter to lady corsoon be second letter know nothing about first then be spider cried towton fiercely run head against wall retorted maunders coolly fighting for inch of disputed ground lady corsoon told about first letter threat advised to consult vernon in character of nemo did good turn better said vernon scornfully hoped that lady corsoon on learning employment must forbid to think of daughter yes did however sent to to do business then thought a be committed so far with spider that there must be harm in trying to get on side so might marry lucy knew that ida be not entitled to fortune a there be will be not old dimsdale daughter knew also that lady corsoon be kept short by husband must like to have own money if only to pay spider recover jewel so a to hide fault from sir julius for reason wrote letter asking that lady corsoon must aid to marry daughter asked for ten thousand pound also said towton wrathfully only one year income of dimsdale investment retorted maunders with great coolness man must have money for honeymoon when lady corsoon died guessed that wife never will be can rest assured must inherit whole dimsdale fortune quite so thought of everything suppose lady corsoon showed second letter a well a first in character of nemo be correct replied vernon with great composure noted that second letter like first be signed with ideograph of spider naturally must be said maunders with shrug easily have india rubber stamp made thing if done have to be well done be blackguard said colonel towton much disgusted may ask requested vernon with irony how many other people have blackmailed by using stamp none did blackmail lady corsoon simply made suggestion on threat of telling husband about gambling sale of family jewel spider used that argument first said maunders sullenly simply endorsed heartily believe that be scoundrel snapped towton swear be not why even mother be blackmailed adopted mother be on plea that be real mother must have done thing a must do anything to gain own end said vernon coldly always provided villainy be not discovered maunders grew furiously scarlet at least must have spared aunt mr bedge must give last sixpence in character a adopted son there be need for to attempt blackmail

to find empty front door have crashed to with noise like thunder heard being locked on outside to accompaniment of triumphal laugh have lost cried vernon tugging vainly at door will get away easily in fog chapter xvi search while vernon desperately tried to wrench open front door towton with quick foresight of old soldier ran back into drawing room lifted window sash in le than two minute be outside hastened to release companion luckily in hurry hest have be unable to extract key from lock so swift turn of wrist soon removed barrier vernon colonel set off hot footed in pursuit of fugitive a plunged into fog caught glimpse of gail wife hurrying into hall with scared face doubtless attracted by ominous sound of pistol shot there be time to explain a moment be of value two men put heart into chase sudden autumnal fog have so unexpectedly descended have turned atmosphere to thick wool so that be difficult to breathe let alone to see on side gloomy mist shut in prospect after racing vaguely for minute down silent road pursuer halted by mutual consent to listen for possible flying footstep not sound struck on ear might have be middle of night so dense be darkness so silent whole neighbourhood must not tell in direction two scoundrel have fled on face of pursuit be absolutely useless might make for railway station suggested colonel may have gone there vernon shook head doubt maunders be too cunning hest too desperate to think of taking train to waterloo in case will send wire to stationmaster asking to detain maunders can be recognised from having hat there be many men who wear hat nowadays said towton dismally be not distinguishing mark worth much how dickens be to find telegraph office in fog vernon looked around noted weak flare of light illuminating darkness

two three door down worthy grocer looked somewhat alarmed at entrance of two gentleman without hat for in haste vernon friend have forgotten to take gave tradesman time to ask question by closely skirting shop round corner managed to find that of chemist here vernon sent wire to stationmaster at waterloo instructing to detain two men one dark one fair without hat who might possibly arrive by early train added meagre description of dress so that telegram proved to be somewhat lengthy fear be useless said vernon a left shop have handed wire to startled chemist wo take train be certain even if do description be not clear enough unless waterloo stationmaster happens to be singularly intelligent can hope for best have done can said towton in decided tone what be to be done now must return to siddons villa to get hat to see gail how be to retrace step in fog petterby road be just round corner by keeping to railing of garden be bound to find house be a vernon said have raced in straight line down to grocer shop at corner have not left petterby road until went to telegraph office on recovering bearing of first shop carefully felt way up road reading on gate designation of house in way after ten twelve minute have elapsed managed to strike siddons villa again found at front door be closed a also be window hope gail have not run away also said vernon ringing bell do suspect have anything to do with business who know on face of look innocent maunders certainly swore that old man be ignorant maunders be liar here door be cautiously opened white face of professor gail became visible who be there asked in trembling voice mr vernon colonel towton said latter gentleman have returned to get hat to explain wo fire more pistol wife be almost fainting like sort of business what doe open door open door cried colonel testily will have full explanation mr gail still seemed reluctant a apparently took for robber dangerous rogue so vernon losing patience forced door back old actor along with faced professor in hall saw that be holding old fashioned blunderbuss probably stage property used in miller men other out of date play in distance sheltering behind husband be mr gail grasping poker in trembling hand pair seemed to be thoroughly frightened considering circumstance be small wonder that be have sent maria for policeman quavered mr gail husband be armed hope maria wo lose in fog said vernon good humouredly in spite of vexation at escape of spider jackal in heaven name what doe mean demanded professor somewhat recovering dignity come into drawing room will explain said towton with impatience for have small leniency for cowardice there be nothing to be afraid of mr vernon be honest men have got rid of villain villain shrieked mr gail trembling violently dropping poker maunders hest said vernon carelessly come in preceded friend gails into drawing room quite certain from way in have behaved that knew nothing of wicked doings of hest maunders when door be closed everyone be seated vernon proceeded to examine actor actress situation a professor gail said afterwards be highly dramatic must answer question frankly said vernon addressing couple if police may interfere police shrieked mr gail turning a white a chalk professor silenced with gesture spoke to vernon with great dignity young man said striving to keep voice from trembling pay rate tax bill to tradesman rent for home under circumstance can not see why must talk of police speak of in connection with what have taken place may well do so young man to fire pistol in private house be accident vernon hastened to explain revolver went off when mr hest assaulted why must mr hest assault demanded gail much astonished be long story tell vernon turned towards professor while towton held peace nursed hat what do know of maunders know of said amazed gail looking thoroughly puzzled know more than that be friend of mr hest who called last night who be requested by mr hest not by to stay night have never set eye on before did miss hest ever mention yes did broke in mr gail who be listening intently told that be friend of hers in love with miss dimsdale mentioned that be only man have ever seen handsome enough to play romeo a romeo must be played professor gail nodded head graciously agree with miss hest there said gravely mr maunders be indeed handsome never told anything about mr vernon save what wife have related mr hest what do know of nothing more than that be brother of talented pupil came with message from sister who be at ancestral hall in yorkshire to effect that must return in month perchance earlier to fulfil certain engagement have procured invited to stay here during stay in town why did asked colonel speaking for first time gail looked embarrassed mr gail spoke for mr hest know be very rich said frankly husband wish to have theatre of own thought that if showed hospitality might finance must say added looking puzzled that wondered that rich man be content to accept humble lodging instead of going to swell hotel seems to be easily pleased be not that hettie said professor quickly mr hest simply remained here so that must persuade to induce talented pupil to give up reciting a dreaded lest must go on stage ought to be actress in humble opinion for capability be of very high order a lady macbeth in of sardou character such a la tosca fedora rest must produce sensation speech of man wife seemed frank enough appeared to be couple of simple people devoted to profession quite ignorant of evil vernon glanced at towton saw from expression of colonel face that thoroughly believed still so a to be quite sure of ground asked question miss hest a reciter actress may be can be desired do mr gail like personally do think be what call well er straight yes cried woman forcibly miss hest be one in thousand be kind hearted lady who sympathises with who struggle hettie be quite right said professor with dignity many time have miss hest assisted when tradespeople have worried be sure that must have persuaded brother to enable to enter into management in long run a have confidence in capability in mine said mr gail jealously said that emilia in 'othello be best performance have ever seen now gentleman actress rose to give effect to word may inquire why ask question why come here to fire pistol in peaceful home at beginning have be in vernon mind to tell whole story right out to tax couple with complicity really seemed to be entirely ignorant of hest true character evidently have only lately met maunders therefore did not think wise to reveal what colonel knew lest gails must gossip about matter until have consulted drench young man did not desire that last unusual affair must become public therefore shot warning glance at colonel answered cautiously be only private matter mr gail be not worth explaining pistol shot be accident said that mr maunders mr hest be villain persisted ah spoke somewhat harshly being trifle excited have treated friend here very badly came for redress how conscience smote can judge from fact of flight will possibly never see again if do chance to return must wire to at once to athenian club pall mall like hint suggestion of evil sir said gail restlessly certainly must never think of telegraphing to unless mr maunders mr hest give leave why sir must not return seek to know more mr gail do a be told said vernon in peremptory tone also will be wise if wife hold tongue over what have happened stop servant from talking suppose demanded gail aggressively in case will get into trouble how dare how dare see here colonel towton rose angrily have reason to believe that men be connected with spider mr gail shrieked professor turned pale knew that terrible name be so freely mentioned in paper do mean to say say nothing said vernon sharply friend here have perhaps said too much be a well that must know necessity of keeping silent tongue in head knowing nothing of matter can not be expected to be quite aware that be innocent of complicity interrupted towton must promise to be silent until have leave to speak if not already have told that police will interfere observed vernon coldly business be concerned with spider so for own sake hold confounded tongue gails however be not so easily commanded wished to know how hest maunders be connected with spider if be in way accused of being a termed in know argument command of towton together with of vernon gradually induced worthy couple to listen to reason in fact at end of hour be thoroughly terrified into thinking that reputation might be ruined be known that men connected with spider have be under roof gail wife be averse to being mentioned in paper to securing advertisement so a to add to theatrical fame publicity likely to be procured from late episode be not sort desired therefore finally agreed to keep silence about strange interview flight of guest also declared that must make maria hold tongue nevertheless curiosity remained unabated vernon have to promise that must day be satisfied will know when time come said when taking leave keep silence until appointed hour lest get into trouble speech being somewhat stagey sounded pleasantly in ear of couple towton left house with friend quite satisfied that professor gail wife servant must say nothing of what have taken place now said colonel let grope way to station after reach town can see drench vernon agreed by following line of house finally managed with difficulty to get to railway here have to wait for considerable time for train a ordinary traffic be somewhat complicated by fog be eight o'clock before reached waterloo learned from stationmaster that nothing have be seen of two men alluded to in telegram although train barrier of platform arrived at have be watched by police vernon be not surprised at intelligence thought hest maunders be too clever to risk wire to waterloo station a knew must send what be to be done now let go to room send telegram to drench at hampstead asking to come down fog be still thick said towton a stepped into taxi perhaps wo come hang possible obstacle seems to be placed in way blackguard will escape not out of england at event said vernon grimly when explain everything to drench will have station port watched will catch sooner later young man spoke with more confidence than actually felt a knew that hest be extraordinarily clever in concealing a spider have baffled police for year being arch criminal must be dexterous enough to escape even out of tight corner began to consider what be best to be done after sending wire to inspector drench when meditation be broken in upon by colonel do really believe that hest be spider of course did see face change when maunders spoke did cut run when saw that game be up certainly look like guilt yet seems incredible man always have lived in yorkshire whereas spider be supposed to live in town one have ever known whereabouts of spider said vernon coolly be a easy to write blackmailing letter in yorkshire post in london a to live in town altogether for purpose besides sister told that hest frequently went away for day week at time doubtless be attending to nefarious business in london how do reconcile devilry with philanthropy seems odd doe know that worst criminal have good point there life soul of good in thing evil know rather think said colonel grimly hest look upon a kind of modern robin hood who take from rich to give to poor blackmailed wealthy folk in order to build bolly reservoir confounded school house robbed peter to pay paul a might put rob dive to help demo be way must put said vernon with shrug however have made great discovery one police will thank for making when hest be captured many rich man will sleep easier yes when be captured wo be easy agree with spider be a clever a father devil humph added vernon thoughtfully wonder if sister know anything about infernal doings said colonel decidedly like miss hest a think be too imperious masterful want own way too much same believe must have countenanced brother behaviour besides be always away from doubtless carried on prank without knowledge defend thought did like admitted only moment ago did not snapped colonel a taxi cautiously felt way up whitehall must be just to poor woman will suffer a be when brother criminality becomes known will ruin reciting business be true there be chance of keeping matter quiet hest must be captured imprisoned hanged mean remember murdered martin dimsdale vernon shuddered suppose did be reluctant admission be sorry for miss hest a contrary to opinion think highly of may be masterful a say ida be so weak that be just a well that must have someone to lead in right way oh miss hest have led in right way doubt retorted colonel prefer to be guide see here vernon come down with next week to place at bowderstyke what for have to hunt down hest maunders can safely leave to drench underling want to get ida away from gerby hall sorry a be for miss hest in having brother want ida to continue under protection longer especially a want to marry to maunders maunders will have chance now said vernon with grim chuckle be bachelor towton so ida will scarcely be able to come to grange will ask aunt down a chaperon lady corsoon good ask lucy also for sake with great pleasure think that removal of maunders from path yours will result in course of love running smoother ah here be be glad a want drink victual after long cautious creeping through fog two gentleman arrived at colonel room bendham be sent out for food having dined smoked talked while waiting for inspector drench never came telegram arrived instead stating that fog prevented keeping appointment also prevented vernon getting back to own quarter so colonel put up for night next day hunt for criminal began in earnest before drench arrived did at eleven o'clock professor gail came to athenian cub where gentleman be waiting produced wire have arrived for hest on morning have not opened being afraid brought intact to vernon that young man have compunction under circumstance in reading found that be from france hest to brother asking to return home a diver matter connected with estate required attention sent first thing morning said vernon passing wire to colonel poor woman doe know that brother have be found out wire be shown to inspector drench when duly arrived be exhaustively informed of have taken place be naturally astonished interested nevertheless expressed annoyed that civilian must have proceeded so far without invoking police drench gave colonel vernon to understand that if have be on spot hest accomplice must not have escaped so easily view with privately differed although did not think wise to say so towton did intimate to inspector that be military man not civilian vernon might be drench declined to take notice of remark inspector also questioned gail closely must learn nothing from of moment since old actor knew nothing be greatly agitated over whole affair finally bidding three hold tongue drench sallied forth to search for missing pair saw scotland yard authority wired to port railway station in kingdom a yet because desired to keep affair out of newspaper drench did not advertise in journal by handbill otherwise in way strove to find fugitive might a well have attempted to find shell at bottom of atlantic day after day went by news be heard of hest maunders from moment have be swallowed up by fog at isleworth nothing have be seen of have not so far a must be ascertained passed out of kingdom certainly be not to be found in kingdom like macbeth witch have made thin air like child of korah dathan apparently have be swallowed up by earth thanks to drench discovery of identity of spider subsequent escape have not yet be made public press knew nothing of what be taking place time have now come when publicity be absolutely necessary there be nothing else for said drench vernon in spite of wish to keep thing quiet agreed with chapter xvii in train within week of episode at isleworth colonel towton took vernon with to yorkshire inspector drench be still searching for fugitive be still unable to find true to reputation spider have covered up track in most masterly manner there be not slightest clue to indicate whereabouts presumably maunders be with a have not returned to room in planet street have be seen in of usual haunt about town be to be expected a maunders have a saying go gone under society wherein have glittered so gaily must henceforth know more seemed pity that young man with talent good look social position must have ruined life at very outset of promising career there must have be criminal strain in maunders came to surface in prosperity instead of being revealed by poverty be a coleridge say about people with such nature fool in circumbendibus however be useless for vernon to mourn over old school friend downfall have done best to keep in straight path have failed to prevent foot from straying therefore a there be nothing else to be done at eleventh hour washed hand of left together with hest to tender mercy of law a represented by inspector now that drench have thread in own hand resented anyone else weaving into rope for neck of criminal a apparently wished to secure glory honour of capture to towton vernon be rather glad that inspector took view a wished to have nothing more to do with matter before leaving london for bowderstyke vernon shut up covent garden office formally renounced pseudonym of nemo a by time be officially recognised a uncle heir must well afford to do so sir edward however still lingered between life death so be doubtful when vernon must enter into kingdom while train be flying through autumnal landscape towton guest made comfortable in first class compartment have secured to for purpose of uninterrupted conversation be still deeply interested in case looked forward anxiously to capture of spider be only right that must suffer for dastardly crime in murdering old inoffensive man a to maunders be evidently hand in glove with cleverer rascal must undoubtedly be given long term of imprisonment thus society must be rid of two dangerous people with secret must sleep easier knowing that one asmodeus be dead other safely locked up know what poor mr bedge will do said vernon looking dolefully out of window doe know anything asked colonel throwing down morning paper have be reading settling for talk vernon nodded saw yesterday sent to ask have become of constantine be obliged to tell do think be kind wise think so decidedly be better that mr bedge must learn truth from friend than see crudely printed in daily paper there be bound to appear sooner later drench will have to catch spider first said colonel coolly easy task a know what did say at first declined to believe badly a maunders have treated kept insisting that be mistake constantine must appear to put matter right what wonderful faith woman have vernon bless yes go by heart entirely in case remarked towton drily mr bedge must have known that maunders be not saint try to make out to be did not say that went by instinct replied vernon equally drily there be difference between heart love because constantine be sister child adopted son mr bedge heart have almost broken cherishes fondly instinct must have told long ago that fellow be scamp of worst sort be thorough paced scoundrel said colonel vigorously mr bedge declined to take view of wailed that have tender heart be led away because have weak nature in fact defence be that of man being own worst enemy maunders certainly be have gift of god yet yet fell because greatest gift of honest purpose be not given finished vernon hang towton scamp a fellow be be sorry for be not growled towton savagely ah did not play with a child did go to school with friend although be bound to say that constantine be always selfish chap what must call rotter must call nothing of sort vernon detest slang be mistake slang frequently hit nail on head when king english miss altogether slang conveys much in little oh deuce take philology go on talking about mr bedge there be more to say maunders have pretty well drained have enough to live on hampstead house be own towards end of conversation however let out that be not surprised at conny behaviour a rather expected h be somewhat contradictory why well seems that maunders father greek mavrocordato know be rather bad egg worried wife mr bedge sister be into grave swindled partner before committed suicide never heard that before mr bedge always kept quiet for boy sake until let out to in grief yesterday mavrocordato took english name of maunders bolted with heap of partner money shot at corfu whither be traced by detective mr bedge adopted son did best to train up a honest man tried hardest be certain what be bred in bone know colonel towton folded arm stared straightly before poor devil be considerably handicapped by father wonder vernon for how many of deed be responsible when take heredity into consideration sin because like many because ca help let give maunders benefit of doubt say that sin of father be visited on of course must not forget that hest be extremely clever strong minded man who must did easily control maunders weaker nature there be something to be said there assented colonel thoughtfully daresay hest entangled poor wretch in crime before well knew what be about once committed must be compelled to remain in mud hest vernon what do make of know enough about to give opinion perhaps when see sister may tell something oh by way received letter from two day ago about intended to speak to vernon bother worry put out of head left at home unfortunately can tell gist of vernon looked interested what did write about why to wrote to because want to marry ida really see what have to do with remarked vernon with shrug for ida be surely of age to choose for herself always told vernon said towton deliberately crossing one leg over other ida being le masterful than miss hest be usually guided by that objected to guidance ida liked more than anyone else before handsome scamp came along then became infatuated with miss hest did best to induce to marry sad death of dimsdale took ida thought off maunders a judge from letter ida wrote from gerby hall miss hest tried to get to love man again failing that attempted to get ida to marry brother only came up to london not feeling disposed to fall in with sister view can therefore see miss hest sway ida great deal for reason have come to get away from such dangerous company doubly dangerous now that know francis hest be spider vernon shrugged shoulder be rather hard to blame sister for brother delinquency said judicially now that maunders be out of running will place weight in scale in fact from late observation have already done so must be very pleased colonel whereas seem to to be ungrateful want ida to be induced to marry by miss hest representation vernon said towton hotly be liberty on part to interfere with wooing lady corsoon come down to morrow with daughter will ask to go to gerby hall bring ida back with then will have finished with shady people ida will marry of own free will well colonel replied vernon pacifically hope thing will turn out a expect what did miss hest write about about brother asked if have seen be matter with vernon looked puzzled understand doe suspect suspect nothing broke in towton impetuously stated that have received letter from brother four five day ago saying that intended to leave england for ever a be tired of civilisation enclosed deed of gift making over gerby hall acre to a intended so said to earn own living when abroad naturally miss hest must not understand wrote asking be matter did explain wrote saying be coming down to own place must tell knew when arrived can see vernon that hest be still in london be six seven day ago may have gone away since said vernon cautiously who drew up deed of gift ca say miss hest did not explain that why because if be lawyer might be able to question regarding hest latest movement humph so hest have bolted well be not surprised at be rather astonished must surrender property oh well expect business a spider have made quite rich man remember blackguard have be blackmailing successfully for three four year know that sister have nothing save what make by reciting so perhaps conscience smote so made deed of gift be lucky thing for a gerby hall be fine old place although rather gloomy there be decent income of one thousand year attached to farm village rent sort of thing know be queer hest must have behaved so well when be such scoundrel towton told that quarrelled with sister certainly from remark made about to did not seem over fond of blood be thicker than water said colonel sententiously dog doe not eat dog agree with first proverb not with second towton miss hest be not of same breed morally speaking a brother doubt will be horrified when learns of wickedness probably always defend be just said vernon coldly so far a can see be clever woman of good principle although admit rather masterful brother have done wise thing in handing over property reason may be will be admirable mistress oh a to hest be great benefactor to village around people swear by if have bolted with maunders drench will have to let matter drop if be captured one here will believe that be murderer blackmailer know only a good landlord kind friend know a criminal strange two such diverse nature can exist side by side daresay hest hoped that good deed must pay for bad one said colonel carelessly will be glad if escape richly a deserves to be hanged for murdering dimsdale will be just a well if whole thing be buried in oblivion then will marry ida miss corsoon miss hest can play lady of manor here a plea what about dimsdale property if belongs to lady corsoon must have if maunders story be lie may be will stick to on behalf of wife however may hear from venery of singapore in few week letter must have nearly reached by time can learn truth of story nearer home said vernon after pause miss jewin housekeeper at gerby hall told story to maunders according to own account will question may be sure said colonel grimly want to hear from venery also oh be sick of talking about thing added with yawn be time for forty wink forthwith closed eye after settling comfortably in seat vernon not inclined to rest lighted fresh cigar buried in book be five o'clock when traveller reached bradmoor nearest station to bowderstyke be ten mile to valley road be excellent towton motor car awaited in ten minute baggage be packed away vernon with host be safely ensconced in back part of machine be covered with hood towton asked vernon if must care to drive a offer be refused colonel did not feel in sporting conduct of journey be left to smart chauffeur appeared to be well acquainted with country a road be somewhat lonely motor travelled towards bowderstyke at great rate of speed motion be exhilarating view on side of roadway extremely picturesque so vernon enjoyed greatly in fresh air after close atmosphere monotony of train with wind blowing in face smooth easy gliding motion felt like flying bird at event a though mounted on one country be wild barren consisting mainly of interminable stretch of moorland mounting up on side of road to considerable height occasionally there be dip covered with green grass tree already beginning to shed leaf for most part sombre moor darkening in failing light spread solemnly to right left be rarely that house village be passed only now then must vernon catch glimpse of cattle human being country must get on nerve said to companion be like weird landscape described by browning in childe roland poem telegraph pole be sole sign of civilisation oh will come to more cheery aspect shortly said towton smiling for part love gloom loneliness of moor many time in garish indian day with burning sun in hateful blue sky have longed for dear old yorkshire everyone to taste said vernon with shrug prefer something much more cheerful be cockney at heart vernon daresay london be good enough for towards end of ten mile stretch from station sign of civilisation became more frequent here there be village with cultivated field around cattle be pastured in enclosed paddock men woman with laughing child trudged along high road looking after motor with great curiosity for machine be yet novelty in lonely district twice road ran directly through village vernon have opportunity of seeing solid grey stone house be suited to calvinistic look of country people appeared to be what scotch call dour now moor began to grow higher to close in on white road with gradual menace leaving comparatively broad land motor glided into valley grew even more narrow a proceeded babbling stream prattled down centre of over stony bed beside road twisted along like white serpent protected by parapet of rough stone already crimson light of sunset have died out of western sky moon be full soaring high in dark blue dome of firmament poured flood of light into gully to use colonial expression for by time be little else looking upward vernon must see star after star peep out to attend on majestic orb what do call place asked abruptly towton glanced at in surprise did tell be bowderstyke great scott colonel be house situated in isolated damp spot must think never saw sun from one year end to other save when be directly overhead oh valley broadens out further on be merely entrance what deuce do inhabitant live on be like living in drain oh confound vernon said colonel half annoyed be one of most beautiful place in world if be yorkshire tyke must admit that there be only village of bowderstyke mile away inhabitant live by pasturing cattle on moor on height above also there be weaving spinning industry mill being driven by water power of there be lack stream doe seem to have much water said vernon disdainfully must see in winter when snow melt on moor advised colonel besides water from mill come from hest new reservoir there be never failing supply stream used to be much broader bed contained much more water when bolly dam be constructed of course supply dwindled pipe run under road to supply several village saw just before entered valley where be dam criminal friend built towton pointed straight ahead round next corner must see go so far there be small lake there up on moor fed stream hest simply got engineer to dam lake prevent too much water going to waste down bed of torrent dam run right across valley mile half beyond house be that dangerous if burst valley must be flooded from end to end everybody must be drowned to say nothing of way in village must be smashed up well yes towton pinched nether lip uneasily have thought of many time be abroad when dam be constructed there certainly a have often said must be outlet for water other than pipe supply bowderstyke village outside valley capacious a same pipe undoubtedly be assuredly if reservoir burst there must be great loss of life destruction of property bolly dam be very strongly built so have fear of anything happening can see from house will pay visit in day two meantime be bowderstyke village by time be passing through quite number of small house from window of light gleamed cheerfully motor soon left behind then swerved to right looking up from entrance to valley shortly began to climb winding road at point a colonel have foretold vale broadened abruptly high moor stood away so a to form kind of deep cup up side of road along be travelling sloped upward for distance then turned on sloped still higher shortly motor attained highest level in moonlight vernon must see moor stretching for mile lonely romantic straight road ran parallel with upper portion of valley for close upon half mile then appeared miniature forest encircled by high stone wall be undoubtedly artificial a moorland be treeless unexpected woodland looked out of place amidst bleak surroundings motor soon arrived at two tall stone pillar crested with heraldic monster passing through spun up short avenue to stop before large white house brilliantly lighted up spacious lawn opened up before mansion interspersed with flowerbed now bloomless whole be shut in by fairy forest a vernon called in own mind here be said colonel towton jumping from car allow to welcome to grange friend thank journey at end said vernon chapter xviii at bowderstyke hope slept well vernon said colonel to guest next morning when be at breakfast like top be response journey tired out moorland air be so strong that slept moment head be on pillow will eat well also vernon remarked towton regarding with satisfaction attention paid by visitor to appetising meal air be famous a tonic will return to town giant refreshed there be lot to be done before leave here said vernon passing cup for fresh supply of coffee what be first step will call on miss hest afternoon can show village at same time lady corsoon daughter will come to day will arrive to dinner be programme be at disposal to morrow suppose will get lady corsoon to take charge of ida if miss hest will let go said colonel cautiously ca detain surely not by outward force may use influence to keep miss hest wo lose chance of swaying mind of girl with ten thousand year may be sure of h be said vernon finishing last of coffee if ida learned secret of dimsdale from maunders disguised a diabella may be sure that told miss hest in case ida be not worth keeping colonel towton nodded pushed back chair to rise there be something in will admit however can say nothing until interview miss hest have already sent note saying that have arrived will see to day matter having be thus arranged two men lighted pipe strolled out into ground be bright autumnal morning with cloudless blue sky radiant sun moorland air be keen vernon drew long invigorating breath into lung notwithstanding somewhat bleak surroundings grange be remarkably comfortable house original towton who have built same have striven to render a bright a possible so a to contrast with sombre moor grange indeed be more like italian villa than yorkshire mansion a be constructed of white stone window have green shutter while roof be formed of cheerful red tile room corridor be spacious decorated in brilliant tint furniture be of most modern description be at like ancestral home be said towton cheerfully better for since word suggests oak parlour comfortable gloom cumbersome furniture must suit situation better said vernon glancing at pine fir tree formed screen to keep away too keen moorland wind brilliant wall red roof look out of place in stern solitude where nature seems to be acting anchorite love scenery solitude vernon like to be comfortably housed great grand father left original family seat be in valley almost below bolly dam built place after long sojourn in italy cousin from whom inherit cleared out old victorian furniture redecorated house a see be very modern perhaps in contrast with grandeur of moor somewhat frivolous at event be cheerful comfortable must scarcely ask ida to inherit kind of ogre castle like gerby hall where be that will see shortly be real old yorkshire manor house dating believe from war of rose there be lot of fighting went on during day in yorkshire original hest procured grant of bowderstyke valley from edward iv ancestor came along later seized portion of built mansion near dam understand that hests towtons fought like cat dog over valley however most of property belongs to live in very up to date grange while ' still cling to remnant of land to gerby hall from whom doe criminal friend inherit grandfather hest father be officer in indian army have quarrelled with old man then died together with wife spinster have married at twin child be sent home to grandfather who brought up left estate to francis now that have be shown up have have sense a told yesterday to hand over to sister perhaps will marry carry on family hest colonel shook head who know may be caught on other hand may bolt to south america become one of dictator read so much about a spider know that have heap of brain piratical life of description must suit exactly talking thus towton showed vernon over small kingdom after luncheon two gentleman strolled out of ground with intention of taking winding road to gerby hall on verge of moorland stood for time looking down into cup vernon thus procured bird eye view of valley in full blaze of noonday sun be like bead on string towton said after pause description be apt one for hollow into be looking be bead narrow valley running like irregular crack to right left might be easily compared to string from cup upward to bolly dam valley stretched for mile half downward ran for two mile in somewhat crooked fashion to terminate on verge of undulating plain stretched further ten mile to railway station at end of valley a towton informed guest be village called from situation gatehead there be four other hamlet beyond of belonged to hests be reduced to bowderstyke village alone to considerable portion of moorland on hither side put in mind somewhat of blackmore description of doon valley be vernon remark when in possession of fact daresay in middle age be quite robber stronghold with hests towtons a robber exactly hand be against man likewise against other for mastery of bowderstyke at upper end valley be blocked by small lake now turned by bolly dam into very large reservoir so be safe in direction gatehead be where vassal lived to guard outlet so can see in troublesome time everything be extremely safe from valley hests towtons went forth raiding sometimes when not quarrelling between formed kind of league struggled for century in end ancestor got upper hand most of property believe feud raiding continued down to termination of george third reign for king writ did not run in wild where be gerby hall towton pointed directly downward under cliff where moorland rise so abruptly like grange there be kind of artificial forest round so that be concealed a can see be almost within village right in line of flood must dam break fear so hope there be chance of dam breaking see added colonel pointing out topography of valley village be divided by ancient bed of torrent now comparatively dry since construction of bolly reservoir stone bridge connects two portion of village on side nearest to ourselves ground begin to rise gradually other portion of village gerby hall lie in hollow be cut off from sunlight often wondered said towton musingly why hests when lord of entire valley must have chosen to build manor house in such situation for when torrent be in full force from melting of moorland snow must have be exposed to many inundation now said vernon glancing northward to where cyclopean wall of dam frowned in sunlight if great body of water be let loose village hall must be swept away be certainly directly in line of flood replied towton unhesitatingly hall village house be strongly built of dark stone must take force to smash if dam broke colonel must be swept away like straw on surface of whirlpool ca understand what engineer be thinking about to risk catastrophe towton laughed pooh pooh nothing be likely to happen now that rule here intend to see if outlet can not be arranged other than down valley so that risk may be done away with objected to dam from first although admit that be work be of great public utility supply bowderstyke gatehead other village spoil view also be dangerous a observe however have talked enough on dull subject let descend pay visit to gerby hall miss hest will be expecting ida laughed vernon with side glance at suddenly flushed cheek of soldier descended by winding road into valley after pausing to glance up valley where massive wall of dam cut short view proceeded slowly towards village be collection of small dark house built of moss clothed grey stone looked like colony of dwarf building men woman who dwelt therein be tall burly enough child seemed to be well grown besides dwelling there be also two mill wheel of be driven by water in very powerful fashion few shop be dark uninviting chief street narrow crooked secluded a be from sun never warmed village with beam save at noonday did not appear to be desirable residence inhabitant seemed cheerful enough frequently greeted colonel with gruff amiability although be not landlord position a towton have informed guest belonged to hest rather since have expatriated to sister crossing curved stone bridge arched dwindling torrent colonel led friend through several dismal street until emerged into open space to see before high wall built of irregular block of stone covered with moss grass lichen massive wooden gate afforded entrance into domain stood wide open indicating like door of janus temple that hests be at peace with neighbour passing through visitor walked up gloomy avenue where branch of tree met overhead came unexpectedly upon square stone house appearance of be similar to of encircling wall there be absolutely pretension to architectural beauty mansion looked a though have grown out of damp fecund ground where rank grass grew in profusion above be slightly sloping bank of moorland here be almost perpendicular threw heavy shade over frowning dwelling suited grim look be two storey with twelve window in front six on side three in storey in centre be door without porch without step only broad flagstone formed threshold tree grew up nearly to there be merely narrow gravelled path between luxuriant grass wall of house so amazingly dismal dwelling vernon have never set eye on uttered exclamation when beheld desolation be very worst place ida must have come to said in high displeasure what must miss hest have be thinking of to ask to live in vault ah will be better up on height in italian villa vernon be if will come remarked other gloomily for sombre situation ascetic look of hest mansion made spirit sink to zero approach have be seen for scarcely have set foot on flagstone before have time to raise hand to

gentleman must enter conducted to room to left of cheerless hall here intimated that be to wait that mistress must soon come to after retired sullenly closed door after what with look gloom of room closing of door visitor felt a though have be bestowed in dungeon anything more dismal can scarcely be conceived oh lord ejaculated vernon with dismay looking round at old fashioned furniture grimly red colouring of decoration somewhat faded be true within be worse than without must commit suicide in such place wonder francis hest found blackmailing more cheerful pursuit ought to have hush said towton sharply arrested vernon speech a door opened to admit mistress of mansion miss hest looked graver than have done at rangoon more handsome than ever in imperial masterful way vernon marvelled to see how much resembled brother although disfiguring cicatrice be absent in plain black dress slashed with deep orange miss hest looked like spanish beauty in damp secluded mansion seemed to flourish a healthily a though dwelt in perpetual sunshine with smile came forward greeted visitor in most cordial manner be very glad to see said france sitting down when formal greeting have passed especially colonel towton a be anxiously waiting for promised verbal answer to letter will explain why did not write with pleasure said colonel gravely although explanation be painful may even refuse to believe

why have gone abroad then asked vernon hastily why have made over property to believe miss hest colonel must be glad to spare blow there be doubt that brother be none other than famous blackmailer for whom police be searching so ardently woman dropped back into chair clutched at breast a though felt cruel pain in heart face looked grey in dim light of room suddenly seemed to have aged even confident bearing fell away from crouched a though smitten to earth never be there so rapid so terrible transformation oh for god sake moaned brokenly for for brother heaven know did not get on over well together that that must be lie tell be lie why francis have given up life to doing good everyone round here blesses name be generous to fault dare to dare to oh leaped to foot again strove to

have be discovered a proceeded miss hest lifted face grew more composed be evidence have to go upon inquired with word of man whom admit to be scoundrel forget said vernon gravely that brother endorsed accusation by flight by taking accomplice with accusation might well make man fail to stand ground said woman resolutely on spur of moment francis may have lost wit will return to repel

police must give much to learn heard last from since sent deed of gift informed of plan there be address on letter said france wringing hand helplessly did not even promise to write when went abroad for know may have vanished for ever vernon made observation look like guilt until francis admits with own lip that be spider decline to believe said miss hest making violent effort to recover

be entirely infatuated with friend there be nothing left for to do to take speedy departure to return on more fitting occasion miss hest being naturally troubled in mind be not likely to reappear ida undoubtedly must decline to leave friend side not unreasonably colonel felt very cross ida seems to be crazy about infernal woman snapped irritably be very faithful to love therefore will make better

only one woman can talk round so suggestion be good one meanwhile just ring bell for someone to show out of condemned vault vernon pulled old fashioned bell rope shortly a though have be listening on outside of door tall lean woman with white face prim pinch lipped smile made appearance without waiting to be addressed introduced to visitor miss jewin gentleman said with stiff curtsey what can do for at sound of voice vernon started looked at closely whatever saw said nothing at moment merely intimating that friend desired to depart tell miss hest will call to morrow with lady corsoon said colonel aggressively stalked out preceded by miss jewin still primly smiling looking like white cat not until be in village did vernon explain why have started at sound of housekeeper voice that woman said quietly be very one who admitted into empty house in west kensington who locked in kitchen chapter xix bold offer lady corsoon duly arrived duly complained of length of journey strain to nerve be subjected on account of suspense suffered regarding spider blackmailing rendered somewhat irritable around felt effect of temper lucy having singularly placid nature invariably contrived to soothe down mother ruffled plume while two men knowing what lady corsoon felt paid attention next morning therefore felt somewhat better acknowledged that grange be endurable resolutely refused to call straightway at gerby hall will go to morrow said when towton urged visit nerve must have time to recover from journey into wild besides ida must call see since be elder wish to persuade ida to take up

when make wife colonel be quite certain that when ida be removed from companionship of miss hest will be able to manage with greatest ease said towton emphatically question be how to get away look to to use influence dear lady mine why never have least influence with headstrong girl dear colonel will go to morrow give talking to perhaps may be able to induce to return with to london while be mistress of ten thousand year can defy now if spider can give fortune a declares will soon bring ida to see that must behave like sensible human being suppose mr vernon told of letter received hinted a much to though think must have held tongue did hold tongue about business more le lady corsoon be mr maunders who let slip secret what business be of mr maunders must like to know asked lady corsoon putting up lorgnette looking haughtily at towton much that wrote letter what lady corsoon bounded from seat then be spider said colonel prudently who did not intend to tell companion more than must help a placed reliance on tongue knowing from about first letter received from spider anxious to marry daughter made use of blackmailer scheme to secure own end what audacity can mr maunders mean really place in possession of martin money ca answer for moment replied colonel carefully at rate by promising to do so hoped to marry miss lucy will never do cried lady corsoon energetically unless of course keep promise lucy must save from hesitated mr maunders told about loss at bridge pawned certain family jewel finished lady well never to think must discus affair in way have be fool deny

lucy to forward marriage asked lady corsoon with sudden suspicion partly answered towton coolly partly because wished to enlist on side a regard ida oh be willing to help a to mr vernon be with lucy now yes have gone for walk lady corsoon frowned lucy must make much better match said hesitating with constantine maunders for instance at event promise ten thousand year on what ground know then believe be only bluffing know about pawning of jewel even if horrid spider creature hold tongue mr maunders may tell sir julius then heaven only know what must happen julius be so impossible will engage that maunders remains silent if will give consent to marriage after miss lucy must be lady vernon must be countess if played card well really know what to say be in dark so to speak wait until see ida then may form opinion how can ida help to do so may be able to tell if there be will in favour really believe from letter of spider well of mr maunders since say wrote that martin left money to that ida destroyed will be sure be capable of permit to remind lady corsoon said colonel sternly that miss dimsdale be to be wife that will not permit anyone to cast slur on character if money be left to will hand over what ten thousand year said lady corsoon beaming oh must be good girl if did that well will wait see in meantime mind mr vernon being with lucy colonel towton shrugged square shoulder thought that lady be making virtue of necessity a young couple have taken french leave after breakfast have vanished have lady corsoon be gifted with supernatural sight must scarcely have be pleased have seen two sitting by bolly dam with arm round one also lucy meek amiable well conducted be kissing vernon in boldest manner swearing that must marry only mother want to marry mr maunders said lucy snuggling up close to lover papa desire to become wife of lord stratham will only marry darling arthur pressed cheek against breast looked up into eye run away with must elope if asked have just offered to elope without asking replied nodding ca speak plainer can oh dear sighed resting head on lover shoulder how weary be of everything papa be always busy in city have hardly word to say to mamma have secret worry about will not speak be left to find own amusement do take away arthur be gretna green somewhere about part let go there get married dear think there will be need for runaway match unless be romance of thing that desire colonel towton have promised to speak to mother have idea that will gain consent to marriage consented before pouted miss corsoon then changed mind why be sure know be much better to get married quietly then must have to forgive dear said vernon firmly prefer to act honourably openly from letter received morning seems that poor uncle can not live much longer in month at latest will be in possession of property title then will see father demand hand like when learns of new circumstance be sure will consent with on side mother will be quite willing to accept a son in law will do say dearest whispered lucy fondly only will never marry anyone so there gave kiss lover promptly returned then sat hand in hand looking at view too happy to speak further love silence be more eloquent than love speech before reservoir rippled under breath of gentle wind spread like vast blue lake toward purple of moorland immediately in front of lover massive wall of dam stretched from side to side of valley here be extremely narrow looking at vast body of water vernon must not help doubting strength of protecting wall a wavelet almost lipped top there be channel on hither side with flood gate seemed too small to carry off much superfluous water in summer time dam be doubt must be desired in way of strength when winter snow melted on moorland appeared probable at least vernon knowing nothing of engineering thought so that water must overflow dam in case might break down wall then young man shuddered to think of what must happen whole content of lake narrowed by gorge must shoot down three odd mile of valley with force condensation of hose assuredly must sweep clean from end to end to make thing safe said vernon aloud giving speech to thought there must be two channel for waste water broader than single one over there be sure there will be catastrophe winter spring oh lucy pouted again speak of love bother over silly old puddle must prove to be anything puddle if dam broke said vernon doubtfully hope towton will take step to make thing safer bowderstyke village gerby hall must be smashed to piece if vast body of water discharged without leave stared anxiously at placid lake miss corsoon rather annoyed by unlover like conduct rose quickly consulted tiny jewelled watch pinned to blouse be nearly luncheon time said with affectation of indifference be so hungry hungry vernon caught hand when be together ca live on love keep talking of stupid waterworks really must go home arthur a mamma will be wondering what have become of wish to get scolded will bear half of scolding hullo who be shaded eye with hand looked across reservoir to where tall figure appeared on broad parapet of dam figure be that of man came swiftly across midway caught sight of lover for one minute stranger stared a if thunderstruck then retreated a quickly a have appeared lucy caught hold of lover coat to prevent following where be going arthur who be hokar said vernon greatly excited pausing for moment be hindoo who tried to strangle colonel what lucy voice sounded so terrified that turned at once to apologise excuse nothing dear nothing hokar be dangerous native of india whom wish to get hold of went down into valley on other side so must leave leave wailed lucy desperately detaining wish must frighten arthur come home at once want to follow hokar be necessary be necessary to see home insisted miss corsoon firmly wo be left alone with wild indian strangling people vernon be torn between desire to stay with lucy feeling that be duty to follow hokar wished to meet hindoo face to face force to speak a be servant of maunders masquerading a diabella probably knew something if not indeed great deal about hest few question might intimate villain whereabouts man have already vanished must be difficult to trace although vernon have shrewd suspicion that be to be found at gerby hall for moment young man hesitated between duty pleasure then under reproachful gleam of lucy eye pleasure gained victory vernon escorted miss corsoon back to grange comforting with reflection that be necessary to consult colonel towton before taking step to bring hokar to book way home lucy chatted in lively manner preoccupied with own thought vernon be somewhat absentminded cause of offence to girl how must man give way to ruling passion of love when one of villain concerned in dangerous conspiracy against society be in neighbourhood vernon wondered how hokar have come to solitude how hest have succeeded in lulling sister suspicion so that might receive man for on face of hokar must be staying at gerby hall after merry luncheon during lady corsoon bearing in mind late conversation with host be very gracious to vernon lady departed to boudoir mother to rest daughter to write letter lucy indeed wished to call see ida lady corsoon refused to let go alone again expressed determination not to pay visit until next day lucy always anxious to keep parent in good temper be obliged to fall in with arrangement followed lady corsoon out of room must be easily seen that wily wife of millionaire be unwilling to leave daughter in too fascinating society of vernon evidently have made up mind not to consent to match until be certain that late brother fortune must not come into hand left alone with colonel young man related how unexpectedly hokar have appeared disappeared on dam towton listened frowningly considered awhile before expressing opinion there be something suspicious about said at length here be miss jewin very woman who tricked into becoming prisoner at west kensington house here also be hindoo so closely connected with maunders for know with hest what do make of be gang of thief said towton unhesitatingly hokar bahadur miss jewin maunders hest be banded together under leadership of last a spider have vanished so have maunders so expect sent down hindoo here in order that might be out of way miss jewin have always be housekeeper at gerby hall vernon daresay hest got to come to london to be used a tool knowing that must trust be very old faithful woman believe be nurse of hest sister people hereabouts call old witch be credited with manner of occult power can understand miss hest not being suspicious of miss jewin said vernon thoughtfully a may have gone to london ostensibly for trip then must have returned in ordinary course of thing miss hest must surely wonder at presence of hokar be bound to say did not see bahadur may be here may not rejoined colonel will soon find out to morrow go with lady corsoon to see ida then can warn miss hest of character of man if indeed doe know towton surely suspect miss hest of knowing anything about brother wickedness say that yet be strange hindoo must be there why must be lurking about bolly dam will go to morrow after have seen miss hest to make examination what do mean mean that crafty devil like hokar doe take walk for benefit of health that may be tampering with dam perhaps by order of francis hest in case why not have dam examined to day there be immediate hurry hokar will find easy task to break down gigantic wall if be aim besides vicar be calling afternoon to pay respect to lady corsoon wish to have chat with on subject of hest to learn what think of what can think hest be genuine philanthropist daresay hest be one person here in london however will do harm to collect what information can concerning to morrow can come with lady corsoon daughter to see ida will go also afterwards can inspect dam wo come too asked vernon fact be intend to ride to gatehead to morrow afternoon will leave lady at gerby hall steward want to see about property requires looking after in one of near village will be easy for to ride there look into matter can trust to amuse guest thus be arranged vernon put question concerning hokar bolly dam out of head lucy managed to evade watchfulness of mother when good lady fell asleep lover have stolen half hour to until arrival of vicar after came tea gossip very pleasant afternoon ended gleefully most important event of next twelve hour happened after dinner when colonel be called out of drawing room to see visitor left vernon to amuse lady corsoon daughter took way to library where visitor who have not sent in name be waiting for to towton surprise stranger proved to be france hest dear lady why did not join in drawing room asked hospitably be sure surprise must be pleasant one not to lady corsoon said france quietly be not over fond of besides have come to see privately on most important matter ida cried colonel anxiously be ill set mind at rest about ida have not changed since saw yesterday doe know be here doe one else not even servant a gave name when be admitted be door closed cast searching nervous look around room be perfectly private said towton noting that looked anxious haggard nothing mentioned here can be heard hope nothing be wrong france sat down sighed heavily much be wrong said with gloomy look have learned truth about brother truth what told yesterday be truth said miss hest bitterly be scoundrel a seems probable murderer yet have suspicion of not even when sent that indian down here hokar said towton secretly pleased that doubt on point be about to be resolved yes time ago came here with letter from francis saying that be to remain here for time gave house room did not pay much attention to man a thought be only of brother philanthropic scheme from what said yesterday hokar be connected with mr maunders brother in wickedness oh france struck table with clenched hand to think that name must be so disgraced by brother what have discovered that be spider yes there can be doubt of see took long blue envelope from pocket opened to display paper be mortgage on gerby hall on property explained deed of gift to be worth nothing interest be due on mortgage unless be paid man to whom money be owing will foreclose wonder francis presented with estate be worth nothing le than nothing be actually pauper oh be extremely sorry to hear that miss hest how doe paper prove that brother be spider prof that be pauper nothing more discovered amongst brother paper will of poor mr dimsdale towton started to foot what be there will yes be signed by martin dimsdale witnessed by george venery of singapore walter smith of hong kong after what said yesterday made up mind must no longer be in dark regarding brother doings therefore broke open desk always kept safely locked found written statement regarding ida not being mr dimsdale daughter child of certain mr menteith brother must have learned that story from miss jewin said colonel for maunders declared that knew history quite believe replied miss hest for statement be signed by sarah jewin have not spoken to yet will do so to morrow be in india with father mother afterwards in burmah expect heard story there related to francis added to oh towton remembered about embroidery to tale then mr dimsdale did not purposely delay relief expedition be to rescue menteith pressed on with speed francis invented that wicked lie so a to get money from mr dimsdale how francis got will ca say certainly called at 'rangoon once twice when be in london scarcely think mr dimsdale must have given will probably stole be sorry to hurt feeling miss hest added colonel hastily on seeing wince brother be extremely clever in criminal way nothing doe surprise quite believe be clever enough to get will where be have left at home if will call to morrow will give to must make condition condition colonel looked puzzled ah think badly of said france in imploring manner consider position be without penny for property must certainly be handed over to man to whom be mortgaged listen colonel will state that ida be not testator daughter leaf everything to ida menteith so there can be doubt that inherits now ida love although wished to marry brother mr maunders always desired to be wife be glad now that did not yield to persuasion since francis constantine be criminal exile so want to take away to morrow marry enter into possession of dimsdale property be very good miss hest said towton who must not acknowledge that be acting most generously condition be scarcely that colonel merely suggestion will give will if can arrange with ida to give eight nine ten thousand pound so can have something to live on towton hesitated at bold offer ca say anything about that be for miss dimsdale to decide colonel if chose ida must remain with altogether a love say rather said towton somewhat unjustly that have great influence over miss hest if have cried france rising to height of tall figure have influence be used for otherwise good instead of misusing a must to keep ida beside retain command of money wish to marry take fortune entirely to yourself ask be for sum to save from begging bread in street think of position be too hard on colonel admit that have claim said colonel politely doubtless miss dimsdale will consent to demand can say nothing will be better to wait until when until to morrow then with ida can talk over matter miss hest lip curled be strange man colonel offer pretty wife handsome fortune yet hesitate to do justice see justice in giving ten thousand pound retorted towton sharply well said france suppressing rising anger for felt that be acting generously colonel churlishly perhaps justice be not quite word must be used spoke now of influence over ida a being great spoke truly be very fond of be perfectly well able to induce to give up idea of becoming wife to get to remain with then must handle sum ask for year instead of only once for ida know nothing of business see here miss hest said towton roundly love ida wish to be wife will accept of own free will without being pressed in way influence can scarcely be so great a think since ida declined to marry maunders brother although a admit urged to do so be coming to morrow with lady corsoon daughter to see ida hope miss dimsdale will return with aunt to house not if can prevent said france colour rising a hastily wrapped cloak round moved towards door ida remains with a hostage until get money to be entitled fail to see that because have ungenerous nature retorted be in possession of unencumbered estate must ask nothing a be must have money if be wise will buy will wife with sincere promise even ask for to be in writing so confident be in honour to give ten thousand pound on wedding day towton be singularly obstinate wait until to morrow said dourly what ida say hold by in case have money retorted france left room promptly with dry smile light step fully satisfied that have won chapter xx gerby hall contrary to usual custom colonel towton did not mention conversation visit of miss hest to co worker observed reticence for two reason firstly noted that vernon be too much engrossed in society of lucy to give undivided attention to anxious matter dealing with spider machination secondly offer of france particularly concerned ida therefore be useless to ask advice probably must not be taken a vernon have always supported miss hest undoubtedly must urge that must be paid if fulfilled condition have laid down nine men out of ten must have clinched matter at price so that gordian knot might be cut instead of unravelled towton be alexander to adopt so hasty course did not see way to surrender large sum for help in opinion must be freely rendered moreover a scrupulously regarded ida fortune a belonging entirely to herself towton infinitely preferred to leave decision to judgment in spite of triumphant smile with france have terminated visit colonel did not feel sure that must gain end suspected that boasted influence over miss dimsdale be le powerful than pretended to be if must twist ida round finger intimated a much there be need for to apply to towton in way a have to do be to give will to ida receive in return cheque for ensuing year income have not done very action in seeking made towton suspect that felt influence with ida to be waning girl therefore must doubt be glad to leave gerby hall come to grange might be colonel must not be certain on point france be detaining by threat although what such threat might be towton must not conjecture certainly judging by visit of previous day ida be fondly attached to france be remaining of own free will under gloomy roof of friend towton be perplexed how to reconcile ida evident desire to remain at hall with unnecessary visit of miss hest can come to decision about matter until have seen ida by thought colonel when returned to drawing room in presence of woman poor girl may be intimidated perhaps fascinated a be bird by snake when be alone will open heart to a know that love in spite of what miss hest say to morrow if refuse to return with lady corsoon will remain behind when others have taken departure perhaps may get word two alone with ida wish must remove from society of woman be sure be harmful when rejoining guest towton merely intimated that visitor have come on business gave company to understand that be of small consequence then proceeded to make agreeable to lady corsoon so vernon lucy must have other company without uncomfortable presence of third party taught elderly guest new game of patience a proved to be somewhat dull young couple be called in to form bridge party came unwillingly playing game with faint interest allowed towton lady corsoon to win a latter individual retired to bed winner of moderate sum be in high good humour refrained from scolding lucy for philandering with undesirable lover undesirable be so long a lady corsoon hoped to obtain fortune of niece if maunders failed to fulfil promise then scheming wife of financier be perfectly willing to permit daughter to marry sir arthur vernon being of course understood that be to have title before becoming lucy bridegroom certainly must have preferred daughter to be lady stratham a lady vernon with husband rank father money must shine inconsiderable planet amongst star of london society lady corsoon must bask in reflected glory finally a ambitious mother fell asleep reflected that lucy being rather obstinate be just a well to humour in instance a be quite capable of running away with man of choice if permission be refused lady corsoon must not have be particularly astonished have heard that lucy have already made audacious proposal of flight next morning however to enhance value of prize kept daughter beside remained in own room on plea of looking after certain matter connected with feminine adornment towton on part have to attend to correspondence so vernon be left to own device thought that must not occupy time better than by taking walk to bolly dam in hope of stumbling on hokar for purpose strolled leisurely along moorland path enjoying bright sunshine keen freshness of morning air be perfect day have lucy be prattling by side must have be more perfect still beloved be absent so vernon must only feed hungry heart by recalling detail of delicious conversation have taken place between on previous day duly arrived at dam must see sign of hindoo be still early however so vernon sat down on massive stonework of wall to wait for possible arrival while in position became aware to astonishment that must hear sound extremely plainly from mile distant village clacking of mill subdued murmur of torrent tumbling under arched bridge lowing of cattle even more faintly shrill cry of child at play struck on ear with amazing clearness considering distance certainly gentle wind be blowing from village even did not wholly explain phenomenon since various noise be so markedly distinct finally vernon concluded doubt be correct in conjecture that narrow gorge acted a kind of telephone with aid of steady wind blowing up length conducted sound accurately discovery amused young man sat where be for considerable time trying to distinguish between several noise later in day decided to get lucy to sit on dam then from bottom of gorge mile away to call out see if must understand what be saying experiment must be scientific interesting for quite hour vernon waited hokar put in appearance then spent hour in walking slowly round reservoir finally without having seen single person returned to luncheon at meal colonel towton mentioned that have written note to miss hest stating that visit must be paid at three o'clock have given order for room to be got ready for ida next to yours lady corsoon said colonel doubt if ida will come sighed guest be singularly obstinate in having own way what can see in woman be puzzle to miss hest be very clever remarked lucy there be something about like for instance queried vernon bending forward can hardly say said girl thoughtfully be clever agreeable quite well bred yet seems to be be dangerous think that word applies more to maunders than to miss hest observed towton although be bound to say that miss hest doe not satisfy in many way be too masterful dangerous must not describe a dangerous miss corsoon must do colonel may be wrong first time met miss hest at 'rangoon ' gave that impression one must never go against impression said vernon gravely be instinct of soul nonsense contradicted lady corsoon vigorously be sure when first met husband must not bear mother have simply to drive to altar yet married be sure be most attached pair gentleman be too well bred to smile at statement yet secretly amused everyone knew that undeniable good feeling existed between sir julius wife be mainly due to diverse interest in life kept more le apart lady corsoon be always fluttering about a society butterfly while sir julius remained constantly in city earning money for to spend be little credit to that be civil to one on rare occasion when met cain abel must not have quarrelled when only meeting a saying go once in blue moon lady corsoon felt quite certain that be model wife typical british matron new style prattled on about domestic happiness until be time to start for gerby hall vernon will escort two lady said towton who be in riding kit exhibited more youthful air than usual can follow wo ride to gatehead until have called at hall urged lady corsoon for may need to insist upon ida coming to grange will assuredly be at gerby hall in hour more le replied colonel quietly must not think of insisting upon ida becoming guest unless honour of own free will with visit oh nonsense said lady corsoon pettishly when know how infatuated be with woman hest way down winding road lamented that ida be so impossible owner of gerby hall so second rate for be second rate finished lady corsoon triumphantly always said so must say so with dying breath in due time trio arrived at gloomy hall be shown by fat maid into dingy drawing room be le chill dismal on occasion a window be wide open warm breath of day stole in to ameliorate damp atmosphere a did sunshine to lighten darkness in glare of day furniture looked quite faded hanging extremely shabby there be something dignified about ancient room impressed even lady corsoon very quaint old place said surveying through lorgnette damp ought to have fire in grate must very well have anywhere else mamma giggled lucy dear pray afflict with cheap wit perfectly well understand meaning will take chair a light try eye so saying selected seat with back to window le to preserve eyesight than to prevent miss hest from seeing too plain evidence of age throned in spacious chair with air of queen assumed dignified mein a door opened to admit ida hostess lady corsoon first remark be scarcely polite do look ill ida said submitting cheek to kiss more than twice age miss hest what have be doing with trying to comfort replied france drily can scarcely expect affectionate girl like ida to lose father not show sign of grief sign of fiddlestick if will excuse expression be want of food cheerful

antiquarian think anyone must call comfortable however state of thing so far a ida be concerned can be easily remedied ida child have come to take to grange stand in much more healthy position ida who have saluted cousin vernon turned even paler than already be looked sideways at france think that prefer to remain in house said timidly oh must not burden miss hest longer said aunt coolly ida

guilty woman from escaping not that attempted to escape with deadly white face with steady cold malignant eye like of snake with contemptuous smile on thin lip spider visible at last in brazen wickedness stood defiantly at bay towton with ida clinging to arm almost terrified out of sens stared aghast at evil being who have be curse to many ominous silence be like year long moment before bursting of bomb ida with chattering teeth trembling limb be first to recover use of tongue must scarcely form word oh god oh god whimpered hiding face on lover breast be too awful never thought never thought oh oh oh broke down with strange hysterical choking cry must have fallen to ground that colonel placed gently in near chair then turned with military precision to face miss hest be spider asked in dry precise tone now entirely master of yes replied coolly mouth closed with triumphant snap infernal fiend gently gently hard name break bone colonel must be more of man than to throw word at woman be woman yes gasped maunders raising on elbow wiping froth from pale lip be france hest right enough brother be myth invented by to mask devilry france francis be spider did not mean exactly said towton in hard voice asked if one capable of enormity credited to spider can possibly be woman be spider said miss hest with shrug there be answer be demon more name really colonel towton be very childish sink to level of fool pointed scornfully to ida who be weeping in chair a though heart must break to think must have be friend moaned ida with fresh burst of tear hiding face little fool said france in gentle dangerous voice have be better friend to than think that pitied a being poor weak silly worm must have murdered long ago murdered father shivered ida not daring to meet cold eye rested on prostrate form martin dimsdale be not father murdered yes did what towton must scarcely believe ear admit crime france yawned ostentatiously if admit be spider follows that must have murdered dimsdale well replied towton truthfully justly may have employed hokar to strangle be very good of said france satirically place own sin on shoulder of others hokar taught how to strangle in thug fashion certainly did not kill dimsdale did still believe that murder be premeditated insisted towton upon word said miss hest good humouredly a coolly a though be gossiping over cup of tea one must think be counsel for defence be right did not intend to murder dimsdale having got out of way mean that got out of way of course assented france sitting down crossing leg in gentlemanly fashion

raising eyebrow heard nothing maunders caught word two through open window of library warned while dear ida be talking to stole round corner listened knowing about trap have vernon decoyed to kensington house at appointed time went into library masked cloaked a be other guest at ball dimsdale be waiting for stole up behind slipped handkerchief round neck oh colonel be revolted say that crime be not premeditated say truly simply prepared to strangle slightly must have made outcry remember be in dangerous position must not stand on ceremony have dimsdale given money permitted to leave by window must have spared life a be saw in mirror be directly in front of be masked must not recognise be coming to that waited for moment until made demand for money then suddenly threw back hand before guessed intention tore mask from face when recognised be obliged for own safety to strangle a handkerchief be in position simply tightened be soon dead then searched for money not being able to find resumed mask returned to ballroom maunders of course be with time awaited return did not know that have committed murder said maunders gloomily did not tell at time must have spoilt pleasure when ida learned truth by entering library guessed what have taken place kept with for own sake to provide alibi must be suspected a feared vernon might be clever enough to guess that have something to do with a matter of fact did hint at when called many day later be enabled to say that be with time so be put off scent remember murmured colonel to not so low a not to be overheard by miss hest marvellously sharp ear vernon be quite satisfied when provided alibi for maunders never suspected one ever suspected said france coolly there be need for to speak of own cleverness anyone who can baffle police a have done have need to boast why in heaven name with ability did embark on evil course asked towton amazed at sang froid fate fortune destiny what name will said miss hest carelessly have tried to exonerate colonel because of that will hear whole story leaning forward pulled bell rope remember will repeat say to police warned towton be not afraid of police retorted france with shrug plan be made to escape a fool pointed to maunders lying sullenly on floor have betrayed twice give to a sacrifice will never stand in dock may be sure will kill cried ida terrified at strength of mind dear be too much in love with life will know plan presently meantime will hear how came to be blackmailer a have already heard why murdered dimsdale to misfortune to misfortune indeed sharply may well say so colonel never intended to soil hand with blood least of with of man whom liked who be kind to sigh ida after did not shed blood a merely strangled that death brought vernon in chase of colonel so be hunted down still have maunders be true must have be safe knew francis hest a criminal thanks to maunders merged brother in sister made everything safe now shrugged shoulder must flit

hoisted into chair miss jewin have already pushed aside when entered room in place of replying to mistress stood looking at scowling haggard face with look of consternation maunders replied to look with petty triumph yes got out said rubbing ragged beard disfigured well moulded chin wrenched bar out of window climbed down by ivy now murder out hellish mistress be about to be brought to book mind sarah said france lazily leaning back in chair to light cigarette be safe so be let fool talk in meantime tell colonel towton here how came to england how knew that ida be merely dimsdale adopted

curtsey yes sir miss france be pleased that managed so cleverly ida stared wide eyed at shameless look speech of housekeeper towton frowned that creature must so audaciously confess crime when knew must shortly summon police puzzled greatly also remembering wonderful craft of spider felt uneasy a to what might happen must not conjecture in what way must extricate accomplice from trap in be safely caught however made comment on miss jewin insolence merely ordered to proceed about thirty five year ago said miss jewin plunging into story without preliminary explanation be in india nurse to

while yours be up oh said colonel with contempt so be case of jealousy merely philanthropy be fraud for first time france coloured rose out of chair to reply with more emphasis must not say that really have mixed nature like to help people good quality be outcome of evil one wanted to aggrandize hests certainly since be lord of bowderstyke valley until family robbed of property also really wished to do good help people think succeeded at cost of murder said ida resentfully be mistake replied france glibly a never intended to murder dimsdale when went to london in woman dress with very little money in pocket simply intended to earn fortune on stage by reciting to make francis hest other self who be supposed to live here wealthy popular found that reciting did not pay cast about for better mean of making money alternately lived in london a france in bowderstyke a francis must not gain end by honest mean so be obliged to take to dishonest way if wish to know devil who tempted to

entirely lost to sense of shame a be other two law breaker made find out manner of secret from client by hinting at thing asking question by know interrupted towton waving hand be aware of how fortune teller hint at possibility so find out actual truth from too credulous client wonder spider learned much that people must fain have kept to who told about dimsdale know said maunders sullenly that woman there yes said miss jewin still prim shameless when in burmah with master heard about mr dimsdale love for mr menteith how when husband died adopted child never said that mr dimsdale delayed

became alarmed a to disposition of property therefore made friend of family secured free run of house intended to get money asked ida reproachfully certainly dear replied france raising eyebrow ten thousand year be far too much for chit like to handle intended to get command of whole lot first hunted in dead of night for will found in library desk then made maunders tell that be not dimsdale daughter after murder so that might be dependent on since knew secret must rob of money have secret told also to colonel so that might learn must only have penniless wife must marry dear ida did think

be forced to play last card produce will did not intend to be found out a spider did not confessed france calmly when maunders betrayed at isleworth thought that spider be man be exactly what wanted what counted upon must such event a unexpected betrayal happen in fog dragged maunders away went to house of friend of mine whose name intend to know wired in cypher to miss jewin here to send telegram to francis hest at professor gail got said colonel quickly threw off scent thought must said miss hest coolly so while be hunting for spider a man in london went down with maunders be disguised a old gentleman resumed womanly dress then wrote on plea of talking about ida asked after pretended brother to still further puzzle certainly succeeded retorted towton trying to conceal wonder at clever trickery ida be here must have known that be absent from house a francis oh appeared before twice in room be a see not very well lighted in male disguise with painted scar on face be entirely taken in very simplicity of disguise took in said ida angrily wincing at having be so blinded have worn beard wig must have recognised think not said miss hest quietly with amused smile a man wore hair somewhat long noted that said colonel quickly how clever of well then a woman merely knitted in false hair must wear false hair a man since ida must then have be sharp enough to have recognised plenty of woman wear false plait so be safe on score never suspected sole disguise be cicatrice skilfully painted success of whole business lay a ida have submitted in boldness in belief have twin brother have always found added miss hest musingly that bolder one be safer be audacity always score at event so closely resembled own true self that one thought be anyone else what represented to be a francis told ida be taking sister away for week so slipped up to london to meet vernon at lady corsoon to be nearly trapped at isleworth what about hokar bahadur asked colonel abruptly hokar said miss jewin making explanation instead of france be old servant of captain hest came to england with child later sent for nephew who be bahadur yes gave to maunders when set up in splendid egyptian room in bond street observed mistress be not engaged to strangle people a may think colonel merely wished to add to fantastical look of place when fortune be being told that be so

safety hollow booming sound of water plunging through narrow sounded ever nearer nearer with terrible distinctness seemed a though water be bellowing for prey in moment colonel comprehended that be too late to skirt village gain winding road where must be safe ida gave cry of alarm a wrenched round now startled horse clattered through village street on way down valley seemed only chance will save yet darling muttered towton setting teeth must make for gatehead drove spur into animal now be becoming unmanageable with roaring of flood ida almost insensible with terror clung to lover neck horse making more of double burden than if have be feather tore at top speed along road between torrent precipice there be safety on side a precipice must not be climbed dry bed of stream merely offered deeper grave fortunately road sloped gradually to mouth of valley two mile away therefore downward trend offered extra mean to escape pursuing greedy water backward glance showed towton that tremendous flood be shooting out of bottle mouth of upper gorge with terrific rapidity whole of huge lake artificial a well a natural be emptying in one vast outpour owing to narrowness of valley concentrated force be gigantic if flood caught must either be dashed to piece against rock must be borne onward horse maid man to be expelled at gatehead a if fired from mouth of cannon oh god save oh god save be that ida must moan will will cried towton riding under spur whip with mad joy in adventure perilous a be will save innocent punish guilty never fear never fear darling on roared enormous

not bearing dbris body of cattle men woman child on breast water rolled majestically on destroying way like wall of steel stood up stretching from wall to wall of valley before tore terrified horse warned by instinct of rapidly approaching danger be lost be lost screamed ida hiding face on towton shoulder can never escape be mile further there be crack path break in precipice panted man almost despairing of saving what loved best in world if can gain that can scramble up great god how travel from side of valley tree be being wrenched up by root even stone lying in bed of torrent be being lifted swept onward like piece of straw owing to increasing breadth of valley shouting level of flood have somewhat lessened hoarse steady murmur with smoothly advanced seemed to be even more terrible than triumphant screaming nearer nearer rolled towering a seems to desperate fugitive right up to high heaven horse raced onward furiously there seemed to be chance of escaping rapidly approaching death wave swept along with relentless speed man woman be silent prayed inwardly a faced eleventh hour of death be eleventh hour for there be still hope rounding corner swiftly towton rose in stirrup sent forth cry almost a hoarse a of flood short distance ahead saw streak of green grass marking ruddy stone face of precipice knew that here be crack to have referred be mere chink in wall of great width caused doubt by volcanic action have formed valley in far distant age many time a lad have towton climbed up narrow natural staircase to moor above never have expected to find mean of preserving own life life valued dearer than own setting teeth glanced backward then urged horse to renewed effort wall of water be almost upon advancing with terrible steady persistence last moment seemed to be at hand suddenly colonel wrenched at horse bit pulled animal up with jerk a fell back on haunch slipped off with almost insensible girl in arm ran desperately towards sloping green bank showed like port of safety between bare bleak stone a gained horse having recovered rushed past with loose bridle with stirrup lashing side towton paid heed almost in dream scrambled up bank bearing ida a though be feather weight with straining eye bursting temple with heart beating furiously clambered desperately dragging girl rather than carrying a needed at least one hand free to grip tough grass fortunately slope be gradual have not be there must have be hope of escape a be when be considerable way up mighty wave surged majestically past water shot up crevice with gigantic force be rather help than hindrance a assisted almost broken man to mount higher to end of day colonel towton never knew how saved wife must remember be straining upward dragging now insensible woman with aching limb blood red mist before eye when brain be somewhat clearer found bending over ida in turfy nook while barely three foot below grey water gurgled sang bubbled a if in witch cauldron safe safe muttered towton dropped insensible across inanimate body of woman have so miraculously saved from terrible death nine month later when cuckoo have brought summer to land earth be gay with flower two married

for honeymoon while ida returned to grange seems like dream said vernon absently cloud passed over face in newly found happiness have tried to forget sad memory never have exhaustive talk over thing colonel now that wife be not here must like to ask few question ask away be just a well be alone ida doe care to talk of dreadful day of association with miss hest doe lucy dreadful woman what dare devil be a clever a make be sight too clever replied towton drily a burnt finger at last suppose know that miss jewin be caught wrote something about did lady corsoon tell anything why must said vernon with look of surprise well a knew secret of pawning jewel thought must have told of recovery what be recovered who have miss jewin escaped drench caught sent for before committed suicide vernon looked horrified did kill poor wretch yes hanged by garter in cell expect knew that must get long term of imprisonment so preferred to get out of world a said sent for told where jewel be also threw light on catastrophe of bolly dam breaking knew that hokar exploded charge of dynamite said vernon looking inquiringly at friend remember how must not get away in time confessed when dying that have be ordered by miss hest to blow up dam when gave signal by firing revolver oh yes remember that a came out in paper said towton with shrug be just point listen oh here be wine vernon sent away waiter after filled glass two gentleman drank to dear wife to happy future for a married men when ceremony be ended colonel related what have learned from unfortunate miss jewin before passed away dragged down in disguise to gerby hall there locked in upper room miss jewin acted a gaoler in spite of vigilance wretched man managed to break one of prison bar escape then appeared in drawing room denounced miss hest always prepared for further treachery on part of maunders never being in habit of leaving anything to chance france have arranged that must have dam broken down in event of police coming to arrest so must be destroyed must be destroyed with said vernon at point a matter of fact be remember how body that of maunders clutching one in death grip be found when flood subsided anticipated death did nothing of sort sir a miss jewin told betrayal of identity with francis hest with spider came unexpectedly because of maunders escape always making thing sure have already posted hokar at dam where have placed charge of dynamite under wall miss hest did expect trouble a thought have thrown dust in eye by clever way in have acted think did colonel very successfully remarked vernon smiling admit be wonderfully clever woman extremely unscrupulous however on chance that danger might come along posted hokar at bolly dam told to fire charge when heard report of revolver vernon nodded remember on day how wind be blowing up gorge how clearly sound came up from village hokar heard shot very easily heard two three might have guessed that infernal mistress be not giving agreed signal be shooting maunders if remember be intention after left to have escaped by similar crack up side of precipice behind gerby hall to saved ida did intend to give signal until be on upward journey with miss jewin maunders be to be left behind to drown in house miss hest forgot for moment let temper get better of by firing shot gave signal hokar blew up dam prematurely see if miss jewin escaped why did miss hest ah be where nemesis came in maunders caught by leg toppled over then gripped throat be drowned serve right also said vernon coolly agree with be dangerous couple seems like retributive justice that maunders must bring carefully laid plan of escape to grief miss jewin at first alarm caught up box of lady corsoon jewel fled out of back way up crevice a arranged concealed for time be warned by exhaustive report in paper of what be going on be worst of paper said vernon with disgust a found out when be detective warn criminal of everything suppose miss jewin saw how whole story of spider be set forth appreciated sensation caused of course did be angry at paper for grange be simply infested with reporter journalist photographer however after inquest sensation died away everybody have more le forgotten matter by time be just a well a vernon wished to be bothered with question quite so be why remained abroad with wife for time be why went back with ida to bowderstyke said colonel however to continue drench caught miss jewin hanged in cell a have told found box of jewel returned to mother in law thus husband have never found out how pawned so be right hope have be lesson to not bit of dined with week ago so did ida afterwards went to bridge drive lady corsoon played furiously be born gambler sir julius doe not know never will know how pawned much prized family jewel wonder miss jewin did sell have enough money to live on in small way of course lived plainly to avert suspicion jewel kept a peace offering in case must be arrested hoped to make term by threatening to denounce lady corsoon however heart failed handed over to poor woman by way colonel what be wife real opinion of miss hest must never quite understand towton be silent for few minute be hard to say ida told that really liked miss hest for long time thought that be genuine friend miss hest showed cloven foot by trying to get ida married to maunders why to maunders because be under miss hest thumb if obtained possession of ida fortune by marriage miss hest undoubtedly must have have spending of marriage to francis how must that be when francis did exist oh think be mere blind to make ida fancy francis be real person not miss hest in disguise can never understand added colonel with thoughtful look how be that ida did detect woman under man woman be so quick in matter be very boldness of disguise said vernon emphatically be taken in at georgian hall bazaar le clever woman than miss hest must have made look utterly different to natural self a be scarcely changed look at save by wearing man dress painting cicatrice on face anyone must have said that supposed brother be sister dressed up such actually be case well know that everyone be taken in thousand pity colonel that miss hest did not apply splendid faculty to better purpose be undeniably very clever criminal genius a have often said when talked of spider must say that professor gail although admired talent be staggered when found out from paper that be renowned spider believe have fit however have now made up endless romantic story about actually got engagement with wife on strength of having known be ill wind blow one good if france hest have lived must have escaped hanging imprisonment colonel must have be engaged at music hall to appear at salary of hundred week age like romantic criminality think miss hest criminality be prosaic in extreme said colonel very drily must earn money honestly therefore took left handed path philanthropy be sham really believe that have bolly dam built le to supply village with water than to protect from arrest human life pooh thought nothing of human life be kind of female napoleon in way wrung dimsdale neck a though have be chicken moment found personal safety be in danger have not torn off mask thus recognised must have spared marvellously clever woman quite took in never expected to find spider in have not maunders escaped to betray must have believed that non existing francis be blackguard more must have got ten thousand pound from ida perhaps in america must have started on new career of roguery however recovered signed document cheque from body so nothing be said about matter in paper be glad for wife sake what became of bahadur bolted from country have never be heard of uncle hokar a know died after explosion mr bedge buried memory of constantine with bone think regard a martyr who be led astray by miss hest yet from lip of spider learned that be maunders who induced that very clever lady to become criminal do think maunders blackmailed aunt be quite capable of think miss hest did that to protect maunders from possible suspicion for one must think that man have anything to do with matter of spider who blackmailed adopted mother simply smart trick of miss hest vernon be have more champagne colonel thank more come along see wife have to meet lucy at swan edgar said vernon glancing at watch will go with there first then can have afternoon tea together right be colonel on condition that dine with lucy at hotel come to theatre afterwards towton nodded well ida be up in town for frolic so will come when do return to bowderstyke in two three day be seeing about re building of bolly dam be that dangerous asked vernon a left club be arranging for large channel to carry off water besides have not dam be blown up by indian beast catastrophe must not have taken place more question said sir arthur after pause think have enlightened on point will talk more of matter not in presence of wife at event said colonel bluffly stepping out smartly along pall mall when think of mystery devilish cantrips have have to do with how narrowly ida escaped dreadful death can only thank god that be happily married there be one small domestic animal if can be called so vernon on can never look without shudder what be asked sir arthur not following friend train of thought what sir what have forgotten past already oh vernon laughed somewhat seriously mean spider yes snapped colonel sharply mean spider end london ward lock co limited
