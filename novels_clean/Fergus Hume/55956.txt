draped in white gold with single triple silver candlestick glittering on side of tall brass cross vas also silver be filled with mixed ill chosen flower gathered anyhow arranged anyhow by mr jabber whose eye be anything artistic after breathing short prayer dorinda who have left rose on convenient seat took vas off altar out of church having shaken out flower brought crimson bloom into porch sat down on side seat to fulfil what be to very pleasant duty rupert arrived with can of water information obtained from mr jabber that mallien carrington have gone home expect father forgot to deliver

looked up in astonishment from task of brimming altar vas with spring water why must like in case well dorinda placed bunch of flower in vase put head on one side to note effect say that mr carrington be cynical like cynical people have have so much cynicism from father that be impossible to stand more of from person oh be only pose with carrington be really good fellow if be why ca show that be

carried with same imposing dignity dark hair deeply blue eye hinted at irish strain vivacity be also hibernian to fascination have to do with race of sister isle dorinda added much english common sense so that romantic dream never overrode matter of fact instinct loved cousin for staunch honesty attractive simplicity of character since in quality represented exact opposite of father for last mentioned individual whom have misfortune to call parent dorinda did not entertain much respect hoped by marrying rupert to escape from companionship be very disagreeable to be only hendle wealth induced mallien to consent to marriage even have objected dorinda must have held to engagement rupert be man of men while held hand looked at with grave admiration thought how fortunate be in securing mate esteemed devotion more than much fine gold father will be waiting for at cottage said dorinda a strolled away again little disappointment wo harm said hendle coolly for have not much sympathy

never be able to indulge fancy left widow with one son have taken post of housekeeper five year before carrington visit on whole performed duty admirably being disappointed in not leading idle life with sufficient money to gratify whim always went about with aggrieved air be only rupert kind heartedness permitted to stay at big house visitor carrington among wondered how must put up with wet

than sense of polite speech have reached already have opened manuscript diary at random with nose close to page be pouring over faded writing mr mallien growled a usual walked across to mantelpiece to pick up pipe for morning smoke when blue cloud made haze round eagerly reading parson mr mallien brought out handful of precious stone of little value from trouser pocket began to fiddle with after ordinary fashion strewed ruby emerald moonstone about table where shaft of sunlight struck across room watched many colored sparkle emitted by tiny gem leigh taking notice turned over page after page with great interest after long while grunted spoke maliciously anxious to spoil scholar pleasure if must dull stuff father wrote did dear mr mallien be there dull stuff oh dear most interesting maya building be quite fascinating manuscript discovered stone carving hieroglyphic similar to of egypt yes went on vicar dreamily must go there go there go to yucatan cried mallien staring old buffer like yes sir said vicar with dignity for quite year since mentioned diary of father have be in mind to fit out expedition to so interesting place how can fit out expedition on income money ah yes will require money of course jolly lot too expedition be not fitted out for nothing believe not murmured mr leigh again dipping into manuscript well well money will be forthcoming who will give to asked mallien contemptuously thought that rupert pooh might a well try get blood out of stone mr leigh why dickens must give money to go on wild goose chase rupert be wise man keep cash in pocket a 'd do if have income must not give money if have four thousand year asked vicar with extraordinarily keen look mallien stared quite unable to speak so indignant be at audacity of parson give to burst out 'd give to nobody ah then hope will never get money said mr leigh placidly must make bad use of must retorted gracious host if gave to to make duck drake of in expedition can be buried le expensively in england than in yucatan believe have idea of being buried anywhere said vicar with dignity yet with scared look puzzled mallien be old be true health be good live reasonable life must if went exploring yucatan retorted other must take risk of mr mallien place be so interesting nose be glued to manuscript again that really must raise money go have plan oh yes have plan to get wo from rupert from apparently said leigh who appeared to be much more alert than usual prefer rupert youth to avaricious age however will come again resume reading of manuscript unless will let take away will hing of kind help expedition said mallien grimly even give rubbish father wrote rubbish cried parson indignantly that diary be worth property john hendle left to son did love well well be case of pearl before swine paying back mallien in own coin by making remark vicar departed with shadow at heel old fool commented mallien wish john hendle have made that will chapter v revelation be with joy relief that dorinda communicated father decision to rupert be a pleased a be at prospect of speedy marriage hitherto mallien not wishing to make uncomfortable by losing housekeeper dorinda really be have always objected to performance of ceremony certainly gained five hundred year when two became one during twenty four month of official engagement fond parent have not be in particular want of money in case have always borrowed what small sum required from liberal minded cousin at interval now heart be set upon purchasing blue sapphire have mentioned to dorinda be not likely that rupert must give price of therefore to get new income assured allowed young couple to have own way also have good deal to do with granted permission really dreaded lest carrington must obtain influence over young squire thought that gaining of such must best be prevented by giving rupert desire with dorinda beside be unlikely that hendle must allow carrington to draw on purse seeing that miss mallien have small opinion of father spoke to pretty freely on subject of dispute between seemed strange that must have laid such stress on obtaining consent to marriage dorinda considering that father be father in spite of unamiable nature wished to exercise last act of paternal authority must not have be happy have provoked quarrel by going contrary to view so have waited until thought fit to issue command have mallien indeed wholly forbidden marriage taking place dorinda must have rebelled gave way on minor point of unusually long engagement saw rupert almost daily understood one thoroughly a be young there be particular hurry nevertheless girl be pleased at lordly permission of irritating parent set about preparation straightway be now july after conversation with rupert be decided that rev simon leigh must make man wife toward end of august dorinda confessed to future husband that must be glad to escape from constant society of father who of late have be unusually trying on side rupert be extremely glad to get dearest girl in world to so important matter be settled hendle returned to big house very contented with world in general with in particular in delight called in mr beatson to library to inform her of intended change of life although rather dreaded woeful look sad word with must receive communication mr beatson made appearance looking more like christian martyr than ever assumed most gracious lady like manner to hear what young master have to say greatly resembled that painfully well bred gentlewoman mr sparsit in dickens story like be housekeeper very much against will wish joy mr beatson said rupert gaily when martyr made sour appearance be going to be married so have understood for two year mr hendle quite so have be engaged to miss mallien for quite time be to be married toward end of next month indeed mr beatson looked dismayed be that rather sudden sudden rupert swung round chair looked puzzled how can be sudden after being engaged for twenty four month only mean mr hendle must have thought necessary for to consider matter carefully for six month before fixing day marriage mr hendle be serious matter be very delightful matter mr beatson considering who lady be ah mr beatson crossed hand cast up eye with melancholy expression so say until be married suppose mr hendle intend to give notice indeed intend to give nothing of sort said rupert bluffly difference will be that wife will give order instead of mr beatson looked a though must make very great difference indeed a much preferred to have master than mistress same looked relieved when learned that situation be not in danger be glad to stay on mr hendle said with air of making concession look on big house a in sense home be right continue to look upon a home until kit marries miss tollart go to live with pardon mr hendle said mr beatson with icy scorn little know nature when suggest thing approve of sophy tollart whose view regarding sex be anything pacific besides young people rarely take advice of who be older wiser than be consequently be best for to live by must like mr mallien to dwell at big house when wed with daughter good lord replied hendle hastily be last thing miss mallien must desire can manage own affair so think mr hendle mistake will make will be endless nonsense be not fool miss mallien have plenty of good sense sense be experience lamented mr beatson shaking head smiling in most dreary manner however be prophetess of evil wish miss mallien well mistake will make say what will sorrow will come to a come to there there croak more mr beatson croak repeated lady in surprise why be trying to look on bright side of thing for may say there be always black side well well observed rupert testily for word manner irritated usually steady nerve will wait see what happens never trouble trouble till trouble trouble be very good proverb annoy by speaking truth remarked good lady with superior smile ah be always way with young sir however have only to say word go want to go may not mr hendle miss mallien will not at be quite willing that must stay so say have doubt mr beatson groaned being quite sure in own mind that dorinda wished to turn out to die by wayside however be world of sorrow when be starved to death perhaps may be sorry for harsh treatment wait until harsh treatment take place retorted rupert who must have liked to shake into common sense meanwhile have told of intention to get married next month there be many slip between cup lip said mr beatson mysteriously le talked about be soonest forgotten after cryptic speech drifted toward door a if leg be taking in direction contrary to expressed by will rev mr leigh be in muniment room mr hendle said pausing on threshold expressed wish to see might ask to stay to dinner said rupert glancing at watch mr beatson departed firmly convinced that master really intended to dismiss have only broken ice with information about marriage so that might be prepared to be turned out to die with in mind hovered uneasily about dining room drawing room before after dinner in hope of catching stray word might reveal rupert expected treachery meanwhile rupert after hearty laugh at mr beatson cheerful manner of looking at future went upstairs to dress for dinner hang mr beatson thought when descended to drawing room do wish must keep dismals to herself be about a cheerful a tomb not at person to have in house of young married couple from mental speech may be guessed that dreary old lady be within ace of being dismissed a dreaded although such idea have never entered master mind until began wailing mr leigh who have brushed washed at mr beatson request for be dusty grimy after work in muniment room be wandering about big drawing room peering at picture statue old silver through pince nez turned to greet rupert in usual mild absent minded way when young squire smartly groomed eminently handsome entered quite greek murmured vicar balancing on toe with hand behind back must say that look be in favor rupert for well being of race must marry beget child well be going to said hendle used to vicar eccentric speech make dorinda wife next month oh indeed said mr leigh alertly dorinda be very desirable damsel hope will be happy seem to have doubt from tone use remarked rupert dryly mr leigh shook head life have trouble observed sententiously for heaven sake vicar croak have have enough of from mr beatson remark housekeeper hovering outside door overheard registered in mind a bad omen for future continuance at big house beg pardon went on squire rather ashamed of momentary irritability do wish people must look on marriage a marriage not a funeral of course of course ruminated mr leigh one be always sure of funeral though not of marriage vicar burst out young man much vexed at persistent lamentation be well linked arm in of mr leigh knowing be useless to argue be hungry there be gong be hungry mr leigh asked when be being conducted into dining room really believe be for three four hour have be busy in muniment room wonder grow tired of fumbling amongst dusty parchment be most interesting yet went on vicar a spread napkin across spare knee may have to postpone history of barship parish after until return from yucatan be yucatan rupert nodded to butler that must fill mr leigh glass with sherry for vicar be too absent minded to give order where be yucatan mr leigh devoted attention to soup then looked up dreamily yucatan repeated dear rupert geographical knowledge be limited never be particularly good scholar said squire apologetically be out of way place take be in central america be concerned with maya civilization oh now know what be talking about refer to diary of old frank mallien son have dorinda told that went occasionally to see at cousin cottage yes said mr leigh more wide awake than usual although have be many time for last year mallien always tell over again that be father manuscript when explored central america think that be wanting in common sense fancy let talk on rudely a doe talk rupert after diary be so interesting that mallien brusque manner be well worth putting up with for sake of acquiring information contains what doe contain asked rupert more for sake of promoting conversation than because cared account of dead gone civilization said vicar in dreamy tone scarcely knowing that fish have be placed before tomb city stone carving manuscript deposited with mummy yes there certainly must have be communication between yucatan egypt le plongue say dear forget what doe say however can see into matter for when go there go to yucatan to central america said hendle staring why at age be dangerous to attempt expedition mr leigh only caught last word expedition yes will be costly a mallien in rude way observed have arranged how to get money rupert thousand pound perhaps more really be not sure what will cost can arrange sum later rupert stared harder than ever said leigh placidly after be glad have money not mallien a be more likely to do what want than be dour man grasping avaricious rupert glanced at butler footman quite understand said in puzzled way perhaps will explain in turn leigh following hendle eye glanced at servant when be alone can tell about over coffee more bewildered than ever in vague way sensing danger rupert must have asked for explanation servant being present decided to wait until be alone with erratic friend therefore conversation passed on to other subject connected with mr leigh discovery in muniment room of various document connected with behavior of dead buried hendles toward parish rupert said very little what with mr beatson gloom vicar cryptic utterance felt a though storm be approaching be anxious for meal to end so that must go to root of matter same laughed at for entertaining wild fancy there be quarter of heaven from storm big little must blow a be serene bright a hendle happened to be one of very material person who only believe in what can be seen heard touched scouted idea of premonition heralding possible evil yet premonition be in consciousness sure enough young man prosaic a ever put down to indigestion weaker explanation considering splendid health can scarcely be imagined when dinner be over mr leigh who have contented with single glass of port wine to round off entertainment rose more briskly than usual announced wish to go must not mind speedy departure rupert said slipping pince nez into waistcoat pocket have much work to do in connection with proposed expedition hope titus ark be waiting to accompany home told to call for about past six ark be waiting in kitchen said rupert after quiet word with pompous butler came at six have stayed on there be hurry for to go mr leigh remember have something to tell hendle taking old man arm led gently firmly into drawing room something to tell repeated vicar puzzled then suddenly face cleared oh dear yes how fortunate reminded rupert have to do with john hendle john hendle do mean great great grandfather who died in waterloo year yes do when be alone mr leigh broke off glanced meaningly at footman who be bringing in coffee be lucky reminded ended aimlessly very lucky expedition ah yes hang on on what on earth be talking about questioned hendle much vexed at unnecessary mystery sit down drink coffee tell about smoke know will certainly certainly murmured leigh vaguely of course marriage with cousin will bring together two branch of family in long run will put thing right put what thing right money matter hendle echoed word stared wish must talk plainly said with irritation oh certainly be rather apt to wander in worldly matter leigh cleared throat sat up briskly with wit about for once in dreamy life mallien be descended from walter hendle from frederick father john being common ancestor yes be so mallien descends through female line although be elder branch of family there be entail no if there be must be in favor a descend through male heir what doe mean will tell if will allow to collect thought while searching in muniment room rupert came across letter of john hendle show that loved elder son walter greatly disliked younger son frederick walter be brave man who fought for country who died at waterloo frederick a letter say be scamp what in day be known a blood reckless extravagant evil alienated father affection john hendle desired to disinherit be first time have heard of frederick iniquity said rupert with shrug see little use in raking up evil done by man who lived about one hundred year ago leigh took notice of observation john desired that granddaughter eunice child of favorite son walter must inherit a property be entirely at own disposal made will in favor rupert jumped up so suddenly that upset coffee what pray act in so excitable manner rupert protested vicar raising thin hand irritate nerve what say oh be absurd stammered squire there be never question about frederick inheriting property know much about matter a thing did interest if frederick inherited wrongly surely question must have be raised before how must be when will in favor of eunice be missing missing yes john made will apparently died suddenly before must make public found said mr leigh slowly in chest in muniment room yes be will drawn up quite legally on parchment a be case in day although think will be drawn up now on oh never mind minor point broke in rupert hastily say that found will made by john hendle leaving property to eunice from whom cousin mallien be descended did week ago came across document did not say anything until ascertained for a to of two be right person to have money be inclined to think that have better keep rupert since mallien be so avaricious will not help anyone not even when desire money for expedition to forward cause of science if will be in order said rupert rising to pace long room feeling painfully agitated mallien must have property fear so fear so murmured vicar uncomfortably same leaf property unreservedly to grandmother eunice have not told mallien who must undoubtedly contest right to estate a consider fit proper person to have much money right be right said hendle whose face be pale whose lip be dry if mallien be rightful heir must be placed in possession may be mistake on part where be will mr leigh looked nervous distressed dear rupert be afraid have mislaid took home to study at convenience so a to make sure that really gave property to eunice did examine became quite positive that mallien be rightful heir then somehow know how absent minded be laid aside since have not be able to find have searched without result must have given to at once said hendle severely dear boy have interest at heart protested vicar wiping forehead know how quixotic be guessed that must give property to mallien without demur if will be correct fear be for own sake took time to consider discovery have made must find will at once commanded rupert manfully must be submitted to lawyer if mallien be heir mallien get money mr leigh rose much agitated think must get rupert be greedy man who must only hoard up gold make bad use of newly acquired wealth tell declined to help to fit out expedition know will so ought to keep money how can advise to be so dishonest cried squire indignantly who be clergyman of church of england have greater sense of right from being so rejoined vicar quite tartly for so amiable man when remember that yours have enjoyed property for one hundred year seems ridiculous to hand over to man who belongs to elder branch remember said rupert swiftly who be according to reading of newly discovered will rightful heir took turn up down room then stopped to face vicar who be fidgeting on hearth rug must turn house upside down to find will mr leigh must be handed over to family lawyer so that mallien may be placed in possession of property forthwith rupert implore not to act hastily foolishly say nothing about belated testament will do mallien more harm than good considering greedy misanthropic nature will look for will give to throw into chest again must never have moment peace if did that know mallien be not man to have too much money ca help that if be rightful heir must enter into kingdom besides if marry dorinda property will come back to representing younger branch if mallien get property said mr leigh deliberately will not allow to marry dorinda can trust said rupert curtly quite so will have money to marry mallien will cut off with shilling be quite capable of doing so hendle knew well enough reflected for few moment say nothing to mallien to anyone remarked finally until find will can look over together oh will certainly hold tongue said vicar quickly believe be only esteem for make urge not to notice will sleep on question rupert for morning be wiser than night matter will remain strictly between ourselves now good night good night hendle shook hand not objecting to vicar abrupt departure when alone groaned over unexpected fulfilment of premonition chapter vi counsel opinion when hendle having weight on mind woke shortly after dawn remembered vicar proverb thought that might be true morning certainly be wiser than night with a began to ask why must be so much disturbed over unproven matter leigh certainly asserted positively that have found hundred year old will made in favor of elder branch of hendle family undoubtedly spoke in way appeared to be genuine then vicar be queer eccentric person who sometimes believed vision to be fact who have on occasion difficulty in distinguishing between real unreal in perfectly honest way might be making mistake rupert turning over matter before rising hoped fervently that such might prove to be case on other hand unless mr leigh statement have foundation in fact seemed improbable that must even think of thing there have never be question a to legitimacy of hendle holding property after whole century have elapsed seemed strange that odd question must be raised assuredly vicar must have found something have to do with inheritance of estate by elder branch else fantastic idea must not have entered rather wavering mind will might not be good in law might have be signed not witnessed there might be flaw in drawing up must nullify provision if be case rupert be far too sensible to think of surrendering land income to man who on face of must make bad use of same on other hand if will be quite in order squire be honest enough to step down from throne allow rightful king to take seat thereon evil a might prove to be rule whole question of right wrong turned on production of will having reached point in meditation rupert arose cleared brain by cold bath must be foolish to say that be not worried for felt very much upset a be natural seeing there be chance of being reduced to condition of pauper mallien be not rich have enough to live on so acquisition of more money must only result in greater extravagance in purchase of jewel if will proved to be legal hendle foresaw that squire of barship must be turned out of pleasant home without single penny without mean of earning one have profession have trade be not over clever mallien be sure of must not allow anything out of estate be uncomfortable enough in for young man who liked good thing of life there be worse to follow must lose dorinda since father must undoubtedly prevent marriage with pauper girl a rupert have said to vicar must remain true how must ask to become wife when must not support much le helpmate be very painful very disagreeable rupert descended to breakfast with bad appetite look at well mr hendle remarked mr beatson when came for order after breakfast perhaps be sickening for fever not at replied master more crossly than be accustomed to speak to dismal woman have have wakeful night be ah well sir be natural considering be going to take serious step a marriage without thinking about rupert allowed mr beatson certain amount of latitude here overstepped mark passed over observation in silence gave order for day will have dinner at eight remarked having arranged matter a be going to town will not be back until late going to see lawyer suppose sir mentioned housekeeper with odd look on dreary face rupert looked up suddenly wondering why have made pertinent observation for be in mind to do what have suggested why do suppose that mr beatson well sir be only natural a doubt there be marriage settlement to be prepared must be in order for ceremony mr beatson said glibly enough reason appeared to be very plausible nevertheless glance be so significant that hendle wondered if have guessed trouble seemed to be incredible since leigh have promised to hold tongue until matter be properly threshed out yet there be certain malicious triumph lurking in housekeeper look hinted that be rejoicing at approaching downfall after swift reflection rupert thought that be mistaken be in position of man who see bird in bush therefore ignored mr beatson remark merely repeated that must return late to dine woman hesitated for moment a if wished to speak more plainly then tossed head glided out in ghostly way rupert frowned for behavior made uncomfortable yet be impossible that must know anything of thunderbolt have struck after a squire reflected when started to walk to railway station thunderbolt have not yet reached mark might not reach at only examination of will must prove if be rich man pauper in anxiety to learn hendle called in at vicarage a passed rickety gate strange to say mr leigh proved to be absent a have gone to see dying parishioner be only short walk to little wayside station at london train stopped occasionally during day rupert caught ten o'clock train easily although be very full managed to secure compartment to here when engine started gave up to meditation not a may be guessed of most pleasant kind hendle a mr beatson ignorantly knowingly have suggested really intended to consult lawyer before going to family solicitor thought that must ask opinion of counsel in person of carrington a struck that there might be statute of limitation in connection with long lost will even if there be rupert knew in own heart that if mallien proved to be rightful owner of property present owner must never be able to take advantage of law quibble depended on will for if not produced must not be required even by own uneasy conscience to surrender house income wondered if leigh have lost will forever in case thing must remain a be wondered if there be will at if there be whether vicar might not have made mistake wondered if will be found if must be shipshape so a to deprive of kingdom indeed hendle wondered in more le worried way throughout journey to town stepped out onto platform of liverpool street station in anything happy frame of mind carrington have envied wealth quiet existence be anything quiet now wealth if vicar proved to be correct be about to take wing to fly away into mallien gaping pocket in dismal frame of mind rupert took taxi to friar inn be in set of tall building that carrington have chamber for business purpose hendle said barrister when visitor be ushered into bare room sparsely furnished looking very businesslike be surprise how be old chap not up to much from look of be bothered out of life replied hendle taking cane chair most uncomfortable one be pointed out to oh think there be sufficient life left in to stand trifle more strain be carrington flippant observation a resumed seat at very businesslike desk ca guess in way what can bother one wearer know where shoe pinch quoted hendle grimly quite so one ever will know unless wearer explains bad fit friend bothered with beef land money promise of beautiful desirable damsel to be wife be just said visitor seizing opening may lose thing carrington barrister wheeled chair round to stare keen dark face be alive with curiosity have be outrunning constable asked have lady changed mind have be wide of mark to put matter in nutshell be will will what about much exists may disinherit deuce in whose favor in favor of julius mallien cousin then will have right if have leg to stand on said carrington grimly mallien struck a man who must go through fire water for why did father make will in favor did not will be made one hundred year ago by john hendle from whom mallien be descended one hundred year ago echoed barrister puzzled then how come have to do with now leigh found in muniment room confound zeal still quite understand perhaps will tell whole story from beginning suppose have come to ask advice a friend yes a barrister best forensic lore be at disposal well hendle at once began explanation a proceeded became much too restless to remain seated midway in recital started to foot began to pace narrow limit of office shading eye with hand drawing figure on blotting paper carrington listened to rather amazing story of leigh discovery when in possession of fact looked rather skeptical understand that have not seen will no leigh a be natural with so untidy man have mislaid then how do know will exists leigh say so humph carrington threw down pencil leaned back with doubtful look think vicar wit must be wool gathering have enmity against suppose enmity hendle stopped in walk stared mean be friend oh yes leigh be great friend attitude toward mallien doe like overmuch mallien be so rude to to everyone finished carrington with shrug most disagreeable person well a leigh like doe like cousin take must not have invented story to do out of property in mallien favor leigh be best of good fellow though rather eccentric must have found will be impossible that must have suggested existence otherwise suppose not murmured carrington vaguely then glanced shrewdly at client doe know family history everyone in barship know replied hendle dropping again into chair with sigh there be nothing to know really a have always be dull homely lot of people tell how descent run from john hendle in direct male line frederick son henry grandson charles great grandson great great grandson mallien descent come in female line from walter eldest son of john hendle eunice daughter of walter granddaughter of john married george filbert mr filbert have daughter anne who married frank mallien son be julius cousin who have a know daughter dorinda to whom be engaged commented carrington that marriage will bring elder younger branch of family together very good arrangement will julius marry again think so hate woman must think single member of sex returned compliment what mean be that when marry miss mallien money will come to when father dy must a two represent elder younger branch of family joined a observed mallien be quite capable of leaving money elsewhere out of devilment tolerates because lend money have very little affection for dorinda be to marry next month because have promised mallien five hundred year when make dorinda wife be now in hurry for money added rupert anxiously if knew that be rightful heir must forbid marriage be probable must since have sweet nature said carrington dryly must miss mallien obey love too well for of course if lose property be reduced to pauperism pure simple must scarcely ask girl to share nothing barrister nodded sympathetically be beastly position said after pause especially a have be brought up to earn own living in way of course be building on sand nobody weird parson have seen will so may not exist see why leigh must think of thing if will doe not exist said rupert impatiently true enough well let grant that will doe exist leaf property to eunice filbert from whom mallien trace descent still possession be nine point of law lot have held property for close upon one hundred year there be statute of limitation oh rupert looked up eagerly have idea that there might be then if take meaning correctly since will have only be found after so long period statute operates against being legal well might operate might not depends upon circumstance of case mostly statute of limitation must operate will be never filed in probate court take until leigh found expect one maker witness knew of existence be dead age ago thought will be filed at somerset house now be in be filed at probate court at canterbury well said hendle restlessly question be what be to do well obviously first thing be to get possession of will in way learn exactly how thing stand with regard to mallien john hendle may not have cut off second son frederick entirely may not assented rupert dubiously on other hand may leigh certainly gave to understand that everything have be left to eunice who afterward married filbert if such be case may be sure that mallien will take everything will decline to give penny just like statute of limitation will not take advantage of interrupted hendle firmly if will doe make mallien heir by descent will have property dear man cried barrister starting to foot be quixotic why leave without penny especially when mallien be such unamiable person be hard grant replied rupert ruefully yet a honest man what else can do seems to that there be limit to honesty said carrington tartly scarcely think must act so quixotically if have to do with matter however can discus point when will be in possession can make sure that what leigh say be true when do hope to get well know leigh said that have mislaid must search for so have called morning on chance that might have found be absent attending to dying woman of course must interrupt at business left message must call again when returned evening when do return by seven o'clock train will arrive in time for dinner told mr beatson must dine at eight if leigh find will presume will bring to evening at big house might might not in case will call carrington considered remark for few moment stared out of window at chimney pot think must call if be hendle said at length why not because case need more careful handling than be able to give friend leave leigh alone until to morrow will come down time about midday to interview vicar along with be very good of carrington said perplexed squire gratefully expect one night will make difference a will be certain of bad news soon enough will wait until can go with to morrow to vicarage perhaps by then leigh will have found will leave vicarage until have found said carrington grimly be too important document to be left in hand of shiftless creature such a leigh be quite capable of taking to mallien if be in favor of mallien grandmother a asserts hendle standing up to go away shook head think will go past remarked slowly in first place dislike mallien because of mallien brusque manner in second mallien refused out of present income to help to fit out expedition to yucatan central america why doe vicar want to go there oh be be reading diary of mallien father describing certain research amongst buried city in wild want to go there look up thing for dare say if finance expedition leigh will say nothing about will be if have already said nothing to anyone said carrington told that have not save one know about leigh discovery be just a well that mallien doe know ended rupert with shrug must tear down vicarage rob to get testament must make rich man well think weak old buffer like leigh must put up much fight handle well advice be for to hold tongue refrain from seeing leigh until to morrow afternoon then can tackle together buck up face music old chap added barrister clapping friend on back after thing may prove to be false alarm place much reliance on dreaming parson do answered rupert a took leave in case fancy there must be fire to account for smoke leigh must not have invented will doe not exist well then good bye will see to morrow at one o'clock thereabouts anyhow before two meanwhile see anyone particularly not miss mallien be sure to spot dismals if begin to question may give away rupert halted on threshold hesitating for while finally promised not to see dorinda then a there be nothing else to be done went to matine of successful play to distract mind returned a have arranged in time for eight o'clock dinner after meal spent very dull evening reading newspaper playing patience for promise to carrington must have walked to cottage to see dorinda sorely felt want of society at crisis however saw wisdom of barrister advice not to acquaint with trouble until more be ascertained for certain lest by arousing mallien suspicion that gentleman might learn too much mallien be very quick a rule to guess that something be being kept from so rupert possessed soul in patience retired to bed early after somewhat restless night descended to breakfast to find ill news travel fast be mr beatson who conveyed especial information did so with delight always anxious to pas on news of disaster oh mr hendle cried bursting into breakfast room without knocking terrible thing have happened mr leigh be dead mr leigh have be murdered chapter vii nine day wonder information concerning vicar violent death be so extraordinary so wholly unexpected that rupert must not believe to be entirely true however mr beatson tempestuous announcement spoiled breakfast leaving meal unfinished squire hurried down to village here everything be in state of commotion a be rarely that so untoward event disturbed placidity of barship one from flying rumor hendle gathered during progress appeared to be acquainted with exact fact of case said that mr leigh have committed suicide others that burglar surprised at midnight have struck blow while few declared that vicar be only wounded must recover when hendle reached untidy house learned from tearful mr jabber that information be only too true mr leigh with nasty ragged wound on right temple have be found dead in study at seven o'clock in morning kensit village constable be already on premise looking into matter along with dr tollart two seemed have arrived simultaneously kensit having picked up doctor on road must have knocked down with feather when two walked in wailed mr jabber who be rag tear expecting to be taken to jail straight off though being a may guess sir a innocent a new born infant ten o'clock be hour a jabber went to bed a can take alfred davit in court of lawr never sound whisper did hear being heavy sleeper when come with duster broom into library to clean for day there see that blessed man lying on floor under writing table bleeding like pig face downward a may think sir went white felt inwards quaking a said to jabber when took someat strong later to keep leg from giving way hollered jabber come to see if be in fit then say 'this be murder ' run out to shriek for perlice be here with dr tollart hardly sober if can believe sir be bible truth of whole thing a 'd swear on mother corpse though be be angel many year what 'ull happen to jabber ended good lady dissolving in many tear be more than can say having gift in prophet considering prolixity mr jabber account be fairly clear chubby policeman be inclined to believe that spoke truth informed squire that have already sent to tarhaven for inspector that dr tollart be examining body with view to learning exact cause of death though to be sure sir be hard to see said kensit who be of more chatty disposition than position warranted there be knock on head a 'ud kill navvy much le delicate gentleman a know mr leigh always be be struck down by loaded cane bludgeon unexpected like if experience go for anything who on earth must have murdered kensit asked rupert greatly puzzled mr leigh be such harmless man have enemy p'raps burglar sir suggested constable wisely who must commit burglary here said rupert looking round entrance hall where be standing there be nothing to carry off except book man must risk rope round neck for such antique rubbish true enough mr hendle knowing that have nothing worth stealing mr leigh never bothered to lock up house at night there be catch to speak of on window bolt of door ai up to much anyone must walk in walk out at time without trouble a did oh then think that assassin be man well sir suppose female must come along assaulting people with blow on back of head to be sure there be miss sophy tollart who be suffragist mused constable mr leigh never argued with over vote for woman a have ever heard in spite of seriousness of case hendle must not help smiling think can acquit miss tollart kensit observed militant suffragist destroys property not human being ah here be doctor well tollart emerged into hall a squire spoke did not seem to be over eager to reply be tall bulky man with large red perspiring face eye like poached egg loose mouth suggestive of hard drinker a mr jabber have hinted have already have morning dram wit seemed to be muddled not at man a rupert thought with disgust to examine murdered fellow mortal remains whew be hot hendle remarked mopping streaming face with dingy handkerchief that in there jerked head toward study will have to be buried pretty smart wo keep long sooner be under ground better wo be put under ground said kensit smartly leigh have family vault know doctor well well vault grave weather too hot to keep thing sweet be tollart unpleasant reply nice business be hendle always thought that old man must be knocked on head why asked squire kensit looked same question why tollart leaned against pile of book near wall a constant nipping made shaky on ponderous leg why because never locked up house stand away from village in quite lonely fashion anyone must break in here rather walk in a leigh never bothered about bolt bar there be nothing to guard tollart think be worth burglar while to risk neck for nothing man who downed leigh be of different opinion said tollart grimly do think burglar killed sir asked kensit anxiously who else mr jabber say that there be nothing missing be there how doe know anyhow paper book be turned topsy turvy burglar have good hunt for loot anyhow room be rather in mess observed kensit thoughtfully always be in mess said rupert with shrug when did death take place doctor judging from condition of corpse must say at eleven o'clock last night hendle did see stranger about village when be on round last night kensit not soul sir at eleven o'clock kensit reflected for moment be at other end of village when passed vicarage about ten there be one to be seen nothing suspicious visible gate be open a usual door expect be simply jammed to a usually be mr jabber saw vicar last just before went to bed with husband at ten o'clock left busy at writing book a usual suppose blow on head killed sir partly be blow on head partly heart disease mumbled tollart staring at two men with glazed eye leigh never be very strong always told to take care of heart never knew be weak observed rupert must not have thought so a be contemplating expedition to central america sheer madness muttered tollart however be gone on longer journey now hendle kensit when be inspector coming expect here moment sir well sooner come better a corpse must be screwed down without delay have inquest afternoon if can will be mere formality a cause of death be apparent enough there wo want here now will be at home at one if inspector from tarhaven want kensit meanwhile be off to get drink thirsty weather doctor stumbled away in hurry to get beer think weather make much difference to doctor thirst sir said kensit disapprovingly chubby face looked severe however ai of business mr hendle will excuse sir will go see that one enters that library nothing must be touched until inspector see room have idea a to who killed mr leigh sir not least idea replied rupert lingering at hall door saw vicar night before last when dined with yesterday morning called to see on way to london so mr jabber said said also sir that said 'd call in evening did did not rupert hesitated for kensit be looking at keenly really have very much to say to intended to call morning do know if expected visitor sir made mention to of expecting then be burglar declared kensit positively hendle shrugged shoulder see what there be to steal replied carelessly then went away after leaving message that must like to interview tarhaven inspector when be at leisure there be crowd round rickety gate now closed for first time for many year policeman summoned by kensit from neighboring village be on guard must not allow anyone to enter saluted rupert a passed out young man mechanically touched hat in response down road came suddenly upon old titus ark who be ruminating against stone wall looking more prehistoric than ever ancient grunted a young squire sauntered along thoughtfully in blazing sunshine raised gnarled hand to battered hat considering that be be bodyguard who followed everywhere like dog hendle expected to find old man tearful with weakness of age titus be smiling in way showed toothless gum piped out ordinary greeting quite oblivious of tremendous event be disturbing village morning squoire said ark with usual grunt fine weather fur crop du think hor hor hor rupert stopped to rebuke levity know that mr leigh be dead oh no bai dead said ancient easily knock on head settle such a nonsense man why vicar be extremely weak mere tap must settle be talking about about muster leigh hor hor hor ai dead have seen dead afore nivir come way fur berryin squoire will come way time titus be afraid replied rupert wondering why old man be so stubborn surmised that a leigh according to doctor have heart disease must have fainted at time in ark presence must account for sexton saying have seen dead suppose know who murdered bai murdered squoire then know who struck said hendle amending question naw muster leigh said good bye to last night at six when left mussus patten who be datter be taken turn for better be glad to hear titus did mr leigh say if expected visitor last night naw said ancient again niwer told naught to squoire can ask when come aloive again plainly ark declined to believe that lifelong friend be dead seemed useless to impress with undoubted fact complained that policeman must not allow to enter vicarage that one must take notice of protestation that leigh be not dead rupert although in hurry to return to unfinished breakfast stayed to persuade titus to take more reasonable view of situation dr tollart say that mr leigh have passed away besides knock on head have heart disease one other be enough to kill dr tollart grunted ark stolidly be better wi beer than wi curing folk nivir heard tell a muster leigh have heart badness be aloive tell ee squoire well titus have own way will be duty within couple of day if not le seeing that weather be hot to put late vicar in family vault oh will put there squoire bai dead fur hor hor hor with shrug rupert passed on returned to big house to find dorinda greeted hastily appeared to be very dismayed at dreadful news of vicar murder who must have hurt rupert asked again again have enemy must not have harmed fly be sure ca tell dear kensit seems to think that be burglar did trick there be nothing in vicarage to rob protested dorinda just what say however burglar from london might have believed leigh be miser have treasure have stranger from london be seen about village kensit ca make head tail of rupert shook head thought for moment unless very startling evidence turn up dorinda believe that truth will ever become known what doe father say dear nothing know father did not care much for mr leigh told that be sorry leigh be fool must have locked up house regularly night father have much sympathy dorinda never have know how badly think of everyone what be to be done about murder rupert inspector from tarhaven be coming to day will arrange for inquest afternoon to morrow upon what evidence be obtainable will depend next step expect body dorinda quivered turned pale will be buried almost immediately why keep body week sometimes in case tollart say that sooner poor leigh be buried better corpse rupert hesitated wo keep oh dorinda made wry face poor mr leigh be such good man rupert who inherits book be have left think there be distant cousin of sort ship captain wo benefit much by leigh death wonder if old man made will oh yes told year ago that have did not mention to whom have left library be executor be indeed be news to a leigh never asked permission however hendle be thinking of probability of ancestor will being among paper book be just a well under circumstance what do mean by hendle tugged at moustache replied in embarrassed fashion oh nothing only can look after thing better than stranger know by way dorinda forgot to tell that carrington be coming down by midday train coming again so soon said dorinda remembering father warning against barrister why only about business went up to town about yesterday answered rupert confusedly will walk with to station to meet said girl promptly want to meet mr carrington again like overmuch ah have be listening to father dear mallien like one saw mr carrington rupert did like require father to judge for what spitfire be laughed hendle putting arm round waist because want to think mr carrington be not good friend for jealous sensible there rupert worry slipped out of arm much to surprise showed feeling so visibly that colored be rather out of sort morning said hurriedly father have be rather trying never mind dear in month will be with forever hope so sighed dorinda somehow death of vicar suggests to possibility that something will occur to prevent marriage oh nonsense rupert stared what must prevent marriage be only feeling persisted dorinda dare say be foolish silly feeling be here for laid hand on heart rupert took a much pain to argue away fancy a have done to argue away fancy of titus ark dorinda be quite a stubborn in belief that evil fortune be coming to prevent marriage a sexton be that leigh be alive finally because rupert laughed at parted from rather irritated at corner where branched off to station road must not even look back when lover went away rupert walked on to meet carrington with reflection that woman be kittle cattle a scotch say a rule dorinda be amiable calm so seemed strange that must be so easily annoyed morning there be reasonable excuse after a hendle concluded since girl always having be markedly friendly with vicar poor man violent death naturally shocked upset greatly moreover heartless comment mallien cynic be more than likely to make assuredly must add to dorinda distress by time reached station rupert have explained away to own satisfaction unusual emotion of girl true to promise carrington arrived by midday train hopped out onto platform a lively a cricket in gray flannel straw hat brown shoe barrister looked handsome well bred very much alive sight of keen face intelligent dark eye comforted hendle a knew that carrington if anyone must be helpful in matter of vicar mysterious murder here be here be hendle cried new arrival briskly a gave up ticket walked out of station along with squire say old chap be worrying considerably over will business there be drawn tired look on face show that have slept wink well did have particularly restful night admitted other with sigh have happened morning doe help to make feel happier carrington eh what barrister stopped then leigh have found will leigh be dead hendle informed abruptly dead carrington stared dead what be talking about about what have happened replied other heavily leigh be found dead in study morning carrington looked at hendle doubtfully be pulling leg said in disbelieving tone pull people leg over serious matter tell positively that vicar be dead village be in commotion dead repeated carrington once more a moved on toward barship unexpected have happened with vengeance well well be young looked like delicate man who must pop off at moment death have nothing to do with delicacy carrington leigh have be murdered oh lord man of world a be carrington received shock poor old chap murdered what beastly thing to happen who murdered one know police be looking into matter now be found dead in study at seven morning there be wound on right temple so far only conclusion arrived at be that one tried to rob house being discovered struck leigh down ca see that there be anything in house worth burglar committing crime for remarked carrington taking off hat there be one in village must have attempted burglary since leigh be known to be very poor besides leigh be too popular for anyone to hurt stranger ah broke in carrington swiftly stranger have stranger be seen hovering about vicarage kensit village policeman be on round a usual last night declares that saw one tramp tramp have be hanging about village of late carrington looked puzzled seems to be mystery at what time be poor chap murdered one know dr tollart think blow be struck about eleven o'clock last night have weapon be found did that housekeeper hear noise nothing be known of murder until found master dead near writing table inspector have be sent for to tarhaven will be here shortly indeed expect be here now will take charge of house look into matter humph remarked barrister thoughtfully a said before seems to be mystery inspector will take charge of leigh book paper suppose yes why not oh be not saying against handling will will yes ca see hendle if inspector look through paper left by leigh probably will be bound to come across hundred year old testament mentioned yesterday rupert winced expect will unless poor leigh have so carefully mislaid that can not be found what if doe well then fat will be on fire said carrington with air of finality suppose mean that will must be made public why not if be legitimate document mallien must get money if be position remains unchanged in case whether leigh lived died what discovered must have to be shown round quite so did want to be shown round until looked into matter privately along with argued carrington quickly true enough must like to have seen document before mallien became aware that existed however a thing stand will be bound to be found be bound to know must thresh out matter openly straightway will do best to avoid trouble see how can avoid hendle mallien be not man to let chance of getting fortune go be sure be retorted squire positively be certain to make thing a disagreeable for a possible if surrender property must will prove to be legal see that can worry will lose everything warned barrister significantly unfortunately yes including miss mallien suppose so admitted squire reluctantly even if remains true to a be sure will ca ask to marry on nothing year there be silence for few minute a two men walked into village be carrington who spoke first be awfully sorry for old man be rather sorry for however what must be must be so there be more to be said by way dorinda told that leigh have made executor never knew that have until told leigh took friendship for granted seems who inherits know sole relative be sea captain somewhere in australia have heard speak of young fellow cousin of sort a last of leigh there be much to leave in way of property so be executor murmured carrington thoughtfully in case will have handling of paper may be able to get possession of will before inspector lay hand on what good will do asked hendle irritably can suppress will must think of doing such thing will lose if will prof to be genuine carrington warned then must lose be quixotic so said yesterday mean to be honest again there be silence carrington secretly considering friend honorable as chapter viii mallien speaks anxious to help rupert at friend request carrington remained at big house until inquest be over burial of murdered man took place squire must do little save watch course of event a of wished to say anything about missing will must suggest reason why crime must have be committed indeed police be equally unable to solve problem since murder on face of appeared to be purposeless assassin must not be discovered inspector lawson of tarhaven did best to find clue from first to last be unsuccessful did not even know where to look for one when inquest be held have absolutely evidence to place before coroner jury leigh murderer have come out of night have gone into night why have come to commit so dastardly crime whither have gone after achieving aim be wholly impossible to say affair be unpleasant mysterious uncanny pursuant to opinion of dr tollart proceeding in connection with death be hurried on a speedily a possible weather be certainly amazingly hot a for week powerful sun have be blazing in cloudless blue sky garden glowed with many colored flower growing crop be parched for want of rain everywhere in district people be complaining of shortage of water under circumstance because nothing relevant to assassin must be discovered tollart advice seemed to be very sensible therefore inquest be held at hendle arm on day after mr jabber have discovered master corpse on same afternoon body be placed in family vault of leigh trouble have happened so suddenly proceeding have be carried through so swiftly that everything in connection therewith be over done with before people have time to wholly realize what have taken place with regard to inquest that necessary function be dispatched very quickly there be little to be done little to be said a new detail be forthcoming concerning dreadful event jury inspected body at vicarage then went on to hendle arm to hear what must be said about matter several reporter from london journal be present interest in case be more local than general a there be nothing in likely to cause sensation general opinion be that burglar have entered ill guarded vicarage that parson have be struck down while trying to capture thief a nothing be missing from house many scouted idea ascribed death to deeper cause what that cause might be minority be unable to say did evidence procurable tend to lighten darkness shrouded crime mr jabber more respectably dressed than usual even more voluble gave evidence with many tear sigh old woman have be deeply attached to vicar must not understand why must have met with so terrible unexpected death deposed to going to bed at ten o'clock a usual after taking into study glass of milk for master there left a happy a trout in pond cried mr jabber with tear running down face busy with book a usual enjoying more after having be to see mr patter a be glad to say be getting better though be more deserves being such gossip here witness be checked by coroner on ground that be dealing with matter irrelevant to inquiry did mr leigh expect anyone to visit on night lord bless sir if did must have mentioned to retired at ten o'clock jabber yes sir being tired with heat day work saw nothing of mr leigh until seven next morning not even nose of sir heard noise being heavy sleeper a jabber be although snore say what like in fact mr jabber statement did nothing to solve mystery admitted that bolt bar at vicarage be not what must be considering lonely position of house lord bless sir there ai never be trouble with thief robber nohow a there be anything to tempt then think that burglar sir there be nothing missing mr jabber stuck to tale what said be corroborated by husband meek trembling little man wholly dominated by stronger minded wife have gone to bed at ten o'clock have heard nothing during night likely to arouse suspicion first news have of murder be from wife when stumbled on dead body at seven in morning then went told kensit about finished mr jabber with very white face evidently afraid lest must be accused of committing crime tollart who be just a red faced much more sober than usual stated that have be called in by village constable within hour after body have be discovered mr leigh have be struck on right temple by heavy instrument probably bludgeon blow taken in connection with weak heart must have caused death instantaneously certificate of death be worded to effect leigh be patient of have never be very strong added to mode of life have weakened considerably on whole shabby disreputable doctor knowing that eye of little world be on gave evidence very clearly resolutely so that created good impression there be question a to cause of death after tollart statement even though coupling of heart disease blow seemed rather muddled one in village have expected leigh to live to considerable age owing to delicate appearance so be quite certain that violent assault have killed must have be wonder to many have survived blow for very apparent reason hendle be called that must say brought nothing to light related how leigh have dined with how have called at vicarage next day while on way to london so far a witness knew leigh be in good health spirit announcement of death came a shock to finished rupert have enemy questioned coroner not to knowledge more amiable man never existed do know anything of past life only that have be vicar here ever since be child be devoted to book to archology with exception of parishioner mr mallien daughter think ever saw anyone be wholly wrapped up in book then there be nothing in past life suggests reason why crime must have be committed certainly not so far a know inspector lawson kensit village policeman gave what sparse evidence must latter declared that while on round on night of murder have met no one have seen nothing suspicious when passed gate of vicarage at hour when crime be said by dr tollart to have be committed witness be on other side of village lawson deposed that weapon have be found that evidence of intruder have be discovered understood that study be in state of disorder said coroner gather from many source that study be always in state of disorder retorted inspector kensit recalled said that did not think that study be even more untidy than usual everything be turned upside down book paper just a if one have be searching for something declared witness then think that murderer killed vicar then looked about to find something wished to get for possession of committed crime kensit hesitated be not prepared to go far remarked after pause can say be gained such impression when speech be made rupert glanced at carrington carrington looked at rupert same idea struck simultaneously that murderer might have be searching for will of john hendle then existence of document be known only to dead man to barrister to squire rupert have be fast asleep when crime be committed carrington have be in london so of course of two must have have anything to do with matter still seemed strange that book paper of deceased must have be messed up if search have not be made for will in question for what have mysterious murderer be looking question young men asked asked other when inquest be over came to end very speedily coroner must only direct attention of jury to fact laid before did not offer opinion a indeed must not jury brought in verdict of willful murder against person person unknown be must be done then meeting broke up reporter slipped away with loaded notebook grumbling at dullness of matter crowd of villager dispersed to wonder for hundredth time who must have killed amiable kindly natured vicar beast who murdered leigh must not have be looking for will be hendle who spoke a walked back to big house with carrington barrister shrugged shoulder replied have same idea when policeman made statement saw look at agree with although be strange that book paper must have be turned upside down only know of of course of course broke in squire quickly a be in bed in london of course have nothing to do with matter did tell anyone else about will never mentioned to soul good must if be carrington tone be so significant that squire turned on in sharp inquiring way what do mean mean that if anyone knew about existence of john hendle will what meant to be possible that on suspicion might rest what rubbish said rupert uncomfortably be in bed asleep at time crime be committed how can prove that rupert looked surprised why saw that butler locked up a usual knew went to bed earlier than usual quite so when house be asleep might have risen from bed have gone through sleeping village to see leigh why must do say did persisted carrington be only suggesting what people must say if existence of will be known hang carrington fumed big man mean to insinuate have anything to do with so cowardly crime insinuate anything of sort a know that be incapable of such thing other people have nasty suspicious mind hendle looked more uncomfortable than ever understand murmured after pause be just a well to say nothing about will dare say will find among leigh paper when lawyer writes to about being executor if rupert shrugged big shoulder then there be nothing more to be said done remarked with resignation there be to be said observed carrington thoughtfully that if assassin really be looking for will turned over book paper to obtain reward of crime will be sure to turn up sooner later follow said hendle perturbed puzzled think for moment will be of greatest value to man who murdered leigh must have stolen to will say blackmail when everything have blown over will certainly make attempt to gain reward risked neck for by taking will to to mallien if come to will hand over to police said rupert vigorously mallien in spite of misanthropic way must do same see however how anyone can have killed leigh for sake of will a one knew about true enough did tell miss mallien about told one if have told dorinda might have told father to whom will be of importance seeing that might possibly place in possession of four thousand year good lord carrington infer that mallien murdered vicar no because have ground to go upon if told confound man did have be saying for last half hour told one even if have told dorinda must never have spoken to father without permission even if have done so father must never have murdered leigh to get will a must know very well that be not sort of man to conceal such document h be be not so sure of said carrington doubtfully mallien be not particularly scrupulous man from what have seen of may judge by care if did judge to be scoundrel retorted rupert must not make one be twisting rope of sand carrington tell solemnly that told one about john hendle will save be only suggesting what people might say about mallien did existence of will become known after added carrington cheerfully there may not be will at have never seen have only word of dead man to go upon may not exist rupert shook head seriously think doe exist that will probably find among leigh paper if do will take to family lawyer call in mallien to talk matter over be risk considering leigh have be murdered see even if anyone be crazy enough to suggest that killed poor old man mere fact of producing will must show that have reason to murder pouf ended rupert contemptuously be froth foam talk rubbish make mountain out of molehill carrington shrugged shoulder said more since on face of be a rupert stated twisting rope of sand more be said on particular phase of case during young men discussed matter freely naturally on what have be set forth in evidence must arrive at conclusion went to funeral of vicar a much in dark a anyone in great crowd gathered in churchyard mallien be there beyond scowling at carrington for whom have little love nodding curtly to cousin took notice of two men titus ark be there mumbled now then something to effect that vicar must not possibly be dead one took notice of so crazy statement since doctor have given certificate of death be known how ark idolized parson how constantly have be with leigh therefore everyone thought that be simply senile weakness of age on sexton part to disbelieve that only friend be gone finding that one heeded protest muttering titus became stolidly silent attending to part of burial sullenly so far a ark duty be concerned have little to even having have to dig grave family vault in quiet corner of churchyard be duly opened coffin be carried down damp worn step for few century leigh have be buried here a formerly before hendles came on scene have be lord of manor now save seafaring cousin who be on distaff side last of race have be laid to rest neighboring clergyman read service be listened to with reverent attention when door of vault be closed again crowd of mourner slowly dispersed judging from observation made be widely believed that mystery of death be hidden away with dead man in dreary vault ca see sir said inspector lawson to rupert how anything be to be discovered looked over poor gentleman paper must find nothing in past life to suggest that anyone must kill yet according to kensit paper be searched through hinted hendle relieved that officer made mention of lost parchment lawson shrugged square shoulder oh young constable always see more than need be seen observed slightly be so eager for promotion see sir opinion be that tramp on prowl walked in at invitingly open gate on chance of stealing finding door window unbolted probably tried on chance a say got into study while tumbling over content of room with idea of finding something worth taking be surprised by mr leigh naturally tramp first idea must be to escape being prevented naturally must strike down man who strove to detain appear to have case quite cut dried remarked carrington smiling be theory admit retorted lawson rather nettled if can find better explanation on what be known sir must be glad to hear oh dare say that theory be a good a other inspector suppose will search for more evidence on line search in what direction be to search oh ask replied barrister lightly be a much in dark a be inspector still will be just a well to order kensit to keep weather eye open on chance of something unexpected turning up have told kensit to do so mr carrington hope for result everyone be of much same opinion a worthy official theory be finally accepted by even by who have hinted at deeper reason for commission of crime stray tramp moving from one town to under cover of night have probably killed vicar so a to escape arrest for burglary might be that did not even mean to murder leigh only intended to stun so a to get away heart disease a much a blow be cause of death according to tollart presumed tramp must not have be expected to know that parson suffered in way at event explanation of lawson seemed likely to prove sole explanation must be forthcoming carrington stayed for night consultation with rupert led to nothing then took departure on understanding that if hendle a leigh executor did find will did not find must call down to barship again to give help say that be rich enough to do so for nothing hendle confessed barrister frankly be not greedy can give what consider fair oh mind answered rupert rather contemptuously for thought that carrington might have behaved more a friend le a professional adviser will name own price if will prof illegal be left in possession of property otherwise will have to get fee from new heir mallien h be be too avaricious man to pay if can help want to work for not for hendle however understand position can depend upon doing best to pull through will expect that if be to retain service professionally said squire rather dryly then mindful of obligation of hospitality drove carrington to station in motor to catch midday express nevertheless be disappointed that old school chum must bring pound shilling penny into matter imported sordid element into friendship when rupert reached big house again came to conclusion that perhaps dorinda be not far wrong in estimate of lawyer character mallien for mallien also mistrusted man now appeared that there be ground for certain amount of mistrust a hendle ruefully confessed to in short time leigh lawyer having seen report of murder inquest burial in newspaper made appearance intimated to hendle that be dead man executor besides income a parson leigh only have few hundred pound invested in consols so be evident that sea captain in australia must not benefit overmuch solicitor arranged to write to legatee in australia promised to send one down to value book with view to selling mr jabber remained on at vicarage along with husband pending arrival of new parson who be to be appointed immediately by bishop rupert a executor went to untidy house after solicitor departed for london to look over paper belonging to leigh to put affair shipshape lawyer have time to attend to matter since estate be hardly worthy of professional attention when hendle explained that certain document have to be restored to muniment room that search for must be necessary attorney allowed to attend to matter wholly by thus came about rupert found three day after burial digging among bookish rubbish in study of course chief aim be to find will leigh have so positively asserted existed although young man turned over paper parchment hunted through various box even examined many of book on chance that might have be slipped into one of be unable to find what wanted at end of three four hour when afternoon be waning hendle began to think that will be myth probably have never existed save in leigh dreamy imagination on other hand might have existed assassin might have taken be too fantastical idea for hendle to accept for one moment seeing that only carrington knew about will whether be real fictitious be impossible to believe that crime have be committed for sake by time five o'clock came rupert working for sake of coolness in shirt sleeve be hot dusty weary looking for needle in bundle of hay did not appeal to a amusing task be about to abandon search for day when quick firm step be heard mallien looking like thunder cloud entered to scowl greeting well asked disagreeably have found john hendle will chapter ix serious position sitting on floor in grimy snowdrift of scattered paper surrounded by pile of dingy book rupert stared at cousin scarcely taking in purport of word mallien appeared to be pleased with expression of genuine bewilderment on other man face did not improve occasion by speaking immediately since afternoon be oppressively hot wore suit of cool white flannel made seem blacker in hairy look than ever in heavy yellow sunshine streaming through dusty room many jewel twinkled shot fire scarf pin stud sleeve link ring near door have closed newcomer leaned against many volume filling book shelf with folded arm crossed leg odd a impressed hendle sinister figure be squire who spoke next a be not entirely sure if have heard mallien astounding question what do say asked almost mechanically heard right enough sneered other john hendle will ah thought so none so deaf a who wo hear well have found rupert john hendle will repeated squire greatly taken aback by sudden display of knowledge on part of cousin yes pretend that be talking nonsense know better hendle gradually collected scattered thought rose slowly to foot then quite in mechanical way took out pipe tobacco pouch must like to know who told remarked filling bowl will know mr beatson told how did know a woman generally know thing be not meant to learn by eavesdropping understand listened to conversation between parson when dined at big house on evening before death did dine with admitted hendle seriously did tell about discovery of will mention why did mr beatson listen since must not have guessed what be going to speak about seems to rupert that be asking question whereas be right to do so however to make thing clear mind in least answering mr beatson explained to in excuse for eavesdropping that have told of approaching marriage with dorinda be afraid lest must turn out told must oh did then evidently did not believe hovered round dining room drawing room hoping to hear anything might say to vicar on subject leigh hinted at mystery have to impart to mr beatson heard remark through open door of dining room aroused curiosity when went to drawing room be outside window drinking in word hum said rupert lighting pipe remember that window of drawing room be open on account of heat stole along terrace presume yes heard word repeated mallien significantly in first instance will understand that mr beatson only hovered round vicar to hear anything connected with possible dismissal when grasped fact about will became aware that have secret must turn to own advantage for time hesitated whether to let buy silence then thinking must get money came told about hum said rupert again very calmly rather treacherous behavior toward considering how kind treated treachery be hanged burst out mallien leaving wall throwing onto convenient pile of book afforded seat wanted to see righted wanted price for secret think said well why not demanded hairy little timon in blustering way be only natural that must wish to keep secret only natural that mr beatson must try make money out of telling to suppose be with nature so be going to pay yes be done good turn will give annuity when come to live at big house be not there yet said rupert dryly now that knew worst be perfectly calm have right to be since have done nothing with to reproach will be there when will come to light bullied mallien fiercely naturally wish to hide there make mistake interrupted big man leisurely a soon a will be found will take to family lawyer have looked into oh yes say so now because ca keep secret longer thanks to mr beatson retorted mallien coarsely never intended to keep secret then why did tell a soon a leigh told because have not seen will so far a go have never set eye on yet may be myth be useless for to speak about until be sure that document be in existence be in existence insisted mallien uneasily have only vicar word for oh of course say that what else can say listen to mallien unpleasant a be for to lose property be quite willing to surrender to without intervention of law if will prof to be legal if doe of course will keep own even generous reasonable speech did not appeal to grasping hearer can do what like replied doggedly if get property will bring case before judge jury there will be necessity for to do so if will be legal mallien sneered suppose will try prove that be certainly retorted hendle angered by extreme selfishness may be sure that will do can to protect own interest must not do same be in position other shirked straightforward reply a selfish man must be here there snapped want right will have if have from what mr beatson told mr beatson know more le than do interrupted squire patiently be aware that leigh found said that found will made by john hendle one hundred year ago leaving property to eunice filbert descendant if such be case be rightfully entitled to take place well rupert shrugged square shoulder completed sentence by waving hand vaguely to four corner of room mallien scowled tried to pick hole oh can be certain that will claim right to last farthing growled savagely rather annoyed by rupert reasonable attitude naturally be only fair be not man a well know to keep what doe not honestly belong to added hendle with emphasis will have yet to be found must be found declared mallien violently be easier said than done leigh seemed to have mislaid hidden very thoroughly inspector lawson did not come across ca lay hand on nohow remember even when be discovered legality of have yet to be proved if be signed witnessed properly inherit shouted mallien doggedly objecting a such illogical man must to mere shadow of contradiction go too fast said squire dryly there be such thing a statute of limitation oh be there what deviltry be that law in most case operates against restoration of property devolving under lost will found a one have be after so long period of time talk like book sneered mallien uncomfortably for here be obstacle did not expect to meet will take advantage of infernal statute why not demanded rupert calmly must not do same under same circumstance prefer not to enter into argument on point said mallien loftily seems to be silly law what about not keeping what be own if statute of limitation act in favor property must be own answered squire coolly hair splitting common sense must not have used argument for display of greedy selfishness selfish how dare mallien fumed fretted made a though must throw on cousin hendle held out one hand to keep off none of mallien violence will be worse for if come to physical tussle will not be difficult for to lay on back mallien knew so tried verbal bullying order not to address in insolent tone be fool man talk about insolence until learn how to behave everyone far near considers most objectionable person indeed mallien grew livid be of same opinion replied rupert smoking placidly if be not dorinda father must have thrashed age ago will never marry daughter gasped other panting with rage dorinda can afford to do without permission see here mallien think be time stopped playing fool said before say again that if property be proved to be rightfully a descendant of eunice filbert will not stand in way so best thing can do be to behave silly self help to search for will can leave question of marriage to dorinda alone just now until will be found be proved not to exist be well aware that marriage can take place if will be found be put in possession of big house marriage will take place retorted other still fuming on other hand if will be found prof to be illegal what then will be attitude even then will refuse to not broke in rupert with broad smile be too anxious to buy that blue sapphire be talking about if want five hundred year that marriage with dorinda will put into pocket will have to put pride in same receptacle will see about snarled mallien vindictively in more subdued tone for did not wish to cross rubicon too soon will have yet to be proved illegal will have yet to be found answered squire thinking how difficult be to hammer idea into man obstinate head ah mallien tone be significant be quite sure that never will be found rupert opened big blue eye in genuine surprise seem to have changed opinion remarked after pause just now made sure must be found bah mallien pent up rage burst forth anew do think that ca see through pretended search pretended search hendle rose slowly towered above stout little man like giant explain what mean be easy to see other sulkily lawson must not find will among paper of leigh will not find why because be already in possession have be destroyed for know still understand said rupert eye grew hard a began to have inkling of mallien meaning leigh did not give will to before died dare say not have own fish to fry must only have given to on getting promise to finance silly yucatan expedition took will from dead body hendle temper long held in check blazed up took two step toward gad fly so irritated caught mallien by throat flung right across room liar said in dangerously quiet tone be true be true gasped cousin struggling into sitting position amid pile of tumbled book do want neck twisted dare to do shrieked mallien hysterically dare add one murder to rupert sat down suddenly afraid lest wrath must carry too far reined in feeling with powerful effort think be fool must be answered according to folly said with suppressed anger what make think that did thing cousin gathered together smoothed ruffled plume still remained among pile of book fall have scattered a did not wish to come within arm length of hendle there sat grinned like ugly little gnome anyone can guess game sneered venomously leigh told about will said be here be quite sure of refused to give to unless agreed to finance yucatan expedition of course refused then came here in dead of night to murder get will bah can see through pretence of searching for what be already found read character according to own base thought said rupert now quite self possessed what say be wholly untrue leigh told about will a mr beatson informed can bear witness that vicar declared that have mislaid document called to see next morning be away a mr jabber can testify seeing mr patter who be reported to be dying then went to town to consult carrington oh have brought that beast into sneered mallien vindictively consulted a to what be best to be done advised not to see vicar until next day then in company carrington a well know came down by midday train for purpose of seeing leigh along with by time leigh be dead quite so killed accusation be so absurd that rupert merely shrugged shoulder wondered why have lost temper with gad fly even for moment think will find difficult to prove that observed suavely did not see leigh on night be murdered did not even call at vicarage thanks to carrington advice servant can prove if like to question locked up retired to bed at ten o'clock oh dare say did scoffed mallien remember leigh be killed if dr tollart be to be believed at eleven be easy for to slip out of big house come along to did not rupert started to foot again maintained calmness how can prove that did not how can prove did counterquestioned squire mallien rose brushed dust from flannel will leave lawson to find proof cried triumphantly oh yes once lawson know that will must rob of property exists will be easy for to assign cause why leigh must have be murdered remember paper be tumbled about a kensit can witness burglary business be rubbish be to get will leigh be murdered be culprit hendle did not reply for moment for so skillfully have venomous little man built up case that be quite taken aback then remembered how carrington have warned that if business of missing will be known be possible such accusation might be brought thanks to mr beatson treachery mallien have be placed in possession of dangerous fact mallien sooner than forego chance of acquiring hendle property be quite prepared to have cousin handed over to police not only be strong motive for murder provided rupert knew that must have greatest difficulty in proving alibi after ten o'clock own servant inhabitant of barship be in bed so be perfectly feasible on face of to protect own interest might have stolen through village to commit crime of course knew very well that have not that idea of securing will in way have never entered head nevertheless position be uncomfortable dangerous for moment did not know what to say mallien noted cousin silence concluded that guilt prevented speech ca deny what say cried viciously be too much taken aback by audacity to reply to deny retorted young man drawing deep breath knowing a do can think guilty of so cowardly crime a to strike down old man think capable of acting anyhow to retain own property answered mallien cynically judge by might act so must not however be useless to prolong talk now know that be envious disappointed man to get money be willing to go to length of getting hanged must murder people know taunted mallien believing that be now top dog must have everything own way rupert passed over accusation suppose remarked laying trap for foe that if hand over property will will wo say anything to police mallien dark eye gleamed with greed triumph a have not expected to gain so sudden victory hendle have evidently surrendered without firing shot yes said eagerly after want to wash dirty family linen in public must be unpleasant for for dorinda to see in dock after also will leaf everything to a descendant of eunice filbert will have yet to be found have yet to be proved legal said rupert calmly be not even certain if presumed will be not figment of leigh brain leigh must not have invented story said mallien doggedly whether did not matter little property be mine have yet to be proved interpolated hendle quietly if climb down will be proved at expense of arrest for murder threatened mallien see rupert lip curled with contempt if give have will condone felony care what beastly term use snapped mallien uneasily know that be in power to have arrested in mr beatson also oh will make worth while to keep quiet wonder how dorinda ever came to have so dishonorable man for father commented rupert reflectively always knew to be bully avaricious animal did expect decency take care raged mallien growing livid again will tell police what know if insult further be impossible to insult man who have agreed to hush up what supposes to be crime can not be insulted be beyond pale of decency presume mallien that never occurred to that if be weak enough to agree to blackmailing that must be arrested later a accessory after fact always supposing that be guilty be not oh for own sake will hold tongue said other confidently mr beatson can be squared think will connect murder will anyhow a have done see be not quite so clever a be well then if hand over property to straightway not bother about finding will have already got destroyed see will let go at be guilty will condone guilt on condition that get money yes said mallien impudently will take risk of being proved accessory after fact yes because know that will hold tongue for own sake of course will keep mr beatson quiet certainly wo say word if give annuity be not likely to connect will murder a remarked before well well echoed rupert ironically be not taking thank mallien face fell when found that in moment of fancied triumph victory be suddenly snatched from grasp refuse do go to inspector lawson bring accusation be quite ready to meet will be arrested threatened mallien be quite willing to be arrested be better than being in power of blackmailer be mad be quite mad must like to be a happens be perfectly sane meanwhile until have locked up help to search for will mallien must not understand cousin attitude have insulted have brought vile accusation against yet rupert coolly refused greedy term evidently did not mind being in company knowing how must have cringed agreed to anything under similar circumstance mallien at once sought refuge in taunt thought be man obnoxious animal such a be can not judge what be man what be friend retorted rupert putting on coat will walk along with toward big house discus matter further hang wo a please denunciation of to police mallien hesitated will give week to think thing over thank said hendle gravely treaty having be made conversation ended with victory for squire victory won by sheer honesty chapter x dorinda here be pretty kettle of fish hitherto rupert have led easy life wholly devoid of great trouble mother having died when be born father while lad be at school hendle have never be brought face to face with heartbreaking sorrow with advent of carrington a specie of stormy petrel have come one woe after in remarkably short space of time rupert found in danger of losing property position promised wife even good name if not liberty life must will be found must prove to be legal mallien without least compunction must ascend local throne a new squire of barship with income of four thousand year in event there must be chance that marriage with dorinda must never take place father having wanted must never agree to match even if girl remained true a knew very well must how must ask to marry one reduced to position of pauper thing alone be sufficient to drive ordinary man crazy possibility of being arrested for crime have not committed made hendle feel that burden be too great to be borne returned to big house with mind in turmoil head aching with anxious thought aware that mr beatson have acted treacherously rupert first idea be to call in dismiss straightway with month wage on second thought decided to hing until have consulted with carrington certainly barrister by refusing to help a friend have shown almost a greedy of gain a mallien hendle decided that prospect of fat fee must make man more alert to earn carrington when be said done have shrewd brain great deal of experience connected with seamy side of life so be just man to handle problem fate have so unexpectedly given rupert to solve mallien did not like carrington if mallien secured property carrington must not even get cost for taking up case therefore a professional man a hendle friend barrister have reason to work on side of squire what must advise in matter of mr beatson eavesdropping rupert did not know thought must be just a well to see what said with idea squire made difference toward treacherous housekeeper concealed feeling so well that mr beatson have idea that battery have be unmasked same hendle saw a little of a possible beyond giving necessary order did not speak to must be noted that mallien estimate of mr beatson brain be perfectly correct one did not in way connect conversation about missing will with death of vicar knew be that mr leigh have found ancient testament must probably transfer property to mallien a descendant of john hendle granddaughter for reason worshipped rising sun have guessed that there be doubt about legality of will danger of not being found must have held tongue until such time a saw on what side be best to range in conversation have overheard leigh have seemed so certain that rupert must lose property a certain that cousin must get that mr beatson have lost time in reporting position mallien conduct have justified action for have promised annuity whenever came into own to gain certain income housekeeper be quite willing to see kind hearted young master driven a pauper from house nature be so strangely constituted that resent kindness more benefaction receive more do hate person who bestows mr beatson be woman of class hendle consideration for many year have only increased dislike have felt when first set eye on moreover detested dorinda for beauty sweetness for certain happiness marriage with rupert must surely give mr beatson knew enough of girl unsophisticated nature to be sure that amount of money must make up to for loss of promised husband did not like dorinda getting fortune through father must not be helped after breaking of engagement must assuredly prevent girl from enjoying same therefore good lady smiled comfortably to a went about duty rejoiced to think a put in quite biblical way that pride of young couple must soon be brought low might not have rejoiced so prematurely have guessed content of after dinner letter master wrote did not gloried in fool paradise dorinda must be made miserable hendle must be made pauper who have brought about thing must retire on annuity of two hundred year for service a thought that mallien must not possibly give le meanwhile after meal to gave little attention hendle retired to snug little library of big house sat down to desk after few moment of reflection wrote long exhaustive letter to carrington setting forth what have taken place in study of late vicar pointed out that what barrister have conjectured have actually come to pas for mallien in possession of secret now deliberately accused of crime rupert added that have be given week to think over thing then asked whether must not be well to dismiss mr beatson at once lest must act in further treacherous manner finally young man ended with inviting carrington to come down stay at big house until everything be put straight hinting that fee carrington liked to demand must be given to for service in postscript rupert significantly added that if mallien got property carrington must either receive le remuneration none at therefore be end of letter remained for carrington to say whether must give service on doubtful term having placed position before barrister thus fairly squarely hendle slipped epistle into envelope addressed sealed sent special messenger to post in village afterward a there be more to be done lighted pipe sitting in one chair with foot on began to read morning paper have not yet glanced at so deeply have be involved in direction of own affair young man brain declined to interest in public doings before knew where be rupert found thinking of what have happened in connection with dorinda laying newspaper on knee placing hand behind head leaned back to think what be best to be done sorely needed sympathetic soul to converse with there be one so fitted to help a dorinda carrington request for fee have placed in position of business man rather than in of friend so there be nothing to be gained in quarter dorinda always understood always gave good advice always soothed feeling hendle longed for look touch word so much that very nearly decided to cross park visit cottage two consideration caused to alter mind one be that mallien now openly hostile must be present at interview other be that must not speak straightly to girl seeing that father have so much to do with matter dorinda knew that parent be what be known a hard case have not much respect affection for since did not deserve first demand last same be impossible a hendle felt for to tell girl frankly that father be little more than blackmailer with delicate perception of what be right just a rupert possessed course of action be not to be thought of so subsided again into chair whence have risen determined to carry heavy burden by considering that young man have experience of burden carried well bravely then fate who have interfered so much in affair that matter have be brought to pas interfered again with kinder motive just a rupert be wondering how be to get through long night without receiving human sympathy there be tapping at right hand window of room brought to foot in stillness of library sound be so unexpected imperative that even hendle steady nerve be unstrung for moment with effort pulled together went to window to lift see who have made signal through glass saw dorinda standing on terrace in luminous summer night nodded smilingly to when lifted sash why did go to door asked rupert leaning out more astonished by unexpected appearance than must admit want that prying mr beatson to see replied miss mallien advancing toward window sill of be so low that must very easily step over want to know be here help in rupert suddenly stepped back better come out join in garden have much to say to want to risk mr beatson listening at door never did like said hendle vaulting through open window onto terrace why do suspect of eavesdropping father have told what told rejoined girl calmly be for reason have come over rupert took arm descended willow step to second terrace then gained lawn be dry warm to foot for few minute squire said nothing guided down narrow path wound deviously to kind of glade wherein stood ancient sundial near against dense shrubbery stood low marble seat on placed girl then sat down beside still remaining silent strove to collect scattered thought dorinda did not hurry into speech by making further observation have said be necessary next remark must be made by lover so two sat quietly under calm beauty of star breathing cool fragrance of night myriad odor of dreaming flower there be moon yet light of dying day still lingered revealed garden in kind of warm twilight be such evening a must have inspired romeo to venture into magical garden of juliet love talk be only language fitted for such hour scene yet stern necessity of hour demanded that bachelor maid must talk on more prosaic matter sad waste of time opportunity to be sure a regretfully thought there be help for if future peace be to be insured only by two solving problem fate have set must happiness come be sorry that father told said rupert at last why dorinda turned thoughtful face toward saw white shirt front glimmer in half light because did not intend to tell why asked again very calmly even wonderingly be there need to worry fenced young man evasively if be worried a be be only fair must be worried also be be not yet married dear same be a perfectly of one mind a two people can be if be to be wife must naturally share burden be easier for two to bear than one understand hendle took hand lay lightly on lap pressed in token of thanks understand that be staunch true woman said in soft voice how came to have father oh let speak of interrupted dorinda impatiently dear must speak of a be part parcel of affair must discus yet have not spoken to must have held peace although be sorely tempted to come to for sympathy later than few minute before tapped at window knew from what father said that be in trouble rupert felt that needed for reason flung cloak over dinner dress came on here mr beatson must be very shocked if knew be sitting alone with in garden in hour mr beatson be kind of woman who must be shocked however innocent thing startled might be so father told of interview in leigh study yes be told about missing will how mr beatson overheard what poor mr leigh have to say on matter what else did tell asked hendle anxiously dear dorinda eye opened widely what else be there to tell hum murmured squire doubtfully father let out just a much a suited let talk of what did tell to begin with afterward can talk of what did not tell yet rupert tugged at moustache nervously be not quite sure if must speak frankly be retorted dorinda giving hand squeeze if be to help must know everything feel quite certain if be playing game be father playing game questioned girl with shrug answered rupert decidedly be be that make so hard for to be frank after father be father dear have right to say anything will lower in esteem dorinda laughed rather sadly dear have illusion left about father said in low tone have never be father to a know very well have tried best to respect love action life be such that can do neither be a open with a can rupert for know that father will not spare of where own feeling be at stake therefore only seems fair to that must not spare more than be necessary on account of unfortunate relationship to do really think so dorinda yes do if father deserved filial affection must have a have made attempt to secure how can give to remember be to be husband interest be mine even though father selfish desire intervene have greatest claim on rupert heaved sigh of relief be so glad to hear say that remarked thankfully for badly need one who can help sympathize with thought carrington must prove to be pal like everyone else be eaten up with greed for money what make say that said that must only help on condition paid ah r r r said dorinda much disgusted told that did not like rupert be bad man oh not so bad a dear little greedy perhaps not wholly bad be bad man repeated dorinda obstinately a father said long ago all want be to get money out of a father doe said rupert dryly dorinda looked down at white shoe placed together before answered have told opinion of father said with sigh so what be use of going over old ground time be passing rupert there be much to say wish to go home soon lest father must find out have come here left busy in study with jewel so be safe for hour at least come now what took place in vicarage library what did father tell said that mr beatson told about will found by mr leigh how mr leigh have mislaid will declared left hendle property to entirely have not yet seen will answered rupert cautiously beyond leigh word even know that exists maintained that did a came across in muniment room took to vicarage to look into then lost mislaid somehow a have access to paper a executor be trying to find doe leave property to father not directly understand admitted rupert quietly leigh explained that john hendle from whom be descended dear hated younger son frederick who inherited loved son walter who be killed at battle of waterloo in year when battle be fought made will leaving hendle property to walter daughter cutting off frederick who represented younger branch eunice hendle be daughter father said yes afterward became eunice filbert a married man of name explained rupert laboriously daughter anne filbert married frank mallien father parent so if will prof to be legal father will certainly get property through descent on distaff side asked dorinda apprehensively rupert rested elbow on knee linked hand loosely together looked down at shadowy turf of lawn will lose everything stated calmly descend in male line from frederick through henry hendle charles hendle a frederick be cut off by father in favor of walter child eunice be interloper fraud if will be found can be proved to be legal dorinda will not have penny a thing stand father be better off with five hundred year than will be be very unpleasant position a stop marriage oh doe cried dorinda flaming up in what way well in first place father must never agree to marrying pauper in second pauper must scarcely ask to share nothing year darling dorinda drew closer to lover laid cheek against will marry one care what father say be not of father that be thinking of of honor rejoined rupert slipping arm round waist holding tightly to if got married how must support have trade profession so only thing must do to keep body soul together be to enlist might emigrate certainly then life a wife must be a hard impossible in backwoods a must be if followed drum along with dorinda sighed take very prosaic view of position in justice to must take prosaic view romance be very well without money romance mean trouble sordid care yes sighed girl again then added after pause if will be not found will keep own answered rupert firmly be use being silly fool giving up what be proved not to be mine be looking for will dorinda if come to light will hand over to family lawyer to be adjusted of course may be certain that will take advantage of everything likely to prevent losing big house income be quite right said dorinda in tone of satisfaction patting lover hand consolingly daresay father will fight if have right on side will be sure to win money must do father no good a must only waste in collecting jewel whereas make good use of income after will may not exist mr leigh may have dreamed that there be such document seemed to be very positive that did exist dear said rupert with shrug although leigh be bit of dreamer think must have must have made up such fairy tale a for part believe that there be such testament that will come to light sooner later will make use of statute of limitation of flaw in will to keep property if everything be legal shipshape will hand over what have to father a honest man can do le be very hard on dear be admitted rupert quietly may have to bear harder thing dorinda stared see anything harder to bear loss of liberty perhaps of life rupert what be talking about ah rupert rose stretched father did not tell that spoke about in vicarage study know what proposes to do dorinda know if ought to tell must must sprang up laid two hand on shoulder with grasp of did not think be capable share trouble sorrow hendle caught hand holding to heart looked into eye dimly seen in light father declares that murdered leigh to get will said quietly scream be not going to scream replied dorinda looking aside speaking rather rapidly what on earth make father say ridiculous thing on face of such accusation be absurd father doe seem to think so dear if inspector lawson learned what be at stake with regard to will must not think so remember have reason to steal even at cost of life what rubbish declared girl vehemently must never never never said rupert positively heart leaped when defended must never save property at cost of crime however small however necessary know dorinda must let everything go rather than lose honor good name father think otherwise so be determined to get money position good name into bargain ca believe ca ca gasped girl overwhelmed father may be selfish must surely have accuses of committing crime have given one week to think over matter if come to term will shut up beatson possible chatter will hold own tongue did offer safety on term did refused dorinda flung arm round neck lip sought knew must knew must oh say anything more rupert be glad told a now know where stand where stand have week to think over thing in week much may happen god will never permit such injustice cheer up dearest kissed again will come out right will come out right hope so said rupert doubtfully adjusting cloak on shoulder what will say to father know ca say must think meanwhile see home rupert thus abruptly ended interview squire escorted to within sight of cottage did not enter chapter xi carrington advice detail given by rupert of conversation have taken place in vicarage study shocked dorinda profoundly be natural enough that father informed of existing will must give estate must try gain possession of so a to secure what believed to be right dorinda did not blame for taking up so reasonable position be horrified to think that must accuse innocent man of committing crime be wholly impossible that mallien must believe rupert to be guilty have known squire intimately for twenty five more year therefore be well aware how strictly honorable rupert be in way moreover hendle have always treated cousin with consistent kindness having again again given sum of money large small have never be repaid even if rupert be guilty be cowardly of mallien to threaten seeing that rupert be innocent dorinda be well assured in own mind that father knew to be so attack be cowardly in extreme if girl have little affection for father before have still le for now what troubled throughout night be question of speaking of not speaking frankly to father have withheld from more serious portion of interview with rupert dorinda be strongly inclined not only to intimate that knew about accusation to tell father how strongly disapproved of conduct more than wished to state that be on side of lover dorinda be straightforward greatly desired that mallien must be straightforward also to bring such rectitude into being plain speaking be necessary yet girl hesitated to broach subject knowing only too well father temper tricky nature unscrupulous greed at breakfast hesitation to make trouble be ended by mallien a began to speak furiously moment laid hand on coffee pot be nice thing dorinda raged without returning morning greeting went out last night did not return until after nine in fact be nearer ten deny slipped out when be busy in study came to ask something found have gone out what do mean by such conduct dorinda lifted eyebrow be not aware that there be anything strange about conduct have be out late before be quite capable of looking after assure father think so retorted mallien bristling with anger like such underhand conduct never behave in underhand way returned dorinda color rising eye flashing know that quite well slipped out last night slipped in without telling there be need to tell there be contradict if conduct be not underhand why did not come say good night to in study a usual because must not said dorinda coldly looking straight at angry parent what rupert told about disgusted too much rupert mallien rose pushed back chair noisily went to see that scoundrel dorinda rose in turn be not scoundrel be tell forbid to see again a be engaged to cousin will see when where please said girl deliberately try too far father will be sorry for be not in best of temper morning minx gasped angry man choking with rage how dare address in way how dare accuse rupert of murdering mr leigh retorted boldly mallien wrath suddenly died away dropped back into chair with uneasy look who say that accuse rupert told saw last night to hear what have to say about missing will told what did not tell be mean hound to put daughter against shouted mallien please dorinda flung up hand be not deaf rupert did not wish to tell made speak out a saw that be hiding something if be a honorable scrupulous a rupert father must not need to get into rage with a deserve be use behaving in way can hold own a well know intend to do so may a well understand one be father owe respect how can give what deserve be father god help must have one if talk to in way snarled mallien blustering will turn out of door neck crop what will do then marry rupert rejoined girl promptly ruined man sneered other be not ruined yet never may be ruined will have yet to be found have yet to be proved legal may be sure that rupert will take advantage can to keep what have see be fighting against father fight on side of right if property be yours rupert be willing to hand over if be have right to keep have right cried dorinda striking table passionately to accuse innocent man of committing such cowardly crime be talking nonsense said mallien doggedly folded arm be guilty be not one know that better than mallien cringed at last sentence dark face grew strangely pale a avoided daughter steady blue eye know why must say that muttered what else can say when have known rupert for so many year be passionate reply have ever behaved otherwise than honorably be man father to kill weakling like poor mr leigh for money care very little about know better mallien recovered self possession during daughter speech shook shoulder a laughed harshly know that will stand between rupert absolute poverty retorted obstinately if man have to make choice man like rupert must chose poverty rather than crime interrupted dorinda imperiously what reason have to believe that rupert must do wicked thing knowledge of human nature oh be that there be expression of relief in dorinda voice a interrupted again so evidence be purely circumstantial yes admitted mallien sullenly feeling that dorinda be too strong for to deal with same very powerful case can be built up against fellow will have disappeared in nick of time rupert have reason to make disappear seem to forget that one mr leigh have seen will said dorinda crisply may not exist doe exist stormed mallien violently leaf property to a descendant of eunice filbert be what mr leigh said may have imagined whole thing be always dreamer know anyhow father see much use in threatening rupert with shadow think that inspector lawson will think that be shadow said mallien significantly replied dorinda with lightness be far from feeling well then do before police can arrest rupert must first prove that document for sake of crime be supposed to have be committed be in existence then will have to prove rupert be at vicarage on night at time when mr leigh be struck down think will be easy to do what say have wish for rupert to be arrested said mallien restlessly have to do be to give up property will hold tongue there be nothing for to hold tongue about said dorinda sharply a what say be purely theoretical a to property certainly will not have unless will be found property be proved to be yours be on rupert side remember will do best to make hold on to own go against father oh cried impatiently said that before answered yes do go against father have reason to be not going to countenance robbery must give money be better without better without demanded mallien indignantly what do mean what say said dorinda tartly rupert make good use of fortune in helping poor in keeping up church must only waste in buying jewel for own satisfaction wo be spoken to like be own fault be so frank if what say doe please can easily go to london to see old schoolmistress ask to get position a nursery governess must do yes must know must must like to respect to love father can not last action in threatening to denounce innocent man widens gulf between if dare to go to inspector lawson will go out a governess until such time a rupert be ready to marry now know exactly what mean mallien did know be well aware that must act precisely a declared must be use to storm bluster try to reduce to tear a dorinda be not tearful woman knew how to hold own intended to hold mallien having tried rage be reduced to attempting pathos did very badly own daughter own daughter murmured sadly be heartbreaking be pretty uncomfortable grant answered dorinda with queer smile for a for a have made position entirely see what have to complain of now that understand one let call truce very good will overlook unfilial behavior try to forget conversation same cried mallien blazing up again intend to get right certainly if will be found will have be cold comfort to mallien who doubted if will ever must be found leigh might have made mistake there might be will in existence in case by making enemy of rupert must be worse off than be at present thought that until truth came to light must be just a well to temporize let thing stand a be therefore a outward sign of reconciliation dropped cold kiss on daughter white brow retreated to study dorinda left alone in little dining room have desire to eat breakfast a struggle to secure rupert safety have exhausted greatly hastily drank cup of coffee then wrote note to lover saying that need not be afraid of intervention of police relating in detail conversation just ended having sent by hand to big house girl went about daily duty resolutely cheerful only by assuming bold front must combat great trouble threatened to overwhelm lover when worst came to worst there must be time enough to think of further defense dorinda believed that further defense must not be required rupert be very well satisfied when received dorinda note a have winced at idea of inspector lawson intervening of course have be very certain that there be chance of being arrested owing to fact that will must not be proved to exist still lawson be ambitious of promotion obstinate in own opinion therefore if mallien have told story there might have be chance of scandal however dorinda having reduced father to neutrality only thing remained to do be to find will rupert intended to search again among paper at vicarage must not do so until afternoon a carrington have sent wire saying must be down by midday express squire intended to meet at station talk to on way home since be anxious to know what be best way to deal with treacherous mr beatson knowing that be spy enemy rupert must hardly bear to see about house however tolerated presence until heard what carrington have to say by time excitement have died out of village a crime have be so thoroughly discussed that there be more to be said about matter in stolid bovine way rustic accepted positive fact that late spiritual adviser be dead buried accepted also evident truth that murderer must never be caught punished being case dismissed past looked eagerly forward to future when new incumbent must arrive be reported that vicar have already be appointed by bishop that have family must make vicarage much more lively place than have be in mr leigh time oh there be plenty to talk about hendle arm be filled with conversational yokel from morning until evening on way to station rupert stumbled across titus ark who grinned in toothless manner touched shabby hat shuffled along in manner surprisingly spry for man of eighty odd year of age hendle stopped to give sixpence for snuff to ancient be much addicted miss mr leigh titus said pityingly for old man be lonely figure in midst of new generation hor hor hor croaked aged sexton why must miss squoire when bai dead why titus buried be helped to place body in family vault poor mr leigh must not have be buried alive who said a be alive squoire never did say that be dead no more be then must be alive bai hor hor hor crack that nut squoire ancient shuffled along dry dusty road chuckling to hendle shrugged shoulder wondering if must be necessary to lock up titus in lunatic asylum appeared to be quite crazy talked in so confused contradictory manner that meaning must be extracted from speech evidently brain be far gone in decay although so far have kept leg must shortly be bedridden ark office a sexton be sinecure a grandson active young fellow dug graf attended to funeral detail activity of titus be confined to appearing in churchyard telling what knew about deceased on whole old creature be harmless enough so rupert banished from mind idea of shutting up satisfied that so long a grandson looked after must be permitted to be at large ark incomprehensible talk reminded hendle of wordsworth poem be seven more than child therein must titus understand what death meant be strange considering that be old accomplished sexton however rupert have more important thing with to employ mind than in thinking about babble of ancient forgot about ark when came in sight of station more readily when saw carrington on lookout for train have arrived early barrister be waiting for friend arrival after greeting carrington linked arm within of old school friend sauntered leisurely toward big house be strange letter wrote hendle said carrington when two settled into stride must scarcely believe why not wrote plainly enough oh yes never thought that idea of risk to must ever become established fact so soon be queer that mr beatson must have listened on particular night to particular conversation well see got into head intended to dismiss when married dorinda so kept ear open to hear if spoke to vicar about intention a matter of fact have idea of turning away then have not now must go said rupert shortly ca have spy at elbow have said anything to be quite in dark a to treachery having be discovered carrington thought for few moment if mallien go to police will then learn that know how have behaved mallien be not going to police said rupert quietly thought said in letter that have given one week to yes yes interrupted younger man did say so such be case when wrote circumstance have changed since then thanks to dorinda miss mallien what have to do with matter great deal last night came over a father have told about will be forced to tell mallien threatened to accuse of murder oh oh said carrington significantly so mallien did not tell that be ashamed to suppose a be well aware that be innocent morning have row with dorinda about engagement to stood up for bless what said what said know dorinda sent over note morning saying that father have changed mind about speaking to lawson carrington heaved sigh of relief make thing easier anyhow can take own time to work out case have found will have seen sign of intend to look again afternoon can assist if care to oh yes four hand be better than two two searcher better than one hendle if will be found well suppose thing will remain a be make mistake hendle replied barrister shrewdly mallien wo stop until get will mind in fact told that must help look for carrington frowned hope wo be brought into contact with be such rude beast well after quarrel of yesterday think will put in appearance said hendle consolingly anyhow whether doe not matter little business be to find will thus knock mallien possible accusation on head a please what must be must be miss mallien be charming girl if marriage with meant father in law like boor must cry off ah be not in love see said rupert calmly besides when be married will see very little of mallien be bribing with five hundred year to make scarce a doe care cent for daughter will probably agree to clear out not before have have try to get whole of money said carrington dryly man be shark sponge greedy animal why call name carrington be dorinda father after so be best to leave alone wo leave alone retorted other wonder can be so calm over matter hendle rupert cast side look of surprise at flushed dark face of companion be quite innocent so why must be calm hum growled barrister innocent men have be hanged before now well innocent man wo be hanged carrington one can prove be near vicarage on night probably not have motive to go there get will seeing that may render pauper if be to be pauper must become pauper replied rupert coolly certainly must never attempt to save from poverty by murdering old man who be friend well see people will talk a mallien have talked said barrister with shrug alone knew about will be in town so one can say word about near at hand what be use of talking rubbish interrupted rupert sharply never be near place on night if people talk well must just talk a be perfectly innocent besides forget that mallien knew about will only after murder a mr beatson probably did not tell beforehand suppose did hum rupert stopped looked down at neat brown boot gaiter queer that never thought of asking mallien when did tell will ask next time meet just now can cross out mallien a knowing mr beatson exactly interrupted carrington gravely occurs to that know more about matter than chooses to say mean to infer that killed vicar why not knew about will guessed that if must get hold of must make squeal at risk of being accused of murdering leigh carrington nodded perhaps then may think that must hold tongue about if gave will hendle walked on sharply believe word of what say cried looking much worried mr beatson have behaved treacherously think for one moment that must kill vicar perhaps not said carrington soothingly well then let say nothing to watch if be guilty be bound to betray main thing be not to let suspect that have found out treachery hendle took off cap let balmy air play on hot head be very unpleasant said in vexed tone very assented barrister cordially for own sake well well do what like carrington case be in hand chapter xii on track generally speaking seemed a though mallien prophecy of carrington picking rupert pocket be likely to come true owing to circumstance barrister have found perfectly legitimate way of getting money from friend intended to take advantage of opportunity explained to hendle that must be necessary for to remain at big house until crooked affair be straightened out that time being valuable must require handsome fee for service squire professed quite willing that thing must be so arranged be scarcely so dense a carrington believed to be saw that visitor be anxious to make money concluded that perhaps be best to settle matter on coldly legal basis cut dried situation be thus perfectly understood by men got on very amicably together on surface everything be a must be below surface thing be scarcely so pleasant rupert susceptibility for carrington dating from rugby day have received shock have looked to find in barrister intimate friend only to discover that be hard business man have carrington looked into matter without stipulating for fee have behaved a chum hendle must have gladly dealt handsomely with knowing that be not particularly successful in profession squire with memory of school hero worship in mind be dismayed to find that former idol have foot of clay that carrington be quite willing to use a mean to end rupert be by mean sentimental yet felt anxious for sympathy in present unpleasant position that sympathy must be sold a barrister be selling chilled ardent nature made le confidential with school friend than otherwise must have be everything seemed to be for sale nothing appeared to be given a gift mallien mr beatson carrington have eye to main chance even late vicar have hinted in veiled way that will must be given up if yucatan expedition be financed seemed to rupert that only true friend be dorinda who loved for not for what must get out of dorinda be nearer dearer than friend since be to be wife hendle who be deeply religious in unobtrusive way silently thanked god that have one staunch comrade such dorinda be therefore marriage must certainly be happier when founded upon so solid foundation than if be mere romantic passion for next three day two men paid daily visit to vicarage hunted high low for missing will examined paper opened book looked through pocket of old clothes turned out cupboard rupert expected that mallien being so keen about right must search also day after carrington arrival went up to london remained absent for time apparently disliked coming into contact with sharp tongued barrister probably must not return until enemy took departure carrington of course be not mallien enemy a have reason to be mallien in odd misanthropic way regarded a such therefore must not have be pleased have learned that on third day of absence dorinda entertained two men at dinner miss mallien did not like carrington more than did father for sake of helping rupert extended hand of hospitality in fact gave quite little dinner party a kit beatson miss tollart be also present master of house always objected to small entertainment a cost money dorinda paid attention to objection a claimed reasonable right to amuse nevertheless considered father feeling so far a only to ask neighbor to luncheon afternoon tea dinner when be absent yet notwithstanding concession there be always trouble when mallien returned since carrington have be invited be probable that on occasion there must be royal row dorinda did not mind a be used to row only way in must make situation bearable be by standing up for herself defying father in small matter if did not do so must bully still more for inch gave meant several ell with mild entertainment be therefore useful in preserving independence in coloring somewhat drab existence with assistance of small servant miss mallien have prepared simple appetizing meal be done full justice to by quartette of guest afterward sat in tiny drawing room enjoyed real old english evening of albert period type including game music carrington have brought jig saw puzzle from london when excitement of putting tricky picture together palled music supplied new pleasure sophy tollart who have be well trained rendered scrap of very up to date harmony began anyhow ended nowhere kit sang sentimental ballad in pleasant uncultivated tenor dorinda delighted hearer with old time song such a kathleen mavourneen robin adair finally a evening waned company gathered near open window to chat about other thing sophy recounted experience a militant suffragist kit informed everyone of what progress motor industry be making of course coming of new vicar supplied interesting conversation be miss tollart who introduced topic will arrive in fortnight explained bending black brow in quite tragic way have family of four girl hope to interest in movement vote for woman asked carrington who found sophy very amusing since knew little asserted much of course what other movement be there well see miss tollart woman rebellion be only pebble on beach humanity have other interest also then must have retorted sophy daringly until woman have vote world will never be put right thing have gone on very well so far ventured rupert only to be crushed how can say so mr hendle when there be nothing war bankruptcy silly football match smart society sophy sophy be enough to go on with cried dorinda smiling give too much to think about never think at dorinda be fainthearted about vote think will get by destroying property having hunger strike replied dorinda with shrug what do say kit kit blushed wriggled for sophy eye be on say anything know never do motor business take up attention then hurriedly changed subject lest lady love must fall foul of for shirking hope sophy will gain end easier in australia be not going to australia kit told that told mother mr beatson said carrington pricking up ear doe want to go to australia miss tollart want to go be news to observed hendle with start be news to of put in kit dismally worst of mother be that never know what will be up to next other day came to said that soon hoped to inherit annuity of two hundred year intended to go to australia want sophy to come with hendle dorinda carrington exchanged glance who be leaving annuity to mother asked rupert guessing source of windfall did say replied kit old aunt fancy want to go with mother sophy never get on well together how can when want everyone to bow down to said miss tollart who hated mr beatson thoroughly be not of bowing down sort when marry want house to myself natural enough observed carrington who be listening eagerly mr beatson want to live together on annuity not exactly that said kit reluctantly wo keep hope that in australia will make more money out of motor may hope said sophy positively if be disappointed will have to be be not going to australia kit father need care ca leave seemed to carrington between kit mother future wife father poor young fellow be in most uncomfortable position however for obvious reason connected with sophy did not say so contented with remark that thought dr tollart very clever when came down here first called in to get cure for toothache gave one acted like charm sophy who seemed to have deep affection for disreputable parent colored with pleasure a rose to go father have fault be very clever man said emphatically for failing must be in harley street a specialist great men have more room for fault than small men quoted carrington look angry miss tollart really mean what say father be clever be glad to hear that one doe justice said girl bitterly looking more womanly a spoke usually everyone be against kit will help to keep straight when be married mr beatson must drive crazy sophy sophy be mother expostulated kit blushing know that snapped miss tollart tartly be only thing have against a husband so long a life at distance well be use talking dorinda be going now went out to put on hat cloak while kit stood irresolutely by door have just opened looking so downcast that hendle clapped on back cheer up old boy will be all right said feeling profoundly sorry for lad since mr beatson be decidedly very disagreeable mother then carrington put question when doe mother expect annuity say may get at time replied kit rather stiffly a did not see why stranger like barrister must interfere know very little about told be that be to get two hundred year must leave mr hendle to go to australia oh will place obstacle in path observed rupert somewhat grimly after a soon marry miss mallien there will be need for to have housekeeper be at moment before carrington must ask further question very much wished to do sophy returned evidently have be cry for eye be red emotion be quite under control after taking leave of hostess two men went away with kit seemed to be rather forlorn young couple dorinda remarked a much when returned to drawing room after seeing to door what else can expect asked carrington coolly when be connected with drunkard like tollart shrew like mr beatson so intends to go to australia doe want to hurt feeling miss mallien see father finger in say a little about father a be possible answered dorinda with rich color flushing fair cheek little a respected shady parent did not intend to discus with stranger whom disliked carrington be diplomatic enough to skate away from thin ice rupert have taken paper clothes odds end of leigh to big house remarked there can stay until hear from australian sea captain who inherits london lawyer have written will have not found yet think ever will find commented hendle soberly have searched vicarage from cellar to attic without success really believe dorinda that after leigh be dreaming that will doe exist said carrington deliberately mr beatson made away with leigh stole ca believe that protested dorinda turning pale told so before when first broached idea mr carrington be not nice woman think must commit murder there be nothing mr beatson must not do if be assured that crime must remain undiscovered insisted barrister grimly after if mr beatson did kill leigh who did rupert housekeeper knew of will of value a be in town be innocent know miss mallien that rupert be not man to commit crime there only remains mr beatson who told father when made thing safe dorinda started looked searchingly at barrister how do mean carrington smiled meaningly believe that mr beatson murdered leigh now have will intends to sell to father for annuity dorinda grew red eye grew bright how dare say thing to mr carrington in first place father must never condone crime even to gain fortune in second moment mr beatson offered to sell will must know to be guilty yes of course replied carrington soothingly naturally must hand over to police be only idea of annuity suggested idea to maybe be far fetched apologize miss mallien dorinda bowed silently did not like ironical tone in barrister spoke a felt convinced that still held to preposterous idea what be more in own mind did not consider that idea be so preposterous a declared father have be prepared to hush up matter when believed rupert to be guilty so be not improbable that must make term with mr beatson provided secured will still girl did not intend to let carrington know what thought therefore stood up for absent parent believe that mr beatson be guilty of such wicked conduct repeated after pause what ground have to say such thing well murmured carrington with shrug very good ground admit mr beatson knew about will before leigh be murdered firmly believe that be got rid of for sake of will suggestion of annuity hint that have will be trying to dispose of at price perhaps hendle have said nothing to interrupted rupert quickly after carrington have watched for last few day without seeing anything suspicious mr beatson be sly creature who will not give away easily returned barrister dryly will continue to watch there be ten o'clock hendle added a mellow tone of church bell floated through warm night must not keep miss mallien from beauty sleep dorinda did not suggest that must remain although must have liked to speak privately with lover while carrington be at elbow be impossible did not wish to talk freely in presence of man mistrusted two young men said good night to hostess went away leaving dorinda in anything happy frame of mind what have be suggested about father trading with housekeeper worried considerably there might might not be truth in idea tried to dismiss from mind must not be dismissed troubled far into small hour of morning meanwhile rupert friend sauntered leisurely homeward be so hot that did not wear coat over evening suit so dry underfoot that walked to from cottage in shoe sky be radiant with innumerable star although there be moon there be ample light in to see surrounding object through shadowy world warm peaceful young men wandered taking way across field a high road be so dusty hard for time spoke for be busy with own thought have to do with case finally carrington broke silence spoke soft a though feared listener did not press point hendle remarked significantly a little did say rather offended miss mallien be rather libellous about father know carrington if saying that greater truth greater libel be true certainly be retorted barrister for what said hold to mr beatson be guilty person yes that be trading with mallien to give what want will of course be a certain of fact a be that live have will intends to deliver to if have done so already on condition that give two hundred year annuity told son come from mythical aunt well said rupert after pause since mallien be willing to come to term with see reason why must not come to term with mr beatson always provided that be guilty be insisted carrington bluntly be use giving reason again think if thing be a say see how mr beatson part of business can be concealed will be of use to mallien unless make public if doe will have to explain how became possessed of suppose confession of deal with mr beatson must bring into trouble a accessory after fact must be wondering how mallien intends to make safe on score there be only one thing to be done hendle must wait until mallien produce will then can move be infernal messy business altogether growled big man restlessly wish be well out of want mallien to get into trouble for dorinda sake think can be pretty certain that mallien will look after own precious skin said barrister dryly if hush not word dropped voice to whisper who be that what rupert looked round a carrington caught arm pulled off footpath into clump of hazel speak whispered carrington with mouth close to rupert ear button coat a well a can over shirt front white may betray acted on own advice kept hendle well behind shelter of leafy tree now watch hendle did so with eye straining sight through shadowy night by time have seen reason of carrington action caution two men have reached red brick wall ran round park saw that postern gate through intended to pas be open tall dark figure in flowing robe be slipping out when carrington pulled friend into shelter behind hazel woman for such be closed postern stealthily after glance to right left walked swiftly along footpath going in direction whence watcher have come a swept past hazel clump rupert nearly uttered exclamation for in spite of black silk hood pulled well over head face be absolutely certain that night walker be none other than respectable housekeeper what be doing outside house at time of night whither be going must not conjecture carrington must when woman passed away into shadow whispered exultant explanation be mr beatson hendle be going to look for will quick let follow take care doe see will breathed rupert cautiously a stole out on trail what do mean have hidden will somewhere be sure now be going to get will catch red handed if be careful what luck be impossible talk interrupted carrington in savage whisper do want to give show away be wonderful chance of learning truth come hendle silently agreed with companion although found hard to believe that mr beatson be such conspirator whether night excursion have to do with missing will not must not be sure be evident that be bent upon shady business into must inquire a master adventure appealed to a welcome break in monotonous existence felt nerve thrill a with carrington followed cautiously in half light saw black figure of woman climb stile at end of meadow enter spinney belted high road by time reached emerged on to travelled thoroughfare mr beatson have vanished carrington bent to run halted moment to whisper if there be truth in belief have gone to vicarage there if anywhere have hidden will in jungle hendle nodded without reply two men sped swiftly along road until came to bend be just in time to see mr beatson vanish through rickety gate a usual be standing wide open carrington stopped dodged stooped then crossed road to run alongside hedge until halted just outside gate peering round corner with rupert breathing hard beside barrister saw that mr beatson carried lantern have just lighted for gleamed like star in darkness of tall tree can wait here whispered carrington delaying rupert who wanted to enter ground will come back way may attract attention if make noise in jungle be good advice rupert be sensible enough to take keeping well within shadow of hedge looking up avenue waited for woman return have put collar up have buttoned dress coat over shining expanse of shirt front so there be gleam of white to betray a crouched two dark figure in dry ditch under hedge with beating heart waited anxiously taking peep now then mr beatson be long time absent hendle judged about quarter of hour then unexpectedly appeared running swiftly down grass grown avenue with lantern swinging in hand at gate within touch waited to extinguish light before doing so set on ground to look at rustling parchment by gleam moment stooped with document carrington arm shot out be snatched away with shriek mr beatson straightened to face master guest have indeed be caught red handed chapter xiii confession paralyzed by extreme fright mr beatson stood a motionless a stone image staring blankly at captor with open mouth unwinking eye face be whiter than dingy parchment of have be deprived breath came went in short quick gasp echoed audibly through still night rupert looked at for moment then turned away head manhood be shamed by silent agony of miserable creature carrington more hardened by experience stooped to light read be last will testament of john hendle in vividly black latin lettering be enough to assure of truth rolling up parchment turned sternly on panic struck woman be clever fool mr beatson remarked quietly clever in getting will hiding so skillfully fool to examine so compromising document here when village policeman may pas at moment word policeman galvanized mr beatson into life action with final gasp suddenly became a seemed conscious of peril bolted down road across road sped be in spinney before two men must grasp situation for single moment stared after flying figure then simultaneously started in pursuit with terror winged foot housekeeper fled a swiftly a wind be not until brick wall encircling park again loomed through shadow that caught up to instinctively like homing pigeon made for only place where thought must be safe much a carrington grimly thought after fashion of child who belief to be free from danger when smuggled between blanket be while be fumbling with lock of postern that laid detaining hand on shoulder with terrified cry dropped on knee mercy mercy be innocent innocent wailed hugged leg in frenzy of fear here get up said barrister roughly pulling to foot come inside explain there be nothing to explain cried mr beatson suddenly defiant be not master be more than master be man who have found out stated carrington in hard tone pushing open postern walk in tell gently carrington gently said rupert sorry for shaking woman who be desperate enough to say anything do anything can deal with matter reasonably take arm mr beatson come to house can doubt give explanation sha give to muttered housekeeper trying to control shattering emotion what have got to do with must like to know be always gentleman mr hendle wish better friend spying prying watching following call man do have have call man god help woman who marries say of two made reply to aimless speech babbling incoherently mr beatson be led by hendle to house fortunately none of servant be in entrance hall when rupert opened door with latch key mr beatson swept in toward drawing room be lighted up carrington friend followed close behind to find seated in armchair fanning heated face with hood have removed color have returned self possession so that eyed pair defiantly attention be mostly directed toward carrington if look must have slain must have dropped dead there then come now said barrister when door be closed trio be alone what have got to say to sha answer snapped mr beatson viciously be going to bully think have better answer said hendle sternly be not time to play fool be against also sir be advising for good a to being against what attitude do expect to assume toward seeing how treacherously have behaved mr beatson treacherously yes listened to conversation not meant for ear reported same to mr mallien did tell so there be need for to tell mr hendle said carrington pointedly mere fact that mr mallien know about will proclaims guilt guilt guilt repeated housekeeper violently will thank sir not to use word in connection with will use be fool woman knew about will before mr leigh be murdered killed to get be lie then how do explain possession of will what be supposition demanded mr beatson more like judge than criminal if will have returned barrister smoothly believe murdered vicar to get will having found buried same in jungle then made term with mr mallien agreed to give annuity of two hundred year if passed will along to when thought that be safe went to dig will up again here be carrington pulled soiled parchment from pocket where have placed for safety doubled up into packet shook in face mr beatson changed from red to white from white to red maintained scornful look be talking nonsense said briefly perhaps put in hendle quietly wait for to talk sense will say nothing said woman obstinately in case will send for kensit give in charge must not do mr hendle indeed will do within ten minute if speak out can can exonerate exonerate stuttered mr beatson dry lip scarcely able to form word have better do so to advised carrington agreeably if snarled turning on then inspector lawson will examine do care when know be innocent well carrington shrugged shoulder be own affair ring bell hendle send one of servant down for kensit cried mr beatson when saw master walk toward fireplace to touch ivory button can explain hendle nodded returned to seat while carrington replaced will in pocket waited for confession mr beatson wiped face glared at two like tigress at bay only knowledge that be driven into corner made speak out overheard conversation with mr leigh sir said to master ignoring carrington oh did mean to know only listened a thought intended to discharge when married miss mallien fancied might explain on point to vicar understand why did report conversation to cousin mr beatson looked down sullenly know what be to be poor muttered irrelevantly be born lady through fault of spendthrift husband be reduced to act a housekeeper be only natural must try improve position so when learned about will must give property to mr mallien thought wise to make money by speaking about to why not to in first instance because be too honest burst out woman raising pale eye

same advise mr hendle to leave matter a be for day so until examine will make inquiry a to who sent letter letter be mine cried mr beatson stretching out hand rupert put into pocket will go to police if hold peace threatened for strong measure be necessary in dealing with woman agree with mr carrington go away say nothing about anything not even to mr mallien do hear what be going to do never mind know what have to do rupert walked to door opened now go to bed mr beatson tossed head moved toward door greatly wished to continue conversation defend glance at hendle stern face made change mind never have seen good tempered master so angry so decided foolishly a have talked woman be well aware that position be critical one therefore refrained from making bad worse be going will say nothing snarled when be turned out of house please said rupert nodding toward hall beast said mr beatson under breath lest servant must hear of beast sailed out of room triumphantly having secured last word so soothed angry mind hendle closed door returned to carrington take out will let have look at said in weary voice wo wait until to morrow asked carrington glancing at row have upset want to see will now may disappear again carrington took out crumpled parchment from pocket look after then can be certain that be safe all right let look at together move that lamp nearer carrington did so hendle spread out rustling sheet three four of a will be tolerably long be written a will of early nineteenth century usually be on parchment in clear scholarly hand writing being excellently engrossed excellently preserved parchment be soiled dog eared blotched here there with coffee brown stain have suffered little damage during hundred year imprisonment in muniment chest with carrington seated beside squire slowly read faded brown writing gradually made master of content when came to signature of testator name of two witness drew long breath looked at barrister in frank dismay seems quite legal said in despairing voice quite agreed carrington so far ca see anything wrong john hendle by rupert struck parchment leaf property with exception of sundry legacy to people now dead buried to eunice hendle afterward eunice filbert heir yes leigh said a much frederick must have be disinherited have will be produced in year wonder how got lost frederick may have did interrupted barrister sharply frederick knew nothing about must have put into fire expect john hendle made rather solicitor did then threw into chest where be overlooked queer that solicitor did mention when old man died perhaps did said rupert sadly know nothing of what took place at hendle death save frederick inherited that there be question of eunice coming into property same be left to descendant so mallien a sole representative inherits will dispute will asked carrington anxiously said rupert putting document into pocket seems fair enough must act honorably when mallien return will give to rather will take to family lawyer along with mallien lose property honor said young man gravely be dearer to than money chapter xiv clue needle to say a have be agreed to keep discovery secret for present hendle did not discharge mr beatson forthwith such action justifiable though must have be might lead to awkward question being asked carrington for obvious reason advised caution a thing now stood housekeeper must keep silent for own sake so next day went about usual duty a if nothing have happened none of servant knew about excursion a be supposed have remained in own room according to usual custom so far a outside world be concerned everything be safe two men have time to look into matter at leisure made rupert gorge rise to have treacherous woman under roof until be assured of truth of will did not dare to get rid of driven to bay mr beatson being woman who must wreck continent for whim must ruin everyone else in whirlwind of rage being left alone nursed disappointed anger in secret rupert expressed intention be to take will up to london show to family lawyer who must be able to explain matter have intended to do very next day carrington dissuaded from being too impulsive be use for squire to burn boat too soon said astute barrister to make public document must be to burn boat with vengeance think must take time turn matter over in mind observed carrington artfully be just a well to be cautious see what gain by waiting argued squire most honest thing to do be to take will to lawyer will have to do sooner later know will questioned carrington significantly of course what do take for if carrington have spoken mind must have answered that took young man for superfine fool to throw away fine position fine house fine income out of sheer honesty be not carrington notion of common sense then barrister notion of right wrong have become somewhat warped by struggling life penniless man be always more unscrupulous in dealing with money matter than one who have never be poor seemed to carrington that friend self sacrificing honor be result of ignorance have hendle lived from hand to mouth must not be so ready to surrender possession moreover carrington wanted to pick rupert pocket a mallien surmised must be real reason why urged not to strip of wealth such urging have to be done delicately for squire be by mean man to be handled easily with in mind barrister replied carefully did not translate real thought into word take for one of best fellow in world said warmly there be such thing a overdoing honesty know know retorted other positively one must be one thing other there can be tampering with honor of course not must never suggest such thing however do suggest that must wait for day so before seeing lawyer why forget that will be mixed up with crime if lawyer decide that mallien must have money matter be bound to be made public in case will become known to lawson leigh possessed will leave to guess what complication will ensue hendle tugged at brown moustache moodily be infernally difficult business said after pause what do suggest carrington rejoicing that have succeeded thus far have answer ready suggest that wait for few day meanwhile come with to vicarage what for to look at sundial see where will be buried what good will do one never know said carrington sententiously who do think buried will man who murdered leigh to get name pouf ask how do know mr beatson well why not a well a have much to gain by possessing will will be in possession last night for chance of stumbling across when went to unearth must never have known ca think that mr beatson bad a be must commit murder mused squire reflectively after if have will on night leigh be got rid of committed crime why must bury dear fellow be where woman artfulness come in said carrington quickly have to give reason for possessing will by hiding in hole then writing to herself anonymous letter saying where be to be found doe away with suspicion against not in mind apparently said hendle dryly of course not long course of criminal law have opened eye to habit of animal may be unduly suspicious grant still fact remains that story mr beatson told last night be too thin granting that woman be innocent why must real criminal tell where to find risked life to obtain doe seem strange yet oh be full of scruple hendle cried barrister pettishly what be mr beatson to that must defend so warmly be woman have great respect for woman carrington made grimace answer like raw boy experience of sex have not led to respect single one yet know dorinda there speaks lover well then do respect if concession will satisfy chivalrous idea believe cock bull story of mr beatson certainly respect do same credit story carrington shrugged shoulder at persistent optimism then let agree to consider innocent until prove to be guilty must see that if interview lawyer to day within week whole avalanche of trouble will descend on thick head well replied squire wavering will wait for few day a advise wonder what dorinda will say tell said barrister quickly for be difficult enough for to deal with one honest person without tackling second will tell father about discovered will if do care if doe have to know time since be so deeply concerned in matter hendle said carrington seriously be child say word to mallien to daughter who might tell until have seen lawyer be common sense on reflection rupert be obliged to confess that be since cousin must certainly make trouble straightway must be best to have opinion of lawyer beforehand so that situation might be adjusted so far a possible before probable inheritor came into matter of course knew that dorinda must tell father nothing if asked to keep silent to so ask must be to lay burden on mallien be suspicious brooding pertinacious if thought that be keeping anything from certainly must never rest until learned what be will not tell dorinda until have seen lawyer said rupert will see in two three day now let go out for walk to vicarage if like ca stay indoors worrying over thing at present can not remedy come wo be better for to have look at will before go think so know will by heart have locked safely away carrington disinherits frederick from whom be descended legally enough if lawyer be of same opinion with larger knowledge why then cousin must enter into own there be statute of limitation know hinted carrington pointedly will take advantage of of anything else if can do so consistently with honor what be use of arguing said hendle with burst of bitterness for position pained greatly can hing just now let go for walk carrington be too politic to press matter further a saw how squire winced have by mean given up hope of inducing hendle to refrain from publishing possible loss of estate intended to talk about affair when young man be more off guard now with diplomatic skill bred from year of experience of shady doings put on straw hat sauntered out of door along with host talking of many matter have nothing to do with burning question of disputed inheritance a walked down avenue carrington spoke of matter really interested be of qualm felt when passing under spreading branch of oak have felt that qualm before when have first visited barship in same place be walking over grave again muttered uneasily although must not confess to superstition coincidence struck a disagreeable what be asked rupert absently have be busy with own painful thought have not paid much attention to companion light nothing know saying that when one shiver have what scotch call grue one be walking over one grave well have such uncanny feeling in very avenue when came to see first now hang have again like hendle now more attentive laughed lawyer superstitious oh bosh be not in least superstitious there be thing be hard to explain be gone carrington wiped perspiring face looked round with air of relief what be gone that feeling of walking over own grave rubbish said hendle who be much too stolid to believe in such thing expect be only sudden chill dare say although be odd must get chill in blazing sunshine muttered barrister who be more impressed than cared to admit there be more thing in heaven earth what well worn quotation need bucking up come into inn will have tankard like drinking in morning do never do worry have knocked out of time be feeling up to mark come along mr pansey have known day of life be distinctly good sort often look in have chat a olympian descending among mortal said carrington smiling for by time odd feeling have passed away mr pansey who be rosy faced stout old dame received landlord with respectful joy soon supplied with tankard of cool beer acceptable to thirst on hot day carrington noted how popular rupert be with villager who came went passed repassed with curtsey touch of forelock hendle greeted one by name with kindly inquiry genial smile feeling of envy stirred barrister selfish heart cynically consoled with reflection very soon rupert must be ousted in favor of mallien out of sheer annoyance with favorite of fortune must have liked to see such toppling down nevertheless for gaining of own end be determined to prevent such change of landlord meanwhile listened to incessant chatter of mr pansey be mostly concerned with new vicar nice gentleman say be observed beaming will be here in fortnight lodging with mr jones while vicarage be being put to right family come later have seen sir answered rupert promptly friend be now on way to vicarage to see what be doing may meet there think so sir came yesterday to set men to work wo come to day workman be painting papering house digging up garden making nice place of mr jabber remains on a caretaker until family arrive 'd like to stay on altogether lord bless sir must vicar do with slut be much more particular gentleman than mr leigh do hear hendle put end to landlady babble by finishing beer departing although commonplace gossip have distracted worrying mind for few moment a carrington crossed square beside host ventured remark let hurry on hendle have look at hole by sundial before workman turn up ground what good will do snapped squire sharply one never know be just a well to look round who know what assassin may not have left clue hendle stared what clue must must possibly leave carrington laughed oh be only idea silly one maybe have idea that will stumble upon clue idea carrington first walking over confounded grave business now chance of picking up impossible clue be imagination barrister laughed again said more hendle be le amiable than usual be scarcely to be wondered at considering what be in mind walked fast enough toward destination a if wished to rid of disagreeable thought by swift movement shortly came to rickety gate passed up grass grown avenue dank unwholesome not to be warmed even by blazing summer sun surroundings be same place have lost uncanny isolating atmosphere there be stir of life in house ground showed that place be waking up many men be moving in out of open door there be noise of conversation cheerful whistling scaffolding be being erected against ivy draped wall even in jungle two gardener be at work cutting down tall tangled forest of weed opening out space between tree most of men employed be stranger of village worker have be pressed into service greeted squire friend respectfully hendle nodded absently in return then strolled through bare house watching ancient paper being stripped off wall replacing of mouldering board afterward carrington walked into jungle at far end of winding path found lichen covered sundial half buried among luxuriant weed have not yet be disturbed say hendle remarked carrington a crushed lush grass under foot dial be pretty well hidden in jungle yes gather from continued barrister musingly that must not be easy to find rupert nodded not unless person knew where to find answered exactly well then if assassin of leigh be stranger must never have buried will in place of knew nothing infer that assassin of leigh be not stranger do that make believe still more that mr beatson be guilty person knew where to find sundial in tangle of greenery in darkness of night therefore must have oh let give benefit of doubt retorted squire cutting short theorizing walking forward to peer among weed say here be hole not very deep one certainly be willow hole earth have simply be scraped away for few inch document deposited loose mold heaped up in kind of miniature mound at least two presumed so a mr beatson have swept aside small quantity of earth when uncovering parchment there be nothing much to see after staring for moment so hendle turned away moodily scarcely have done so when carrington touched on shoulder drew attention to small object glittered in long grass near edge of hole what be that asked pointing with finger rupert said nothing stooped picked up object why said in tone of surprise be jewel mallien wear on watch chain barrister exclaimed also a stared at gleam in hendle hand certainly be opal in matrix to mallien have drawn attention at first meeting such distinctive ornament be not easily forgotten after look exclamation drew back pondered surely mallien never nonsense nonsense interrupted squire sharply what can mallien have to do with matter be what be trying to think out said carrington dryly must admit that be strange what be strange asked rupert determined not to commit finding ornament here near where will be hidden if have found on high road now yes yes be odd admit interrupted squire again that doe not prove mallien implication in sorry business prof that be here in secluded spot at one time since lost opal among grass mallien may have wandered round garden a be doing came deliberately here because will be found in place by mr beatson what took mallien to sundial rupert slipped ornament into waistcoat pocket will find difficult to fasten guilt of crime on mallien said dryly say that because man be miss mallien father wish to shield returned barrister coolly same if lawson for instance knew circumstance must build up very pretty case against disagreeable friend a how mallien knew about will before leigh be murdered a know from story of mr beatson will meant much to so be just possible that came to vicarage to get from leigh failing to get given to freely struck ca believe that what else can believe when ornament know belongs to mallien be found on edge of hole where will be buried mallien may be able to explain oh undoubtedly more precisely explains le will believe explanation have missed ornament may be sure long ago have have plenty of time to make up story accounting for loss however whether be guilty innocent finding of opal in matrix will settle in what way hang hendle be slow in uptake cried carrington exasperated why child must understand have to do be to go to mallien threaten to show jewel to lawson calling a witness accusing of murdering vicar then will climb down wo need to consider with regard to fortune rupert said nothing for moment turned on heel forced way through tangled path back to rickety gate when barrister be well on road home spoke again very dryly seems to carrington that regard a man who will do anything for money think told that honor be dearer to than money intend to give up property to mallien if be legally even if leaf a will pauper finding of jewel will make difference understand yes if man be guilty must be punished ca be sure if be guilty carrington laughed grimly seems to that what have discovered be excellent proof of guilt when taken in connection with known fact of case want to think about must for sake of justice if not for own sake confound hendle take advantage of chance providence have placed in hand to save skin only mr beatson know about will being discovered only know about jewel brings mallien perilously near gallows for sake will hold tongue can have timon on toast there be something in carrington ca expect to hold tongue for nothing oh term wo be exorbitant of course added barrister making light of knavery a poor man must make hay while sun shine oh be opinion be asked rupert dryly on receiving smiling nod walked on rapidly in silence have laid trap for carrington man have fallen into be little more than blackmailer who be prepared to make use of power to enrich to prevent such thing rupert temporized although must scarcely stop from catching carrington by throat hurling into ditch must give time to think over matter said hendle at last oh there be hurry be on same string know can make mallien squeal now yes assented rupert wondering that man must think capable of such baseness can make squeal chapter xv circumstantial evidence rupert felt very uncomfortable be bad enough to have mr beatson in house when knew how treacherous be be worse to entertain carrington a guest barrister undoubtedly be determined to make money at cost of honor what be more must probably gain end unless truth came to light truth required to adjust matter be to learn beyond question what be name of individual who have murdered vicar if indeed mallien be culprit rupert felt that be in carrington power be impossible to allow truth to come to lawson ear a then mallien must be arrested there must be public scandal yet if carrington who knew detail be not bribed largely to keep silence seemed likely that must denounce miserable man of course a yet hendle must not be certain that cousin have committed crime circumstance be against if police took up matter ruin must stare mallien in face for dorinda sake such publicity be not to be thought of for one moment hendle have love for cousin who be a disagreeable selfish mortal a ever existed be capable of most unscrupulous conduct to feed egotism rupert thought with degree of truth that very egotism in question must prevent man from risking neck yet even if be innocent a rupert tried hard to believe for dorinda sake evidence against be very strong mallien thanks to mr beatson knew about will before leigh death discovery of ornament near sundial proved that have be where will be buried also possession of will meant fortune to mallien sole reason for vicar must have be murdered be for criminal to obtain possession of parchment indeed be very certain that if inspector lawson became possessed of fact must not have slightest compunction in arresting mallien in doing best to have hanged evidence be certainly purely circumstantial so strong that rupert felt convinced judge jury must accept a positive truth failing mr beatson whom squire did not believe to be guilty really looked a though mallien with greedy nature bad temper have struck fatal blow never be man in such dilemma carrington afraid of losing chance remained at big house kept strict watch on mr beatson on mallien that gentleman have returned from london in best of spirit having managed to pick up most wonderful ruby for small price hendle have be under impression that when so much be at stake cousin must abandon hobby to prosecute search for will push on a rapidly a possible claim to property mallien never came near place according to dorinda be wholly taken up with arranging collection of gem in new set of cabinet abstinence from action at critical period argued fear on man part lest dangerous information must come to light if made too conspicuous more more rupert became convinced that cousin be guilty person did not know very well how to act must not talk to dorinda a what have to say be too terrible be unable to converse freely with carrington since now mistrusted so greatly of course carrington never guessed that such be case a rupert kept careful guard over word action so that barrister believed that friend be quite willing to act in dishonorable way suggested what carrington did suggest be that rupert must inform mallien of what have be discovered then threaten to denounce to police if did not surrender claim to property then will must be thrown into fire mr beatson must be sent to australia with sum of money to close mouth must end up with marriage of hendle dorinda for suggestion for service rendered in connection therewith carrington plainly stated that required sum of five thousand pound after beating round bush for time during next two day carrington informed hendle frankly of scheme of amount expected for carrying out then rupert forgot caution told old school friend in most indignant way what thought of two men be walking in park one morning when explosion took place rupert a usual be unable to remain in house quietly since very painful thought did not permit to take interest in anything be on leg from morning until night barrister for obvious reason since wished to poison mind always hung round with suggestion of what must be done to hush matter up on particular morning did more than suggest a be growing weary of hendle sluggish reluctance to deal with matter therefore put proposal into plain word mentioned price rupert lost temper wheeling on in fury knocked down carrington be so amazed startled by sudden rebellion on part of sheep that remained on grass tongue tied staring up at big man who stood by furiously angry think must be be mad stuttered barrister be not mad villain said hendle between teeth think be a big scoundrel a be be not now know carrington pulled together rose stiffly tenderly feeling left eye be growing black will make pay for said savagely turned threatening face on hendle can do what like be not afraid of retorted squire indifferently a trouble have taken place there will be need for to return to house can go away luggage will be sent down to station can send to hendle arm said carrington making up mind swiftly a to best course of action intend to leave place until get what want wo get five thousand pound anyhow five thousand penny can tell said hendle with usually kind eye growing hard not from perhaps since be such fool mallien mallien can defend what doe have nothing to do with have lot to do with dor if mention that name will knock down again shouted squire carrington be wise enough to take hint being coward at heart a bully be must like to know why knocked down at complained in sulky tone did so because be little else than blackmailer how dare use that word to cried carrington black with rage must have struck quondam friend that knew from experience that must get worst of in struggle might ensue what other word applies to conduct demanded hendle fiercely a old school chum have treated well have shown hospitality a know very well how do repay by threatening to make thing hot for if buy silence with large sum of money did threaten to make thing hot for protested carrington snarling like disappointed dog only suggested that must hush up matter of murder will yes pay to hold tongue what else be that blackmail if be dishonorable enough to agree to term request for money must only be first of many swear must ask more blackmailer say that until get victim in toil by first payment then show in true color wonder be not ashamed carrington to behave so basely be not behaving basely cried barrister furiously be poor admit want money proposed be to own advantage so that might get hold over by persuading to hush up felony so take penny posse that posse sneered carrington recklessly throwing off mask now no longer protection why mallien must have money mallien will get when will be looked into by lawyer take to to morrow know that be honorable know that be fool snarled baffled man if strip of property to give to mallien will be better for will go to say what know be villain enough for anything go if choose hendle said carrington almost unable to grasp fact that relation between rupert have so suddenly changed for worse what doe mean have said little more morning than said to before only now do object rupert who be going away stopped to face enemy objected all along a might have seen if have not be blinded by own wickedness carrington word said made loathe more more sole idea have be to get money out of thought be gentleman friend whereas be villain blackmailer go on go on said carrington becoming very white breathing very hard will make pay for insult be impossible to insult retorted squire contemptuously such worm a be doe feel insult a to making pay have hold over know can take away property by telling mallien of will being found will tell so need trouble can tell lawson about mallien guilt oh a to that ca prove that be guilty said hendle coolly a wo kill goose with golden egg will say nothing to lawson if mallien buy silence come along have have enough of can go away do worst if go straight away will make public scandal by kicking out of gate be nothing more than bully know be not strong enough to fight said carrington furiously very wisely moving in direction of gate quite so if be bully must thrash life out of for daring to insult with base proposal a have done have got off very lightly considering thing now march hold d d tongue carrington have to do a be bidden for big man looked at in quiet imperious way meant trouble with must be dignified step baffled villain walked over grass toward distant gate without opening mouth a passed out into road turned for one moment to make last threat rupert guessed from malevolent expression on face that be about to refer to dorinda made quick step toward carrington winced cringed shut mouth sped down road at remarkably quick pace have be turned out of paradise where have expected to live in clover for rest of life with hendle under thumb knew that closed gate divided forever from old school friend therefore did curse not hendle for being such fool carrington be far too egotistic to lay blame on own shoulder a invariably believed method to be perfect however having lost chance of obtaining money from rupert only remained for to get somewhere else naturally mallien be first person thought of since gentleman by inheriting property must have wherewithal to pay carrington intended to remain night at hendle arm to place portmanteau be sent during afternoon next day to return to london must much rather have stayed on to attend to nefarious business position be bound to be disagreeable when villager learned that have be turned out of squire house so be best to leave place in meantime hoped to bring mallien to knee with idea wrote short peremptory note to man asking to come to inn at eight o'clock for interview concerning safety sent up by hand to cottage on reply must depend what attitude must take up toward dorinda father if mallien refused to come such refusal must hint that be strong enough to fight if came in answer to so insolent message arrival assuredly must show that be afraid of what might come out therefore when curt line so be brought to barrister saying that mr mallien must be at inn a requested carrington felt that have won first move of game man be afraid must be a well to take advantage of fear also seeing what have be discovered be difficult to understand how mallien must save mr pansey be somewhat surprised when squire guest took up quarter for night in house wondered what must be reason carrington afraid of making bad worse did not give simply stated that must eat sleep there before leaving for london by eight o'clock train in morning engaged sitting room bedroom enjoyed very good dinner shortly before mallien put in appearance gentleman swaggered into stuffy little room in usual truculent manner carelessly dressed in gray flannel because evening be hot glittering with jewel after usual fashion what dickens do mean by writing to a have done blustered visitor when door be closed a have come dare say can guess retorted carrington coolly have be bullied by rupert who be strong enough to thrash did not intend to be dominated by mallien who be weaker also hendle being honest mallien rogue barrister felt le at disadvantage be certain that visitor be not one who must hesitate to accept term however shady so long a purpose be served ca guess growled mallien sitting down aggressively demand explanation what do want five thousand pound said carrington thinking be useless to beat about bush with brother knave what for for certain information will be of service to oh if mean will carrington be not going to pay something for nothing retorted mallien viciously know sooner later will be certain to be found when be hendle be not man to dispute possession of what be rightfully mine will have be found be in hendle possession said carrington with keen look mallien stared changed color never told here started to foot let pas be off to see rupert get will unfortunately wo give to wo give to intends to take to london to morrow place in hand of family lawyer oh well mallien sat down again that will be right once be in hand will see have right have seen will may ask yes leaf property to eunice filbert descendant have mallien expanded chest in gratified manner then get property be right where be will found where buried man jumped up once more spluttering angry what devil do mean sir mean murdered leigh stole will buried under sundial in vicarage garden be information for ask five thousand pound to be paid when come into property mallien staggered against wall with outspread hand be mad to accuse of of of murdering vicar be not mad will be if refuse money only for five thousand pound will hold tongue have nothing to hold about stormed mallien savagely oh yes have sit down listen wo mallien made for door very good then go to morrow will be arrested before noon will go straight to tarhaven in morning to explain thing to inspector lawson for own safety have much better let explain to mallien hesitated then returned to seat be talking rubbish said pulling beard in embarrassed manner have nothing to do with murder must have come here have guessed must talk to in way carrington now master of situation laughed way in letter be worded compelled to come be lie then why be here who hate who be bully taunted barrister there be door walk out of if dare le talk cried mallien savagely go on explain on what ground dare to accuse oh very good now be talking sense carrington related adventure have to do with discovery of buried will by mr beatson subsequent passing of document into hendle hand have at present moment continued barrister intends a said to take to solicitor to morrow if property be yours a think be will be done full justice to a hendle be not man to keep what doe not belong to rupert fool honest enough said mallien shortly looking very much relieved well what have to do with infernal insolence in asking for five thousand pound by own showing there will be trouble about getting what be mine have told why ask for money retorted carrington tartly make repeat again again what already know what be demanded mallien willfully blind murdered leigh if will have did not murder leigh have reason to do so oh yes have wanted will remember that kensit declared oh about disordered paper struck in mallien wiping face what evidence be that when everyone know that leigh kept study like pigsty paper be more in disorder than usual sufficiently upset for policeman to think that search have be made coroner jury thought nothing of evidence in respect said mallien with uneasy sneer because existence of will be not known replied carrington meaningly once be known strong motive be supplied for killing of leigh rupert have a much reason to murder leigh a have agree with since be so scrupulously honest if money be yours will have so why must hendle murder man to get what in end must not benefit now tell carrington did not touch man vociferated mallien bosh struck down got will buried under sundial a know then made use of mr beatson to avert suspicion from by sending anonymous letter telling where be did send letter insisted mallien looking gray worn did be in town for few day while be away housekeeper got letter since have promised annuity of two hundred year knew very well that must give will to rather than to hendle be very clever scheme mallien be talking rubbish cried man in consternation for saw how strong be evidence against how can prove be at vicarage on night where be opal in matrix asked carrington glancing at mallien watch chain significantly lost hesitated other did hendle found in presence near sundial on very verge of hole wherein buried will listener made inarticulate noise clutched hair be fate be fate muttered everything be against yet be innocent prove that be so said carrington leaning back in chair indolently smiling mallien hesitated then seeing that barrister knew so much rushed into explanation must not have made to le well informed person be a if dam have broken so volubly did word come tumbling out carrington listened attentively be at vicarage on night confessed visitor swiftly after mr beatson told thought must get will from leigh since be not sure if rupert must act straightforwardly knowing hendle a do why did think that most honest of men might hesitate before stripping of wealth retorted mallien sharply however be not to point made up mind to go then changed again went to bed determined to go in morning unable to sleep decided to visit vicar on night rose putting on clothes went out a left cottage heard church clock chime eleven oh sneered carrington remembering hour of murder then did not commit crime did snarled mallien viciously got to vicarage in darkness of avenue stumbled against man who be know clutched by throat struggled then got away probably wrenched opal ornament from watch chain missed next day surmised that have lost in wrestling match after man fled went to house peered into study through window saw leigh lying apparently dead on floor be seized with fright lest must be accused of killing saw position in moment a may guess must have given alarm said carrington quietly oh must sneered other must have done so under same circumstance must perhaps returned barrister ambiguously quite see that be in very awkward position of course be if fact of will came to light might have be accused of killing leigh to get did insisted carrington in spite of cock bull story hang shouted mallien fiercely clenching fist tell did not thing happened a say ran back to cottage determined to hold tongue let thing take course be why have made move about will man struggled with in avenue be criminal got opal how then did hendle find opal near sundial know returned mallien moodily if tell police can only repeat story be repeating now want to tell police said carrington mildly term know about infernal term just a know be in fix be innocent be difficult for to defend against circumstantial evidence then agree to term will hold tongue what be use rupert know a much a do hendle wo speak because of daughter be true mallien hesitated then burst out must give time to make up mind will give week said carrington readily for did not wish to press man too hardly hanky panky remember hold in hollow of hand if have murdered leigh said mallien deliberately must murder in hope of saving a be will take week to consider term man with snarl went out abruptly chapter xvi new witness squire be relieved when turned carrington out of house a felt how impossible be to live under same roof with scoundrel be still more relieved on hearing that man have gone to london by early train hoped that prudence must keep at safe distance from barship a yet knew nothing of late friend interview with mallien did mallien appear at big house to report conversation hendle have uneasy feeling that barrister must not hold tongue unless well paid to do so undoubtedly knew many thing revelation of must prove highly unpleasant if carrington went to inspector lawson with story mallien might be arrested disgrace must break dorinda heart therefore for girl sake be necessary to make move what action must be taken rupert did not very clearly see passed uncomfortable morning turning thing over in mind rather regretted impetuosity have led to deal so sharply with dangerous man however consoled with proverb that what be done must not be undone of one thing hendle be sure that carrington must only tell police what knew when chance of getting money to hold tongue be at end must certainly wait until mallien be placed in possession of property before taking step being case rupert felt convinced that sudden scandal must disturb present position of affair man who gain time gain everything rupert mindful of saying determined to make best use of time be in hurry began to think of what must be done to adjust matter at first a have told carrington intended to see family solicitor about will on second thought decided to interview mallien beforehand moment john hendle will be placed in other hand to be dealt with certain amount of publicity must assuredly ensue in case mallien might find in awkward position although rupert must not bring to believe that cousin be guilty of so brutal murder nevertheless circumstantial evidence be undeniably strong on whole squire decided that must be wise to interview mallien before handing document to lawyer unless man must exonerate fully seemed dangerous to hand over at there must be little sense in mallien gaining fortune if necessary step to place in possession of must only be taken at risk of liberty perhaps of life position be extremely difficult unpleasant puzzling hendle scarcely knew what be best to be done finally concluded to give matter careful consideration for twenty four hour before acting so far hendle intention be sensible considering awkward position in be placed be diplomatist having stirred up carrington to hostility proceeded indiscreetly to deal in somewhat abrupt manner with mr beatson having got rid of one shady person wished to get rid of other already have stated that must send away mr beatson have never believed that must act immediately on determination be therefore greatly dismayed when summoned into library after luncheon intimated that be to go why must go demanded woman with air of martyr duty say nothing about duty ca have person under roof who listens to conversation not meant for ear then must have secret cried mr beatson furiously did listen intentionally know that must have listened at said rupert coldly bracing to meet trouble have intention of making what not to protect when thought of turning out there be protection needed on score said squire politely have intention of turning out then why be turned out now demanded housekeeper in most exasperatingly illogical way because of behavior think that there be need to explain further to day be saturday must leave on monday oh very well sir with year wage mind oh will give three month wage may consider lucky that give at will go to law rupert shook head reprovingly must if be dealing with will wo bear looking into have done nothing wrong said mr beatson becoming tearful ah idea of morality differ from mine be not going to argue point said rupert pointing to door can go now will tell know about will threatened woman desperately a please in two day will go to lawyer if mr mallien inherits will become owner of place have hold over there mr beatson believe murdered mr leigh wish be father to thought replied hendle dryly well then if did that horrid mr carrington did why do say that why did turn out of place yesterday retorted housekeeper for very good sufficient reason doe concern baffled by master calmness woman walked defiantly toward door anxious to hurt yet unable to do so when mr mallien get money will never allow to marry daughter said spitefully rupert raised eyebrow made reply be unwilling to take by shoulder thrust out of room so all must do be to remain silent until venom exhausted a be usually case when man deal with woman weakness of mr beatson be strength will be pauper without penny railed housekeeper rupert still said nothing turned toward fireplace to pick up pipe mr beatson finding that supplied fuel for anger have more to say retired fuming with temper master lighted pipe sat down to consider once more how must best deal with situation be faintly nervous a occurred to that perhaps must have be better to deal le boldly with housekeeper barrister on second thought decided that be acting straightforwardly that have be just a well to take bull by horn mr beatson went to room put on best clothes sallied forth bent upon samson like intention of pulling roof down on own head be in such rage that did not mind being hurt personally so long a rupert suffered doubtless when doings recoiled on must be sorry that have acted like fool at present moment did not consider consequence wanted be to hurt one to make thing unpleasant round rupert hated for discharging carrington loathed because have brought a considered shady doings to light dorinda because be engaged to hendle even hated although have never harmed did not contemplate hurting since hoped to receive annuity how intended to make thing uncomfortable did not very well know commenced operation by walking toward son lodging in village must tell everything leave to deal with insulted honor kit might agree with squire in reprobating eavesdropping never struck for single moment be in much too great rage to be reasonable kit be not at home landlady said that have gone to luncheon at dr tollart mr beatson snorted when heard a did not wish kit to marry girl objected to keeping company with still bent upon relieving mind of burden made for doctor house be at far end of village speedily arrived at front door servant informed that dr tollart be absent on round must be back soon meanwhile miss tollart be within along with mr christopher beatson servant having feminine sympathy with lover did not ask marplot to step in mr beatson brushed aside like fly stalked into drawing room where heard gay voice went to lodging learned that be here kit said mr beatson grimly philandering a usual instead of earning livelihood young couple rose in dismay at sight of uncomfortable woman who be always like stormy petrel sophy be first to recover immediately took up arm on behalf of kit be saturday said coolly if kit work week have right to one holiday suppose during seven day mr beatson sat down glared how do expect to welcome a daughter in law when behave toward in impertinent manner mean to be impertinent said sophy sorry for agonized expression on lover face be so unreasonable unreasonable shrieked visitor be other people who be unreasonable if only knew knew what asked kit nervously have be insulted discharged lady born bred discharged echoed sophy interrupting do mean to say that have left big house leave on monday said mr beatson getting out handkerchief beginning to sob oh insult have received mr hendle must be thrashed have come to ask son to thrash kit bounced out of seat in dismay why mr hendle be best friend owe everything to be right go against mother wailed mr beatson be just like father who be always coward bully kit be said sophy indignantly little a think of men who wo give vote think great deal of kit bother vote cried mr beatson suddenly recovering composure a be evident that tear did not help going on be silly silly well like when be trying to vindicate cause of oh sophy make row interrupted kit who saw how two glared at one let hear what mother have to say have great deal to say said mr beatson savagely if young people will only hold tongue a young people must in presence of older wiser older certainly not wiser pertly said miss tollart for sake sophy implored kit seeing that mother be stiffening for royal row want to hear why mr hendle have discharged word be enough to recall mr beatson to memory of wrong proceeded volubly to discourse about same yet even a began occurred to that must be a well to bind young couple to secrecy for present a hendle hint about law lingered uncomfortably in mind after judge jury might be silly enough to condemn behavior what have to tell must keep to yourselves said solemnly looked to see if door be closed be matter of life death kit looked scared at exordium even sophy bold a be began to feel nervous knew what reckless person future mother in law be wondered what have be doing to justify so grave request kit will say anything promised catching at lover hand for comfort hope be nothing very serious be said mr beatson ironically unless consider death of mr leigh serious what kit jumped up with face a white a chalk said mother irritably get on nerve be bad enough a be paused then continued rather pleased with sensation be making know great deal about murder oh miss tollart eye grew large round became filled with curiosity have idea a to who murdered mr leigh have what be about to tell keep to yourselves have promised that snapped sophy for mysterious talk be irritating greatly what be know must begin at beginning said mr beatson solemnly taking advantage of situation when son know will expect son to defend honor against mr hendle asked kit nervously have behaved like brute cried mr beatson flaming up bad a be be not so bad a nasty mr carrington lawyer said sophy curiously what have to do with if will only let speak will explain said mr beatson in dignified manner go on mother said son impatiently keep on tenterhook mr beatson frowned severely not seeing way to answer began to relate grievance be characteristic of profound belief in own rectitude that told everything plainly baldly never thinking that listener must condemn what have done from moment when squire have informed her of intention to marry miss mallien forthwith down to interview have just taken place housekeeper detailed have happened concealing nothing exaggerating great deal naturally made out to be martyr be greatly annoyed when brought story to end to see disgust written on sophy face dismay on face of son what do mean by glaring at in way demanded after waiting for comment be not made a speedily a expected think that have behaved at well said sophy bluntly seeing that kit be speechless what do mean by demanded mr beatson bristling impertinence mother struck in young man quietly recovering speech if matter be to be discussed may a well discus reasonably ask for nothing better have be disgracefully treated said kit pulling together becoming manly heroic have business to listen to mr hendle mr leigh have business to tell mr mallien what overheard have business to meddle with will hear hear said sophy clapping hand agree with kit a have behaved so badly to mr hendle see what must do send away after speechless pause mr beatson appealed to son kit will sit there hear insulted sophy doe mean to insult mother said kit quietly looking a white a be determined must be reasonable be reasonable cried mother violently there never be such unreasonable person a be own son turn against wailed exasperating woman again taking out handkerchief to sob own son nursed a baby kit sophy looked at other helplessly wholly undecided how to deal with impossible woman mr beatson only saw thing in own way expected everyone else to see a concluded must be seen have common sense have logic have control over temper when anyone disagreed with made objectionable in way miss tollart face to face with unreasonable feminine nature heaved sigh well wonder that get vote mourned be in least ready for hush sophy said kit touching hand must understand more about matter ca be allowed to rest here promised to hold tongue shrieked mr beatson rather scared by look on son face will do so so far a be consistent with honor retorted kit bluntly be not going to allow mr hendle to get into trouble have be good friend to mother good friend to if have spark of gratitude toward must never have behaved a have done how dare speak to in way because time be past when must play tyrant tyrant tyrant to mother who bore wish to be disrespectful mother be so unreasonable that compel to be so be very well so far a thing be between ourselves in story have told serious matter be concerned share in be not honorable can do what like said mr beatson in more subdued tone for attitude taken up by son impressed unpleasantly be no longer boy to be bullied man to be conciliated ca do what like when doings bring into trouble with law insisted kit sophy nodded approbation be odd considering how dared authority a suffragist in own way be a unreasonable a mr beatson although must never have admitted a much must have be indignant at mere suggestion wo get into trouble with law said mr beatson rather nervously that depends upon what step police take police know nothing said housekeeper hastily police will know mother think so honorable gentleman a mr hendle will allow thing to remain a be be innocent be have reason to kill mr leigh because of will be likely to leave pauper say be innocent shouted kit stamping expression on face be such a to reduce mother to frightened silence nothing will ever make believe that mr hendle must act in such wicked way then be mr mallien whimpered mr beatson said sophy quickly mr mallien know well enough that mr hendle will act honorably about will must not risk neck to get document knew mr hendle must not dispute if be legal well said housekeeper still bent upon accusing someone must be surprised if nasty mr carrington be guilty mr hendle went up very next day after conversation with mr leigh to consult mr carrington might have killed mr leigh to get will so that must make mr hendle give money for quite believe that mr carrington did try to get money said kit after pause a have quarrel with mr hendle yesterday how do know that someone told mr pansey angry word passed between mr hendle mr carrington at gate of park mr carrington slept last night at inn before going to london morning did have quarrel admitted housekeeper at least suppose so a mr carrington did not stay at big house last night know if quarrel be over money a price of will mr carrington be in town on night mr leigh be murdered so can have nothing to do with sophy jumped up clapped hand be not in town on night cried with eye blazing with excitement father came down by eight o'clock train on night mr carrington came also father saw on liverpool street station afterward on barship platform kit turned on girl sharply sophy be certain yes be can ask dr tollart doe know mr carrington remarked mr beatson anxiously yes doe when mr carrington came down here first called to see father about aching tooth came to very house father did not take much notice of mr carrington on night a thought be just coming down to see mr hendle never connected mr carrington with murder now now sophy clapped hand again so excited did feel from what say mr beatson must be at surprised to hear that mr carrington be guilty ca be certain of said kit quickly be certain said mr beatson rising will tell inspector lawson what have told just to pay carrington out for poking prying must if be mother remarked kit dryly if can make thing hot for mr carrington can make thing disagreeable for better let mr hendle know first allow to attend to matter after mother said kit with shrug be assuming great deal mr carrington may be quite innocent quarrel with mr hendle may have nothing to do with will believe be guilty said mr beatson viciously said because wished to think so so do put in sophy earnestly still mr beatson must go to see inspector lawson if be might be arrested a accessory after fact know mr beatson grew white tottered have nothing to do with oh kit kit do think do think think be quite safe so long a hold tongue allow mr hendle to look into thing oh will not say word groaned mr beatson now thoroughly frightened for own skin sophy will keep silent for sake will tell mr hendle said kit firmly must will tell dorinda chimed in miss tollart be engaged to mr hendle can talk over together union be strength a know from vote for woman trouble if mr carrington intends to accuse mr mallien mr hendle will find in wrong box can call father a witness if case come into court new witness declared kit eagerly one who will put saddle on right horse mere presence of mr carrington in barship on night show that have something to do with matter ca be sure murmured mr beatson weakly for by time be becoming dreadfully nervous about share in proceeding will soon make sure when mr hendle question mr carrington a to doings in barship on night said kit decidedly now go mother hold tongue be dangerous to speak will hold tongue promised mr beatson tottered away weakly chapter xvii difficulty kit owed great deal to hendle be never backward in admitting that squire be benefactor when mr beatson first took service at big house boy be at school explained to employer that must no longer pay fee for education rupert approving of bright intelligent lad thereupon arranged for rounding off of scholastic career afterwards paid for training a engineer be due to squire kit occupied excellent position did in exploitation sale of motor also must be stated that young beatson took advantage of opportunity earning esteem approval of with whom came into contact with squire aid own brain there be chance that kit must succeed in life more than most naturally boy be deeply grateful to hendle for consistent kindness also adored a athlete who possessed out of door quality youth most admire in senior therefore distressed greatly when mother came with tale of woe kit loyal to core must not admit for one instant that benefactor be in wrong especially a knew only too well what trying woman squire have to deal with a parent kit have always found mr beatson uncomfortable since invariably used authority to force into agreement with however unreasonable idea might be like many mother mr beatson must not recognize that son be grown up have right to have own opinion be to obey in thing do what be told kit thought otherwise a view of two clashed there be always certain amount of friction between having regard to mother aggressive personality be extremely hard for young beatson to obey fifth commandment rupert knew boy difficulty in adjustment of filial duty greatly sympathized with therefore be by mean surprised when kit made appearance at big house early on sunday afternoon be to be expected that mr beatson must tell son about dismissal when hendle heard what visitor have to say be surprised to hear that woman have be so frank in explanation made kit sit down repeat story of interview then walked up down library much perplexed for boy being son of woman who have be discharged be by mean easy to talk to rupert be so kind hearted that be positive pain for to say word against anyone yet what must say in condonation of mr beatson extraordinary behavior kit saw worried look on hero face felt worried in consequence therefore did try to smooth matter of course sir know that mother be rather unreasonable remarked in low voice twisting turning straw hat quite agree with view know rupert gave boy approving glance a quite understood how unpleasant be position mother have have much trouble in life perhaps nature be rather warped what must like to do kit reflected then spoke up straightly with flush on face think must be better for to allow mother to go away for holiday instead of dismissing at once while be away can give notice can look for place in way pride will be saved why must pride be saved asked squire hastily bluntly how can answer question mr hendle of course not beg pardon kit must not have asked what say be very reasonable have wish to make thing easy for mother will take holiday can leave when have found better place kit shook young head will never find better place sir better friend said sadly have be good to more than good to wish mother must see thing a see there there rupert clapped on back know how feel what wish to say even if mother doe leave kit that need make difference to friendship certainly will not said young fellow emphatically think have acted well doe sophy mother certainly be very explicit kit wonder did not make out better case for well see mr hendle mother never think that doe wrong be very difficult thing for to say since be son quite understand why want to go suggest that must take holiday that must give notice on plea of finding place to save pride to shut people mouth think will gossip that mother will talk think that mother will talk mr hendle be much too frightened to do so a know that have not acted well sophy told so gradually came to see that have made mistake if send away people will ask reason rupert nodded straddling on hearth rug put hand behind back ca give reason other than true one be impossible to give since involves danger to other people be glad that persuaded mother to hold tongue kit be great relief for to know that miss tollart be acting so discreetly want to help sir see how of can do kit why not know story of from mother point of view know story interrupted squire hastily doe not know there be will may disinherit suppose mr hendle oh will of john hendle leaving everything to elder branch of family represented by mr mallien intend to take to lawyer to morrow after have seen cousin why not surrender property to cousin sir without taking will to lawyer questioned kit shrewdly rupert shook head wish everything to be done openly seeing what be involved mr hendle be there danger of scandal if public statement be made there be same if gave up property sneaked away people must talk truth might come out in crooked way wish to come out in straight way so intend to act a say will lose everything sir think so if will be proved to be legal then kit will have to come to ask to get situation in factory of yours boy be greatly distressed oh mr hendle talk like be wicked to think that kind hearted man like must lose property think mr mallien will make such good use of money be affair kit replied hendle with sigh may be sure that will do can do to keep property there be certain statute of limitation may help perhaps mr mallien can arrange to divide money what be use of talking rupert threw despondently into chair ca help not so far a regard property mr hendle said kit earnestly may be able to help to clear up mystery of murder rupert sat up stared what oh say that know anything for certain sir have suspicion know oh have who be suspect will tell when relate to detail unknown to mother hendle rose again restlessly walking up down thought deeply when paused again before kit have made up mind to be frank know be friend said earnestly know that be honest true be rejoined beatson emphatically especially when there be anything to be done for sir will never forget kindness to anything say will go no further than sophy why sophy asked rupert suspiciously because know so much that may a well know suspicion point in direction mine do be now with miss mallien rupert uttered ejaculation not reporting conversation with mother hope said hastily yes answered kit bluntly be better for sophy to speak to miss mallien than to mr mallien doe do suspect cousin sophy will explain when brings miss mallien here arranged to meet here shortly mr hendle kit glanced at watch dare say two lady will be here in hour did want miss mallien to know anything said hendle frowning be absolutely necessary that must know said beatson calmly a love sir be going to marry must know be always in habit of telling sophy trouble give best of advice woman be not so unreasonable a mother mr hendle anxious a be rupert must not help smiling trust not said at length sat down quietly well kit be more shrewd than gave credit for being perhaps can help after let take advantage of hour before lady arrive to go into matter must be quite frank with sir know be only fair yes will be quite frank take cigarette kit listen carefully to what have to say shortly rupert have pipe kit cigarette door window being closed hendle felt quite secure a be unlikely that mr beatson must indulge in eavesdropping again seeing what severe lesson have received hendle related slowly have happened supplied detail missing in story of mr beatson ended with short sketch of present position difficulty found in deciding what action to take kit be so interested in what be said that allowed cigarette to go out when story be ended stared tongue tied at squire rupert laughed at expression on boy face seem a perplexed a be remarked with shrug think that be perplexed said kit slowly relighting cigarette only be astonished that have not spotted right man who murdered vicar thing be too muddled for to spot anyone replied hendle dryly cousin accuses mr carrington accuses mother be ridiculous for mother to be accused said kit quietly mother have pluck to kill fly in spite of temper kit laughed what bosh 'd a soon believe sophy be guilty well only mother cousin knew about will before mr carrington knew oh yes be in town on night leigh be killed so be not in town interrupted kit sharply be in barship hendle dropped pipe stared be sure of what be saying can ask dr tollart if doubt dr tollart echoed hendle much surprised what doe know came down on evening when vicar be murdered saw mr carrington on liverpool street platform on barship platform did speak to no told sophy that mr carrington have come down that have traveled in carriage after went on beatson thoughtfully there be reason why doctor must speak have only seen mr carrington once when called on to get cure for toothache yes remember went to see doctor when first came replied rupert mechanically be in church with miss mallien carrington on way back to big house looked in about tooth on tollart paused then continued what train be one leaf liverpool street at eight arrives here at quarter past nine said hendle meditatively yes a vicar be murdered at eleven mr carrington have plenty of time to make plan ca believe that carrington be assassin muttered hendle in dismay for dreaded lest must prove accusation to be true did dr tollart connect carrington with murder if have must have spoken out took little notice of mr carrington thinking be coming down on visit to a mr carrington be with next day of course doctor believed that be a have thought yes see carrington did not come on night came by midday train next day doctor did know said kit nodding in fact thought no more about matter after told sophy only told a piece of gossip understand yes yes see that a carrington be with next day presence in eight o'clock train on previous night must arouse suspicion in tollart mind still being at barship on night doe mean that killed vicar well said kit with wisdom beyond year rather think that be very good evidence against have told about will knew what meant to what said when kicked out other day show that want large sum of money intended perhaps to stun vicar get will so a to make term with vicar having heart disease died straightway for reason mr carrington buried will sent anonymous letter to mother mr carrington did not know where sundial be how then must find in nighttime hidden a be among bush oh ca explain everything said beatson frankly must admit sir that be odd mr carrington must have be in barship on night of murder without saying word to if intention have be innocent must have come for night to true enough kit wonder where did spend night kit shrugged shoulder will have to ask really believe that be guilty person what about opal in matrix belongs to cousin be found by on verge of hole where will be buried did find well no be carrington who pointed out glittering among grass merely picked up well said kit with judicial air person who loses generally manages to find how do know that mr carrington did drop opal there when back be turned be very rapidly weaving rope for man neck observed hendle dryly after be taking great deal for granted well sir have to do be to ask mr carrington to explain humph will be awkward considering be declared enemy however will see think will be best to speak to cousin first kit agreed with suggestion then held tongue have said that must say having placed squire on guard there be nothing more to be done rupert did not pursue conversation further walked up down musing over what have heard for quite five minute there be silence then dorinda made appearance followed by miss tollart girl looked very pale anxious what doe mean rupert asked nervously what sophy have told strange story said dorinda taking seat suppose kit have told to also hendle nodded yes know that carrington be in barship on night when leigh be murdered unless of course dr tollart have made mistake father made mistake struck in sophy flushing for guessed that squire be hinting at doctor infirmity be quite sober when came home on night be waiting up for mentioned in quite casual way that mr carrington have traveled down by same train of thought anything more about matter even when heard next morning about murder thought that mr carrington have come down to see squire certainly be with next day be admitted rupert quietly being with made believe that what thought be true be not so in way real truth be that father thought anything at about matter only mr beatson hint that mr carrington might possibly be guilty made remember do think that man be guilty asked rupert quickly sophy bent dark brow in frown reflected must go into witness box swear that committed murder observed came down to barship on night if did not stay with mr hendle must have have strong reason to keep visit secret father can swear to visit yes asked again if remembered mr carrington coming down said that must of course added sophy significantly have to ask question in way not likely to arouse father suspicion a to why be asked be use letting know too much a might talk if necessary can prove what told dorinda shivered never liked mr carrington observed same ca believe that murdered mr one must have murdered said kit trifle dryly why not mr carrington rather than father squire for part going by what mr hendle have told believe mr carrington be guilty how be going to prove to be guilty well said rupert doubtfully see way save asking to explain why came down to barship on night unless give reasonable excuse will be in danger of being arrested rupert in case father will be in danger how so know that mr carrington sent for father other day have interview with at hendle arm what did wish to see father about threatened to accuse of committing crime so a to gain possession of will know exactly what passed went on dorinda anxiously a father told little really said be that be in danger of being arrested because mr carrington must give evidence against must be difficult to disprove father surely did not admit that be guilty dorinda certainly not cried girl flushing indignantly how can suggest thing a mr carrington want money be ready to say anything do anything likely to force father into paying to hold tongue rupert smiled grimly carrington know that father have not sufficient money to pay what want what doe want asked sophy looking up five thousand pound be price demanded from said hendle think will take penny le from mr mallien in order to get money carrington will have to wait until cousin be in possession of property until then can be sure dorinda that will take step to make thing uncomfortable think be right murmured miss mallien greatly relieved what be best to be done have already made up mind in first place will see father learn exactly what took place at interview afterwards can have talk with carrington then will oh let will alone until learn truth about murder urged dorinda anxiously to clear father from chance of being accused be first thing to be done see father rupert perhaps will be more frank with than be with must be frank if want to save said sophy bluntly worry dorinda opinion be that must give mr carrington plenty of rope with to hang when be fully committed then can turn table on by saying what know of presence in barship on night of murder there be nothing to be afraid of be not exactly afraid said dorinda slowly suspense be very trying with mr carrington working in dark will force to come out into open miss mallien said kit resolutely then will have to defend wo have time to accuse other people sha have everything own way anyhow hear hear cried sophy clapping hand be brick kit for part believe that mr carrington have only to be faced boldly to bring to knee rupert shook head can do damage before be forced to take up position what doe matter so long a damage wo be lasting said dorinda impatiently be certain that father be innocent so be finished hendle with shrug so there only remains carrington a possible criminal well will see anyhow a wo move until cousin be in possession of property have ample time to arrange what be best to be done meantime let keep what know to ourselves what about mr beatson hesitated sophy glancing at kit mr beatson said rupert grimly polite be going away for holiday if hears of better situation will not return here be glad of squire sophy guessing plan be to save housekeeper pride felt greatly relieved little a liked future mother in law did not wish to see disgraced now think kit have better take home have more to say began kit anxiously only to be silenced by sophy no have declared imperiously marched to door have given squire quite enough to think about then sank voice to scold be fool want to be alone oh murmured kit see submitted to be led away chapter xviii setting trap mallien by telling daughter half truth instead of whole truth have made very nervous although asked for more detailed explanation have refused to give to dorinda be therefore much relieved when sophy conducted to big house hidden matter be made more plain when in possession of fact quickly recognized that position of father be highly dangerous must carrington speak to police girl agreed with rupert that must not do so until chance of getting money for silence have disappeared even if mallien be willing such money must not be obtained until property passed from squire to cousin so if rupert refused to give up same carrington must be forced to wait be not likely that must kill goose with golden egg by speaking prematurely there be a rupert pointed out to dorinda grave doubt whether must speak at when informed that presence in barship on night of murder be known hendle intended to question barrister on point hear what defense must offer before doing so desired to see cousin enlist aid be even more to mallien interest than to rupert to bring carrington to book only by cousin joining force must accomplish end be to learn for certain who have murdered vicar assuredly seemed a though barrister be guilty person must crime be brought home to evil scheme to acquire money by blackmail must be frustrated instead of accusing mallien to police be probable that carrington must be forced to fly lest lawson must lay hand on dorinda returned home in much more comfortable frame of mind since rupert thus placed matter in better light be also more content because affair be in lover hand if anyone must be able to make crooked straight one of hendle last injunction to girl be that must say nothing to father about visit to big house warned not to repeat what have heard not to question father in way regarding dealing with carrington rupert arranged matter thus because intended to call on cousin next day have complete

receiving attention sympathy be due never seemed to strike that daughter must scarcely administer to comfort while be ignorant of necessary information nothing irritates unreasonable man more than being treated reasonably mallien scowled blackly when saw from window dorinda tripping lightly in direction of village be quite sorry for did think that own daughter have decent feeling in meditated sadly be like everyone else selfish in extreme oh be wonder hate everyone people think only of now what dickens do want hang last question asked aloud being still at window saw rupert open little

going to have own if spend last sixpence in law court thought be honourable rupert yet here talk of putting to lot of expense to get own estate hendle stared at greedy heir for such selfishness in taking advantage of innocent person misfortune be inconceivable to knew only too well that argument be useless mallien must only see thing in own way did not care who suffered so long a benefited however made one effort put in place mallien remarked mildly must surrender everything without struggle be not question retorted mallien evading reply after usual fashion property be mine intend to have will keep will a be not safe in hand indeed why not must benefit too much by destruction rupert laughed must have destroyed while be in possession without knowing anything about instead of doing so have brought to doe that look like dishonesty on part bring to because be aware that know about said mallien doggedly mr beatson told about will a know if have must have thrown into fire oh must

be not be carrington be aware that mr beatson told about will be with when found opal say that be guilty when in london sent that anonymous letter forgot know about letter yes do snarled mallien wiping perspiration from forehead carrington be very explicit at interview paused for moment then continued may a well tell everything since know so much warn rupert that nothing can say do to crush

murder be in barship be man ran across in avenue said rupert grimly wonder pointed out opal on verge of hole wherein will have be buried dropped there while back be turned allowed to find so a to incriminate mallien be thunderstruck carrington muttered sitting down again oh be impossible not at dr tollart came down with carrington in train arrives at barship shortly after nine be with understand saw at liverpool street at barship then why did tollart say so at inquest why must tollart never connected carrington with crime believed that came down to see a carrington be with next day

carrington arrested have not least doubt what murdered leigh to get will extort money for from from scoundrel cried mallien highly indignant to think that must have dared to accuse be in equal danger of being accused observed rupert coolly oh care about retorted other selfishly must look to myself will see lawson have carrington arrested if do be sure to make mess of thing warned hendle accepting

what tell if will wash hand of whole affair leave to extricate a best can mallien grunted assent scowled a rupert left cottage be not in least grateful for help thus afforded a hated idea of cousin doing anything for besides being extraordinarily vain mallien never liked anyone to be sharper than rupert have proved to be sharper a have so cleverly solved mystery of vicar murder think be fine fellow growled shaking fist at retreating form of cousin wo get penny out of sha marry dorinda if can help be not going to have crowing over thus grumbling ungratefully retired to room to write letter be to trap carrington meanwhile rupert returned toward big house through village in hope of meeting dorinda came across just near own gate in few word reported have taken place girl listened attentively when lover mentioned of mallien selfish speech looked pained wonder do anything for father said sadly do anything for dear do for besides added rupert with shrug how can one be angry with child greedy child at will give up property rupert fear will have to dear however can discus matter when question of carrington guilt be settled father will do justice rupert said dorinda determinedly will not allow if possibly can prevent to leave without penny then broke off with shrug well doe matter a say can talk of matter later just now have something to tell rupert met old titus ark yes know that be mr leigh shadow well tell now that be lurking about vicarage on night of murder that saw mr carrington there deuce why did say so before dorinda shook head refuse to say will question then said hendle briskly anyhow will be new important witness be afraid carrington goose be cooked poor creature sighed dorinda always tender hearted oh poor creature chapter xix resurgam next evening rupert received curt note from mallien stating that carrington have replied to effect that must come down to barship on ensuing day must reach big house at twelve o'clock pleased with information since interview be likely to settle question of vicar murder once for hendle took upon to arrange matter to compel plain speaking on part of slippery barrister be necessary that witness must be present for purpose of proving beyond question presence in barship on night of crime without doubt carrington must twist turn like eel in effort to escape from corner in procurable evidence must place rupert weary of mystery worry made up mind that man must be finally brought to book therefore went in search of dr tollart now that inspector lawson be to be dragged into matter for purpose of arresting culprit there be need for further secrecy besides visiting doctor hendle intended to call on ark for testimony faced by two witness must not be easy for carrington to win free mr beatson duly went away for so called holiday be simply preface to dismissal presence be not required at coming interview a what knew what have done did not touch immediately on carrington guilt also dorinda sophy be to be present a must give first hand evidence rupert mallien ark doctor be necessary people to prove that carrington have struck blow squire employed kit to bring lawson from tarhaven for share in proceeding so that everything must be prepared beforehand for lawson action rupert arranged that officer must not arrive at big house until one o'clock must give rupert friend sixty minute to bring carrington to bay tollart be startled surprised when squire called to explain why presence be required at big house have thought little of carrington presence in train on fatal evening have not in way connected presence in barship with tragic death of leigh explained to visitor suggested that after mistake have be made in crediting barrister with commission of crime hendle determined to put end to mystery explained to tollart about discovery of will pointed out what leading part document have played in ensuing event tollart who for once be sober expressed amazement regret le for vicar death than for rupert probable loss of property surely said tollart in husky voice with big red face expressing sympathy surely mallien will not take everything from even if will prof to be legal oh will appears to be legal enough doctor knowing cousin a do may expect to grab everything will make bad squire be lookout replied hendle with shrug bad lookout for parish hendle set up for saint a have failing mallien doctor made face why will ruin place give in to if only for sake of barship fight to bitter end oh will protect interest a best can may be sure answered rupert pleased that tollart be on side that matter can be attended to later what have to do now be to force carrington into confession take that be sure be carrington who came down in same train with doctor certainly know well by sight a called on when first visited to get remedy for toothache never forget face saw friend on liverpool street platform at barship station did carrington try to escape observation well hardly know did not see so far a know have heavy overcoat on be strange considering how sultry be evening collar be turned up remember mused doctor thoughtfully well yes think be anxious not to be recognized never thought anything about matter know hendle a believed be coming down to stay with a be with next day belief be natural enough quite so assented squire must have returned on same night to town perhaps by midnight express from tarhaven visit to only dated from twelve o'clock next day when arrived by midday train hum knew about will mr beatson told expect wished to get to sell to ah doe know what honest man be hendle know now responded rupert dryly however understand that will come to big house at twelve o'clock to morrow to give evidence certainly certainly rupert hesitated with awkward look oh will be sober said tollart with defiant laugh be not quite so bad a people make out can depend upon doing everything can to help hendle a have great regard for burly doctor shook hand warmly with squire rupert went away feeling sorry that man with such good heart must be slave to despicable vice wondering if there be way in must be reformed tollart when sober be clever physician when in cup made endless mistake for medical man to make mistake be dangerous seeing that be dealing with matter of life death however much a hendle wished to assist tollart to lead better life give undoubted ability chance be not moment to attend to matter a there be more immediately important matter to be looked into so having secured tollart a witness squire walked to ark abode be tumble down cottage on verge of churchyard stood in well kept garden surrounded by wall of loose stone here lived old sexton grandson in tolerable comfort neat look of garden be due to tobias ark for grandfather took interest in such thing tobias be lean dark faced man taciturn rather melancholy perhaps by reason of funereal employment be digging in flower bed when squire approached gate hastened to come forward with surly touch of forelock in answer to rupert inquiry admitted that grandfather be in cottage said that must send out to hear what squire have to say hendle did not mind waiting at gate a have wish to enter ark stuffy abode whoy be squoire piped titus when grandson went in came out like little old man woman in weather gauge what be here fur squoire there bai be funereals surely titus no have come to ask about what said to miss mallien aye ark looked tremendously cunning face wrinkled up like of monkey gloating over nut what might be squoire told that saw carrington near vicarage on night mr leigh died muster leigh bai dead tell squoire yes yes titus know about replied rupert soothingly for be well aware of fixed idea dominated old man saw mr carrington about house yus did when walking round vicarage not being able to sleep being old beyond telling young sir night being warm like yus continued ark garrulously see sure enough come down road in moonlight dressed a if t'be winter went into vicarage garden lord bless squoire did think a 'd gone to see vicar nivir thought aught of being there next morning titus when heard vicar be dead bai dead tell squoire persisted ancient crossly evidently be useless to try beat sense into old creature head so rupert argued further ark must evidently swear to carrington presence in vicinity of vicarage on night in question be main point well titus wo talk about vicar being alive dead want to come to morrow to big house to tell mr carrington that saw on be muster carrington there to morrow inquired ancient eye glittering evidently eager yes at twelve o'clock can swear that saw on night before king lord chancellor grunted sexton aye fur sure can say so squoire oh will be there sir will be there rubbed old wrinkled gnarled hand gleefully will tell what know squoire think that mr carrington killed vicar muster leigh bai dead tell 'ee said titus for third time very irritably after shuffled back to cottage annoyed that constant statement be not accepted be queer that old man must persist in declaring vicar to be alive seeing that have assisted to lay in family vault be visible from abode however rupert having impressed upon ark that be to be at big house at twelve o'clock next day did not trouble with ancient fancy so long a ark must swear a evidently must that carrington have be haunting vicarage on night of murder what believed about vicar not being dead mattered little man be senile be crazy on one point although appeared to be clear enough on other concerned with carrington presence at vicarage rupert did not trouble head further about matter returned home satisfied that two witness must confound carrington in moment of fancied triumph nothing of moment happened during rest of day next morning when meeting be to take place kit appeared with spick span machine before midday be sent over by hendle to tarhaven to bring back inspector by one o'clock rupert informed boy while on way back must tell lawson have be discovered so a to obviate necessity of explanation in fact a hendle said must be best for kit to relate everything immediately arrived at police office in tarhaven so that inspector must get warrant for barrister arrest so kit went off in high glee delighted at being able to do something for hero rupert returned thoughtfully to library where mallien be already waiting suppose carrington doe come suggested squire who be very nervous oh will come right enough explained mallien grimly said in letter to day intended to arrange here about transfer of property to under john hendle will that wanted to be present suppose that have suspicion of truth to be sure have after for tollart evidence that of old ark must never have be able to nail tell rupert that carrington have not least idea of what be about to happen poor devil yet deserves fate murder of leigh be cowardly in extreme be assented other be tender hearted fool man must rather be fool according to light than wise man according to yours mallien be quite content chuckled little man for one fool must give up property a be doing have given up yet said rupert disgusted with brutal speech may not be fool take to be for insolence mallien be plainly disconcerted by frank statement began to think that have gone too far muttered apology be on lip be cut short by entrance of dr tollart immediately behind shuffled old ark who seated near door chuckling rubbing hand with air of man who be highly pleased with mallien doctor who be by mean friend exchanged curt greeting tollart turning back on prospective squire of barship talked ostentatiously to rupert mr carrington will be here almost at once declared drawing off glove slowly walked up behind ark a reached gate even a spoke footman appeared to announce barrister carrington evidently considering master of situation walked in with victorious air looked smart alert being quite in best form in well cut suit of blue serge with straw hat brown shoe have apparently arrayed in best to receive money expected of course did not anticipate that five thousand must be handed to at once when thing be arranged between hendle mallien a to possession of property then carrington intended to get promise in writing of share of plunder not for one moment did think that anything be wrong even offered hand to rupert with insolent air of pity dog have day hendle said maliciously be mine be too sure replied rupert rejecting proffered hand there be many slip between cup lip remember be full of wisdom sneered carrington well will need to earn money when be pauper hendle stepped forward until towered over smaller man spoke slowly tempt to give thrashing let off with other day carrington murmured let get to business rid of presence a soon a possible oh be ready to go into business a soon a like retorted barrister still triumphant why be dr tollart here be here said tollart gruffly to state to face that be in barship on night when leigh be murdered

vicarage ground be liar cried carrington taken off guard bai liar said ark rising tottered toward barrister wor younger man 'd make 'ee pay for saying so shook gnarled fist in carrington face did see round about vicarage swear to if need be before judge jury bai afeared will be required to swear before judge jury said hendle in cold measured tone when carrington be in dock in dock carrington stepped back trying to command nerve for now began to understand full extent of peril on what charge killed leigh growled mallien savagely yes did so deny criminal dare to accuse do accuse said carrington driven to bay becoming fierce out of sheer desperation be who killed leigh to get will accuse in presence of witness pshaw said rupert contemptuously what be use of talking carrington game up have got down here to have arrested ca arrest said barrister with air of bravado will go at once to tarhaven give information against mallien rupert got between barrister door toward be retreating

sternly so why must not be done by a intended to be done by others there be scripture authority fur grunted old ark grinning toothlessly carrington now at bay looked round saw that everyone be against so that there be hope of mercy covered face with hand staggered against wall near door for moment there be silence for although mallien leigh pitied scoundrel rupert having unusually tender heart did so perhaps feeling that man be old schoolfellow induced to give carrington chance of escape be a may when barrister sobbing near door suddenly opened dashed out rupert made immediate effort to stop mallien did stop thief stop liar stop murderer vociferated followed rupert be thus compelled to pursue culprit although did so reluctantly two came to door to see carrington running down avenue dashed after barrister flew like wind speedily outdistanced pursuer be not to escape after for a reached open gate of avenue kit motor car containing lawson swept round corner running blindly carrington tripped fell under machine wheel passed over breaking back be picked up stone dead chapter xxi final surprise at inquest held on body of unfortunate carrington whole story of event connected with will of john hendle be related in detail be done by advice of inspector lawson so a to avert further trouble a officer wisely pointed out be necessary that character of implicated in affair must be cleared once for must only be done by truth being made public course of procedure greatly recommended to rupert who be tired of underhand doings be of frank nature idea of hiding concealing that annoyed exceedingly therefore made clean breast of matter when called upon to give evidence regarding carrington death insisted that everyone else must do same consequently whole amazing story appeared in print read like romance mallien be inclined to hold back from giving evidence a of course must have communicated with police moment became cognizant that murder have be committed cousin lawson insisted that must come forward to state what knew notwithstanding reluctance be compelled to do so escaped better than deserved a be seen how difficult position have be majority of people argued that man must scarcely have be expected to incriminate by drawing attention to crime at time when discovered mr beatson also contrived to elude reproof a cleverly stated that when in possession of will have intended to hand over to squire of course rupert knew that have never meant to do for sake of kit did not contradict statement because of dorinda feeling be glad to think that mallien have got off so lightly two plotter be much relieved that character have not suffered to appreciable extent retired into grateful shade of obscurity a speedily a possible thing have turned out better than have expected carrington conduct of course be condemned since have behaved so basely not so severely a must have be have be alive having met with violent death be felt that have paid for trickery a little a possible be said about kit of course be exonerated with regard to accident a lawson proved that young man have sounded horn when turning into park carrington anxious only to escape before inspector must take in charge have not heard warning of horn have not attended to be a may there be doubt that have ran on blindly thus have fallen under cruel wheel of car remembering carrington two premonition about walking over grave in avenue rupert thought quite uncanny that must have met fate on very spot only remarked on matter to dorinda who be wise enough to hold tongue enough have be said about carrington disreputable doings in newspaper so there be need to say more mr leigh did not appear at inquest a lay dying in comfortable bed under hospitable roof of big house signed written statement detailing event of night when have be struck down satisfied coroner jury after procurable evidence have be sifted verdict of death by misadventure be brought in matter ended in only way must end carrington sole relative clerk in war office came down to take charge of body expressed little surprise at smirched reputation of dead man carrington have always be black sheep relative grimly said to rupert that be glad thing have turned out a have carrington observed must sooner later have come to prison gallows have lived being one of unfortunate creature who must not run straight so that be end of squire old school friend who have chosen evil instead of good bad a have be hendle be kind hearted enough to regret man miserable end afterward always tried to remember carrington a

blow have be delivered that leigh have escaped death be not carrington fault dead man be practically murderer villager in excitement of finding vicar alive began to overlook carrington share in matter

being struck down by being buried alive have so shaken system that be not likely to live tollart be attending to did so in entirely sober state a narrow escape from trouble kept away from drink sophy indeed regarded whole matter a blessing in disguise hoped that father must reform have reason to do so seeing what lesson have received with regard to giving certificate of death tollart fellow physician held that be perfectly justified since vicar have be in cataleptic trance villager headed by titus held that dr tollart have be drunk at time when examined body opinion be not favorable to tollart reputation however when be seen that have turned over new leaf conduct be considered more kindly doctor began to hope that must weather storm have very nearly wrecked escape have have greatly improved character in time by acting judiciously keeping strictly sober managed to restablish position week later when everything in connection with catastrophe be quite settled mallien made appearance at big house be more subdued than usual a also have learned lesson there remained something of old blustering manner when entered library produced john hendle will from pocket rupert guessed that cousin have come to demand settlement braced to face disagreeable future be not pleasant to become pauper there seemed to be nothing for to accept inevitable be not so much loss of money young man regretted a probable loss of dorinda a wife rupert knew cousin well enough to be sure once in possession of estate income must not be inclined to permit marriage to take place seeing that be likely to be poor be useless for girl to insist upon fulfilment of engagement be with sad face weary heart hendle asked mallien to take seat suppose have called to discus matter regarding will said leaning head on hand speaking quietly in way though see that there be anything to discus retorted mallien who be rapidly regaining former bullying way have to do be to clear out allow to come here

signed by witnessed by titus ark grandson held good a gave detail of how false testament have be prepared leigh confessed therein that have copied signature of john hendle from letter first gave idea of committing forgery so in end mallien have to accept fact that rupert be true squire of barship that there be not slightest chance of getting single penny of four thousand year so greedily coveted while mallien frenzied with baffled avarice be moving heaven earth to prove that be rightful heir other people who have be connected with strange affair of will be settling in life mr beatson obtained

welcomed by one a mistress of big house everyone be delighted that rupert still kept position everyone knew that will have caused so much trouble have be forged hendle must have preferred to keep

mr hendle be not little troubled by reporter interviewer snap shot people in end curiosity died away be left to live own simple life doing good making everyone around happy in end mallien found that effort to prove will to be genuine be futile so one day presented at big house in very dismal frame of mind not being able to get property be secretly pleased that daughter must have become mr hendle even without consent a hoped to use for own end with greatest impudence suggested that son in law must fulfill old promise allow five hundred year oh said rupert calmly when mallien came for last interview think be good for to be treated with such leniency do chimed in dorinda who found difficult to behave amiably to father seeing how badly have behaved what do mean demanded mallien taken

better take rupert advice leave barship oh will go want to stay in such hole shouted mallien putting on hat violently then became pathetic go to live lonely life think will find plenty of amusement in playing with jewel said dorinda quietly never cared for mallien muttering something about ungrateful child serpent tooth walked away with drooping head dawned on dimly when shook dust of barship from foot that perhaps after a have not given affection must not expect affection egotism be much too strong to permit to understand fully that be only reaping what have sown took up abode in london
