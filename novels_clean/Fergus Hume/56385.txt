bedroom be in possession stain of blood be on shirt sleeve in face of such evidence how can prove innocence have nothing bare word can not anyone give evidence in favour michael gowrie might humph hear that old scoundrel be at bearsh inn trent told remember in edinburgh age ago wonder if said herries emphatically gowrie be old scamp must not commit crime well know seems that sir simon brought

house why must come to lonely little inn with large sum of money why must be so anxious to see stranger that having retired placed red handkerchief in window put candle behind by way of signal answer question doe seem strange muttered browne thoughtfully so strange that there can only be one explanation retorted cheap jack decisively man whomsoever be must not get to inn at appointed time be eight o'clock came very late before twelve in fact why not after twelve asked herries because a dr browne here will tell millionaire be murdered somewhere about midnight can not be quite sure put in browne hastily made only superficial examination of body well will say midnight a can not be very far out of reckoning certainly think that at midnight shortly afterwards sir simon be killed then that fix time stranger must have arrived before midnight a pair might have have talk before murder said browne quickly sir simon be think from orderly way in bedclothes be placed murdered in sleep good said kind quite unruffled let say that man climbed up to window be left open by sir simon with signal of red handkerchief killed millionaire there be difficulty about climbing said herries thoughtfully for when mr narby found that door be locked insisted that elspeth must climb up trellis work ah said kind with satisfaction make mode of entry more certain have not seen trellis work a have not visited

blackmailing friend man however saw gold at once made for sir simon woke must have made outcry stranger seeing awake doe not give time to cry out cut throat at once how must stranger see in dark asked browne sarcastically forget said kind gravely that candle be on dressing table sir simon left there lighted to shine through red handkerchief else what be use of handkerchief at yes yes see that said herries eagerly go on deed being done stranger wait in room until daybreak then knowing how sir simon be to leave inn put on dead man fur coat boldly walked out with plunder why did escape again by

now a will undoubtedly have something like fifty thousand year perhaps for sake of auld lang syne added clapping friend on shoulder may spend of money in saving will do said kind sharply with glance in direction of still sleeping wife nothing can do be too much for man who gave back rachel will stay here of course browne asked herries looking at floor where hiding place be concealed yes be guided

have adored appeared to think more of love than of irreparable loss doctor not being romantic school miss did not approve of captain kyles in spite of alluring exterior in smartly dressed suave cool person before saw typical adventurer who must win maud thousand year by sheer cajolery mixed with scarcely concealed bullying then must probably neglect when babyish beauty of look be gone at same time to do justice be surprised pleased to hear captain kyles defend accused a be certainly doing in manner when accused armour must have thought remarked doctor sarcastically that like everyone else must judge friend herries a guilty kyles shrugged square shoulder brushed fluff from breast of blue serge coat from what inspector trent say must seem that herries be name be be criminal drawled voice be not least attractive thing about that make believe man to be innocent have herries killed sir simon fancy must have arranged thing better to secure own safety perhaps lost head suggested maud maliciously criminal do know even cleverest dear said kyles so grimly that adjective be robbed of value have told before tell again that cousin be innocent oh said browne quietly then know that herries be miss tedder cousin know family history replied kyles lazily a be to marry miss tedder considered duty to learn be place boomed heavy gloomy voice coming from back of hall to inform captain kyles of tedder history stout stately female who approached in dramatic way be mr mountford ci devant governess who have improved maud young mind who now acted a somewhat cheerless companion be of

albert period lengthy earring like jet chain be wound like cable round fat neck mr mountford only needed plume of feather to resemble hearse horse mere presence darkened none too cheerful hall dr browne did not like female mute for in spite of cynicism must be cheerful on occasion mr mountford in mourning for neighbour fault never be how maud tedder light minded frivolous gay must endure wet blanket society of raven be more than doctor must understand prided on understanding feminine character must have thought that sir simon must best have informed captain kyles of that there be to be known said in reply to gloomy lady be added pointedly if sir simon approved of engagement of course papa approved broke in maud smartly though a have already said see what business be of yours did come here to make disagreeable child croaked mr mountford in bass voice be not time place to say such truth time for dr browne to make remark about thing concern snapped younger lady pertly beg pardon said doctor ceremoniously have right to interfere must think not cried irrepressible maud be again frowned down by mr mountford who seemed to be mistress of propriety merely came to assure miss tedder that cousin be innocent finished dr browne moved towards front door so think observed captain who have taken part in war of word anything can do can hing cried miss tedder who seemed anxious to place cousin in dock if angus be to be hanged will have to be hanged though be hard must suffer from such disgrace papa murderer must be punished tell herries have nothing to do with murder said dr browne violently face becoming suffused with blood wonder at persistence in accusing go by what inspector trent say see here remarked sailor in lazy drawl like to see fellow go to wall if can help miss tedder bowed to maud have consented to be wife think that one of must care to have relative hanged for capital offence besides to mind evidence be so clear that believe herries to be guiltless will therefore go along with gentleman learn what can likely to help poor fellow dr browne bowed to medical man in somewhat foreign fashion by clicking heel together understand also wish to prove mr herries innocence do said doctor doggedly wondering why captain be so anxious to assist intend to in case kyles extended small shapely hand may a well work together browne took hand indeed must hing else must like to know why be so certain that herries be innocent be not certain inquired kyles gravely yes then know herries well although appearance be dead against hold on remarked sailor in somewhat american fashion be because appearance be dead against that assist in state out west in mexico be nearly lynched for horse stealing evidence be plumb against good luck came way at eleventh hour must have be goner can wonder then that sympathy be with herries see have fellow feeling might put way hall boomed mr mountford once more be scarcely place to discus matter entirely agree with said doctor with emphasis so take leave if have influence with miss tedder ma'be advise to induce to be le bloodthirsty cried maud in shrill angry tone like infuriated mosquito bloodthirsty none worse for said lover genially stock cotton wool civilisation in indiana browne laughed rather liked kyles abrupt way of dealing with miss tedder when be married be easy seen who must rule house for maud air grace feminine wile seemed to make very little impression on rover doubt so good looking fellow have be much run after by fair sex have learned how to govern woman good day captain said doctor heartily be glad can see further than nose in case presume will meet at inquest to morrow bruce will take said maud hastily chimed in mistress of propriety with toll of big ben will be there to chaperon miss tedder being settled browne took departure walked down avenue wondering why maud must be so vindictive towards man to whom have once be engaged that man very own cousin must not understand for there seemed to be reason that must desire herries death certainly seemed to do browne asked whether dreaded lest herries must insist upon renewing engagement when maud became possessed of million perhaps a again thought engagement have never be broken in latter case since maud desired to marry kyles might think to cut gordian knot of entanglement by sending cousin to scaffold even in such case seemed incredible that must behave so wickedly browne have always deemed maud to be butterfly now seemed that be tigress resolved to lay case before herries when next visited caravan see what opinion be of behaviour thought of caravan brought up image of kind who be sheltering fugitive a be often case scarcely have name passed through browne brain when ran up against man at gate of park kind in odd dress chewing blade of grass be seated on stone with hand in pocket pondering expression on shrewd face mornin ' said rising a soon a doctor emerged from park beastly weather ai did come here to tell that asked browne looking up at leaden coloured sky in humorous manner came to see about man armour policeman who yes interrupted doctor strolling towards tarhaven beside cheap jack know about who told well to be precise know everything while be talking to miss tedder telegram came from trent saying that armour have be found bound in ditch yes trent there be making more mistake than ever be still hunting for mr herries ended kind with grin have found hope asked browne hastily kind turned blade of grass in mouth not much chance of said contemptuously mr herries hiding place be too easy found for trent to find be in place added kind wagging head until ostrich feather shook in bowler first thing must do must be to search caravan why asked browne puzzled because be likely place if man bolted came across caravan must ask owner to hide trent doe believe that mr herries must be fool enough to hide in so suspicious place sound rum know doctor be human nature argue something like captain bruce kyles who may be be captain in indiana navy be republic in south america understand that have come to england to arrange about buying new war ship for republic so in way be brought into contact with sir simon who speculated in other thing beside jam pickle consequently captain kyles who be romantic looking scoundrel have induced miss tedder to fall in love with will undoubtedly become master of money argued in same way a do doctor yes declares that evidence be so plain against herries that belief man to be guiltless oh kind gave shrewd glance at companion became meditative argues in way doe doe credit fool must say why asked kind wheeling round doe take trouble to defend mr herries be what have be asking said doctor dryly doe know mr herries have never set eye on queer murmured cheap jack with hand in pocket eye on ground must have look at captain will see at inquest to morrow along with miss tedder mr mountford who be young lady companion kind nodded absently being still occupied with problem of kyles unsolicited defence of accused man where be going now doctor asked a neared town to see mr ritson solicitor of sir simon wish to ask if have knowledge of what took sir simon to inn wo know rejoined kind shaking head decisively if sir simon have intended to let mr ritson know must have made appointment at office bearsh inn ' giving name carrying large sum of money kidnapping of armour hint at blackmailing kidnapping of armour echoed browne stopping short amazed forgot only know that armour be found in ditch said kind railway porter on way home morning found be taken to desleigh where life trent be sent for know mr armour who be old friend of mine saw armour before inspector saw then trent arrived sent that telegram to miss tedder what explanation doe armour give have gone round arrived at desleigh about one in morning rested on bench outside tap room door until two o'clock rather between two three then say that men must not guess how many suddenly came out of mist gagged bound wrapped head in shawl carried to ditch distance from railway station left there poor chap be nearly stifled when be found a time head be tied up in shawl why be kidnapped ah be what want to find out kind looked at browne have given clue be clue will tell after inquest said kind turning away then when be distance off called back see mr ritson doctor come to caravan after inquest wanted to see about have seen called back kind have said what wanted to say about armour browne ran after man who still walked on have come to conclusion panted for doctor be plethoric have said cheap jack have given clue tell will explain when be together with mr herries so saying walked off quickly browne although anxious to question further have not breath to follow moreover saw kind must answer more question at moment being case went to seek out mr ritson wondering greatly why armour have be kidnapped wondering still more what clue kind have obtained from browne must recall nothing in conversation likely to afford clue mr ritson have office in high street of tarhaven most imposing office next door to bank there be nothing of pettifogging lawyer about mr ritson office a be mahogany brass plate plate glass window ritson be well known a legal adviser of county be supposed to be extremely wealthy be tall thin severe old gentleman with silvery white hair parchment hued face dry manner a rule be not given to speaking much usually waited to hear what client have to say that might commit when dr browne who knew very well be admitted into lofty airy apartment be mr ritson sanctum be surprised by warmth volubility with usually silent lawyer greeted be very glad to see doctor said advancing with outstretched hand have not come must have sent for humph said browne cynic seem to have become person of importance miss tedder greeted in same way have seen miss tedder yes must have thought that must have seen also about what asked ritson quickly returning to desk about father death will will interrupted ritson vehemently be exactly what fear to see about fear yes doctor caught browne button hole time ago when be talking of sir simon wealth mentioned that knew nephew yes poor herries who be accused of murder ah ritson wiped high bald forehead although be usually cold blooded man be difficulty must speak speak away said browne more more surprised in confidence of course in confidence assented other ritson sat down suddenly began to fiddle with paper browne straddling leg with hand behind watched be strange that so quiet lawyer must be so moved certainly death of sir simon be very terrible naturally ritson who have known for year be startled by tragedy seemed to doctor that there be something more behind mere fact of murder something having to do with dead man will well said impatiently while ritson kept shifting pen sealing wax paperweight a though be playing chess yes yes ritson threw back thrust hand into trouser pocket never speak of client affair to anyone nodded browne everyone be aware that be trustworthy then will be surprised that be about to betray be not word that be about to forestall reading of will made last week by late sir simon tedder be necessary to ease mind be what do mean why must sir simon make such will said ritson almost to thought that be strange at time now when nephew have murdered herries did not cried browne growing red yes did said ritson determinedly to get money money browne leaned forward hand on desk stared into agitated face of solicitor money sir simon have disinherited daughter in favour of angus herries who now have fifty thousand year chapter x inquest must be mistaken stammered doctor staring a well might considering astounding news have heard make mistake in out of business replied mr ritson haughtily last week drew up sir simon will be short to point in disinherited maud tedder left money property to nephew angus herries good lord browne collapsed into chair near desk found difficult to believe that herries outcast be now herries millionaire fifty thousand year gasped doctor red hair almost standing on end what will do with buy freedom expect said ritson grimly what do mean by well lawyer took up quill pen began to play with mr herries be certainly entitled to fifty thousand year have to do something to earn do what asked browne more more perplexed ritson bent forward have to find out who killed sir simon thereby earn freedom money be still in dark will explain have told enough will have to tell more said browne determinedly duty to dead client see here little doctor jumped up slapped hand down on desk there be need for to have told anything so be too late to talk of duty to dead client a have told so much must tell everything yes ritson nodded silvery white head be right have committed breach of legal etiquette miss tedder must have be first to hear will have to be read after funeral at moated hall then mr herries who inherits must also be present be accused of crime have escaped immediate consequence said browne meaningly do know where be good lord how must know cried browne explosively be not quite sure a to truth of ritson statement thought that might be trap to lure herries from hiding place be friend of mr herries went to desleigh a inspector trent told quite so be with inspector trent at time herries escaped out of window of bedroom then know where be said doctor lying manfully ritson looked depressed be pity muttered for unless can see know how to put thing right explain to lawyer turned on visitor in twinkling of eye know where be browne be not at all disconcerted having have one moment in to think of plausible answer if herries communicates with anyone will be with said quietly a know that be firm friend believe in innocence do really do certainly herries did not even know that uncle be in inn certainly must not have known that be heir ritson rapped teeth with feathered end of quill pen yet evidence be dead against be with there same here browne shamelessly pilfered kyles idea evidence be so clear that believe friend to be innocent hum hum hum ritson cleared throat settled old fashioned black satin scarf quite so quite so then think doctor leaned forward confidentially that very clear evidence be got together to implicate mr herries in crime of have knowledge be sure of inspector trent have given version be coloured by belief that herries be guilty let tell other side mr ritson be attention said lawyer placing tip of finger together looking up at ceiling browne thereupon detailed that have heard seen at inn did not yet trust ritson so far a to relate how herries have found refuge in kind caravan did state that kind be ex detective sworn to assist accused man out of gratitude ritson listened in profound silence when recital be finished did not commit to statement on contrary again began game of chess with sealing wax pen paperweight asked irrelevant question saw miss tedder yes belief on trent authority that cousin be guilty consequently be much disturbed suggested lawyer browne smiled cynically place too much faith in human nature mr ritson miss tedder seems most anxious to get cousin hanged hey hey ritson sat bolt upright with hand on arm of chair say that again good sir browne did say again said more gave detailed version of interview of coming of telegram announcing finding of armour in ditch of opinion of captain bruce kyles be so much at variance with miss tedder ritson stared hard at little doctor a told tale dramatically when be ended rose went to look out of window be very remarkable said ritson turning from looking at busy high street to look at dr browne very assented medical man saying a little a must what be opinion asked ritson returning to seat have none save that herries be innocent then think said lawyer again playing chess that miss tedder in way have heard of will disinherits be anxious to have cousin hanged so that may get back money will get back money if be hanged asked browne artfully why yes pleaded for girl seems that maud have known from baby so can call by christian name well then seems that maud insisted on marrying captain kyles man of whom sir simon did not approve wonder at that man be adventurer so sir simon thought however look scamp be certainly handsome captured affection of miss maud declared that must marry sir simon told that if did must disinherit carried out threat by leaving money to nephew whom treated so badly pointed out that maud ought to have enough to live on sir simon disagreed said that maud must have everything nothing finally yielded in way in what way left money to herries for life afterward to maud meantime get one thousand year see then think that maud wish to see cousin hanged so that may inherit money at once ritson did not reply at once to question be difficult to say observed at length can not make up own mind be why have consulted why have violated confidence of client be enough to get struck off roll very rightly too anything say be safe with said browne sympathising with lawyer desire to act rightly see continued ritson still defending a circumstance of case be so dreadful time be of value therefore thought best to anticipate in confidence of course reading of will what do advise ah know circumstance of case said browne cautiously what for example do mean by saying that herries must have to buy freedom with money well said ritson nursing chin if be guilty be not will presume for sake of argument that be pursued solicitor well then if mr herries be guilty will have to use money to get best lawyer in england to defend else ritson hesitated be aware that be suggesting compounding of felony said nervously mr herries might employ money to escape be might bribe people to hold tongue until be beyond pursuit think herries must do said browne vigorously know that be innocent will prove innocence in way be not man to lie idle under stigma be unlucky very unlucky perfect jonah a be fond of calling well luck have turned seeing have inherited money agree with mr ritson have to remain in hiding because be accused wrongfully of murder again told that doe not get money until have found out who killed miserable uncle quite so if doe will at once prove entire innocence gain fortune be good luck luck be yet to come why did sir simon make proviso herries must seek for assassin did then expect to be murdered yes for reason along with other maud love for captain kyles made will did tell whom expected must kill asked a proviso be so strange told a little a possible gained clue to possible assassin did not be there anything in past life made guess that ritson interrupted there be nothing so far a know sir simon be perfectly safe there be reason to think that life be threatened by anyone apparently be however since made will be stranger still added lawyer meditating that must have made write letter setting fact that have left money to herries browne jumped up so quickly that overturned chair what be a told said ritson composedly when will be signed witnessed asked to write letter have copy certainly insisted on keeping copy although sir simon be none too pleased refused to sign name to letter unless have copy especially added ritson slowly a did not know to whom letter be written must not have written then snapped browne annoyed at seeing hope of clearing herries dashed to ground ritson touched bell when clerk appeared gave instruction to bring in letter book while boy be absent turned again to browne know how determined sir simon be said quietly moreover when read letter will see that there be reason why must not have written asked for envelope addressed letter clerk copied brought in sir simon slipped into envelope one have directed secretly went away be several day ago have never seen sir simon since never even heard of until inspector trent knowing be lawyer called to inform of lamented death to invite a late knight legal adviser to attend inquest did not see address caught sight of one word however quite by accident what be word well hesitated ritson fidgetting certainly might throw light on mystery of death although scarcely think so to betray client business relation be affair be too serious to admit of tender conscience said browne imperiously herries be in danger of life believe maud tedder know much more than chooses to tell seeing what attitude be be determined to save herries prevent getting money surely think that maud know who killed father be deliberately sacrificing cousin know what to think answered browne impatiently can talk of later tell what word saw tarabacca what doe mean asked browne puzzled ca tell word saw be certainly something like ca be sure of spelling conveyed something like tobacco to mind tarabacca repeated lawyer a clerk entered with letter book be certainly name like perhaps name of town sound like foreign name certainly be not name of english town retorted ritson opening book here be short letter a can see little doctor advanced to desk ran eye over few blotted line almost illegible on tissue paper used for copying dear sir read aloud be to inform that client sir simon tedder have left posse to nephew angus herries that have formally disinherited daughter maud tedder of everything save one thousand year yours obediently j ritson well said ritson when browne closed book doctor shook head can not understand said helplessly what be to be done there be nothing to be done save to wait advice to mr ritson be to be silent until inquest be over when herries hears of good fortune may give up advise to do asked ritson anxiously certainly do good day will meet at inquest browne in state of great perplexity left office certainly be perplexed a have never before have such mystery to deal with browne be straightforward man liked everything to be done openly underhand dealing connected with death puzzled sorely must not see way to solution went home to pas restless night again again did ask whether maud tedder have anything to do with crime again again did mutter to strange word tarabacca to question did obtain answer when rose next morning to go to desleigh looked very weary red eyed browne be not fated to be present at inquest for just a be starting received message from very wealthy patient saying that be dangerously ill insisting that must come to at once patient be too rich to lose moreover be extremely irascible so browne went to house a proved really to be dangerously ill be forced to remain there for greater part of day be quite three o'clock when found leaving desleigh station to walk along straight muddy road led to now celebrated village weather be much better for although sky be still grey sunless mist have vanished browne walking smartly towards goal cast musing eye on dismal flat wide marshy land environed village wondered how anyone must live in such place wondered still more why sir simon have come to so dreary locality to meet with terrible death a drew near desleigh met outcoming throng of human being of motor car bicycle cart horse coming towards station apparently inquest be over reporter morbid people attracted towards inn by curiosity be returning to railway that might be taken to various destination close carriage with arm of sir simon on panel drove past at full speed browne have doubt that maud chaperon along with captain kyles be within felt sorry that blind be down a wanted to see how maud looked whether expression be one of triumph guessed that be a felt pretty certain that verdict of jury have ticketed angus herries a criminal of worst type strange to say be so sure of what verdict be that did not stop of hurrying people to ask question at entrance to village perceived sloppy meadow wherein stood gaily coloured caravan of sweetlips kind smiled to to think of what must be said did anyone know that accused man be snugly ensconced under flooring of vehicle then recognised how true be what kind have said regarding safety of hiding place one much le trent suspicious a be must credit herries with being such fool a to remain so near scene of supposed crime therein lay man safety a browne sent second stealthy glance in direction of refuge for innocence stumbled against woman who be coming swiftly along road with shawl up to eye in blindness have run up against where be going oh be elspeth be indeed elspeth have run out of inn with shawl over head fringe of be pressed to tearful eye a doctor spoke let shawl drop saw that eye be red with weeping that small white face looked smaller whiter than ever yes be said nervously glancing at many men woman who be hurrying past to station be going to see rachel who be still ill be alone with meaning glance at doctor apparently uttered for benefit of public sweetlips be drinking at inn what be verdict asked browne eagerly although knew very well what answer must get only one must be given said elspeth leaning against barbed wire fence on side of road jury say that mr herries murdered sir simon there be reward offered by miss tedder yes offer five hundred pound oh said browne biting nether lip saw in increase of reward fresh proof of maud vindictive feeling towards cousin apparently be determined to leave chance of escape again browne wondered a have wondered through long night if maud tedder be cognizant of assassination of father inspector trent have be congratulated on evidence have collected sobbed elspeth also have be blamed for letting mr herries escape wonder at said browne wonder be that must have be congratulated at never knew of such bungling piece of work herries have not be caught yet neither of looked toward caravan a spoke many people intend to stop here search district there be three detective one of knew sweetlips do detective believe herries to be guilty oh yes intend to search for mr herries what do think of kind opinion told that thought mr herries be guilty said elspeth in meaning tone browne quite understood sweetlips be posing a enemy to herries so a to save life kind be also going to try for reward said elspeth with glimmering smile on lip doctor rubbed hand laughed there be suggestion of comedy in sweetlips kind attitude notwithstanding that be playing with issue of life death however have learned that wished to learn since now knew that verdict have be given adverse to herries that reward have be increased that accused man be still safe in hiding place stream of people vehicle grew thinner must seem very shortly village must again be left to desolation now that sensation be at end elspeth supplied doctor with more information sir simon body be to be taken to tarhaven to night said be to be buried in three day miss tedder agrees to give one hundred pound to mr narby for damage done to inn by murder having be committed there doctor smiled inwardly thinking of interview with ritson of small chance maud tedder have of paying six hundred pound however did not wish to complicate matter further by explaining disappointment awaiting presumed heiress merely answered question in same vein must think that crime have increased popularity of bearsh inn ' said with grimness probably mr narby have never have such good customer since took up trade be ill wind blow one good elspeth have sold out nearly liquor girl informed a there be scarcely anything to do allowed to come away visit mr kind wish must come also doctor rachel be still weak will come replied browne mechanically a be keeping eye on tri car lagonda make be slowly surging past next minute swore loudly for although there be ample room chauffeur insisted on crushing elspeth against barbed wire fence with painful result here confound cried doctor irritably look out where be going occupant sole one besides chauffeur be dark complexioned woman in prime of life with haughty face aristocratic air be richly fashionably dressed in lustreless black material wore with infinite grace from large melting dark eye olive complexion together with strange fact that be smoking cigarette in public browne thought that be spaniard foreigner at least appeared to understand english for on hearing none too gentle language turned proud face in direction taking cigarette from between full red lip flung fairly in face then at word from foreign word car shot forward down road leaving vile smell behind in minute lagonda be speeding towards station so rapidly that browne be unable to follow much a wanted to however shook fist picked up stump of cigarette have fallen at foot wish have caught sight of number of beastly machine snapped irascible little man 'd bring woman into court have fined good lord to think that shook cigarette stump in elspeth face must be thrown at wish must hullo stopped examined cigarette earnestly tangerian tangerian a be sinner what do mean asked elspeth astonished at expression mean bellowed doctor seeing that one be within earshot why mean that be foreign cigarette unknown in england well well kind picked up similarly marked cigarette stump in herries bedroom be dropped there by murderer that woman be be say stop stop dr browne brandishing umbrella ran in wild manner after vanishing tri car shouting like red indian on warpath chapter xi lover naturally enough elspeth must not understand hurried explanation of doctor must not guess what important clue little man be following up for moment two watched puffing panting down dreary road then with sigh entered spongy meadow wherein caravan be standing looked bright gay in coat of yellow paint although portion of be covered with tarpaulin to preserve from rain various broom brush mat basket dangled on four side day be still fine already sky be darkening with coming night vehicle looked rather lonely in wide bleak meadow horse usually drew caravan seemed to know for kept a close a possible to perambulating home a elspeth approached began to sing garryowen since be unable to whistle so a to let herries know that friend be coming also when climbed step gave triple knock on door waited with beating heart for sight of dearly loved face door be cautiously opened hastened to breathe own name shortly be within door be again locked herries stepped across gaping space of cramped hiding place be open usually kept ready so a to slip in cover with board must do by touching spring a speedily a possible one never knew what stranger might come to caravan in way of business out of curiosity to see sick woman rachel looking much better with flush on formerly pale cheek be sitting up received elspeth with rather knowing laugh held out large hand covered gipsy fashion with silver ring be glad to see dear said in hearty tone can talk now a throat be getting rapidly well thanks to dr herries be not exactly doctor said young man smiling can call mr herries surgeon oh be doctor right enough

anxiously need not ask added smiling bitterly wilful murder eh angus herries murderer thought so elspeth nodded leaned against wall of vehicle a heart be too full to speak mr kind strove to cheer poor young fellow who be dreeing so hard weird come come cried in hearty good humoured voice be worse off than be before ah think be said elspeth clasping thin hand there be now reward of five hundred

struck herries knew nothing when arctic sealer nansen came to pierside yacht be already berthed by wharf herries have left ship so immediately owing to persecution of captain that have made no enquiry a to nationality of strange vessel have remained on board nansen must have so enquired since tarabacca did not interest in slightest now however that yacht name be on shawl letter have apparently be

with head whirling must not quite understand seora guzman herries when conversation be reported to likewise expressed inability to comprehend two men talked matter over earnestly tried to arrive at conclusion whole matter be so enigmatical that must decide upon course finally concluded that notwithstanding danger of neighbourhood to herries must be best to wait for few day see what action donna maria intended to take there be nothing like waiting said sweetlips if spanish lady rather mexican a believe be creole if have anything to do with murder be on account of captain kyles must think false to certainly be will make trouble do believe that sent sailor to kidnap armour asked herries who be sorely puzzled must see light of course did since lied about shawl may have be sent to kidnap political person who be menacing sir simon made mistake in collaring policeman uniform pooh night be dark foggy mr herries armour wore great coat did not look very official besides greaser foreigner remember must know policeman from civilian let alone fact that may have thought political person might have disguised to get at prey why do say 'his prey ' because be inclined to believe that murder be political one after sir simon evidently be mixing up with politics of indiana republic to make money over sale of ship man expected be emissary of republic who got in at window how must know particular window forget signal of red handkerchief mr herries with candle behind must show very plainly well then political person got into bedroom killed sir simon afterwards went out in morning disguised a victim why did wait until daylight run risk because must have run bigger risk by leaving immediately have killed man sailor from 'tarabacca be outside if have fallen into hand might have be killed seora guzman be not woman to stick at trifle armour whom thought be man be not killed quite so probably learned mistake so left wrong man in ditch then perhaps returned to watch inn hoping that real man might come out evidently saw waiting so remained until must escape in morning herries fingered chin very feasible said wearily why must have be implicated ah will never learn that until chance upon assassin how will find ah kind shook head have there seora guzman know be sure demanded herries sitting up a sure a anyone can be with so puzzling woman seora guzman must certainly know member of political party opposed to father one more of member may have come to england to thwart mission of buying battle ship so may have tampered with sir simon such person lady may know be why attended inquest then why will not accuse right man save will do so really believe if will go to herries shivered said quickly ca trust might give up to police well might might not pretend to understand best thing to do will be to wait development here kyles be still at beoated hall ' with miss tedder yes know truth about will by time hum murmured kind caressing chin expect so if funeral have taken place sir simon be to be buried to day fancy will make sure learn what have taken place get browne to see ritson kind nodded will go to tarhaven to morrow then elspeth be at armour can remain there for time a soon a know what seora guzman intends to do can go to colchester in here caravan will be safe trent can hunt about a like will never think of looking here for ah said herries glancing towards bed where mr kind be placidly sleeping that reminds elspeth brought local tarhaven newspaper produced from pocket see indicated advertisement read that kind did so be paragraph offering reward of fifty pound for discovery of michael gowrie full description of somewhat noticeable personality be given if found be to be brought to tarhaven police station have said kind laying paper aside trent be not such fool a expected know that gowrie who slept in tap room may be able to give evidence a to what took place on night why if slept in tap room crime took place up stair know how well built wall of inn be row overhead must not be overheard by sleeping man be if mr gowrie be sleeping said kind dryly old cove blackguard know more than think did miss money from pocket yes gowrie took of course did knew that have money that must be sound asleep worn out with tramp therefore when fancied be in deep slumber must have gone up stair turned out pocket if did so might have overheard noise voice in sir simon room know enough of gowrie to be sure that must listen what overheard may have warned to make scarce at rate trent be well advised to search for never knew that trent have so much sense here conversation ended for time being herries remained in hiding place kind strolled round neighbourhood selling good keeping eye open armour contrary to expectation be not dismissed elspeth stopped with wife paying visit ostensibly to mr kind really to herries at caravan lover grew fonder of one day elspeth urged herries to leave neighbourhood lest must be captured must not do a wanted to find out how maud tedder took news that have be disinherited also desired to learn what difference disinheriting must make to kyles affection if be after money solely must probably break engagement return to seora guzman tarabacca if however really loved girl must undoubtedly try get herries hanged in order that must get fortune kind must learn nothing a after funeral reading of will ritson have gone to paris for few day miss tedder went up to london together with mr mountford captain without doubt have gone to see if will must hold water a saying be be taking counsel opinion on matter at least be sweetlips surmise marsh inn have settled down to old way mr narby procured slip of girl in place of elspeth treated just a badly once twice met with former slave in village scowled viciously neither spoke to made assault elspeth quite expected to do seeing what virago landlady be perhaps fact that elspeth boarded at armour have to do with mr narby meekness for woman husband be highly suspicious character be suspected by more than one person of smuggling good at back of inn be waterway known a red creek from colour of mud on shore here be reported boat used to come up from river laden with contraband good armour have often watched a yet have not be able to implicate mr mr narby in wrongdoing same couple kept quiet did not cross policeman path lest ill must come of doing so be certain therefore that mr avoidance of elspeth lay in fact that be under armour roof be very glad of refuge meanwhile seora guzman made move either to see sweetlips to seek out political assassin perhaps be waiting until such time a kind must produce herries then when accused man be in presence might have made up mind to speak out several time two men discussed advisability of trusting mexican lady elspeth always insisted that lover must remain where be until father must be found girl have got into head that mr gowrie must be able to produce evidence likely to save herries from scaffold be certain that father must appear before long although have written twice thrice to address have given in london old man never replied never appeared must really seem a kind sometimes thought that old scamp be guilty party have murdered sir simon for sake of money paper have be full of crime now that sir simon be safely buried trace must be found of assassin a herries be believed to be interest in case died away to great extent be revived somewhat by advertisement about michael gowrie for trent not finding local paper of sufficiently wide circulation have placed notice of reward in london journal paper in metropolis seemed to contain inquiry for michael gowrie so that herries began to think that be not so much trent who be seeking for man a maud tedder guided by advice of captain kyles two wanted money by will if herries died girl must inherit be therefore probable that thinking gowrie must be able to substantiate guilt of herries miss tedder have offered reward likely to bring old man on scene a day went by gowrie appeared seemed a though truth must never be made manifest by reason of absence of chief witness herries be growing very weary of confinement one evening couple of week after burial of sir simon tedder when weather be still damp dreary kind suggested for hundredth time advisability a put of herries facing music in other word really thought that young man must give up mr kind have now quite recovered have gone to marsh inn to do sewing for mr narby accused man be seated in gap of hiding place ready to lie down be covered

mr armour freedom from being struck knocked about enabled to put on flesh be really becoming rarely beautiful doubt love have gained be helping to become more of woman le of drudge looked very different to pale faced miserable creature whom herries have helped on memorable evening when have first set foot in unlucky hotel case stand way said kind after pause using little finger a stopper ca do anything a matter be now have seen ritson say so sweetlips surely have not told lawyer that angus be here not such fool dear ritson returned from paris to day saw by chance in street went to office asked on dr browne behalf a mr herries friend mind how matter stood well asked herries anxiously well echoed cheap jack said that miss tedder be mad to find that have be disinherited be still in london with mr mountford captain seeing if will must be upset have money demanded elspeth oh yes father left one thousand year to get along on be using that to ruin said herries bitterly ca blame retorted kind quickly one thousand year be drop from fifty thousand however lover mr mountford be in london so that disposes of for present ritson be holding property until such time a herries turn up to claim ca claim until learn who killed uncle quite so can learn that from seora guzman be still at pierside of course sneaked along there other day learned that 'tarabacca be still alongside wharf did go down to dock a thought that greaser knocked down might knife oh be there right enough keep on board most of time wonder doe go to london to see captain kyles wonder also seeing that belief a be really case that kyles be engaged to miss tedder perhaps be got something up sleeve what can be mused elspeth well said kind after pause really think be waiting until bring herries to see went on without heeding exclamation of girl want to have yarn with herries to see how stand in what way asked herries puzzled well drawled kind again filling pipe if seora guzman knew that get money if real assassin of sir simon be discovered must make business to tell who be because in way must keep miss tedder out of money kyles whom love from marrying miss tedder so if will take advice mr herries will slip along to pierside to morrow see lady be to interest not to split on sound like confess said elspeth getting off bed looking very anxious must be wrong to tempt providence in way better wait until father appears must have heard something when be sleeping in tap room perhaps will know truth seora guzman know truth also be at hand while father be retorted cheap jack be sure know truth certain replied kind positively hinted to that murder be political one if be case mind be inclined to believe will probably know assassin father occupies difficult position a president of republic hold on said herries quickly found out something about indiana republic from of old newspaper wife gave have read since giving up thief catching have given up reading newspaper interest rachel doe read either buy up old newspaper to tie up good in sell also a waste paper well well then mr kind gave few dozen of old paper to wile away time found of few month ago nine ten month to be exact gave account of revolution in indiana president guzman be deposed fled with daughter captain kyles whom seems commanded navy humph said kind in case yarn of buying war ship be rubbish see that president daughter may procured money have come to get ship under advice of captain kyles so a to replace president over republic might be yacht certainly looked like money from what say must think that kyles will marry miss tedder be better to get fifty thousand year in england than marry daughter of deposed ruler if guzman be still president must say daughter must get captain a matter stand think kyles be making for tedder cash will marry girl wo get money however said elspeth quickly will unless mr herries join force with seora guzman learns truth be politics alone can put on track of real assassin see mr herries at once wait till father come cried elspeth at moment by one of odd coincidence often occur in life trembling knock came to door in moment herries be lying full length elspeth have replaced

caravan have departed with kind elspeth chaperoned by rachel to quiet midland town whereto detail of crime have not yet penetrated with sufficient publicity to make name of herries notorious thus

for lady apparently be money be after thought made jealous heart of maud burn within loved kyles must have sacrificed thousand cousin to make husband must be done thought if recovered fortune by getting herries hanged if be arrested certainly must be hanged therefore be quite willing to give year income to bring about result day next lay in bed denying to everyone longing for news late in afternoon of day following gowrie visit received wire from anderfield sent by old man herries arrested ran wire be already married married said maud to herself smiling cruelly honeymoon will be spent in gaol will end on gallows chapter xvii maud inheritance there be lull in political social world when herries be captured newspaper have said that must say regarding past event nothing especial be happening worth prattling about marsh inn case with strong element of mystery spice of romance proved to be godsend in way of copy consequently horde of eager reporter poured into tarhaven whither inspector trent have conducted prisoner after arrest at anderfield in buck fact that herries be sir simon nephew for late knight be unimportant figure in commercial millionaire world that have inherited fifty thousand year that have be taken by police when issuing from village church immediately after marriage made whole case immensely interesting also mystery of murder lifted out of category of ordinary crime be well known that prisoner declared to be innocent everyone wondered what possible defence must make trent did not know a by advice of shrewd headed kind young man preserved irritating silence rev michael gowrie wishing to make dramatic announcement at dramatic moment kept own counsel that herries might be exonerated never entered inspector head for one moment gathered together procurable evidence so a to secure committal of prisoner by local magistrate a various hint might have be traced to gowrie be given to public strange revelation might be expected everyone be on tip toe with excitement sir simon have be great magnate in tarhaven be natural that death must arouse deepest interest more so a be now commonly reported that far from explaining fact of death motive for what looked like purposeless crime evidence at magisterial trial must probably deepen mystery in frantic effort to get at truth narrate highly coloured tale to reader several reporter attempted to interview mr herries formerly miss elspeth gowrie by advice of sweetlips girl saw one of enterprising young journalist who belonged to half penny paper with very largest circulation in world kind instructed to tell truth even to concealment in caravan a thought that if public sympathy must be awakened for lover herries must stand better chance of acquittal there be risk in being thus explicit a cheap jack ran deadly chance of being arrested a accomplice after fact be herries condemned must probably be so arrested elspeth along with before instructing elspeth sweetlips have privately interviewed old scotch tutor from have extracted evidence a averred must save herries from gallows at eleventh hour elspeth did not know what evidence must be fact that kind be willing to risk liberty on strength of made very cheerful a pointed to certain discharge of angus when unvarnished tale came out in morning planet made undeniable sensation elspeth became heroine of hour sudden love of girl way in have proved that love by rescuing man believed to be innocent from hand of prejudiced police strange wooing in caravan saving of rachel kind from terrible death by timely arrival of herries thing smacked of romance people now began to believe in spite of evidence to contrary that angus herries be innocent man so loved must be guilty scoundrel must awaken such devotion in heart of timid unformed girl one woman high low of three kingdom ranged on side of mr herries not few men followed lead a be natural kind belief proved to be right after publication of statement in morning planet case became more interesting than ever everyone sympathised with unlucky married pair dr browne invited gowrie daughter to stop at house servant be occupied to very day of trial in keeping away people from door when elspeth walked abroad be pointed at snap shotted admired discussed in way showed that heroic conduct a morning planet called have won warm place in heart of public in several paper portrait appeared be asked to write account of early life there be talk of getting up subscription on behalf since be known that be horribly poor in way people showed sympathy mr herries be lioness of hour have be single must undoubtedly have received many offer of marriage a be devotion to unfortunate husband made talk of england ireland scotland wale elspeth did not like publicity a be retiring by nature bore for sake of angus undoubtedly must aid in defence probably must help to save life to do that must have sacrificed ten time over in much more terrible way further sacrifice be needle herries be now so to speak under protection of british public everyone be certain that must have fair trial many even went so far a to say that must be acquitted inspector trent laughed prophet to scorn herries be guilty evidence proved that be guilty in assisting to escape wife cheap jack have thwarted end of justice when prisoner be committed for trial said trent must see about arresting kind a accomplice after fact even trent did not dare to hint elspeth might be arrested to put in prison must have provoked storm from public one in authority must risk one person be intensely disgusted at elevation of young mr herries into heroine be maud tedder on hearing of arrest of cousin have expressed great joy in condemnation saw chance of recovering father property not only did want money also desired to re capture captain bruce kyles wary bird only to be lived by golden grain after have heard will read have discovered that must not be upset have returned to tarabacca at pierside beyond few cold note have refrained from paying attention in effect showed that now be poor did not intend to marry after gowrie hint maud be certain that captain be engaged to seora guzman have be made catspaw of if herries be not hanged kyles re captured to be husband have fully made up spiteful mind to revenge however since there be difficulty in way called to see elspeth propose compromise might be a maud argued that angus must not be condemned especially after statement of morning planet therefore be worth while to gain half if not whole fortune mr herries be alone in doctor drawing room very masculine looking apartment unworthy of name browne be absent seeing patient kind who usually haunted house be taking rachel round tarhaven to buy good for caravan reverend michael gowrie be where often be in nearest public house drinking at other people expense advertising a father of famous mr angus herries old man managed to procure many cheap drink in way one ever got out of even in most convivial moment what evidence proposed to give in order to save son in law elspeth remained within door for certain reason after hearing kind account of visit to tarabacca became certain that seora guzman be in possession of fact might help to prove innocence of husband since sir simon have written that mysterious letter to someone on yacht why not to captain kidd in petticoat then there be hint of treasure manco capac treasure kind professed unable to understand kyles might know something by awakening jealousy of mexican beauty truth might be arrived at concerning kidnapping of armour that a elspeth argued be in way connected with death of sir simon tedder after a seora guzman have hinted to kind might be simply political crime in case donna maria must have le hesitation in telling plain fact of assassination taking fact into consideration mr herries have written to seora guzman asking to call at tarhaven have chat mexican lady have graciously assented to request when miss tedder card be brought in elspeth saw in arrival much more than mere chance providence have brought two woman who loved bruce kyles into contact possible quarrel between two might result in truth becoming known of course elspeth be groping in dark a did not yet see what maud seora guzman bruce kyles must have to do with murder that have something to do with death of millionaire be very certain therefore be ready to take advantage of miss tedder visit maud came alone a did not wish even mr mountford to hear what have to say to woman who have married cousin when entered room elspeth arose to receive stopped short in surprise be frail delicate looking girl with white face pathetic eye heroine about whom fuss be being made did not look a though must plan anything much le carry out daring scheme yet be owing to that herries have escaped at critical moment maud judging by flesh not by spirit looked at shrinking girl contemptuously promised easy victory sat down with insolent air stared hard at rival on side elspeth be eager to see maud knowing that angus have once loved mr herries admitted doll like prettiness of millionaire daughter must not understand how man like husband must have loved so soulless being miss tedder be beautifully dressed looked extremely pretty certainly be not girl to awaken passion of sort in man in way elspeth be a contemptuous of maud a maud be of so two commenced interview with mutual misunderstanding be angus herries cousin said miss tedder sharply sitting bolt upright keeping hand in muff then when elspeth simply nodded added be wife elspeth bowed again why have come here asked quietly dresden china beauty laughed to see woman who have taken leaving said insolently see replied mr herries calmly well behaviour disconcerted maud must have preferred elspeth to have risen in royal rage girl be perfectly calm must supply fuel for burning think much of snapped with hard stare really did come to tell partly also to congratulate that angus will be hanged elspeth started clasped hand tightly to prevent getting into passion why do think be matter of congratulation demanded in choked voice because be beast burst out maud losing temper in face of coolness be once engaged to treated shamefully did not treated only too kindly what do know about angus must tell ah have to make own case good there be need to with said elspeth coldly spot of vivid red burned on cheek know angus well not so well a do cried miss tedder anxious to break down companion composure angus made love then left alone broke heart with truly effective sob rubbish said elspeth rising quickly say that to man not to woman angus have passing fancy for threw over at bidding of father have more than fancy adored then why did leave papa must not let marry if angus have remained true to must have remained true to instead of taking up with captain bruce kyles suppose sneered elspeth resolved to sting in turn maud started to foot in fury how dare talk to like who be better than servant who will soon be murderer widow no cried mr herries imperatively facing other girl boldly intend to save husband life ca do without elspeth turned like tigress on visitor what do know about maud felt rather afraid when fragile girl flashed out in way know that angus be guilty said obstinately then how can save can get one to give evidence that be innocent who will tell on condition oh on condition be father explained maud calmly left money save miserable thousand year to angus be not fair can offer opinion on point rejoined elspeth in equally cool manner will be none of making if wanted to inherit money must have given up captain kyles a father wished wo did must rather lose penny than give up bruce seems to that have lost penny said mr herries rather cruelly have got lover have cried maud eye very bright cheek very red then suddenly broke down oh elspeth do help will lose altogether wo marry unless have money have got elspeth be not going to yield to few crocodile tear can get money when angus be hanged retorted maud dried eye viciously very well cried with stamp be hard hearted girl beast hate detest came here to save husband now can hang very good now can go be not what miss tedder wanted see here said becoming business like speaking in hard voice if angus will promise to give income will save can asked that before yes can elspeth recalled what other have said few moment previously by getting someone to declare innocence repeated said maud coming closer whispering by getting someone to plead guilty to crime what be name of someone sha tell will must no if angus sign paper saying that be to have money then will save by denouncing real criminal oh did say knew about do believe know truth wish to get angus hanged simply to get horrible money before maud must evade caught girl by wrist will tell name of assassin before leave room leave alone cried miss tedder in cold fury how dare in answer elspeth gave wrist twist that maud screamed aloud with pain tell tell be hurting ow ow cry away taunted elspeth intend to have truth maud set teeth tried to wriggle free might a well have attempted to extricate from blacksmith vice oh be hurting will break wrist before have done speak elspeth shook a terrier doe rat maud fastened teeth in elspeth wrist received box on ear then burst out cry dropped to floor with mr herries still holding to prey oh be cruel elspeth shook again went on shaking a spoke tell tell be not sure whimpered miss tedder now really frightened of other blazing eye can prove nothing must let judge of who killed sir simon will give money if tell must ask angus dispose of property maud began to scream be of use have ventured into lion den how ill bred be sobbed ah said elspeth contemptuously thought to come here taunt thought to find weakling see with vigorous shake love for angus make strong be afraid of nothing when be in danger rejoiced to hear that be arrested very good then will be one to release now then out with out with again came shaking until maud be quite sick be terribly afraid of reckless girl who dared to lay hand on there be nothing for to tell truth so far a knew seora guzman murdered father cried grovelling mr herries be so surprised that released hold stepped back pace to see if maud be speaking truly how do know papa wrote letter to saying that must disinherit if did give up bruce asked to meet at bearsh inn ' to see if must take bruce away from might be true murmured elspeth recalling that seora guzman smoked brand of cigarette found in herries room why did kill father took lot of money with wanted to fit out expedition to find manco capac treasure who told bruce fear love there maud rose smoothed skirt have told truth can prove nothing without give money will have money if save angus said elspeth chapter xviii surprising defence elspeth lost time in relating to kind that have heard from maud also confessed that have promised girl half father fortune if saved angus sweetlips be rather annoyed that promise have be extorted really have be a miss tedder certainly did not deserve one single penny however said cheap jack made promise not mr herries therefore if refuse miss tedder can say nothing angus will do what want replied girl quickly know that wo want to reward iniquity oh maud be not so bad a be about a bad a make grumbled ex detective grimly to get money be quite willing to see cousin hanged be only hedging at last moment a fear lest father must save do think father really can yes know what be going to say will settle matter therefore miss tedder not having saved mr herries can expect nothing moreover fortune will not be husband until discovers criminal oh there be many reason why forced promise to miss tedder need not be kept if be right in saying that seora guzman be guilty person will have done everything towards getting fortune for angus so that may secure half of if be not hanged if escape will be thanks to do think be telling truth really ca say murmured kind nursing chin of course be jealous of seora guzman must do anything to get out of way seems to that captain bruce kyles be trifling with woman tell again exactly what miss tedder said elspeth thought for moment said that father wrote letter mr ritson mentioned to to seora guzman asking to come to bearsh inn ' came sir simon proposed to pay enough money to fit out expedition on condition that seora be took captain bruce kyles away from england removed from maud path in fact humph remember seora guzman reference to expedition in search of treasure might be that real reason in coming to england be to get fund if mexican lady love kyles sir simon be willing to pay for loving why did murder to get money maud say must have got money in case argued kind who be much perplexed by present aspect of affair why commit useless crime believe did remember elspeth reminded remember that found stump of tangerian cigarette on floor of yes yes seora guzman smoke that brand other people may smoke same sort of cigarette for instance captain kyles sweetlips looked keenly at elspeth do think that mr mountford whom have seen told that captain kyles be with maud tedder on night of murder must not be in two place at once must then that kidnapping crew of 'tarabacca certainly kidnapped armour under impression that be spy look a though mistress be in hotel at time be removing danger from path again seora guzman must easily swarm up light trellis spar under window of bedroom in petticoat pooh daring woman like be quite capable of assuming sailor dress to carry out object then think be there that be guilty think on authority of cigarette stump that be in hotel say that be guilty did not kill sir simon for can see motive for committing crime nevertheless urged a cigarette stump be found in husband bedroom must have be there well drawled cheap jack with eye on ground a said other people may have smoked brand one of officer on board for instance kyles be innocent be not prepared to say that seora guzman be guilty certainly might have implicated husband in crime by placing razor on bed hiding pocket book under best thing to do will be to question inform of miss tedder accusation thought be coming to see so be yesterday expected to see about time maud called however never came humph will be at trial doubt will see to day then will question oh by way kind came back after taking few step towards door have found out from trent who be fool ca keep own counsel that sir simon drew two thousand pound from bank day previous to death be two hundred in gold rest in note trent learned from ritson who must have told by way heard from bank manager so see that money landlady son saw sir simon handling filled blue pocket book amounted to that sum now if can trace note will lay hand on criminal have of note be presented not yet however manager have number trent make statement at hearing to day before magistrate must get off there be coming with father in hour will come back with husband to place shortly said kind in encouraging tone oh sweetlips do really think so be absolutely certain of departed leaving mr herries much up lifted by good news be certain that cheap jack spoke truth for there be that in manner inspired confidence elspeth dressed very simply to accompany father to hearing before magistrate indeed even have be minded to dress more expensively must not have done so frock hat boot glove be present from rachel kind in return for nursing be of plainest cheapest description dr browne in impulsive generosity have wished to give friend wife dress elspeth refused a preferred to be indebted to one browne honoured for refusal be beginning to have better opinion of woman since have known elspeth herries if daughter be plainly dressed father be resplendent a old scamp have scruple in taking money from whomsoever be fool enough to give to be arrayed in purple fine linen looked highly prosperous gowrie be aware that be most important figure at trial after prisoner resolved to take advantage of publicity be a said thrust upon for year a also said have be hiding light under bushel now there be chance of shining brilliantly arranged to stick candle in most conspicuous position shrewd old man saw opportunity of making money although hoped that son in law when freed in possession of property must remunerate for service still did not neglect chance of making few shilling on own account finally gowrie dearly loved publicity praise progress along street with be like of king leading princess to altar daughter wanted cab gowrie refused haud up yer held ma bairn said in grand mellow voice dinna leuk sae white be gran ' day in annals o ' ma hoose ' gang forth like david tae succour sick tae here mr gowrie who have be taking various drink became somewhat incoherent elspeth be glad when held tongue since everyone in street knew who be who be from old man loud talking be really dreadful person to have for father same held fate of husband in hand there be crowd outside building in trial be to take place very few people be admitted into court be done by order of presiding magistrate who knew that sympathy of public be with prisoner who did not wish for manifestation during proceeding trent have assured that herries must undoubtedly be convicted on evidence magistrate believing guessed that when young man be committed to take trial at next essex session there must be tumult therefore when elspeth father entered court found that few be present outside must be heard murmur of mob who be eagerly waiting to see what must happen proceeding be very much same a have be at marsh inn inquest trent made similar statement to have made before supplemented by adding that sir simon have in possession on night be murdered sum of two thousand pound in gold note stated that number of note be in possession that a yet none of have be presented detailed have taken place at inn on night crime have be committed arrival of sir simon to meet unknown visitor subsequent arrival of herries who said perhaps wrongly a trent suggested that did not know that uncle be in house then came relation of narby discovery of dead body evidence found in herries room in fact inspector trent made out very good case against prisoner really looked a though nothing must prevent accused man being committed for trial at chelmsford session same witness a have appeared at inquest be called mr narby husband son elspeth new fact be elicited witness with exception of elspeth stated that be certain prisoner be guilty browne be examined gave evidence a to examination of dead body mentioned probable hour of death be rather dull a everything have appeared before in paper herries seated in dock gazed straight before with calm face now then stole glance at elspeth to gain confidence be seated with clasped hand in agony a evidence be given in face of how must hope that husband must escape trent recalled by magistrate explained that have not be able to find man who have passed through tap room arrayed in sir simon fur coat mentioned that coat have be discovered magistrate who seemed to be open minded man thought that be favourable sign for prisoner a missing man might possible be very probably be assassin lawyer who appeared for prosecution pointed out that razor empty pocket book have be found in herries room dared defence to explain how came to be in room of prisoner be at point that michael gowrie be called then present listened attentively a be most important witness of lot assuredly according to common report must be able to save prisoner young lawyer who be acting for herries asked gowrie few question relative to position reason have be at marsh inn on night in question then asked to tell story gowrie did in best english very earnestly knew that too much be at stake to commit to scotch dialect must not be half understood by present gowrie statement made with considerable impudence be to effect herries on retiring to bed be so excited by misfortune that be probable must not sleep sorry for young man gowrie bethought of small bottle of laudanum possessed considered duty to give herries dose so that might sleep be dangerous thing to do said magistrate rebukingly be sir be replied witness herries might have gone off head have not obtained needful rest deemed duty a old tutor sincere well wisher to drop small quantity of soothing drug into whisky took up to therefore sir must point out that a prisoner be under influence of drug certainly must not have risen in night to kill deceased be there evidence other than yours to show that drug be given asked magistrate looking grave gowrie mentioned pope narby son of landlady woman of witness be recalled pope stated that certainly saw gowrie drop laudanum into whisky to make prisoner sleep a have stated mr narby gave evidence a to administration of drugged liquor how readily prisoner have fallen into deep slumber browne be recalled stated that while under influence of dose of laudanum prisoner certainly must not have committed crime then gowrie

upset by mr narby sudden wrath with glass in gouty old hand pipe in mouth sat staring at driftwood fire thinking lot after fashion of celebrated parrot two thing struck a strange first mr narby must have so suddenly lost temper with man whom apparently desired to propitiate second that narby must have so unexpectedly inherited legacy if really have money be quite natural that must have let pope go to london to publish poetry for virago adored son even though did not understand writing where have mr narby got that money gowrie in frequent visit have learned lot about narby past life in state have never heard that anglo american expected legacy indeed mr narby on one occasion have said that husband be bothered with relative be queer that money must come to so suddenly from unknown source

to marsh inn so a to see what gowrie be doing browne quite believed that pair connected with tarabacca knew much felt certain that gowrie knew more than chose to tell herries browne argued over matter until late hour resumed talk when met at breakfast then browne departed to see patient herries went to look for kind cheap jack be not at humble little place where wife have put up during trial since have left caravan at anderfield in buckinghamshire herries thought that also have gone leaving to own device perhaps thought that have done enough in return for saving of mr kind life must not blame for looking after own affair for time herries contemplated walking to moated hall see what maud have to say on reflection decided to wait for return of gowrie from inn might be that something important be transpiring there elspeth met at door of doctor house when came back to luncheon having practically wasted morning angus said eagerly here be two letter one be in papa writing other have be written by sweetlips herries went into drawing room opened letter one from kind be merely short intimation that have met captain kyles early very morning from certain fact have learned from have

possessed soul in patience like going to bearsh inn ' after what have occurred angus said elspeth uneasily mr narby will make disagreeable herries laughed scornfully what doe matter be not afraid of mr narby of dozen like besides have idea of how to tame virago in what way will tell intend to bring action against for telling lie about can perhaps can not threat will serve to keep mr narby tongue

if armour be kidnapped because wife have be maud nurse dear herries took in arm see bird in bush a case have got on nerve see least connection between armour kidnapping mr armour early employment agree with seora guzman believe that kidnapping be political affair in what way well see seora guzman be daughter of ex president of indiana with kyles a commander of tin pot navy came home to get war ship so a to regain possession of republic if possible naturally new president not wanting civil war must have sent emissary to thwart scheme sir simon be mixed up in possibly emissary must keep eye on one might have followed to bearsh inn ' kyles who be doubt going to meet sir simon there on political business must have told sailor to get rid of suspicious looking person from indiana consequently armour by taking up position near inn laid open to suspicion be promptly removed might be so then know meeting be to bribe captain kyles to leave maud kyles must not give sailor true reason replied herries leaving table good bye elspeth be off do take care of darling pleaded of course kissed need have fear luck have changed since marriage elspeth felt that be so a stood watching
