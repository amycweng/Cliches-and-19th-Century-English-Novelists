out solemnly on still air with salutation curtsey villager passed by young squire waited to hand over car to servant who came up at moment breathless with haste will wait for sir take car to inn make comfortable in hour can return nothing loth to get indoors out of bitter cold man drove machine humming like top down road sky be now clouding over wind be getting up a giles walked into church thought there be promise of storm wondered that must labor up so rapidly considering previous calm of night however did not think further on matter when within looked around for daisy be at lower end of church staring not at altar now glittering with candle at figure of woman distance away who be kneeling with face hidden in hand with thrill giles recognized anne fearful lest daisy must be jealous did remain in vicinity made way up to own pew be in lady chapel near altar here took seat strove to forget woman loved woman did not love be difficult for to render mind blank on subject organ have be silent for time now recommenced low breathed music then choir came slowly up aisle singing lustily christmas hymn vicar severe ascetic followed eye bent on ground when service commenced giles tried to pay attention found almost impossible to prevent thought wandering towards two woman tried to see pillar intervened must not catch glimpse of gaze fell on tall figure of man who be standing at lower

red beard large black eye age be probably something over fifty looked ill worried worn wondering who be what brought to out of way place a rickwell at time giles settled comfortably in seat to hear sermon vicar be not particularly original preacher discoursed platitude about coming year duty entailed on congregation owing to length of sermon lateness of hour people yawned turned uneasily in seat one ventured to leave church although sermon lasted close on hour seemed a though preacher must never leave off insisting on same thing over over again repeated twice thrice interspersed common place english with lordly roll of biblical text for position giles must have gone away be long over hour knew that servant must be waiting in cold when stood up for concluding hymn craned head round pillar to see daisy have vanished thought that like have grown weary of sermon more fortunate than have be able to slip away anne place must not see did not know whether be absent present giles wondered for one delicious moment if must see before left church daisy evidently wearied by sermon have gone home there be one to spy upon might be able to have anne to for time must then ask why be going perhaps force to confess that loved even a thought conscience rebuked for treachery to daisy fortified with good resolution resolved not to leave seat until congregation have dispersed thus must not be tempted by sight of benediction be given choir retired with last musical amen worshipper departed giles remained in seat kneeling with face hidden be praying for strength sorely needed to enable to forget anne to remain faithful to woman whom father have selected to be wife not until music of organ ceased verger came to extinguish altar candle did giles venture to go by time thought anne must surely be well on homeward way must return to own place a fast a motor must take thus must avoid temptation at present moment must not trust to emotion outside expected storm have come on snow be falling thickly from black sky light at lych gate twinkled feebly giles groped way down almost obliterated pathway quite alone for one else have departed reached gate quite expecting to find motor to surprise be not there not soul be in sight snow be falling like meal giles fancied that servant have dropped asleep in inn have forgotten appointed hour in heart must not blame man for weather be arctic in severity however determined to wend way to inn reprove for negligence stepping out of gate began to walk against driving snow with bent head when ran into arm of man who be running hard in

stood amidst falling snow staring at one almost too surprised to speak suddenly heard loud cry of fear moment afterward urchin one of choir lad came tearing down path a though pursued by legion of fiend giles caught by collar a ran panting white faced past what be matter asked harshly why did cry out like where be going to mother oh let go wailed lad see lying on grave be frightened mother mother saw who lying on grave know lady face be down in snow be bleeding dropped lantern mother gave scudded sir do let go never did did what giles in nervous agitation shook boy killed did be lying

trim out of gate like frightened hare giles stopped for moment to wipe perspiring forehead pas tongue over dry lip then made sign to trim to follow walked rapidly in direction of mr kent grave dreaded what must find there heart beat like sledge hammer grave be at back of church choir boy have evidently passed when trying to take short cut to mother cottage over hedge snow be falling so thickly night be so dark that giles wondered how lad must have seen one on grave then remembered that lad have spoken of lantern during lull in wind lighted match by blue glare saw lantern almost at foot where boy have dropped in precipitate flight hastily picking up lighted candle with shaking finger closed glass moment later be striding towards grave with lantern casting large circle of light before in ring of pale illumination saw tall tombstone beneath figure of woman lying face downward on snow trim gave exclamation of astonishment giles set mouth suppressed sign of emotion wondered if figure be that of anne of daisy whether woman whomsoever be be dead alive suddenly started back with horror from wound under left shoulder blade crimson stream have welled forth snow be stained with brilliant red staring eye of groom looked over shoulder a turned body face upwards then giles uttered cry here be daisy kent lying dead murdered on father grave chapter v afterwards never before have

delegated to be poor daisy said hoarsely have be murdered say murdered yes found lying on father grave dead knife thrust under left shoulder blade must have died almost instantaneously dead muttered morley ghastly white approached to take handkerchief from dead face dead repeated replacing then looked at haggard face of ware at silent group of men startled woman standing in doorway where rector be keeping back where be murderess asked sharply murderess repeated giles angrily what do mean mean why miss denham have done be mad to say such thing will tax with to face where be not at home for have be waiting to see be run way on mr ware motor car volunteered trim only to be clutched violently by master say that fool ca be sure of mr morley added turning to scared man make remark about

at once go home trim saddle couple of horse will follow track of car when find will never find put in morley who have be listening with ear falling snow must have obliterated wheel mark by time when did occur know replied giles coldly instead of chattering there have better have stammered body taken into room attended to poor daisy sighed what end to bright young life here mr drake rector thought necessary to assert waved aside throng men woman go to home said nothing can be done to night car might be followed said voice car will be followed said giles pushing way to door come trim will ride at once did one see car pas out of village one have seen a most of villager have be inside church rest in home there be talk suggestion ware with nod to morley took hasty departure disappeared into stormy night might track car said rector wo replied morley bitterly will lead trim on wrong scent liked miss denham too well to let drop into hand of police then really think did asked drake horrified be perfectly certain be reply come into library will show what evidence have meantime hall be cleared of eager listener present went to home le to sleep than to argue a to guilt innocence of body of girl be taken to bedroom poor scared mr morley roused from bed to face tragedy did be needful assisted by two old woman who remained behind to offer service be must be done till dawn mr morley thinking of dead daisy missing anne till first streak of daylight a yet limited understanding must not grasp horror of thing morley conducted mr drake to library related how wife have heard anne threaten to kill daisy produced anonymous letter detailed daisy accusation that governess be in love with ware finally pointed out damning fact of flight rector be quite convinced by reasoning that anne be guilty now come to think of said stroking shaven chin miss kent be in church yes so be miss denham think sat together a be on worst possible term did see daisy drake nodded went out when be way through sermon remember felt little annoyed that must leave when be doing best to inculcate good habit for year in congregation must have gone to pray at father grave there drake stopped with sudden terror in eye there miss denham stabbed ware said wound be beneath left shoulder blade look a though daisy be struck from behind can see cried morley with shudder poor child praying by father grave stealthy approach of woman armed with ah interposed drake there be have not yet found weapon after morley evidence be purely circumstantial know for certain that miss denham be guilty person why did fly then demanded morley fiercely if be innocent if have not left church until others did must have returned now be in bed from what trim say fled on ware motor car humph ca get far on night too rector walked to window to watch still falling snow morley shook head miss denham know country for mile mile ware taught how to drive motor must be surprised if got away after in spite of weather drake looked uneasy placed before fire with shiver rather admired miss denham must not yet bring to believe that be guilty even if be cherished secret hope that might escape police be terrible to think that one woman must be dead be more awful to look forward to trial condemnation hanging of other blame ware good deal for continued morley gloomily openly admired miss denham encouraged to flirt with rash thing to do to one who have negro blood in vein expect passion carried beyond how do know have negro blood said so did know that when engaged never engaged at drake wife did must say that miss denham credential be good have be governess in italian family have stopped suddenly started up in italy might have procured stiletto from nature of wound be small deep must think be inflicted with weapon how do know that wound be small deep wife told when came to door that time did not hear say wound be quite small in case must be deep death must not have occurred so suddenly drake shook head know that did occur suddenly morley contradicted angrily if daisy have not died at once must have have time to shriek cry must have be heard in church doubt people be deeply interested in sermon other man shrugged shoulder be scarcely worth while arguing point with rector relapsed into brown study until roused to reply to question asked by guest have ever seen stiletto asked drake have one here replied morley running eye along wall one got in italy be said to have belonged to lucrezia borgia wonder where be rather difficult to discover amidst weapon mr morley good heaven what be matter might well ask host be clutching arm in vice like hold be pointing to certain part of wall whereon hung pair of ancient pistol crusader shield old helmet stiletto be there be gone gasped morley impossible who can have taken miss denham miss denham oh believe to be innocent cried other came into very room at nine o'clock little after be outside on terrace seeing visitor off be alone in room for time must have taken weapon why must have because intended to murder poor daisy be arranged in black heart drake added solemnly have done best to believe that woman innocent defended against daisy wife defended also tried to believe that have ill intention see see what come of steal stiletto kill child in most brutal manner swear to hunt down swear rector caught down uplifted hand morley be raising to heaven be said sternly there be need for man to call upon god to witness blood thirsty oath if woman be guilty let be punished give benefit of doubt appearance be against admit same may be able to prove innocence might a well talk to wind a to be murderess will do best to have hanged morley spoke with such vehemence drake looked closely at wondered if man have grudge against anne denham that spoke of with such bitterness certainly crime be terrible one deserved to be condemned must only be fair that must be first tried morley on contrary have already judged without waiting to hear what have to say in own favor well mr morley there be nothing more to be said remarked coldly for disliked melodrama must wait till police come in morning meanwhile will go to home get sleep ca sleep with in house replied morley abruptly rising will go with where to churchyard to grave intend to look for weapon may have be left there tossed aside by assassin after crime night be dark snow be falling will not be able to do anything be advised will come with now if find nothing be better for if do shook hand again fiercely drake argued longer seeing that man brain be in such state that be best to humor went out together at church gate drake excused retired to home have wish to see morley groping amongst graf like ghost pausing until little man disappeared into gloom rector went to house wondering at sudden change in morley character have be light hearted rather frivolous creature fond of gaiety overflowing with milk of human kindness now be fierce savage enough for caliban must have loved that poor girl very dearly sighed drake ca believe that charming woman a miss denham committed so cruel crime there be mystery about in last speech be right there be mystery about death much deeper one than willow man like rector must fathom through long night mr morley watched by dead have placed candle on side of bed laid cross on poor child breast drake be quite shocked when saw papistical arrangement afterwards came out that mr morley have be educated in convent have imbibed certain notion of romish ritual for dead that memory reviving made act thus in spite of openly confessed belief in communion of english church while be thus sitting weeping morley looked in be wild haggard in eye glared triumphant expression terrified wife did not dare to move crossed room looked at body will be avenged dear said solemnly before mr morley must recover from surprise denounce ill chosen moment for visit wheeled round disappeared did not retire more did servant who be collected in kitchen steadying nerve with tea so happened that when giles weary wet worn rode up to door in morning on jaded beast be met by morley have caught asked man giles dismounted threw rein to groom trim went one way where be know horse gave in returned entered house where be body asked up in room occupied during life said morley come into library have something to show ware followed sank wearily into chair must scarcely keep eye open nevertheless started up wide awake when host spoke miss denham killed daisy said morley took stiletto from wall yonder here be produced with dramatic wave where did find beside grave on spot of murder chapter vi case against anne contradictory quality of mr parry nature came out strongly in connection with rickwell tragedy when miss denham be prosperous old woman have nothing bad to say of now that be fugitive generally credited with crime mr parry stood up for stoutly made acquainted with detail delivered verdict to mr morley on whom called for express purpose of giving opinion never liked woman said impressively be artful frivolous to gain admiration behaved in brazen way of thoroughly disapproved same believe killed girl evidence be strongly against expostulated mr morley how many people have be hanged on evidence have afterwards be proved incorrect retorted mr parry care how certain be of guilt in opinion be innocent woman be glad have escaped be not sorry sighed other be fond of anne for have many good point mr steel say who be mr steel detective who have charge of case thought police from chelmsford have in hand of course mr morley sent for police morning after poor daisy death be three day ago to morrow inquest be to be held suppose will bring verdict against poor miss denham have said mr parry rubbing nose greengrocer be on jury much know about matter steel creature where doe come from mr morley sent to london for have private inquiry office believe such thing contradicted mr parry be from scotland yard genuine detective none of makeshift thought knew nothing about did till minute now remember seeing name in connection with theft of lady summersdale diamond caught thief in very clever way steel martin steel remember now so have case in hand humph wo accuse anne denham may be sure of that be too clever be convinced of guilt said other triumphantly then man fool will see mr parry did so very next day after inquest have be held verdict given possessed small neat cottage on outskirt of rickwell standing distance back from high road seated at drawing room window must see who came went thus kept watch over moral of village window be called mr parry eye everyone sneaked past in constant dread of terrible old lady who looked through beyond mr parry cottage be house of gentry church therefore knew that steel must pas house on way to elm where must doubtless go to report to morley to be sure morley be to be at inquest mr parry took account of that detective must certainly return to elm to compare note also there be chance steel might go on to see ware at place be mile beyond village giles have caught cold after midnight ride search for missing motor since then have be confined to bed deposition have be taken down in writing for benefit of jury a must not be present since be deeply interested in matter steel must probably go tell about inquest mr parry therefore posted at window about twelve waited for detective at half past twelve saw come along having on previous day made acquainted with personality be dapper pert little man neat in dress suave in manner not at like detective of fiction a known to mr parry there be solemnity hint of mystery about mr steel must pas unnoticed in crowd one must take for bloodhound of law did not even posse indispensable eagle eye did utter opinion with air of oracle in fact when mr parry captured lured into parlor be exceedingly disappointed with appearance one must even take for detective said brusquely whereat steel laughed cheerily better for ma'be folk speak more freely when know business will excuse added glancing at watch be in hurry say know something about matter be on pretence mr parry have got into house else must not have wasted time on have therefore to make good word have not slightest chance of doing so know that anne denham be innocent be that must say said with air of one who settle difficult matter once for on what ground ma'be on ground save of own common sense have evidence to have evidence of own eye have seen woman have be not kind of person who must act so jury take different view said steel dryly have brought in verdict of wilful murder against fool what can expect from parcel of tradesman wish to hear on ground made such idiot of steel be somewhat taken aback by coolness must really excuse said rising have to see mr ware in good time steel said old lady coolly might do worse than spend hour with there be precious little going on in parish know of might be able to help in search after woman steel shook head think so expect have escaped to foreign part oh know about made trim tell know trim of course be groom once be groom now well mr parry rubbed nose might call engineer when ware started motor car trim refused to let anyone else attend to young master be servant of old ware think be duty to look after son not what be needed added mr parry spitefully trim learned how to work car so be what might call engineer very interesting ma'be have appointment will keep replied mr parry suavely have better wait steel have something to show in connection with case in connection with miss denham what be show to in good time steel must first know what think of matter think that woman be guilty oh do do humph thought clever how easily one can be deceived however can sit down tell ground for preposterous belief steel hesitated in career have be varied one have never met before with anyone like determined old dame took possession of in calmest way be evidently bent upon pumping dry before left house a rule steel be not man to be pumped after reflection concluded that be just a well to use sprat to catch mackerel in plain english determined with reservation to gratify mr parry curiosity so that might get sight of what have to show if be reticent must show nothing whereas if told about evidence at inquest be public property must certainly open mind to moreover steel knew value of having gossip like mr parry to aid in gaining knowledge of neighborhood finally saw that be shrewd matter of fact old person for sake of making work easy must be a well to conciliate therefore sat down with cheerful air prepared for interesting conversation will be perfectly candid with said taking out note be memoranda made at inquest humph have bad memory see said mr parry with emphasis carry know in head go on steel detailed fact of case related threat of anne against daisy overheard by mr morley read out copy of anonymous letter emphasized presence of anne in library for few minute morley be absent when must have have time to secure stiletto explained how morley have found very weapon near scene of crime then continued to relate what took place in church during midnight service martha james said be sitting not far from miss kent corner be rather dark whole church be badly lighted interrupted mr parry never must bear smelly kerosene lamp corner be dark resumed steel patiently martha a say having headache be rather inattentive to sermon saw man near door tall man with great coat white scarf must see face plainly slipped along wall during sermon when attention of everyone be fixed on preacher a martha saw slipped scrap of paper into hand of miss kent started bending towards near lamp read paper did anyone else see read placed paper in prayer book so contrived to read without exciting suspicion martha saw action because be well placed for observation must mind own business know martha james go on after few minute miss kent seemed to grow faint slipped out of church witness samuel gibbs say that a brushed past murmured that felt unwell however went out tall man also no remained for ten minute martha james watched because must not think why did not follow miss kent after giving paper of course martha thought of something bad sniffed mr parry doubt believed that two have arranged to meet so tall man went out ten minute afterwards what about anne be few pew behind apparently inattentive small girl called cissy jinks most precocious child interpolated lady be smart admitted steel well declares that miss denham be watching tall man time whether saw give paper to miss kent one seems to know think must have done so if be a watchful a cissy jinks declares moreover followed tall man when went out immediately five minute afterwards have then be quarter of hour before followed daisy humph did trim see come out of church groom no be at lych gate with car snow be falling fast besides night be so dark that must see nothing first intimation have of miss denham be when came through lych gate to tell that master be with miss kent on way to elm wished to see trim followed left in charge of car when be gone went off leaving body of girl behind case be dead against a make out certainly be said mr parry scathingly what about tall man what became of have vanished one seems to know anything about have said old lady with satisfaction well can enlighten on point be man who called to see mr morley who left just before anne entered library be sure morley said nothing about morley can hold tongue when necessary said old lady dryly yes be man footman at elm told that mr morley visitor wore great coat white scarf same dress murmured steel man be afterwards in church passed note went out apparently to see miss kent must question mr morley about wonder if went away in motor also of course did replied mr parry calmly anne be watching according to cissy jinks followed five minute later must seem that knew after killed daisy helped to escape what do say asked steel wrinkling brow that man killed miss kent evidence be nearly a strong against a against anne be in library also might have obtained stiletto be who lured daisy out of church be five minute absent before anne followed quite long enough for to kill poor girl sound feasible admit said detective thoughtfully even if be true incriminates miss anne helped to escape according to theory must therefore have known about murder that make accessory after fact in case must be arrested not hanged insisted mr parry be sure did not kill girl a for man have strong reason to get out of way that doe not say knew of crime see what other reason must have have said steel daresay be right that stranger did go with miss denham on car what pity one saw did one see car be found overturned in hedge near tilbury know said mr parry not liking to have omniscience questioned trim told came on car by chance be quite cold furnace be extinguished must have be abandoned for time when came across where pair went then seem certain that stranger be with miss denham yes be quite satisfied on point tilbury have be making for tilbury did inquire there steel nodded must find trace of one saw rather for asked only after miss denham be opinion that must have got on board ship have escaped to foreign part must not learn of ship having left night though well be evidence mr parry can see for that case against miss denham be almost conclusive same believe be innocent insisted old lady be man who committed crime ask morley about do think know anything not of murder must know man name now a have be so frank with will show what promised do remember anonymous letter reference to scarlet cross yes miss denham said that father who be now dead wore red enamelled cross on watch chain know mr morley told so now see here mr parry opened left hand for time have kept clenched in palm lay small gold cross enamelled red where did get that asked steel astounded mr bates pew opener found in church brought to be found near spot where stranger stood what steel started to foot ah be beginning to see now said old lady yes steel may well look be innocent on evidence of cross believe that father be not dead be stranger killed daisy because be father anne aided to escape chapter vii oliver morley in due time body of daisy kent be buried remains be laid by of father in very churchyard about have complained to giles short time before tragedy of death ware being still ill did not attend funeral large concourse of people from part of county followed coffin to grave morley be chief mourner looked haggard a be natural poor mr morley remained at home wept did little else weep in day poor soul when mr drake have finished service grave be filled up crowd dispersed there be great deal of talk about untimely death of girl chance of murderess being caught everyone believed that anne be guilty a steel have kept own counsel mr parry held tongue mention be made of tall man chatter of cissy jinks martha gibbs certainly seemed to inculpate in matter only villager talked of especial point never reached ear of reporter did not get into paper journal gave good deal of space to affair hinted that be what french call un crime passional still paper be daring enough to hint at giles presumed connection with tragedy be merely stated that have be engaged to deceased girl felt death so deeply a be natural that have taken to bed of course be embellishment of fact a ware be simply laid up with attack of pneumonia for benefit of public journalist ascribed to romantic undying love giles who be matter of fact young englishman did not see description must have be much disgusted at sickly sentimentality meantime news be heard of anne be not known that tall stranger have be with for several people have seen car passing on way to tilbury be lucky thought have made trim take that particular direction merely by chance that have stumbled on motor overthrown in hedge evidently accident have occurred one be near at time a took place little distance from tilbury in lonely part be conjectured that two occupant have proceeded on foot to tilbury boatman be found who related that have taken lady gentleman across to gravesend that gentleman walked trifle lame landed on gravesend shore here boatman lost sight of be lady who paid fare said that appeared to be quite calm did not see face of man described that of anne dress also there be doubt what be fugitive however here trail ended once in gravesend trace of pair be lost steel made inquiry everywhere without success two might have got away in ship must not learn night be foggy dark ship have gone out of river according to boatman steel must discover nothing resolved to throw up case at eleventh hour stumbled on clue followed up result of inquiry made return at once to rickwell where sought out mr morley little man have sent wife family away from elm a atmosphere of house be melancholy in extreme mr morley not averse to more cheerful surroundings elected to go to brighton with triplet took two servant with morley remained behind with reduced staff promised to

reference remember letter steel yes showed to mr parry to meddlesome old woman why be too long matter to go into be just a well did gave little ornament morley turned over enamelled cross examined carefully humph be kind of thing miss denham said be worn by dead father exactly well mr morley father be dead a told that cross be worn by stranger man who called to see here be father how do make out what do mean said morley face exhibited genuine amazement for answer steel related what mr parry have told about discovery of cross how have put two two together now sir must see that in way

did know anything else about mr benker sir drew up primly never pry never did one call to see mr wilson one time be here not one person called did receive letter not one letter arrived queer murmured steel what newspaper did take morning post also took world truth modern society m p be fond of fashionable intelligence oh be be must have called gentleman always paid rent duly hesitated mr benker so far be perfect gentleman have lived a lady maid in best family sir think mr wilson be what must call aristocrat see so be lady maid once in what family mr benker be not at averse to relating better day did so with pride be with countess of flint with mr harwitch with lady susan summersdale have said steel starting remembered that morley have be concerned with lady summersdale about robbery of jewel did tell mr wilson asked oh yes have long talk about aristocratic family repeated several tale have told wilson steel asked many question when took leave asked leading one did mr wilson wear red cross a ornament on watch chain did said mr benker steel departed very satisfied with day work chapter x on fresh trail if giles ware have not be desperately in love desperately anxious to find anne denham must scarcely have gone to paris on wild goose chase postmark on letter showed that be have be in french capital to find in immense city be like looking for haystack in league long desert however ware have idea foolish enough that instinct must guide to side therefore a soon a recovered sufficiently to travel crossed channel with trim left rickwell about three week after interview with morley time enough a well knew for anne to change place of residence trusted to luck for quite fortnight explored city accompanied by faithful old servant trim have sharp eye must be certain to recognize anne if came within eyesight in spite of vigilance observation two saw one even distantly resembling anne certainly if giles have gone to authority who take note of who come go might have be more successful knowing that anne be wanted by english police did not dare to adopt method be forced to rely entirely on search resulted in nothing ai no good master giles said trim for at least tenth time have lost scent somehow better go back to london want to be ill over here sir with nothing foreign doctor to look after sha leave paris until be certain that be not in place declared ware resolutely well sir know how much more certain want to be have tramped bullyvardes chamy elizas till foot be near dropping off be looking shadow master giles if will excuse old man a nursed when be baby ai here now must be surprised if be in london said trim wisely what in very jaw of lion nonsense oh be sir always heard said by a know that jaw of lion be very last place one expects to find trim did not state what meant if went back to rickwell must be safe especially if laid up in cottage called widder trim have be reading detective novel not sir ai got time about going back will go back to morrow trim said ware with sudden resolution trim joyfully departed to pack just struck giles that after trim might be right that having thrown police off scent by going abroad in yacht anne might return to london might be there now living in quiet suburb while police be wasting time corresponding with french authority ware thought must be just a well to learn what steel be doing have charge of case might have struck trail in case giles wanted to know for must then avert possible danger from anne finally reflected that might learn something about anne friend from people at governess institute where mr morley have engaged if returned to london be not impossible that might have gone to hide in house of friend one who knew anne must be certain that be not guilty of crime be accused of must assuredly aid to escape unjust law so thought giles in ardor quite forgot that one be not in love with anne must scarcely help unless be fully convinced of innocence perhaps not even then most people have holy horror of law be not anxious to help in danger of long arm of justice however giles reasoned a above forthwith left paris for london took up quarter in guelph hotel opposite park began search for anne again luckily have obtained from mr morley number of institute be in south kensington day after arrival walked there to make inquiry be very forlorn hope ware saw other chance of achieving desire institute be tall red brick house with green blind prim tidy look be shown into prim parlor interviewed by prim old lady who wore spectacle have pencil stuffed in bosom of black gown however be le prim than looked have cheerful old ruddy face with twinkling pair of kindly eye in heart mr cairn admired handsome young man who spoke so politely be more willing to afford desired

help from can see that also believe guiltless do said mr cairn in low voice have known anne for year be certain that be not woman to do thing like must not harm fly then can help know where be mr cairn looked at flushed face at light in eye in shrewd way guessed secret of eagerness then love said under breath love anne why do say that asked giles taken aback be not prepared to find that must read so easily remember said mr cairn to herself loud enough for to hear there be society paper said something about jealousy being motive of crime do mean to say that statement be in paper asked ware angrily with flash of blue eye be in none of big daily paper mr ware offered explanation society reporter went down to rickwell to gather scandal from servant suppose off from mr parry muttered giles then aloud yes well man woman most probably be woman made up very pretty tale be printed in firefly scandalous paper said ware annoyed what did say that be in love with anne that be engaged to miss kent that to gain a husband anne killed girl be foul lie will horsewhip editor make put in apology must do that if be mr ware said old lady dryly better let sleeping dog lie believe whole story only

mckail have already gone back to new zealand with fearful opinion of english society for mr parry have blackened country just a though have be pro boer then one day little maid who be called jane have

put horse up at inn asked old lady to excuse dress mr parry did so with pleasure giles be splendid figure of man looked picture in trim riding dress old dame have eye for fine man cast approving glance at shapely leg slim figure frowned when eye rose to face be thinner than liked to see there be not old brave light in eye fair moustache have lost jaunty curl to romantic mind have made such gallant lover giles be one of few person mr parry did not abuse for good look many courtesy have long since won foolish old heart although must never confess to then mr parry be softer than looked who have be taking heart out of ware asked in gentlemanly way giles knew have often laughed at one answered gloomily unless call fate one call anne denham one replied coolly so have found yet poor soul

yonder tell what have be doing month no good if face be index of mind ware laughed sitting down managed to stow long leg out of way easy matter in little room then accepted cup of excellent tea from mr parry of celebrated cake did not reply immediately a did not want to tell truth have too long tongue to be told anything be necessary to keep secret put off a best must with general answer have just be going to fro like satan sniffed mr parry be model be so have be searching for anne where in paris in london ca find doe want to find replied old lady if did must stand face to face with soon

last tenant left because said be haunted rubbish by what by white lady wanders up down park wringing hand franklin evidently doe not believe in ghost for have be there two month never word from what kind of man be tall man with very black eye black beard added mr parry correcting be wrong have beard when first came now have shaved off have seen much of hardly anything morley be only person with whom be intimate in degree hardly ever come out when people call be not at home why man must have five thousand year ca make out doe good with family wife there be daughter understand be invalid keep to room to ground weak in head must say seeing how secluded father keep have seen yes came on unexpectedly one day rather one evening short girl with red hair freckled face look fool be dressed in color of rainbow wonder mean franklin keep out of sight humph said ware rather astonished by extent of mr parry information did servant tell there be servant retorted mr parry with man be mean creature may not believe ware have only three people to do work of huge house then there be three servant people might call so retorted mr parry determined not to give up point be queer lot not at like domestic have be used to old man who act a kind of butler woman wife who be cook brat of fifteen daughter expect who doe general work oh be quite family affair queer household doe man intend to stop long have taken priory on seven year lease morley visit yes visit morley be a thick a thief perhaps may be thief for know doe man franklin go about much not great deal occasionally take walk into village sometimes come to church believe rector have called wish one have taken priory want company in dull place will call see ought to replied ware slowly seeing be engaged to daisy who must have have money from what say must not think franklin must care to see certainly doe not seem to be desirable neighbor be quite mistake snorted mr parry tried to be friendly gave to understand that preferred book to company be great reader understand evidently good lady be somewhat sore on subject for shortly changed for first began to talk of daisy secondly wonder who have killed why thirdly made mention of grave there be something queer about remarked rubbing nose sure sign of perplexity how do mean queer well mr parry looked thoughtfully at guest then before replying gave permission to smoke like scent of cigar about place said reminds of colonel be awful man to smoke one habit must not break of giles lighted cigarette willingly enough repeated question time got answer surprised be way said old lady taking up knitting for time grave be quite neglected gave order that must be looked after told drake gardener be friend of sexton thought there must be trouble there have be then said mr parry triumphantly sexton gardener quarrelled have not be on speaking term for month thomas sexton wo let williams do anything to grave out of spite wo touch so went to rack ruin grass be long rather be long flower gone to seed sore wreck ware be most annoyed will see about to morrow there be need grave be now a neat a new pin grass be clipped fresh flower be planted month ago never saw grave better kept quite labor of love who have done mr morley pish said old dame pettishly a though woman have gumption to do anything humph one know who have done what do mean ware looked puzzled what say usually do grave have be put to right at first few people noticed because few go into corner one day imp of choir boy saw improvement told old thomas came looked at others came one knew who have put to right then continued mr parry impressively be discovered that be done at night at night yes one seems to know by whom at what time morning fresh improvement be noted people watched saw one coming yet when watching be dropped there be something fresh done may be brownie added mr parry with sniff be mystery even ca find out truth be very strange said ware thoughtfully be worse be improper cried mr parry in sternest voice see reason why thing must be done in darkness of night though to be sure continued rubbing nose have have moonlight lately must see into said ware rising will find nothing everyone have watched to purpose friend now idiot talk of ghost what not what do think asked giles why one who loved daisy better than did have taken pity on neglected grave cried wincing did best to make happy engagement be unfortunate marriage must have be still more so be just a well poor girl died blame anne say word against anne interrupted quickly then before hostess must reply took leave must be going now mr parry be not at pleased knowing how far must go decided that have reached limit of forbearance with feminine craft smothered resentment parted from in most cordial manner same still held to opinion that anne be not wife for favorite giles went at once to churchyard to view daisy grave found everything in good order grass be shorn flower be blooming white marble of stone have be cleansed carefully wondering who have performed labor of love returned to get horse at gate of churchyard tall man passed with bent head a brushed past young squire raised suddenly giles saw clean shaven face large black eye sallow complexion stood aside to let pas rather nice day said ware pleasantly very responded man continued walk giles knew very well that be new tenant of priory be in mind to speak to on second thought decided to do so on more propitious occasion standing at gate looked thoughtfully after retiring figure there be something familiar about about face of man eye especially aroused vague recollection in mind must not a saying go put name to while walking to inn suddenly flashed into brain that be man whom have seen in church on fatal new year eve be clerk said breathlessly have shaved beard be man who fled with anne who murdered poor daisy chapter xiii mr benker reappears more giles thought about more be certain that be man for whom search be being made to be sure there be distinguishing mark of identification evidence that be one same amounted to fact that have large black eye that height figure resembled so called wilson moreover although other people in village have seen clerk one giles seemed to recognize in fact recognition be rather due to instinct than to tangible reason in own mind be convinced recalled how man have suddenly removed scarf a though be stifling on night remembered wan face dark anxious face rough red beard hair to be sure franklin be dark haired sallow in complexion also be clean shaved even when not according to mr parry have worn full black beard red hair whisker might have be assumed a disguise giles did not know very well how to verify suspicion then determined to confide in morley steel have told that proprietor of elm be ex detective giles thought that for sake of avenging daisy death might be induced to take up old trade with idea called at elm morley be delighted to see welcomed in most cheerful manner giles be always good friend only subject of contention between be question of anne guilt morley still believed that governess have committed crime asked after at outset of interview have found asked just a mr parry have done giles knew quite well of whom be speaking have not answered if have certainly must not tell a please replied little man complacently will never see truth be not truth see here morley what be use of discussing matter believe miss denham to be guilty be certain that be innocent let difference between rest there still if must prove innocence of miss denham must be more than delighted responded morley quickly must make amends in power for unjust suspicion have first to prove unjust believe ware admired miss denham a much a wife did thought much of defended from poor daisy aspersion must have stood friend through for last act of hers well well get angry be willing to be shown that be wrong show giles reflected for moment then went straight to point have be with steel said abruptly tell that have be in detective line morley nodded quite so answered although asked steel to say nothing about be private gentleman now want former occupation to be known in rickwell prejudice exists against detective ware people like because one have something to conceal with trained man be afraid lest secret sin must come to light may be so although be rather cynical way of looking at matter be really joe bart yes quite at service only keep quiet certainly quite appreciate reason for wanting matter kept quiet see here mr morley will call so will be better replied ex detective cheerfully have sort of right to name be mother very good then a morley why must not exercise old skill help to find out who killed daisy must be delighted what skill remains to be at service be rusty now can not follow trail with old persistence talent besides mind be made up a to guilt yes yes interposed giles hastily think so agree with now listen to what have to tell be sure will think that be man who killed daisy have motive yes have will tell to concisely morley looked surprised at giles insistence nodded without word waited for explanation giles related that have learned about wilson how steel have connected with supposed clerk who have served summons on morley then proceeded to detail steel belief that so called wilson be burglar mentioned fact of yacht with strange name morley listened in silence interrupted recital with laugh when scarlet cross be mentioned in connection with robbery at lady summersdale house steel have found mare nest time said coolly knew better than to come to with cock bull story although have imposed very successfully on on hungarian princess talk of have summersdale case in hand know steel said that carried through successfully morley demurred know if can say be successful ware be not one of lucky case certainly got back jewel found in london hiding place did not catch one of thief bolted in red cross yacht oh be rubbish said morley frankly there be great many yacht at bexleigh on occasion remember one called red cross even if one of name be there doe not say that be same be off gravesend other day six month ago corrected giles gravely how do account for fact that wherever yacht have be burglary have taken place ca account for steel have yet to prove that there be connection between yacht robbery think kind of pirate ship evidently not bad idea though added morley musingly good must be removed easily without suspicion on board good looking yacht be have be done be in matter of lady summersdale jewel retorted ex detective found in london have reason to believe that be taken there by train besides there be connection between yacht robbery steel said that scarlet cross be found in safe interrupted morley there have long arm of coincidence ware that cross belonged to lady summersdale be one of trinket left behind if want proof on point have only to ask lady forgot be dead however daresay son daughter will be able to prove that cross be hers giles be much disappointed by explanation seemed clear enough if one must know truth must be man who have taken charge of case failing on point giles shifted ground well morley said be not very anxious to prove man wilson burglar be murderer be sure greater crime swallow up lesser sound law said morley lighting cigar well ware see how can help man wilson whether be innocent guilty have vanished moreover connection if with summersdale robbery of ten year ago wo prove guilty of poor ward death only mentioned that to show connection with yacht at gravesend a to wilson know where be morley wheeled round with eager light in eye devil do where be at priory be joke cried morley angrily if so be very poor one ware man who life at priory be friend franklin be also man who be in church on new year eve man who killed daisy a truly believe giles went on to state what reason be for belief at once morley started to foot ah know now why something about seemed to be familiar to what fool be believe be right ware what that be man wilson know what former name be replied morley with shrug now mention fancy be man who served summons on ought to know said ware dryly saw in room in good light true enough ware time kept collar up that white scarf round throat chin be quite buried in then have rough red wig will say red beard did trouble to ask to make comfortable wanted be to get out of way remember black eye franklin have eye like sometimes catch wondering where have seen before tell have lived in florence six year more fancied that when be detective might have seen insisted that have not be to london for year year originally came from state be once detective good lord how have lost old cleverness to be sure have be idle ten year then think franklin be man think so of course ca be sure naturally will deny that be ca prove matter tell ware said morley suddenly get that woman wilson lodged with down see if will recognize franklin a former lodger if one will know perhaps throw off guard ware rose very good idea said will write to at once be certain be man especially a have inherited daisy money killed in order to get fortune be why kept asking asher office boy about money left to people ah morley looked thoughtful so be motive think be sure of quite strong enough motive for many people said ware grimly if mr benker can verify man will have arrested will have to explain why came here instead of office boy why fled on night yes yes cried morley excitedly might perhaps explain why governess helped to escape ah giles face fell so might if dare to inculpate in crime ware said morley laying hand on young man shoulder if be must hing rash one think that miss denham be guilty if franklin be man who fled with will accuse to save certainly there be motive of money might be explained away see how can still there be always chance again may take alarm always presuming be man fly tell what ware bring mr benker down take into ground of priory will arrange franklin without suspecting will meet accidentally at place where can hide then can overhear if be man not will deny that be why must there be nothing so far a know that mr benker can lay hold of if be man will admit identity if not will explain who be whereas if show show that suspect will be on guard ware better let woman meet by chance be good plan replied giles shaking hand heartily with morley be delighted that must co operate with will yet prove anne be innocent hope so cried host slapping giles on back off with ware to do part will attend to franklin say word of plan to one upon word cried jubilantly feel just a though be in profession again thus laughing joking sent visitor away in best of spirit delighted that have one to help giles lost time in performing part of business sent letter to mr benker asking to come down for couple of day be intention to invite alexander also a boy must also be useful in identifying franklin a mother former lodger since leaving asher alexander have be taken up by steel who saw in making of good detective if alexander learned anything must certainly tell master then steel must come down to interfere ware did not want to meddle with matter at present wished to be sure of ground first then must ask assistance of detective to have franklin arrested of course have confidence in steel for above reason determined to keep present action quiet also steel be on south coast hunting for evidence concerning red cross yacht must not be pleased at being taken away to follow what might prove to be false trail ware therefore said nothing to mr benker about what desired to see simply asked to come down on visit there be prospect of having visitor one did not much wish to meet be princess karacsay several time have called to see have always put off promised explanation on plea instead of attending strictly to business have brought together made agreeable to giles too agreeable thought for have by time got into head that olga karacsay be in love with be not vain young man tried to think that attention be merely friendly be so persistent in invitation in slang phrase made such running with that grew rather nervous of attention several time have proposed to come on visit to rickwell hitherto have always managed to put off letter be becoming very imperative foresaw trouble be quite relief to giles when post arrived without letter from too persistent too charming lady however did not trouble on especial occasion be thus enabled to give time to mr benker good lady duly arrived looking more severe than ever with several new tale about iniquity of alexander expressed greatly obliged to giles for giving day in country got on very well with old housekeeper when ware told reason for asking mr benker grew rather nervous a did not think how must support interview also wanted to know what interview be for to extent giles have to take into confidence suppressed fact that suspected franklin of crime merely stated that steel who have introduced giles to mr benker have reason to believe that so called wilson be wanted by police mr benker have to do be to see if franklin be really former lodger after much talk many objection consented to do what be wanted be to wander in park of priory meet franklin accidentally near ruined summer house near what be known a fish pond morley have arranged that franklin must meet there be to be late so a to afford mr benker opportunity of speaking to man morley ware concealed in summer house saw mr benker parading grass shortly franklin arrived walking slowly mr benker saluted chapter xiv treasure trove beg pardon sir said mr benker to new comer do hope be not why changed tone to one of extreme surprise if ai mr wilson man did not move muscle ware who be watching be disappointed at least expected to start so called wilson be absolutely calm voice did not falter be making mistake name be franklin be voice muttered landlady still staring eye be same may ask to go said franklin be trespassing mr benker shook rusty black bonnet may change hair from red to black declared may shave off ginger beard ca alter eye mr wilson be that will swear to in court of law before judge jury let say what will about being liar of what be talking woman of sir hope may mention that be more respectful when boarded with

be said landlady color rising deal more respectable if be known why must deny to face be more than can make out mr wilson name be not wilson say be sir man woman eyed one firmly then franklin motioned mr benker to seat on mossy bank can talk better sitting said must like explanation of say that name be wilson boarded with at lambeth will take oath to have boarder red hair red beard red a tomato can

cross dangling from watch chain yes have what doe mean ca tell 'd give good deal to know have hinted to that be sign of criminal fraternity with be associated never must learn what object of cross be always kept quiet on subject have not seen for year then only when be on flying visit from italy have be to italy sir live there said franklin at florence have lived there for over ten year with occasional visit to london if still think that be brother can bring witness to prove lord sir want to prove nothing now look at hear voice do say a made mistake a humbly beg pardon for be so like mr

placed within reach of law hundred time if police come to will tell have told one must be more pleased than to see walter laid by heel be name walter yes walter franklin although chooses to call wilson name be george be blackguard oh sir flesh blood be brother of mine said franklin rising with snarl hate man have traded on resemblance to to get money do manner of scoundrelly action be why went to italy seems that did wisely for if must not prove have be abroad ten year must swear be walter oh sir really mr benker rose also nonsense swore be walter when first met take good look at now so that may be sure that be not want to have rascality placed on shoulder mr benker took good look sighed be not be very like may ask if be twin sir eye be only thing that have in common got from mother who be italian take after mother be black a see brother favored father who be a red a autumn sunset be indeed red sighed mr benker wrapping shawl round now sir hope will humbly forgive for be right mr benker only explained at length because be so sick of having brother sin imputed on hope paid rent oh yes sir did that regularly indeed sneered franklin then be more honest than gave credit for being because if have not paid must have done so seem to be decent woman widow murmured mr benker hoping that must give money mr franklin have intention of doing can go now said pointing with stick towards ornamental bridge be best way to high road mr benker if brother must return to let know police sir faltered will tell police said man frowning good day mr benker rather disappointed that must have received money wishing that have said walter franklin have not paid rent crept off lugubrious figure across bridge franklin watched till be out of sight then took off hat exposing high baldish head face be dark began to mutter to finally spoke articulately be never to be rid of scamp said shaking fist at sky have lived in italy in exile so must not be troubled with scheme rascality have buried here with daughter three who be faithful to in order that may not find out now hear of that woman be spy of believe came here from with made up story walter will come then will have to buy off will be glad to do so to be blackmailed by reptile will go back to florence first replaced hat began to dig stick in ground wonder if morley must help be shrewd man might advise how to deal with wretched brother of mine if must only trust looked round wonder where be promised to meet hour ago here franklin glanced at watch will walk over to elm ask who woman mr benker be may know be delivered audibly at interval giles be not astonished a knew from mr parry that man be in habit of talking aloud to be disappointed to receive clear proof that franklin be not man who have eloped with anne even if have be deceiving mr benker be not to be thought of must scarcely have spoken in soliloquy a did if have not be man asserted to be giles saying nothing to companion watched franklin in silence until be out of sight then rose to stretch long leg morley with groan followed example be who spoke first be half dead with cramp said rubbing stout leg just like old time when hid in cupboard at mother meddler to hear black bill give away over burglary ay nearly sneezed that time must have cost life have be safe enough in summer house cramp owch seems have be mistaken be giles must say so have so be mr benker be in same box man be evidently very like scamp of brother doubt morley be brother more be pity for franklin sake a well a own seems to hate brother fairly must be willing to give up to law if be done anything well said ware beginning to walk walter franklin to give real name have committed murder be more convinced than ever that be guilty person see what have to do with anne father be certainly dead died at florence have morley franklin come from florence may know may have heard morley nodded be quite right ware will ask about matter humph ex detective stopped for moment involuntary confession clear george franklin yes be innocent enough well inherited money said morley be queer that brother according to must have killed girl who kept fortune from be strange might be that walter franklin intended to play part of brother get money counting on resemblance between be true enough yet if george be in italy within hail so to speak see how must have done why not come to elm with speak to franklin will be waiting for there answered ware after thought evidently intends to trust if come may hold tongue draw out morley then can tell mr benker will say nothing about be not supposed to know that be visitor to rickwell will suspect game if chatter about ware must be cautious be difficult skein to unravel be that assented giles dolefully be further on with than be

come back feel at well will order carriage said giles rising will come back with really must excuse mademoiselle olga answered even country squire have work to do with hurried away in hour have satisfaction of seeing carriage roll down avenue with very disappointed young lady frowning at broad back of coachman then set about seeing what must do to circumvent be too late to call on franklin a be nearly six o'clock still ware thought must reconnoitre in wood be strange that elder princess must have be there morning wondered if also knew of anne whereabouts decided be impossible have only be few day in england must not likely know anything about governess still be odd that must have taken walk in particular direction that must have walked at here be mystery added to one already perplexed so greatly however time be too precious to be wasted in soliloquizing so went off post haste towards wood round priory since wished to avoid observation chose by path took rather circuitous route be nearly seven when found in forest summer evening be then at longest under great tree there be soft brooding twilight full of peace pleasant woodland sound have gone straight forward must have come on great house centred in fairy forest be last thing wished to do be not yet prepared to see franklin looked here there to see if human being be about unsuccessfully then took way to spot where have found coin of edward vii to surprise saw girl stooping searching at once decided that be looking for lost coin girl be not anne looking up suddenly surveyed with startled air saw face plainly in quiet

never heard of never heard of uncle said giles then wondered how must let know that have heard without confessing to eavesdropping suddenly occurred to that franklin have supposed on previous day made confidant of morley supposition took advantage of mr morley told that father have mentioned brother girl started thought for moment oh mean uncle walter said after pause yes never talk of little speech did not ring quite true seemed a though girl wished to back up saying of father whether believed not be that why pretended ignorance asked that be why replied miss franklin with brazen assurance be lying giles felt certain of must not bring untruth home to suddenly reverted to main object of interview have to do with possibility of anne being in priory what about coin be looking for

at institute procured engagement in london be one have before mr morley engaged received news that father be ill of typhoid fever hurried at once to florence not only be dead be buried so be informed by mark dane who be mark dane be father secretary one moment anne uncle stated that be man who lived in florence that father being scamp lived in england on account of walter george resided abroad be quite true walter may speak of father so for sake of clearness used to come sometimes to florence george never knew that be there thinking that be in london learned lately at time father lived in florence knew nothing of relationship between george walter father knew that if daisy died brother must inherit money kept watch on george so a to see if must come into property knew nothing of neither did mark although be deep in father confidence well a say father be supposed to have died expect corpse be buried in place mark doubt agreed to fraud be reason have not seen mark since immediately after death ca get explanation saw in florence told that father be dead buried since then have not seen so returned to england thinking father be dead certainly left little money went back to situation afterwards came down here on new year eve entered library saw father speaking to mr morley disguised feeling a be certain did not wish to be recognized shock be so great that nearly fainted went up to room afterwards to church to see father be there a know saw pas paper to daisy went out ten minute later followed wished to see be curious to know why have come to rickwell have let think be dead shortly afterwards went outside be snowing fast must not see father daisy suddenly came across father be beside grave of mr kent daisy be lying on ground gasped out that be dead implored to save do think killed afterwards denied that did at time believed that be guilty saw that must be arrested in frenzy of alarm cast about for mean to save remembered motor car be waiting at gate sent trim away on errand know know deceived to save father replied anne quietly got car in way went off with father told to go to gravesend where have yacht waiting near gravesend car upset left on roadside walked to tilbury boatman ferried across river went on board yacht did know father be owner of yacht did not said that belonged to friend departed in yacht went to french port then on to paris be from paris that sent drawing of coin yes knew that appearance be against must not bear to think that must believe guilty did not dare to send letter knew must recognize drawing of edward vii coin so sent a saw how long did stay in paris for week then went to italy to florence be father recognized have altered appearance gave reason at first for doing afterwards told that be engaged in political conspiracy something to do with anarchist be red cross symbol of society ca say refused to explain mystery of cross to admit fully giles can not understand father way be strange lead most peculiar life afterwards george franklin uncle came to england inherited property father sent to with explanation uncle refused to believe be guilty gave shelter in house until such time a character must be cleared came over have be hiding in priory ever since be so sorry for poor daisy for unexpected death came to see after grave found neglected thus went to clean a see portia cousin have be very good to have stayed in day have walked out in evening one know that be here one will ever know unless tell tell anne what do take for will keep quiet until can clear character make wife must not see again sighed giles will not be wise ca tell who killed daisy thus clear anne shook head wish must father declares that came out to see girl found already dead on grave face downwards have be killed during time waited behind saw that there be danger of being accused of crime since have asked to leave church thus be that lost presence of mind called on to save did so on impulse of moment thus came about where be father now anne thought for moment must tell if knew said seriously a know will not betray know where be since have be here have not heard word from uncle if uncle knew must hand father over to police hate be always kind to anne wonder if uncle killed daisy to inherit money be in italy at time be sure of have father suspicion who killed daisy no say have not why did ask to leave church how did manage wished to speak to about george franklin who must inherit money if died believe intended to warn that george be dangerous for hate uncle did father know that money have be left at time be only because be on spot that wished to see daisy wrote on scrap of paper that wished to see about money came out be always eager after miserable money said ware sadly father did know powell be dead at time anne told of discovery in connection with office boy so see father be in england masquerading a wilson finished yes said anne with shudder see now told nothing of indeed ca understand father at do know meaning of scarlet cross no refuse to tell wo say why pretended to be dead in way be most mysterious be fond of father giles although know be not good man did not kill daisy be sure of even at time thought have done so saved after may be a bad a possible be father owe daughter affection giles must have argued at moment anne started to foot heard sound of approaching footstep without word to giles flew over low wall darted across park be too astonished by sudden departure to say word have lost again knew where be after chapter xviii what happened next giles left churchyard slowly with brain in whirl anne have departed in hot haste taking shelter in hiding place dare not follow unless wanted to be discovered never knew who be whose footstep have startled away when left remained for quite ten minute where be in kind of dazed condition footstep be not heard now so intent have be upon anne flight on amazing thing have told that have not noticed when ceased then occurred to that have retreated just a though person have be listening have hastily gone away of must not be sure did know be that when rounded corner there be not soul in sight nothing remained to go home olga mother did not put in appearance on night so giles have ample time to think over meeting with anne did not see how must help story have related bewildered instead of enlightening after time rearranged detail concluded that in spite of denial father be guilty person crime have be committed for sake of powell money whether scarlet cross indicates political society be symbol of thief association said giles to ca say until steel be more certain of ground alfred denham walter franklin chooses to call be evidently bad lot have sufficient love for daughter to keep iniquity from be why anne be so much in dark quite believe that think father innocent saved on spur of moment be guilty for then giles proceeded to work out case a presented to walter franklin a found most convenient to call be scoundrel who preyed on society who by mischance have pure good daughter like anne to keep from knowing how bad be man apparently valued affection sent to be governess believed in not knowing how be plotting to get powell money certainly walter have resided in florence under name of denham ware quite believed guessed that did so in order to keep eye on brother george who be to inherit powell money probably knew beforehand that powell be ill so have feigned death that might carry out scheme without anne knowledge that scheme be to impersonate brother giles trembled to think of how proposed to get rid of george when time be ripe must have intended to murder for since have slain daisy with so little compunction certainly must not stick at second crime however thus giles argued first step to secure money be for to feign death thus get rid of anne then came to london a wilson stopped with mr benker in order to spy on ashers through alexander a soon a knew for certain that powell be dead that money be coming to daisy came down to rickwell on errand of serving summons then have lured girl outside of church to kill for anne following must have disappeared into night one must have be wiser appearance of daughter in library upset plan followed into church came out to find near dead body certainly made excuse giles believed that such be lie if have confessed to crime even anne might not have stopped with here giles remembered that at time of flight anne really believed that father be guilty at event have made use of to get away thus have reached yacht at gravesend be waiting for there in order that might fly after crime be committed perhaps intended to walk to tilbury crossing thames get on board yacht before hue cry be out anne hampered plan in measure then by mean of stolen motor car assisted thus man have got away by murder of girl have opened way to george inheriting money went to paris mused giles then to florence daresay walter intended to send anne away on excuse to murder brother in florence then must slip into dead man shoe come to inherit a george property of powell probably george left florence before walter arrived thus escaped death be safe so far how long will be safe then terrible thought occurred to giles wondered if walter have placed daughter at priory so a to have opportunity of coming to see brother thus seizing chance of killing anne innocent a be of real meaning of terrible scheme might be decoy if father came george must be murdered walter who be able to disguise with infernal ingenuity might slip into dead man shoe thus money have schemed for must come to evidently last act of tragedy be not yet played out more giles puzzled over matter more bewildered became must see a thought what have be done must not guess how last act be to be carried out yet walter franklin be hiding somewhere waiting to pounce out on unsuspecting brother second crime might involve anne still deeper in nefarious transaction of father finally giles made up mind to seek george franklin at priory tell what thought man must at least be put on guard may be said that ware fancied might be permitted to see anne a reward for kind warning before calling on franklin went to see foreign lady to surprise have left by early morning train there be note from olga informed that mother have insisted on returning to town finding country cold dull note added that olga must be glad to see at westminster flat a soon a must come to london ended with remark that have yet to give answer to question giles be relieved when read olga be gone two day of probation be extended indefinitely might find way of releasing anne before need give dreadful answer again again did bless selfishness of elder princess have removed obstacle of olga from path

did hear of meeting certainly anne told of directly came back oh have heard about mr ware niece confessed that loved from morley heard that defended did morley know anne be here certainly not at outset of acquaintance informed that believed to be guilty resolved to say nothing lest might tell police why did not tell that be innocent asked giles hotly man looked grave smoothed shaven chin

reason to believe that did replied franklin told be innocent began ware franklin interrupted love too well to say otherwise be guilty must not believe that if told sit down mr ware said franklin after pause will explain exactly how confession came about giles took seat again eyed host pale defiant be use saying anything against anne be innocent mr ware believed that when first came to hate brother because be bad man liked niece when came to for shelter took in notwithstanding enormity of crime be accused of having committed gained fortune said ware bitterly must rather have be without fortune gained at price answered franklin coldly really believed anne guiltless defended father fancied since have helped to escape that have killed poor girl did cried giles be sure did have motive oh yes to get money five thousand year forget by miss kent death came to brother must have found mean to get believe will find mean yet understand will explain franklin seemed fairly puzzled by giles remark so young man set forth theory have formed about murder at first mr franklin smiled satirically after time face became grave seemed agitated when giles ended walked room in state of subdued irritation what have done to be so troubled with relative a walter said aloud believe be right mr ware may attempt life to get money a be rather like one in appearance may be able to pas off a why there be woman

ca believe such thing of will tear out of heart be impossible impossible franklin looked at with pitying smile a hid face in hand then touched on shoulder led way along passage towards back part of house at door at end paused room be rather dark wo see clearly said will know by voice must know anyway cried giles fiercely tormented beyond endurance franklin gave glance a though asking to brace for ordeal then opened door showed small mercy in announcing ware coming anne here be mr ware come to see tell truth room be not very large be enveloped in semi gloom blind be pulled down curtain be drawn bed be near window on lay anne in white dress be lying on bed with rug thrown over foot when heard name of giles uttered cry keep away said harshly keep away let come anne anne cried giles

xix clue lead to london be indeed portia seeing that be discovered sprang from bed faced giles with sullen defiant look on freckled face still standing in strong light poured in through window ware looked at girl satirically be very clever mimic miss franklin said rather forgot in last speech anne be of too sensitive nature to have explained with wealth of detail be deceived at first grumbled portia rocking only for moment replied giles now must like to know meaning of masquerade also cried franklin in turn be staring at daughter with look of profound amazement where be anne wretched girl have run away run away exclaimed men simultaneously yes after finding out last night that have killed daisy kent be afraid to stop knew that hated father thought might hand over to police last night told so said must run away love anne let do a liked be who let out ended portia defiantly anne must not have so mistrusted cried franklin much perturbed surely always protected treated well ah did

be on condition did not tell have reason to poor miserable girl to be outcast now to leave only refuge sighed shook head giles time have be watching portia whose face bore expression of obstinacy worthy of mule did scheme for anne departure include masquerade have indulged in be own idea retorted defiantly anne wished to get away without father knowing so stopped in room pretended to be servant be deceived a knew exactly how to imitate voice pulled down blind so that one must see who be only must have guessed truth how be that because love giles thought strange speech for heavy looking girl to make be that original remark on part asked confessed candidly suggested to anne must pas off a so give longer time to get away said that might deceive servant father must never deceive because loved have good try continued portia nodding red head triumphantly when father spoke name at door thought must try well have done so only to fail responded ware coolly for moment be deceived forgot how to manage voice moreover explanation be too elaborate how be dare to confess a anne that killed girl anne did kill daisy kent did not yes did confessed a much to father last night to also asked to tell so that might forget about be going over to place very day to tell when father brought in thought must pretend to be anne tell in way anne must have written must said portia eagerly began to write letter saying that be guilty afterwards thought might fall into hand of police tore up told to let know by word of mouth asks of be that will forget that ever existed let tell that with own lip said giles groaning yes portia tell mr ware place anne have gone to portia eyed father with anger how can tell when know anne never said where be going let out by back door just before dawn went away know more if writes will let mr ware know sha retorted girl anne want to forget be impossible said giles whose face be now haggard with anguish of moment must be friend portia tell think how suffer think how suffers poor darling cried portia whose sympathy be with anne ask more sha speak speak must not although giles cajoled franklin stormed must be said of portia be very loyal to outcast there be nothing for for ware to depart did what be best thing to be done giles did not very well know anne be lost again did not know where to look for must not bring to believe that be guilty in spite of confession to portia franklin be that blackguard of father of hers over again thought a tramped moodily through priory park be afraid lest brother uncle must denounce have taken crime on own shoulder even though be father must not sacrifice so much for be just noble of to do so oh poor love will ever be able to shelter from storm of life there did not seem to be much chance of at present moment mistrusting uncle have vanished must let one portia know of new hiding place portia a giles saw be too devoted to anne to confess whereabouts without permission how be such permission to be obtained anne allowed uncle to think guilty in order to save unworthy father from fraternal hatred have asserted innocence to giles have apparently through portia tried to deceive again so that might not follow poor darling cry giles full of pity wish to put out of life have fled to avoid incriminating father if told whole truth father must be in danger chooses to bear guilt why must think must betray man bad a be must screen for dear sake oh giles stopped looked up appealingly to hot blue sky if only knew where be to be found if must only hold in arm never never must let go again poor quixotic darling will ever be worthy of such nobility be very well apostrophizing sky such heroic did not help in practical way cast about in own mind to consider in direction have gone nearest railway station to london be five mile away must not leave district thus openly for stationmaster knew well have frequently travelled from centre a miss denham must be sure to recognize even though wore veil anne a giles judged must not risk such recognition certainly there be station ten mile distant be very little used by rickwell people might have tramped that distance have taken ticket to london from there be intention to go to london giles thought highly probable that must anne a knew from portia have very little money must be necessary for to seek out friend must probably go to mr cairn for mr cairn believed to be guiltless must shelter in meantime later on situation must be procured for abroad must leave england under feigned name giles felt that be course anne must adopt determined to follow clue suggested by theory having made up mind to course giles hurried home to pack few thing arrange for immediate departure chance rather providence led past mr parry eye about five o'clock of course good lady be behind window spying on sundry a usual caught sight of giles striding along road with bent head discouraged air wondering be matter desperately anxious to know mr parry sent out jane to intercept ask in giles declined to enter at first then struck that since be in search of information about anne mr parry might know something knowledge be so omniscient that for knew might have be aware time of anne presence at priory held tongue mr parry must do sometimes out of pity for girl fate giles went in resolved to pump mr parry without mentioning what knew of anne supposing be ignorant be not going to be one to reveal anne refuge if did know ware be certain that mr parry must tell since be aware how deeply loved governess thus in five minute young man found seated in big armchair opposite old lady be rather grim with have not be to see for ever so long said rubbing beaky nose royal princess have taken up too much of time suppose oh know about be sorry did not stay for few day replied giles in most amiable tone wished to introduce to mean present to corrected old dame who be stickler for etiquette be genuine princess be not oh yes be not royal princess karacsay be wife of magyar noble be not austrian however a came from jamaica younger princess olga be jamaica interrupted mr parry humph be where anne denham be born queer woman must come from same island be certainly odd replied giles mere coincidence humph from mr parry folk make own coincidence what do mean mr parry mean humph know if must tell giles be now on fire to learn meaning evidently mr parry did know something might be able to help seeing that be slightly offended with required tact to get necessary information out of old lady giles knew best way to effect purpose be to feign indifference mr parry be bursting to tell news that must come out sooner if pretended that did not much care to hear there be reason why must tell said coolly know about princess karacsay daughter only came down here for rest oh did did ware humph rubbed nose again eyed with malignant pleasure be sure elder princess did come down to see franklin doe know said giles trying to be calm took walk in priory wood suppose be how mistake make mistake retorted mr parry with snort know new gardener who be employed at priory told jane who told that princess karacsay mother called on franklin other morning entered house be with for over hour came to door to see off gardener be attending to shrub near at hand must not hear what said to one declares that franklin be a pale a sheet queer thought giles remembering how elder lady have denied knowledge of man however did not make remark to mr parry well there be nothing in said aloud franklin lived in italy for many year may have met princess there true enough mr parry be rather discomfited there may be nothing in franklin seems to be decent enough in life though bit of recluse have nothing to say against man giles thought that be rather fortunate for franklin seeing that mr parry tongue be so dangerous if ever came to know of brother walter of relation between george must be sure to make mischief thought prudent to say nothing le revealed to good lady better however attitude did not prevent ware from trying to learn what mr parry have discovered with regard to two princess told interesting detail without being urged last night about nine saw one of out for walk princess olga questioned giles mr parry nodded if be younger of two be not bad looking girl ware passed window went on to look at church rather strange hour to look at church giles started be about hour that have be talking to anne shortly afterwards have heard footstep have fled now believed that olga must have overheard portion of conversation be footstep have heard retreating at once remembered be threat that if tampered with anne in meantime must have arrested then be reason why olga have not come to house again why mother have left so suddenly for london wondered if elder princess knew about anne be assisting daughter to get poor girl into hand of law giles turned pale what be matter ware asked mr parry sitting up nothing stammered coincidence oh simply mean that a princess karacsay anne came from jamaica be strange that must go away to london together think so too there must be connection giles started to foot anne said loudly do know anne be here be here said mr parry with gratified chuckle where have be hiding be more than know however be certain be anne saw morning on moor be veiled dressed quietly knew walk turn of head must be mistaken said giles perplexed indeed be not trust one woman to know however may disguise tell anne denham have be here in hiding believe left neighborhood after wonder who took in muttered mr parry rubbing nose a usual must find that out what do mean by saying anne went to london with can believe own eye ear suppose snapped good lady be out at seven o'clock taking walk always do get up early in summer be how keep health have patience with who lie in bed what did see be impatient ware want to find anne a believe be guiltless have suffered lot unjustly while have be on wild goose chase have be here time if have only known must have told did worse luck know be friend said giles pressing hand can help by saying where anne have gone to oh good man must find that out for believe

what happened then asked giles anxiously why princess olga embraced kissed doe know yes have be friend for long time humph princess olga mother come from jamaica where anne be born said mr parry queer there be sort of connection be too suspicious mr parry better can see through stone wall believe ware that if there be connection between two be dutchwoman however anne got into carriage drove away giles caught up hat to london cried jubilantly know where anne be to be found now to mr parry dismay rushed out chapter xx many slip cup lip giles be not destined to go to london a quickly a thought rushed out of mr parry cottage leaving good lady in state of frenzied curiosity walked rapidly through village on road to own house on way dropped into merry dancer to look at b c morris still

leave be not going also morley looked astonished why must go have priory on seven year lease besides like place might go to escape brother think walter franklin will dare to trouble george now be innocent of actually committing crime certainly be accessory after fact will keep out of way let hope so for sake of george well morley must be off giles went home at top speed morley remained at inn to make inquiry about hungarian princess although be not now detective yet morley still preserved instinct made ask question heard that foreign lady have driven to westbury afterwards strolled round to stable to see new coachman learned from about strange lady who entered carriage on moor man described face for seemed that have lifted veil for moment when alighting at station morley took in walked home jubilantly knew that anne be with princess karacsay if be old day said 'd wire to london to have house of hungarian woman searched wonder what have to do with matter humph anne killed

mind own business if ex detective wife have not be present if conversation have not taken place in presence franklin might have be more easy to deal with presence of third party shut mouth so morley must hing made attempt to do anything have giles known of might have set mind at rest for must not get out of head that be being followed at liverpool station alighted about ten o'clock looked everywhere in crowd to see if be being observed fear be vain for must distinguish one with inquiring look on face note person dogging footstep stepped into cab ordered man to drive to st john wood at

bedroom giles smoked complacent pipe if one did try to follow said to must have missed when took underground railway be close on half past eleven when ended wandering too late to call at westminster flat giles thought that olga must never think have traced flight with anne must not do anything till morrow probably not before twelve o'clock be up early went off to new scotland yard to see steel did not intend to tell about anne thinking that detective might arrest if knew of whereabouts desired to know if steel have discovered anything in connection with scarlet cross also since steel knew olga so well might be able to explain why have come down with mother to rickwell why elder princess have called on franklin half thought that olga keeping promise have brought anne to london to have taken in charge by steel on second thought fancied that olga must keep anne a hostage not deliver up if giles agreed to become husband thus thinking went to see steel detective be within saw giles at once looked very pleased with saluted ware with triumphant smile well sir said have found out astonishing lot of thing about murder asked ware apprehensively steel face fell be still mystery expect

father must be visited on child what be name of man who confessed asked giles mark dane ware started be name of man anne have mentioned a father secretary however said nothing when steel requested to tell knew about wilson related everything save that be anne father steel listened attentively chin on hand when giles finished nodded will go down see brother remarked if hate man whom think committed crime so much will be anxious to assist in securing wonder why governess helped wilson rather walter franklin to escape of course believe that be daughter now look so angry mr ware if remember when talked with at princess karacsay said must draw own inference be what meant here detective stopped peered into giles face appear to be so surprised a thought must be be sure that miss denham be wilson daughter be not yet sure if can make mark dane speak further will be certain know about matter unfortunately be gone caught at bournemouth after told portion of truth managed to get away be long story how fooled will tell to time worst of be resumed steel dolefully dane will warn wilson will get away same now have told wilson have brother may be able to find out something in quarter brother be all

see dane get truth out of will see again hope for sake that miss denham be not daughter of man from few word let drop by dane fear be at event sir can set mind at rest about being guilty of murder be innocent father did giles departed much comforted by statement knew well enough that anne be daughter of wilson alias denham alias franklin shuddered again to think of pure good anne being mixed up with man who be hand glove with criminal class criminal however put matter out of mind for moment drove to westminster flat if be there determined to take away to place of safety defy steel walter

then began to laugh refused to explain why did so save in general way be queerest case be ever in said with chuckle know how queer well explain think be keeping something from be answered steel readily tit for tat mr ware did little business on own account said nothing to repay compliment be afraid must arrest miss denham mean miss franklin must not have done that investigation into thieving

have met mr cairn still olga time have known much more of anne history than have chosen to tell if princess karacsay have not be so candid ware doubted very much if olga must have confessed

leave post beside captain besides thought mattered very little whether be seen not ware knew that be on board moreover if dark horse be overhauled must suffer most by capture must do no good to throw anne overboard although felt much inclined to do so if only for revenge calthorpe must well be proud of boat responded gallantly to strain put upon tore like mad thing through waste of water swung
