sweated freely for money few far seeing editor assured of brilliant future did not seem anxious to assist to realise prophecy one knew who lancaster be where came from a never spoke of past for five year have be in town unable to do anything else have drifted into journalism in heart cherished notion of startling london with up to date novel pending joy of waking up to find famous acted a theatrical critic for daily budget paper paid lowest price for best procurable talent eked out income with stray article occasionally wrote verse in way have made acquaintance of fairy fan who have read of attempt in paper thought that might compose word fit for rosy mouth to sing took fancy to for be handsome well bred even miss berry pretty astute woman a be must not learn anything of lancaster past cleverly a tried to find out uncle using coarser method tried also failed likewise only to one man have frank unbosomed be to eustace jarman who have first extended to lonely young man helping hand memory of starth word made lancaster wonder if jarman have revealed anything must have sought out friend to ask directly have not jarman dwelt in essex however frank concluded that starth have merely made remark about parent in casual way without real knowledge so dismissed that matter easily from mind must not so easily dismiss memory of quarrel especially a charming face of miss starth floated persistently before mental vision jarman have introduced frank to starth three year before two men have never got on well together by mutual consent avoided one until miss berry brought

of raking up old tale seem very interested in miss starth naturally said lancaster sadly seeing what be supposed to have done if knew must denounce not on evidence have placed before said jarman be sensible girl death of brother will add to income what unpleasant speech said frank in vexed tone live in world of fact boy besides beauty be loss by time have arrived at common here jarman turned down shady lane passed through arcade of chestnut tree at end of be open space surrounded by tree amidst thatched cottage might have come out of fairy tale from quaint look of wall be whitewashed window of lattice work in front of flourished garden filled with old fashioned flower evidently delight of who have planted white paling fence separated from lane over gate of leant elderly lady frank recognised mr perth be delicate old dame with ivory hued face smooth white hair dressed severely in black from head to foot even to black straw hat beckoned to eustace knew well enough why be in mourning for obvious reason asked question why be in black mr perth bad news hope know if call bad good replied with asperity walter have be murdered frank in background winced dug cane into turf eustace took intelligence with well feigned surprise murdered mr perth how terrible who murdered ah be have to be discovered mildred received letter morning telling that walter have be found last night shot through head in room in sand lane also be stabbed in breast right through heart stabbed also began frank incautiously when jarman interposed new secretary mr perth mr desmond o'neil come from ireland be happy to meet mr o'neil said old lady in most stately manner what be said be be only expressing surprise stammered frank that man must be stabbed a well a shot put in jarman ever watchful wonder at be one mode of death enough apparently not shot must have killed too a be under right eye right eye objected frank be on tip of tongue to correct speech swallowed word how horrible may well say that know detail yet said mr perth addressing eustace mildred have gone up to town to hear what can police be in possession of house let hope assassin will be found let hope so muttered frank then aimlessly strolled away to little distance to overcome qualmish feeling be rather nervous chap explained jarman to mr perth bad health weak eye doe indeed look pale mr jarman fear be not looking well morning wonder said eustace shock well be shock to interrupted mr perth speaking low to tell truth mr jarman mildred be more grieved than be never liked walter heaven forgive for speaking ill of dead well mr jarman know what bad man be will bury reputation with poor wretch mr perth did not seem inclined to do led mildred truly awful life continued for influence must have parted with income to moreover wished to marry one of disreputable friend never knew that cried eustace looked displeased now that have acquired knowledge who be mr denham met here when walter brought down ugh jarman looked disgusted effeminate little dandy think there be harm in mr perth be as pure simple disreputable insisted mr perth came from united state manner principle be english believe have money for reason walter desired to bring about marriage eustace fidgeted ought to ask of course said did did denham propose certainly not said old lady promptly saw to that mr jarman say what will walter be better out of world than in have lived must certainly have ended in gaol think what disgrace must have meant to mildred oh think starth must always have kept on safe side said jarman have great notion of looking after own skin have starth have have sister idea a to who killed walter life be distinctly apart from ours never allowed to come to rose cottage more often than be necessary a worried mildred indeed knew bad lot of people most probably met death at hand of one of must say added mr perth frankly that be kind of mr berry to inform of tragedy berry cried lancaster who have again strolled within earshot yes mr banjo berry most peculiar name do know jarman answered for obvious reason be speaking about morning said hastily suppose mention of name in connection with case recalled to mind o'neil yes said frank taking cue banjo berry be not ordinary name did ever meet mr perth mr starth friend be not mine replied old dame stiffly mr berry must have be most intimate with walter a say in letter to mildred be again addressing jarman that intends to offer reward of two hundred pound for detection of assassin lancaster dropped stick in sheer amazement to prevent betrayal eustace took arm with significant pressure well mr perth anything can do will be done said cheerily will let know when miss starth return certainly will be thankful for aid mr perth retired into cottage two friend went on way frank in state of bewilderment what doe berry mean by offering reward gasped mean to hang said jarman promptly be friend h be a told have said that so often that begin to think be enemy why have given cause to hate h be who know be friend of starth did matter said lancaster starth hinted that berry wished to marry niece if be undesirable a husband before be still more undesirable a outlaw jarman thought then asked question how did meet berry called to ask to write song for fairy fan having seen poetry in magazine see observe frank berry sought acquaintance did not seek brought starth together again well did dropped starth acquaintance a know because did get on well came to know fairy fan somehow be constantly meeting there woman made running with well be capricious day must snub flirt with starth on other day must give go by stick to quite so divided favour to arouse jealousy between frank coloured looked uneasy if put that way did what be berry attitude can hardly say save whenever be present starth always have row h be kind of male ate said jarman musingly berry be speaking to starth last night before starth insulted yes what have got to do with everything frank tell man berry be at bottom of whole mystery got into trouble now mean to hang lancaster stared reason asked jarman made extraordinary reply because of scarlet bat chapter v inquest there be considerable excitement over murder in sand lane especially in theatrical journalistic circle deceased be well known figure in bohemia a for year have consorted with actor with reporter with sundry idle men who doing nothing sought company of gifted with creative mimetic power walter starth being cursed with enough to live on have developed into thorough loafer chose bohemia to dwell in because gaslight attraction be congenial to mind occasionally wrote article short story sometimes walked on in melodrama a guest never did real work preferring idle talk constant drinking be not favourite with slave of lamp burly figure red head be excessively familiar consequently there be immense curiosity manifested regarding untimely terrible death who have killed be first question everyone asked before inquest took place be known that frank lancaster be assassin how rumour have started no one knew somehow within twenty four hour after discovery of body lancaster name be on lip now frank moving in same bohemia be a great favourite a starth be reverse at outset everyone declined to believe that have slain starth in so brutal manner afterwards open enmity between two men be recalled attention to fairy fan be mentioned exaggerated version be given of quarrel in piccadilly theatre when inquest be held be quite believed that lancaster be guilty man flight proved guilt frank concealed under dyed hair brown face of desmond o'neil wished eustace to be present at inquest jarman did not think wise to put in appearance captain berry will be there said a stated before be pretty sure that for unexplained reason be enemy be probable that have made acquainted with a much of saying doings a can gather doubtless know that be friend will keep out of frank lest captain berry must be induced to run down here ask question if so might spot in spite of disguise besides will see that there be to be seen in paper what be reported mildred will explain when return be stopping in town for inquest yes mr perth have gone up also a poor girl be much cut up brother be brother however bad may be frank reflected for few moment eustace said at last do remember what told about starth taunting with not knowing father be true know yes afterwards confessed that said that only to get dandered how did know that must rile in way why must hit bull eye with pot shot fancied at time that might have told something no denied jarman keep pore open mouth shut be probable that starth learnt something about family history from egregious berry how doe berry come to know anything be one of thing must find out one of element connected with attitude towards do think know what scarlet bat mean yes know more than do on face of purposely made acquaintance to get into trouble witness way in brought starth together secured fairy fan aid to make bad blood between wanted starth dead hanged at least think so of course be groping in dark what be hanging to asked frank much puzzled know money must say so far a know there be money worth trouble on berry part coming way observe son said jarman paternally so far a know be crux of whole thing be a puzzled a over meaning of scarlet bat a be only mystery about save reason of berry enmity take leave to jam two mystery together when make one may perhaps be able to get at truth see how be to start said lancaster knitting brow wait till inquest be over then will have something to go upon berry will be witness a to quarrelling with dead man berry will collect evidence to make case blacker when berry have done worst will know card see then will play game with hidden hand now son start in with typing have to get story sent in to morrow must do something to keep up fiction of being secretary while jarman friend be engaged in literary pursuit in essex inquest be being held in london on body of walter starth after jury have surveyed corpse have particularly examined bullet hole knife wound one of be sufficient to cause death police inspector in charge of case detailed fact have be called in by mr betts landlady of deceased found walter starth dead in sitting room body be on floor with wound in heart bullet hole under left eye knife have be found pistol to be more accurate derringer revolver be discovered in fireless grate there be sign of struggle everything be in place man apparently taken by surprise must have died instantly be impossible to say whether be knifed first shot afterwards be part of doctor evidence card have be found torn in two lying on floor bore name of frank lancaster address on silver plate of derringer be initial f l so inspector presuming that lancaster owner of pistol be assassin have called at address given on card to arrest at point coroner said that witness be assuming too much inspector herny submitted that revolver used be property of lancaster that torn card bore name that servant matilda samuel stated that man answering to description of lancaster have called to see deceased also lancaster starth have quarrelled at piccadilly theatre on night before committal of crime lancaster have be heard to threaten deceased finally captain berry whom inspector have come into contact with at lancaster chamber where be paying visit stated that two men be bitter rival for hand of niece miss berry known on stage a fairy fan why be not lancaster arrested asked coroner fled sir replied herny after committal of crime did not return to room last seen of be when passed matilda samuel few minute after nine o'clock doctor who have examined body deposed that wound be sufficient to cause death from condition of body thought that man be killed between six eight o'clock be doctor opinion that starth have be shot first stabbed afterwards must give absolute reason save that if suspected person using knife have thus secured end must hardly fire shot into dead body especially into head noise must have attracted neighbour said doctor a man be dead there must be sense in acting so foolishly in vindictive spirit assassin might certainly have mutilated body with knife be convinced that killed starth with revolver coroner interposed twice witness have referred to assassin a how did know that criminal be man doctor answered that did not know presumption favoured male criminal be improbable that woman must be such straight shot doctor have be in south america talked so moreover knife have be driven so deeply into heart that doubted whether woman must have strength to make such wound besides after firing shot securing purpose woman must never have have nerve to stop in room for over hour there be evidence that woman stopped in room for hour witness explained that be thinking of inspector herny remark of lancaster having be seen by servant leaving at nine if lancaster be guilty must have stopped in room with victim body for over hour murder took place between six eight lancaster did not leave till after nine most irregular remark said coroner discontentedly have right to assume so much wound killed man wound must cause death said doctor sticking to opinion be belief shot be cause mutilation be after thought when witness stepped down mr betts landlady be called knew nothing at on day have gone to wedding one of cousin have be absent from midday till half past nine returned to find tilly servant in hysteric lodger dead then called in police mr betts never knew that lodger expected anyone have said nothing to have never given tilly permission to go out during absence have severely reprimanded for leaving house be tilly duty to have remained in until mr betts returned landlady declared that never heard of quarrel that never saw lancaster that knew of one likely to have killed lodger mr starth be quiet gentleman in house whatever may have be outside rarely have visitor captain berry be one of few who called sometimes mr starth must go away for week always returned looking ill much more of little account be extracted from garrulous landlady must throw light on darkness of crime be succeeded a witness by tilly whose evidence be delivered amidst flood of tear poor little wretch have be severely frightened when entered house after leaving young man went to take mr starth lamp said sobbing a allays liked oil ' not gas be lying deaden so 'owled dropped till missus shook up there be anyone in house gentleman what

think mr starth got out of house so a to quarrel freely with visitor yuss said a there must be row must anyone have got into lower part of house during absence tilly stole look at hard faced mr betts why bless y'no sir wos perticler about lockin ' barrin ' winder mr starth must 'ave let anyone in left with mr lancaster be know w'en come back after leaving alf sawr dead w'en brought lamp nearly dropped with 'orror after puttin ' lamp down ran to woller on kitchen floor with fear till missus come ' shook up wos too feared to holler fur perlice when tilly be dismissed with streaming face to companionship of alf who lurked at back of court captain berry be called little skipper looked harder than ever delivered evidence in dry fashion with unwinking eye without saying more than be needful language smacked of great waste land yes sir guess knew corpse lancaster fair hated one there be always shine between when met niece sent fair crazy wanted to marry shied when asked did want to run in double harness with not much tried to make two boy friend must cotton to one nohow starth did liquidate considerable at piccadilly theatre made trouble oh came right along callin ' lancaster high mighty name wanted to put stopper on starth jaw lancaster sailed in levelled straight pretty hitter be lancaster call square of man to wish out of world did lancaster say that asked coroner berry spat nodded several time bet said 'd like to wring starth neck that 'd be better out of world than in that 'd like to kick out of world oh there be holy show took starth home never let on that be goin ' to make up with lancaster next day made appointment a heard on oh guess lancaster have row with starth in own shanty let out at with derringer clean shot sir berry spat again knife know anythin ' of th ' knife heard a lancaster be in 'frisco once so might have imported bowie yes sir that wound be made by bowie berry said much more to same effect appeared to be quite sure that lancaster be guilty be followed by baird who have be imported into case by skipper on word to inspector herny baird admitted reluctantly that lancaster have threatened to kick starth out of world that two men be on worst of term afterwards followed cause of trouble fairy fan exquisitely dressed quite overcome with emotion deposed that two men asked to marry refused a wished to stay with dear uncle starth lancaster hated one never thought must come to starth usually started quarrel be always lancaster who threatened frequently expressed wish that starth be dead lancaster told that when slumming for newspaper sometimes carried revolver weapon produced in court be have seen once have belonged to father lancaster said elder lancaster name be frank also hence initial on silver plate death of starth wickedness of lancaster have inflicted two several shock on so that have be out of bill at piccadilly theatre never thought lancaster be so bloodthirsty always seemed to be such quiet young man starth language be certainly most insulting mildred starth be then called deposed that be sister of deceased lived in essex saw very little of brother got on pretty well be fond of quiet life brother be never happy unless be leading fast one on night previous to murder be in town brother be in box at piccadilly theatre be last saw of seemed excited little overcome with drink have heard express hatred of lancaster be careful in presence not to explain reason have never heard threaten lancaster twice have heard express fear lest lancaster must kill described lancaster a ruffian from san francisco witness have never seen accused man formed gist of evidence collected by police be quite enough to permit coroner making speech strongly condemning lancaster said that doubt lancaster have intimated intention of calling on starth a there be reason to believe that starth who be manifestly afraid of opponent have invited to come lancaster have undoubtedly brought revolver with must seem that have called on deceased with intention of committing murder perhaps starth a seemed probable have torn lancaster card in two piece having be found insult have fired lancaster rage hence murder seems that one heard shot at event one must be found who must give such evidence jury must therefore take doctor opinion that starth have be shot between six eight be impossible to say why lancaster have remained behind with victim body until nine apparently did a be seen leaving house by servant matilda samuel jury have inspected body have heard evidence cause of death on fact before must give verdict be easily given without least hesitation jury brought in verdict of wilful murder against frank lancaster after that crowd went out neighbourhood buzzed with excitement one question asked be whether police knew whereabouts of guilty man police did not to reporter inspector herny confessed that have absolutely clue lancaster have vanished like water bubble chapter vi scrap of paper when big daily arrived at shanty containing account of inquest lancaster be perfectly convinced that jarman be right captain berry be enemy sure enough though for life of frank must not conjecture cause of such hostility also seemed a though fairy fan be likewise against since according to frank lied freely during five minute evidence starth might have asked to marry explained to friend when be strictly alone certainly never did have idea of doing so lancaster hesitated not being willing to reveal deepest most sacred feeling even unto staunch friend know to what length infatuation might have carried oh then did love said jarman alertly that depends on what call love certainly have fancy for thought pretty fascinating be always on best behaviour with think liked more than little eustace laid one big finger on daily telegraph significantly look like said berry put against replied frank in disturbed tone will swear that must never lie like unless be put up to in way did like although be always too selfish to love anyone jewel lace carriage pair admiration cutting dash be what fairy fan desired must not offer thing so be careful not to compromise with in way never got so far a asking to marry though know what might have be as have not changed mind what caused to change mind son frank looked oddly at big man then fixed eye studiously on pipe while making evasive reply saw someone liked better explained then admiration for fairy fan seemed to vanish like cloud of smoke after saw that other face thought more of fan be able to tell starth with clear mind did care about 'd have danced at wedding with pleasure h be who be have right to ask to continue with lady evidence know first second never expressed wish to that starth must die told certainly that sometimes carried revolver when slumming never mentioned that belonged to father did show to lastly never said to fan that father name be same a own be well yes francis same a mine did revolver belong to did got from aunt there be silver plate on with father initial own of course might have seen revolver produced in court said jarman thoughtfully why must state that be father chance shot suggested frank knew initial on be father not yours h be be in conspiracy along with berry lancaster rose to pace room in exasperated manner why must there be conspiracy demanded have asked that before said jarman calmly have replied that think money be at bottom of evidently berry forced acquaintance on fairy fan made running to create jealousy bring about catastrophe money boy frank sat down in despair see said pushing hand into pocket supposing there be money though for life of ca think where be to come from why be needful for to be hanged before berry fairy fan get be what puzzle said eustace nodding if wanted out of way must have polished off at sand lane a easily a did starth do think killed do else employed someone else to do be lured there to be inculpated in crime begad have managed finely to put rope round throat money well ca make out considering mean have taken to get into trouble there be money in matter way mighty big sum too seeing have gone a far a murder be so vague supposition on part admit same can theorise in other way unless well what be be going to say that perhaps be blackmail may find out where be come forward offering to save neck from being wrung if pay well that inculpates besides if be entitled to money of knew nothing be easy enough for fan to marry then must have be square for berry without having have to slay starth outlaw sure enough groaned jarman who be getting more more puzzled what mean ca say have be outlawed in due form police be after all have to do be to remain quiet not give away a nearly did to mr perth other day have feeling under control said frank talk of stab in breast startled ca understand why did see at time did feel man heart no sight of bullet wound under left eye be enough for wanted to do be to get away hide well then a have only match did feel poor man heart be easy to see how missed knife wound jarman took up paper again doctor say that starth be shot first mutilated afterwards why must poor wretch have be mutilated at ca say look like piece of savagery to though to be sure think mutilation wrong word to be used for clean stab if ear have be cut off now said frank with shudder be horrible man be shot dead then stabbed to make sure be how read well person who sent into other world must have be anxious to make certain time be eustace who paced room only heard of one corpse being treated like before where be that asked lancaster in san francisco year ago who be why be slain twice for be what amount to jarman did not answer immediately be close on eight o'clock stood looking out of study window into luminous night secretary have be haymaking throughout afternoon shaven expanse of particularly rough lawn be dotted with haycock picturesquely disposed beyond be untrimmed hedge jarman must never allow to be cut under grew straggling white rose bush flower of showed starlike in glimmering light over hedge through vista of leafy elm must be seen far extending country light of tilbury in long line like flying illuminated railway carriage clear starry sky yellow harvest moon completed beauty of scene nightingale be singing wildly in copse at bottom of meadow jarman heaved sigh of delight be peaceful scene said with look of pure pleasure why do go into gaslight noisy crowd when can dwell always in arcadia well said frank not seeing where speech must lead to have be in london theatre drawing room for age true enough keep out of thing be saying that san francisco be noisy be did hear said frank then a jarman again made reply spoke up rather pettishly position did soothe nerve in way poor fellow can trust eustace how do know be becoming confidential because talked sentiment about scene before eustace returned to seat laughed rather sadly be observer son said yes have told about past must have repetition of story day for reason will easily understand now will tell romance about woman yes did ever know romance did include woman one of mine included corpse too shot stabbed in street of 'frisco six seven year ago man name be anchor be talking of corpse asked lancaster settling of what else be lucky miner having made end of money built new raw palace near where settled with wife ah said frank intelligently be woman quite so loved for be worth till found out eustace remarked lancaster finding detail scrappy if will start in sail plainly wo interrupt jarman took pull at pipe will give gist of in few word said slowly be doing journalistic work in 'frisco ran across anchor be big burly rough chap whacking good sort chummed up invited to see be introduced to mr anchor fell in love with what be like promised not to interrupt never mind what be like taste then be not taste now mildred thought frank said nothing think liked more than little after visited at house for time found that anchor be turning nasty jealous suppose eustace nodded upon soul have cause to be be a straight a die be not fashion to loot other men wife think mr anchor did best to make jealous after time became sure then found out matter not how that wished to get rid of husband be to be man to remove confound did want to murder man well be idea did find out for long time anchor grew nasty rarely went to house mr anchor used to come see in city sometimes be that quite straight be in one way see came to tell that be afraid that husband must kill be up to game then third man came in name be sakers nasty dry bad tempered chap mr anchor became thick a thief then gave go by oh suppose hoped sakers must kill husband yes seemed that anchor be ruined wife spent money raw new palace be sold pair came to live at 'frisco sakers loafed on front with mr anchor be still in love with be tell frank really did love that woman be most fascinating woman ever met have flirted with in country well after time chucked sakers came to gathered that knew of money must be got if husband be out of way how well did inquire proposed so plainly that must shoot anchor seeing that even prank must make jealous enough to get up duel grew angry that be eye opener even then if 'd dropped business might have gone on loving up slanged properly then saw what bad mind have showed door what scheme be know after week later anchor came to see to make trouble poor chap came to make up said that have be mistaken in that did believe lie be told about being in love with mr anchor then cried said that have bolted with sakers why be man enough to follow shoot be off night to chicago where two have gone came to see to explain seemed that there be money about million that have something to do with promised to see again before left for chicago to give paper about matter be by midnight train be going be to call back at eight went to door of house with be in quiet side street stood chatting at door why did bring paper with asked frank did know if 'd take moreover be afraid of being robbed killed by well ca say who by sakers be mixed up in business see mr anchor have told sakers what told le scrupulous intended to kill anchor to get paper be about size of whole thing be so vague must get at pith of must tell nothing until came back with paper at eight said when shook hand at door be 'tamaroo ' well go on tamaroo what did get further said jarman for at moment be shot shot in open street be quiet side street being about meal time there be one about also be almost dark man who shot anchor must have be concealed in corner close at hand turned saw cutting along street followed calling for police bunked into crowded street lost went up to policeman made come back with have be away for fifteen minute on chase anchor be still lying before door in addition to shot wound there be knife in heart in instance frank knife be left in wound be brand new bowie nothing must be made of in way of evidence what happened then well at first be thought to be guilty soon cleared character anchor be buried never saw heard of mr anchor sakers again what about paper never heard anything of appeared that when anchor be seeing negro came to lodging to wait for a did turn up negro skipped fancied might have be emissary of mr anchor to steal paper none be found who killed anchor well fancy sakers fired shot who knifed ca say frank rose walking to window stretched be gruesome story said what did tamaroo mean ca tell be one word poor fellow said before be stretched corpse well frank after got sick of west came home strange romance very ca make top tail of business be strange that anchor must have be shot stabbed a starth be for reason tell story keep to frank care about wearing heart on sleeve will say nothing assented lancaster know quite enough to round on if do say peered through window into moonlight who be lady jarman rose looked over frank shoulder there be white figure crossing lawn be mildred miss starth frank made for door will go to bedroom said be not able to meet yet a might give away besides may wish to talk to about case h be yes be just a well clear out will let know be needful so frank disappeared jarman opened front door to visitor mildred looked very weary wore white dress with black bow saw looking sideways at when entered study have have time to get proper mourning said sinking into chair mr perth be furbishing up old dress for to morrow be thinking of said jarman mendaciously have wine miss starth look so tired be worn out that awful inquest poor walter death hid face in hand be so sudden so terrible have be in bed ever since returned so mr perth told know verdict do think be true one asked mildred suddenly jarman be taken aback how must know jury say that mr lancaster killed walter a be leaving room someone know who slipped paper into hand have brought to a ca understand handed jarman sheet of notepaper on be written in unformed childish hand three word frank innocent tamaroo tamaroo jarman leaped up tamaroo what doe mean chapter vii cupid bargain while jarman be receiving miss starth at door miss cork have brought in lamp pulled down blind in yellow light mildred must see that face be pearly white a eustace be not usually emotional guessed that paper have given must be interesting enough to surprise out of ordinary self what be asked nervously oh what be nerve be slack poor girl from anxiety of last week jarman did not answer directly that must have stumbled on word tamaroo in unexpected manner immediately after telling story to frank surprised not little coincidence be extraordinary suspected providential must not see what connection there must be between murder of anchor in san francisco that of walter starth in sand lane mysterious word tamaroo seemed to link two perhaps might prove clue to mystery of last crime jarman sat down to hurriedly arrange thought be unable to answer mildred for time after exclamation remained quiet clasping unclasping hand shaken to core of soul by disturbed look of ordinarily phlegmatic man know what mean confessed jarman finally looked again at paper be written by uneducated person by one who know lancaster well enough to address by christian name who slipped into hand know said mildred again be passing out with crowd after verdict have be given felt being pushed into hand finger closed on mechanically for moment never thought to look round for person when examined outside be of course too late h be be pity if must only find who wrote there might be chance of clearing up mystery then think there be mystery mr jarman about brother death certainly do know lancaster very well indeed be who introduced to brother be absolutely certain that be not man to commit so brutal crime threat on previous night objected mildred mere foolish speaking far from proving guilt to mind hint at innocence have intended to kill brother must have be more circumspect in language if mr lancaster be innocent why did run away jarman shrugged shoulder ca expect man to have wit about at moment be here jarman be about to explain drugging on second thought did not think wise to appear to know too much be in house alone with brother whom have threatened continued when murder took place saw that there be chance of being accused to avoid being arrested on circumstantial evidence fled have idea where be asked miss starth quickly replied jarman deliberately have not seen frank lancaster for month be always in town a know rarely go up believe to be guilty everything seems to point to guilt admit that be convinced from what know of that be perfectly innocent if so said mildred shrewdly must at least know who killed brother seeing that left house after death profess to explain said eustace who be unwilling to lie more than be necessary to shield lancaster did brother ask lancaster to call on replied mildred decisively walter be rather afraid of mr lancaster be bad friend for reason mr lancaster threatened to give walter thrashing did threaten to kill mildred hesitated well walter said that mr lancaster must shoot if got chance a always carried revolver lancaster only carried revolver when went slumming be slumming when visited at sand lane ca explain that can say be that from what know of lancaster might have thrashed brother certainly must not murder mr darrel tell that mr lancaster be very bitter against brother when did tell said jarman who knew darrel regarding a possible rival did not approve of overmuch to day when got up mr darrel be staying at rectory for few day know be friend of rector yes know replied eustace thinking must put frank on guard since darrel might recognise why did darrel come down on visit to rector also said

however said nothing to darrel a rhodesian be rich might be trusted to do something towards launching young arrow into bleak world darrel be big man a huge a jarman black sulky in look manner be soft resembled large tom cat more than anything else particularly when speaking a positively purred with child be favourite a always presented with gift be understood that on condition of largess be to leave alone consequently have time to spent dodging about rose cottage filling little parlour with gigantic person mr perth rather liked a be always deferential to be not averse to courtship of mildred for be what continual not always welcome presence amounted to girl thought darrel possessed violent temper always declared that must not marry if be a rich a vanderbilt however a rhodesian came ostentatiously to condole with on account of trouble must not very well express a wished moreover in measure be now engaged to jarman told one of agreement have made with not even mr perth be now over fortnight since death of starth a be buried mildred be recovering spirit have never cared particularly for brother who be something of bully have seen so little of that death made scarcely difference in life consequently beyond be in mourning showed little sign of catastrophe walter have only to thank for calmness with accepted decease one afternoon mr perth be out darrel sat with mildred drinking tea in parlour be small room filled with chintz covered furniture looked extremely cool window be open darrel who felt heat sat near cup in hand be dressed in spotless flannel looked

difficulty about miss starth verdict of jury be wrong ca believe that mr lancaster committed so horrible apparently purposeless crime have reason to believe innocent mildred for obvious reason did not answer question directly ca see motive said looking down pensively evidence of lady at inquest know nothing about lady retorted girl flushing then to change conversation mark sense of darrel bad manner asked question did know mr lancaster darrel nodded thought told said be sitting next to on night saw in theatre night before tragedy said mildred shuddering what be like to look at fair chap blue eye wait miss starth recollected man who have stared at do mean to say that be gentleman who sat next to yes said so fair hair know broke in hurriedly be looking at eye met oh did look like man

stolidly promise to be wife will hunt down lancaster mildred gasped be same bargain a have made with eustace so situation be duplicated more than liked jarman cared very little for darrel moreover now that knew suspected man be one who have stared at to whose face have taken fancy be inclined to agree with eustace that be innocent so refined man must not possibly have committed so brutal crime finally be displeased that darrel must again broach subject about have asked to be silent told before tell again mr darrel can not become wife said with heat why not asked man stolidly mildred grew exasperated because love love may come after marriage prefer to come before declared wo marry yes will said darrel closing obstinate mouth brother be in favour of match at one time not lately know ca

conduct be flighty late event have unsettled mind be not usually so vacillating at present moment be too bewildered upset to know own mind save that must never marry darrel perhaps not eustace concluded meantime eustace be in seventh heaven for last few day have gone about singing lancaster be rather exasperated seemed unfair that jarman must have happiness must have nothing trouble then blamed for being selfish jarman have be be good friend to jarman have known mildred for many year frank have not even spoken to so be ridiculous ungrateful of to be jealous of best friend on such slight ground did all knew to preserve cheerful face at time grew gloomy eustace put fit of dismals down to too vivid realisation of danger must not allow frank to speak more than be necessary about murder a did not wish to brood over be not idle one morning announced that be going to to town will be away for day said so can make comfortable frank look out darrel doe see darrel have gone back to

under own name what as be frank firstly nom de plume be required to intimate who will write sketch since eustace jarman be unknown a dramatist secondly did write in own name might give into hand of berry must have learnt from starth that be friend thus might seek to know too much must baffle inquiry oh yes if chose to come down see must not baffle spotting be best to be on safe side even in disguise man be clever enough to recognise doe say much for disguise said frank grimly pooh make up be good enough to baffle casual observer captain berry be exceptionally clever might not recognise

comfortable here frank while go to town think might take newspaper to mr perth meet mildred know said frank flushing mr perth will introduce said jarman be sure will get on well with too well thought

thought that ex skipper who have cast away schooner have to change name for reason have need to be so scrupulous did not believe in relationship suspected that fairy fan be telling glib lie however suited to accept story set forth swallowed scrupulous captain banjo berry along with other fiction will call miss berry when come till then looked imploringly gave coquettish smile very well till then eustace jarman knew perfectly well that be calculating to make use of wished to think so must accept a colleague in swindle so called uncle be perpetrating might more easily penetrate secret of starth murder then tell fan be ever discovered who killed anchor how harp on eustace yes old partner of whom cheated in connection with mining claim shot who thrust knife into heart chinaman found body

that husband must have be treated in same way coincidence suppose said eustace indifferently knowing that fan be watching closely what be become of lancaster know wish did must hang thought liked a nice boy so did replied liked starth better oh jarman found difficult to believe eyed suspiciously must have explained further that banjo berry followed by young man entered room uncle said fan rising anticipating eustace who do think leonard grant who want to do sketch be well be very curious said berry shaking eustace by hand in warmest most friendly way jarman of 'frisco be responded eustace how

in 'frisco saw often be chicago mbeelf came to old country along with captain miss berry never met in 'frisco asked fan addressing jarman heard talk of mr denham though seemed to eustace that fan uncle be rather relieved by admission wondered what connection fool must have with game two be playing fancied that denham be pigeon berry co hawk also struck that if must get natty to might find out something always supposing that young fellow knew anything later on after desultory friendly conversation natty gave opening say said live down in essex yes at wargrove natty nodded to fan captain knew said ca understand how slipped memory what slipped memory bub asked berry sharply why that nodded towards eustace be in essex when starth took down to see that pretty sister of said something

replied little skipper solemnly besides have scheme on to make money what sort of scheme never mind said berry be dead now scheme up tree suppose miss starth cut up said denham to eustace naturally only brother guess need heap of consolation went on young man artlessly be just in mind to go down see jarman be not at pleased at proposition be inclined to reply in negative bright thought struck very daring thought of nature of bluff denham be fool not at observant might be that if came down saw mr desmond o'neil might be able to dispel suspicion might afterwards take shape in mind of fan uncle with idea gave natty invitation come stop with said cordially there be one with secretary irish chap called o'neil 'd get on well with natty seemed inclined to accept looked at berry for instruction skipper nodded go by mean have good time never ask said fan reproachfully to old lover be afraid bachelor establishment be not quite paradise to lady said eustace laughing if will spend

jarman rising to take leave if catch captain will do more than police huh scoffed berry police be fool most people in old country be can squash lot of lancaster too bet eustace laughed when on way home be pretty certain that having already made false start about lancaster berry must not squash jarman hoped to gather great deal from natty prattle chapter x queer mark frank be not at pleased when heard that denham be coming down to shanty experiment be too risky a there be chance that young man must recognise in case must at once put revengeful berry on scent jarman did not look at matter in light explained after sundry question have met denham often asked yes be always dodging round berry establishment thought lived with have digging way off berry so told be kind of guardian to doe man require guardian at age of twenty three denham twenty five be almost same age a be although look older said lancaster must think seeing what fool be that will require guardian life then think be more fool than knave asked eustace ruminating frank nodded emphatically think be rascal at captain may be denham just silly good natured as who must give head away have weak will be quite under thumb of berry did fraternise with denham cackle got on nerve know well enough to spot must betray then must not betray said eustace decidedly so far a look go wo know must defy even detective to penetrate disguise denham may twig by voice think from what saw of that be so observant besides will give something to roughen voice can say have cold frank stared at friend seem to be up to trick jarman nodded thought of being detective myself once practised for time have material for disguise here told so when made up a desmond o'neil can get into skin of character with ease be what have to do be not frank lancaster remember desmond o'neil from county kerry say eustace why do want denham down here well wish to report to berry lot that there be concealment about may suspect that know something of whereabouts want one to drop down upon denham be fool what see will report to in artless fashion consequently berry fan will trust want to get in with learn what be up to do think denham can tell said eustace promptly whatever game be that boy be in dark have much too loose tongue for berry to trust with secret what be berry bothering about for be what want to find out denham may know something for instance mentioned name of balkis a told what be use of asked frank gloomily much starth have portrait berry be in touch with want to learn why berry call at opium shop at dock be going there be sure to see balkis two be standing by window chatting in way a eustace repeated name of balkis there sounded low moan made speaker turn miss cork with tablecloth over arm stood at open door thin face a white a linen bore apparently have entered silently a be wont to lay table for luncheon have overheard name like statue stood vacant eye fixed on jarman what be matter asked miss cork lip moved balkis said in whisper what about balkis do know name balkis said miss cork again then threw down cloth ran back to kitchen eustace followed found moaning in chair rather brutally shook what be asked miss cork went on moaning have child began then shut up not word must get out of after many fruitless inquiry eustace returned to sitting room to explain told did trust said frank whose fear took shape at once be silent secretive woman be sure will get into trouble why must know name ca say now talk of child own say need be afraid frank be a true a steel trust said frank doggedly where did pick up jarman driven into corner replied reluctantly in london court police court inquired lancaster then when received nod went on then be dangerous what do know of past nothing never speaks of poor wretch be taken up for vagrancy afterwards be handed over to missionary knew chap told what capital cook woman be how needed good home to put right came to a miss cork have have reason to regret having played part of good samaritan be strange that name of balkis must upset wo explain be very obstinate woman when fit take fit apparently did not seal miss cork mouth on occasion soft knock at door told of return presented quietly picking up cloth proceeded to lay table without looking at men proceeded to exculpate ask pardon said in whispering voice ask pardon mr jarman yours sir name balkis here stopped laid hand on heart have child of name ah said jarman sympathetically while frank still looked suspicious name brings sad memory to miss cork nodded be married woman said softly husband left to starve with child child died burst out fiercely child be stolen by whom miss cork stopped finger worked convulsively a though be clutching at throat wish knew wish knew said savagely expression of lean face surprised jarman who have always considered apathetic woman perhaps look warned that be betraying too much of unknown past for pulled up with faint titter be billericay woman began when jarman cut short be nonsense said sternly know be not have said have to say said miss cork quite irrelevantly if be pleased mr jarman will go want to go ask nothing replied child be called balkis went on miss cork be stolen five year ago have be looking for ever since will be seventeen year old by now lost five year ago yes five year ago kept on repeating have be looking for ever since strange name balkis said jarman watching husband be in east came from east name be billericay woman giggled then shook head withdrew swiftly two men looked at one be quite mad harmless said eustace quite mad dangerous replied frank trust confirmed in opinion by strange demeanour of miss cork watched closely muttered to herself frequently kept counting on finger sometimes must utter name of balkis laugh laughter be not pleasant did not seem to frank that retained pleasant memory of name yet if be that of child must have done so jarman did not trouble about miss cork eccentricity meal be well cooked well served there be fault to be found with woman housekeeping be odd in manner appeared to be labouring under suppressed excitement twice frank caught listening not in sufficiently open way to admit of rebuke a position be delicate one became alarmed trusting in jarman influence over woman claim to gratitude tried to dismiss fear denham duly arrived speedily made at home thanks to herbal decoction given to by eustace lancaster welcomed visitor in hoarse voice regular nestling note natty did not recognise in mr o'neil dark secretary fair haired frank lancaster whom have seen frequently in bloomsbury be completely deceived frank felt more at ease being now certain that disguise be must be desired luckily natty did not give much of frivolous company a be mostly with jarman hanging round rose cottage by time frank introduced by mr perth have made acquaintance of divinity likewise never suspected disguise be quite at ease with new secretary frank heart beat hard when offered hand must hardly see face for mist before eye now that heard voice saw gracious manner fell more in love with than ever be strange feeling one that have not experienced in wooing of fairy fan from misery suffered there be doubt that be genuine passion mildred be very amiable with be together great deal mr perth have taken fancy to frank whose manner pronounced perfect talked much to even discussed death of walter starth probability of lancaster being assassin by time frank have schooled into hearing case talked of without moving so much a eyelid in couple of week became quite accepted fact in life of rose cottage indeed of village even mr baker have ceased to ask question several letter addressed to desmond o'neil with dublin post mark have arrived so mr baker be quite satisfied that came from country whence procured butter from being nine day wonder in quiet essex hamlet frank became comparative nonentity be exactly state of thing jarman wished to bring about thus when denham arrived on three day visit there be nothing likely to connect secretary with bedraggled man who have arrived so late at night miss cork in spite of odd way lancaster suspicion kept own counsel most faithfully one afternoon frank now quite at ease in disguise strolled over to cottage to ask for afternoon tea brought book of poem in pocket for mildred be fond of hearing read frank must read admirably be rare accomplishment often must declaim poem to mr perth mildred on occasion there be chance of enjoying browning for jenny arrow from rectory be present be kittenish damsel of eighteen with freckled face turn up nose gay vivacious manner also have vein of romance cherished unrequited affection for dark secretary confided to mildred doe look romance dear said jenny when gazing from drawing room window saw frank approach love milly mildred laughed have have quite enough of love said that denham boy worry life out then there be brother billy oh billy as said jenny contemptuously fall in love with everyone see suppose will marry mr darrel certainly not said mildred quickly what put idea into head jenny young lady nodded sagaciously oh know said be not to see poor pa mr darrel come down here ma saw ma say be in love with being rich be sure to marry must never marry for money jenny said mildred thinking of eustace mr darrel will never make wife oh be so very rich then marry must rather marry mr o'neil mildred laughed again same for reason inexplicable to herself felt annoyed here be mr o'neil 'd better propose mildred if reveal love oh how will hate mildred watching approaching figure of man knew merely a o'neil did not reply be wondering why be so attracted towards be not particularly good looking have shown marked preference for society indeed have laughed with mr perth over attention o'neil paid old lady there be something about secretary made mildred pulse beat a never beat in presence of jarman perhaps although never knew be case of telepathy for frank be always moved beyond usual self when in presence never revealed by manner mildred however be not sufficiently psychologist to analyse feeling so did not search too closely into reason of sensation still must not help wondering why felt annoyed by jenny silly remark think have better take denham boy said mildred to jenny bother greatly be kind of donkey who must fall in love with anyone regard a anyone said jenny with dignity besides be not half so nice a mr o'neil mildred acknowledged with sigh welcomed o'neil with blush marked wondered at where be mr jarman asked have gone bathing with billy denham said frank standing outside looking in at window have done work came to be rewarded with what cake ale asked jenny languishing modern equivalent in shape of afternoon tea let have outside on lawn oh

fan when there must probably be trouble jarman wished that estimable couple to look upon a one wholly unconcerned in shady doings by assuring of lack of interest hoped to throw off guard conversation became more le frivolous a be natural amongst such young people jarman be eldest present felt forty year painfully even began to ask if be fair that must make mildred wife be young be elderly remembered proverb of may december be not exactly december yet be getting rapidly into sear yellow leaf reflection made sad when went home with frank natty remaining behind to play game of tennis with

billy have scarlet bat tattooed on left arm know said jarman quietly saw to day when be bathing intended to surprise with news strange that must have made discovery on same day a did long arm of coincidence again suppose frank paid little attention to being taken up with own thought know have scarlet bat tattooed on right arm jarman nodded remember suggested that a be sole mystery in life might have to do with berry desiring to have hanged now that know denham be marked in similar way put matter beyond doubt ca see how said frank frowning wait till get inside said jarman then can talk at ease not word be spoken until entered jarman den sat down in coolness blind be down there be pleasant darkness jarman closed door then took seat opposite to into lancaster have thrown tell again of

brought up till be time for to go to college studied at elizabethan grammar school in town father be always coming home never appeared then when be ten stopped writing altogether aunt have money for education sent to regularly went to oxford a know then came five year ago to make mark in london pretty mark have made said frank bitterly never spoke of past to anyone aunt particularly told not to do so ca see why must have kept silence though added frowning there be nothing wrong about past can see must seem a though father be anxious must live a quietly a possible so a not to attract attention of adventurer of berry type understand well that tattooing on right arm never knew what meant asked aunt must not tell be on arm scarlet bat mean when came from america denham understand say that tattooing be done by indian h be might believe that said jarman sceptically daresay be a ignorant of what symbol mean a be berry know what make think that because be hounding down be marked in similar way to boy whom have in clutch do think denham be in clutch be sure of boy belief in thoroughly be quite under berry thumb poor wretch know nothing about significance of scarlet bat berry must not trust babbling tongue within reach of ear told that there be chance of learning something about yes aunt dorothy said that when be twenty five have be told by father to give sealed envelope what contained did not know in fact jarman aunt knew nothing save father be great traveller that married in america that when mother died sent home think be dead because have not received letter from for

soon a intend to call on next week what for asked frank surprised to get that envelope to learn can from about father life in america there be money tell frank come either to denham how do make out because be marked with scarlet bat berry said eustace with emphasis be doing best to get money chapter xii unexpected happens denham took leave with profuse thanks to jarman for pleasant visit departed without least suspicion that frank be other than be represented to be eustace drew breath of relief when dismissed at railway station be right thought a took way homeward denham will represent a kind friend will do away with suspicion in berry mind a to having card up sleeve now can make move next move be to see miss dorothy drake learn particular about sealed envelope also frank wished to know what have become of effect have be left behind in london room a nearest relative be probable that miss drake must lay claim to until such time a must reappear eustace therefore decided to go few day after denham visit called on mildred to explain absence for obvious reason did not explain too fully not until frank be proved innocent did jarman wish to know that be identical with mr o'neil will only be away week mildred said eustace taking hand wo forget in time be not likely to forget at replied girl wearily mildred be not looking well weather be so trying said hesitatingly walter death have damped spirit wish must not dwell on dear be not worth still be brother when be said done if have only died natural death must not mind so much be terrible to think of tragic end be making attempt to discover truth yes journey be connected with attempt where be going said jarman smiling ask that not until be successful will reveal method at present be groping in dark have clue eustace hesitated can hardly say have there be certain suspicion in mind may may not prove correct when return may be able to tell something do suspicion still point to innocence of mr lancaster yes said jarman firmly be more convinced day that be victim of conspiracy innocence will be hard to prove mildred again took hand when be away want to be kind to o'neil have relative poor fellow be in sad trouble let feel lonely mildred nodded must not trust to speak have consulted own inclination must have seen nothing of secretary during absence of employer daily grew more more interested in so called o'neil learnt to watch for coming to hang on word have said nothing to likely to be construed into admiration be always cold guarded in utterance very coldness increased liking for assured that be merely liking in heart knew that love have awakened thought of coupled with remembrance of half engagement to eustace made nervous confused must not meet lover eye returned to home wondering at inexplicable change however finally put down to grief for loss of unworthy brother to prevent from brooding asked frank to see a frequently a must during absence certainly said frank with effort to be cheerful if think will find out how can have never set eye on at close quarter a be muttered lancaster guiltily recalling night in theatre genesis of futile passion suppose not then to change subject asked eustace to be sure to let know transpired between miss drake give love tell be innocent oh wo need to be told said frank aunt dorothy will never believe that did wicked thing heaven bless by way think there be chance of berry coming down not slightest suspicion may have entertained about knowing whereabouts will be dissipated by babble of natty took greatest care to load up with story likely to satisfy even suspicion of captain banjo must be surprised added jarman reflectively if berry approached with offer to join force what good must do well know about murder of anchor moreover a be friend might in opinion know something likely to help in acquiring fortune then really think there be fortune after talk of natty about birthday be perfectly sure that there be great deal of money knocking about ought to come to berry machination unless thwarted will put into pocket of denham if so wo benefit oh yes will rejoined eustace grimly when denham be in possession of fortune will die a starth did will follow poor anchor to other world in same way then fan berry will retire to live happy ever afterwards be theory grumbled frank quite so that be reading of mystery however aunt may throw light on subject will probably tell more of father life than told lancaster be not to be convinced think know anything said better see lawyer white saon will look up when return to town jarman having settled plan went off frank found in sole possession of house miss cork waited on assiduously noticed that be not so eccentric a usual a yet have not tried experiment of letting see photograph of balkis be true reason for obtaining from mildred frank did not believe miss cork story of lost child be certain that emotion at mention of name be due to other le respectable cause might be that knew balkis a balkis knew berry according to slip of tongue miss cork might be able to throw light on mystery of black woman connection with starth frank determined to place photograph where miss cork must see then when be moved to terror surprise by sight of face to insist on explanation what said might not lead to detection of true assassin might reveal something about berry likely to show why be conspiring against life liberty of innocent man again be theory a be jarman belief that tattoo mark of scarlet bat be at bottom of berry rascality still if frank wished to win clear of difficulty behoved to try in direction on chance of finding clue to mystery frank therefore displayed photograph of big negress in prominent position for startling of miss cork then took way to rose cottage knew that seeing loved mildred ought not to go in spite of unsuspicious jarman direct wish lancaster loyal a wished to act towards friend must not help drinking in sweet poison by time be convinced that mildred liked more than little gave kind of delicious pain in watching fruit must never hope to pluck thought that when knew real name liking must vanish to be replaced with loathing for assassin of brother a must surely think lancaster to be then must marry jarman be happy frank argued in way same knew that be giving way to weakness in trusting in sweet presence feeling be so strong on when approached cottage that be minded to retreat make excuse for not calling again what made change mind be sight of darrel in garden that frank be in love knew that darrel be suitor for mildred hand timely thought of danger must have made retreat a be went boldly forward trusting in perfection of disguise have not be pierced by denham so be unlikely must be unmasked by so slow thinking man a darrel made young man furiously jealous to think that darrel must persecute mildred with attention tried to think that in coming between be actuated by friendship for jarman in own passionate heart knew well that be personal resentment mr perth have brought everlasting knitting into garden be seated in cane chair under elm near be mildred looking in frank helpless eye more beautiful than ever to make more jealous mildred be winding ball of red wool for mr perth from skein held by darrel rhodesian be a usual big sullen appeared much too gigantic for little garden be modern picture of hercules omphale frank realising own helplessness raged inwardly a be smilingly welcomed by mr perth mildred after nod cast down eye with flush on face attended assiduously to work hercules scowled be so glad to see said mr perth in precise voice do know mr darrel naturally frank said that have not pleasure be introduced at once darrel lifted heavy eye with grunt paid further attention to secretary be quite a jealous a frank mildred cause of feeling in breast became aware that weather be thundery however chatted brightly divided attention equally being helped by mr perth good lady never suspected what be going on under nose cold be better said mr perth when frank be seated a matter of fact be a eustace have left off giving frank mean to hoarsen voice after departure of denham be better said frank almost in usual tone jarman have be doctoring will soon be well darrel pricked up ear looked at dark young man have ever met before asked frank kept countenance although felt that be in awkward position think not said coldly while darrel lazy eye strayed over slowly mr perth put in brisk word mr o'neil come from ireland said have ever be in ireland mr darrel no responded still eyeing lancaster who sustained scrutiny unmoved must never have taken mr o'neil for irishman mean have brogue said mildred to frank smiling have one when came mr darrel have be here long time to get rid of then said darrel just few week replied frank calmly mr perth with best intention brought lancaster under gun of enemy came just when be in deep grief over horrid murder said clicking needle yes

lady have not hope never will said mildred flushing from what mr jarman say believe mr lancaster be innocent oh said darrel turning away eye from frank so jarman take up cudgel on behalf of murderer remember be friend of lancaster be said frank incautiously must know said darrel quietly with keen glance being secretary have heard jarman speak of matter replied frank knew that darrel suspicion be aroused tried to keep colour from cheek looked directly at darrel eye of two men met be darrel who first withdrew gaze said at length be not bit like lancaster although have same tone of voice have indeed said mildred with interest lancaster be fair haired white skinned went on darrel whereas be dark celt said frank drawing long breath a deemed danger be at end well talk more about matter put in mr perth sharply will upset mildred affair be too horrible to discus upon hint darrel turned conversation into other channel devoted to mr perth frank thus have opportunity of chatting with mildred talked on most indifferent subject time one knew what other wanted to say such sudden love seems incredible to who have never loved anyone who have fallen victim to great passion know how suddenly devouring flame blaze into conflagration two have seen little of one thing considering have never become confidential yet loved one needed only unguarded moment of emotion for truth to be openly acknowledged between darrel with side glance saw embarrassment flushed cheek effort to appear easy took note of with great self control continued conversation with mr perth for quite hour talked then rose to take leave at same moment a frank announced intention of departing be stopping at rectory said darrel when passed through gate come way think for little distance replied frank always on guard suspecting evil on part of companion for time strolled on in silence down lane out on to dusty white road then darrel commenced to converse on indifferent matter told story about africa also stated experience in america be at los angeles said frank remembered how at theatre have said that met berry at los angeles made comment on remark darrel still continued to talk till halted in quiet side

clear out will hold tongue if will write to london police inspector herny will be glad to get into clutch now know without further word darrel turned on heel lumbered down road like heavy clumsy steer for few moment frank stood alone in shadow feeling a though brightness have died out of life felt that did not much care if be arrested so wearing be rle be playing thought mildred must be told that must look upon with loathing made shudder tried to stifle thought hurried into house to think what be best to be done at moment sorely missed wise head staunch friendship of jarman door of shanty be

to london put up at small hotel for few hour leaving bag there went to see white saon towards midday have consulted own inclination must have gone immediately to wargrove a have great curiosity to see frank open sealed envelope thought best to follow on warpath a long a possible on chance of something new turning up did do to waste time with so active enemy a berry near mansion house met dickey baird who be always prowling about city in connection with mysterious stock share friend declared that dickey lost more money than made dickey always talked with air of rothschild knew jarman very well saluted gaily eustace be not averse to talking with baird thinking dickey ubiquitous might have something to say of captain niece after exchange of few word jarman introduced subject of murder a speedily a dared without attracting attention say dickey have heard anything of lancaster poor chap be cleared out daresay be in america in fact know fellow who thought saw in liverpool doubt replied eustace thinking be best to encourage idea put berry on wrong trail most sensible thing must do be to cut say jarman believe that be guilty asked alertly if do added dickey rather inconsequently be accident will never believe that good chap like lancaster killed in so brutal way what do mean by accident well see frank rather admired starth sister have said eustace with start remember be in box rather looking beauty of world ripping girl just sort of diana of chase 'd like to marry go on go on well frank thought be ripper wished to know of course starth rowdy manner prevented proper

statue of indignation be not so indignant a eustace returning to hotel silly fool said wrathfully to 'd juggle with man life just to get cost frank sha' show up to be slaughtered by if can help that negro h be balkis be negress wonder if man be spy of berry trying to find out whereabouts of frank must think over upon word lamented eustace hailing hansom more go into case more mysterious seems well there be one comfort sealed letter may give clue to mystery will go down by six train may know about before retiring to rest at hotel alighted went in then suddenly recollected that have not sent wire to frank to be on safe side although be sending to o'neil went to telegraph office on way hither knowing neighbourhood well took short cut through by street a be turning corner heard fresh young voice singing song burden of be tamaroo tamaroo hardly believing ear eustace dashed round corner to hear who be repeating last word poor murdered anchor have uttered came nearly on top of ragged urchin true guttersnipe who be dancing gaily in gutter to music of own minstrelsy oh git 'eavy screw tamaroo tamaroo ' father be jew tamaroo tamaroo where did hear that song interrupted eustace

must not understand what meant boy conducted down one street up till brought up against huge hoarding before house in course of erection there appeared huge placard of scarlet bat with outspread wing a on frank arm beneath be printed in gigantic red letter mysterious word tamaroo chapter xv strange disappearance jarman returned fuming to wargrove be clear headed man who liked to foresee what be coming so that might arrange plan at present moment must not see inch before nose rather lost temper in consequence unexpected appearance of scarlet bat of mysterious word tamaroo on london hoarding perplexed extremely at first thought that might be new move on part of astute berry on consideration dismissed idea berry be not anxious for publicity argued eustace when in train a must attract attention to underhand scheme to get money again believe denham know anything not even meaning of tattooing on left arm must want to be told why bat appeared on poster if be berry work captain might not be disposed to furnish explanation there be other person taking hand in game with person must come into contact if person be enemy of berry may work together to thwart on other hand person who have plastered london with poster may want fortune in case will be equally enemy to frank may want hanged also may be woman conjectured jarman that balkis seems to be mixed up in matter not to mention negro who called on lawyer h be wonder what barbaric element be doing in galley turned twisted argued matter in way by time arrived at wargrove be a much in dark a ever only chance of making discovery likely to elucidate mystery lay in content of sealed letter anxious to see frank to tell adventure jarman walked rapidly to shanty when reached be surprised to find that be shut up window door be barred not having key eustace must not obtain entrance into own home there be sign of miss cork of friend what doe mean jarman asked can frank have be arrested in case miss cork must still be here situation be puzzling so jarman set to work to learn detail make discovery sought out old gardener who lived in cottage adjacent to own house ancient bowles by name be bent wheezy old creature very garrulous jarman must not have hit upon better man for information a jacob bowles have key of shanty dark gentleman guv to said bowles surrendering key to owner t'other day guv to might call day afore yesterday yes might muster jarman dark gent guv sayin a 'd be back muster jarman must be wishful to get into house like did leave message asked eustace still perplexed bowles scratched head ca say rightly a did muster jarman do know what have become of miss cork muster jarman ca rightly say a do missus did say a mr baker saw miss cork gitting to station three day back aye muster jarman might say three day eustace remembered that be day of departure questioned female bowles simply repeated information given by husband adding that miss cork have be seen by ubiquitous mr baker walking rapidly towards mardon railway station across common a might say said mr bowles cautiously considerably perplexed eustace returned to deserted house be plausible to think that frank might have taken fright have fled disappearance of miss cork be remarkable so far a jarman knew have always expressed pleased with situation certainly never stated that be going hurried into house hoping to find message from frank in be not disappointed for on writing table lay letter addressed to jarman big man wrinkled brow opening read at once in waning light dear eustace wrote missing man have to go darrel who be stopping at rectory recognised for reason need not here be set forth be probable may denounce think best to go away will let know a soon a can what be doing left photograph of balkis lying about after seeing miss cork ran away believe know something about negress be in league with gang know of having digested letter jarman sat down to think over matter have always be afraid lest darrel must recognise frank wondered that friend have not sense to keep out of way of so dangerous acquaintance must not conjecture reason for darrel denunciation of unhappy man however a darrel be staying at rectory jarman decided to go over on morrow hear what have to say a regard miss cork h be thought jarman while getting scratch meal together wonder if there be truth in frank belief certainly seemed startled when heard name of balkis pitched that yarn about child being called so believe have child of name indeed child at however seems to have taken fright on seeing photograph wonder where frank got ah remember starth have photograph probably be passed on to mildred frank must get from why must miss cork run away where have gone must not answer question without further information only frank must give detail frank be gone also jarman wondered poor persecuted young fellow have fled did not dare to make inquiry lest must attract attention of police only thing to be done be to remain passive until such time a frank chose to write from new place of concealment then might see learn detail about inexplicable flight of housekeeper meantime must be just a well to see mildred learn if surmise about photograph be true after hurried meal jarman walked to rose cottage maid who answered door be fat red faced creature be only domestic employed by two lady stated that miss starth be lying down with bad headache have retired early to bed in fact that mr perth be still in parlour jarman must have walked in mr perth appeared seemed indisposed to admit jarman put down unwillingness to prim manner a nine o'clock at night be certainly not time to pay visit to two single lady on seeing face in moonlight noticed that looked disturbed however appeared friendly enough why must not be although declining to let in when maid retired have few minute conversation with on doorstep said mr perth in decisive tone have not seen mr o'neil lately called once after departure mr jarman since then have not favoured with visit do know that have gone away asked eustace gone away replied mr perth what do mean what say said jarman rather chafed have gone away thought that might know where be mr perth drew up in prim manner why must know mr jarman said stiffly friend movement have interest for seems to that must know best where be presume gave notice being secretary left letter saying be going never expected to leave so suddenly there appears to be mystery about oh not at rejoined big man quickly be odd fellow doubtless left in freakish way only came to ask a thought

really know replied mr perth with fatigued air made remark ah thank will not keep longer suppose added eustace with hesitation suppose be impossible for to see miss starth certainly be impossible have retired to bed can call to morrow good evening thus dismissed there be nothing for for eustace to return to house in spite of mr perth calmness saw that be worried have something on mind wondered if really knew anything of frank be impossible unless darrel have told mildred that lancaster alias o'neil be murderer of brother must account for mr perth stiffness a must not be too well disposed towards jarman for having introduced criminal such criminal to mildred however nothing must be learnt until saw darrel on morrow if have told said eustace over final pipe why mildred will be angry with night jarman got little sleep annoyed that frank must be absent at so critical moment wanted young man to open sealed letter have half mind to open on consideration did not think be justified in taking such course if darrel have told mildred eustace determined to explain whole of connection with matter to assure again of firm belief in frank innocence a soon a lancaster revealed new hiding place must take sealed letter from content might be gathered clue to mystery seemed to increase day to grow darker more endeavoured to throw light on next morning eustace having have bad night slept well into middle of day then have cold bath having cooked own breakfast sat down to somewhere about twelve o'clock be still worried ate well a knew have hard day before just a be pouring out second cup of coffee became aware that someone be looking at through window to surprise saw arch piquant face of fairy fan with sudden start rose went to door there be in most dainty of costume looking amused at astonishment asked to come so have come said stepping into house without being asked hope mind taking by surprise in way oh not at said eustace mechanically led way to sitting room wondering what ill wind have blown hither wish have given notice of coming miss berry a chose to be called plumped into seat cast eye over untidy table did want to be found at breakfast so late said smiling thought be early riser have bad night said eustace shortly fan selected cigarette from box near at hand lighted wonder at said through cloud of blue smoke if will shelter criminal what can expect jarman started uneasily what do mean demanded frowning why said waving daintily gloved hand seems that frank lancaster be with what cunning fellow be eustace guess gave uncle banjo outside running know why want inside nobody else doe replied smartly not even balkis hinted jarman must have bitten out tongue for making remark so calculated to place on guard a be coloured looked keenly at guess know more about matter than will give away perhaps do replied determined not to let know extent of knowledge if came here to see lancaster be gone be lie said miss berry coolly search house then retorted eustace serenely meeting with own weapon give full permission looked at again said after close scrutiny guess believe be flattered not bit feel angry where be frank know oh yes do rejoined

seeing that relative offer reward for capture however can reply with honest heart know where be fairy fan threw away cigarette with important air wish did said want to save from being lynched why do wish to save after bringing into state did said fiercely yes did for reason best known to yourself induced starth lancaster to quarrel having be successful up to point of putting rope round frank neck come to to ask if will help to adjust woman clasped unclasped hand nervously rose to pace room believe come to save said earnestly be in great danger alone can help ah then know who killed starth swear cried vehemently so far a know be frank uncle belief in guilt also know be to interest to believe snapped jarman how much money be involved in business miss berry turned pale looked down there be money said oh yes will say about million uncle doe offer reward for nothing be small sprat to catch large mackerel fan threw down burst into tear wish be dead wish frank be dead asked jarman mercilessly oh do tell where be can save from being hanged think so where be stamped foot imperiously eustace smiled a saw be trying art to make reveal what be determined to conceal tell know said quietly now that have learnt that sheltered man mind admitting that be here have gone away have left address what frightened away from hiding place have better ask darrel who told where to find darrel fan seemed genuinely surprised never told then who did asked eustace bluntly fan thought for moment then looked up with winning smile will tell that if will answer question what be question why have placarded london from end to end with poster chapter xvi what mildred knew eustace looked at much surprised if know of thing said do mean to say did get out certainly saw one be very much surprised do

enemy now thought be fool so be in san francisco have learnt sense since be enemy mr anchor enemy of man berry 'd better not threaten indeed do think be afraid of sneered eustace also have be in wild west can handle weapon a neatly a berry did when shot starth be lie be lie did not lose temper will gain nothing by be on side of frank lancaster intend to prove innocence ca said mr anchor with pale face be guilty be scheme to make appear so retorted jarman know better so do who told be here that business said doggedly very shady business be do wish to murder frank a murdered husband with spasm of fury fan snatched up knife flung at flew over head do again said will forget that be woman woman loved said again weeping eustace grew tired of thus running in circle think 'd better try something new mr anchor have have cajoling tear violence temper be growing weary also said fan drying tear speaking in much more business like manner be not worth while losing one temper not with assure be brute said violently possibly did come to tell came to see frank not a be not here think be clever enough to deceive please send message know where be mr anchor jarman used name because must see that annoyed message tell that if will promise to marry will save neck must have promise in writing will convey message if can said eustace without making comment on one condition what be asked mr anchor turning from mirror before be adjusting veil must write letter to miss starth deploring death of brother stating that loved so much that wished to marry fan grew crimson eye sparkled will not write such tissue of lie said with stamp jarman laughed not pleasantly have become wonderfully scrupulous of sudden sneered intended to marry starth denham denham said contemptuously must marry if asked why do want to write letter for own sake responded big man coolly miss starth belief that be concerned in death of brother such letter will convince that be well disposed towards bah wo believe may may not however want written mr anchor sat down leaning cheek on hand stared musingly at floor after few minute looked up be on game said calmly for reason wish to join in well mind letter will be sent oh want to know what game be not at be doing ca concern letter will do harm a wish message taken to frank be willing to buy on term jarman looked at distrustfully wondered why yielded so suddenly knowing tricky way felt sure that have card to play however for reason of own wanted letter so long a got be not particular how came into possession be useless to act honourably towards pair of sharper like fan so called uncle having thus arranged matter little woman held out hand have carriage waiting to take to mardon said understand one hope think do be in dark regarding scheme can say same thing about letter know why want written tell who told of lancaster whereabouts will explain thanks rejoined with shrug writing letter wo hurt in way telling too much might a please let see to carriage accepted offer together walked across field to where fly from mardon be waiting mr anchor hopped into a lightly a bird again held out hand goodbye smiled wo forget to deliver message will if can on condition yes know condition letter will be sent to miss starth when fly drove away eustace stood in brown study for few minute wondered why mr anchor have so readily accepted assurance that frank be not in house certainly be not jarman fancied that so suspicious woman must have made sure yet did not even avail of offer to let inspect house wonder what stake two be playing for mused jarman walking down road be that million suppose must not be sure until gained more explicit information jarman have conceived plot with letter to mildred be concerned by hoped to learn secret of berry who certainly appeared to be head of whole business a to scarlet bat opening of sealed letter might reveal what that meant letter must only be opened by frank frank be nowhere to be found jarman decided to tell mildred whole story then to consult about opening letter in frank absence seemed foolish to wait to leave man in such peril be in greatest peril now that fan knew have be hiding at wargrove eustace felt thankful that for obvious reason must not take police into council else might have got into trouble for compounding felony while thus thinking man have approached softly jarman be startled by touch on shoulder wheeled round sharply to behold darrel man looked sulky a usual purred like cat when addressed jarman so friend lancaster have gone away said quietly yes replied eustace thinking best to save time by admitting so obvious fact frightened away ah then left letter behind did mr darrel in stated that knew that threatened to denounce only if interfered between mildred said darrel jarman flushed face grew angry what do mean by speaking of miss starth in so familiar fashion speak a like being in love with miss starth since want to be punctilious call by name like best jarman must have struck to earth a stood there like man mountain of gulliver there be something insolent about darrel inspired meekest of men to kick eustace be by mean moses for moment eustace be inclined to take up on question of loving mildred remembering that be not officially engaged to girl must not discover assassin of brother might never be husband thought best to pas over matter however remarked on conjunction of girl name with frank lancaster be not likely to interfere between said oh yes be said darrel in slow heavy voice lancaster be in love with jarman felt jealous pang impossible not bit of lancaster saw night in theatre even then admired more than liked down here saw together love be in love myself know be not certain added darrel viciously that doe love tell ca cried jarman agitated oh then know lancaster killed brother know nothing only speak from knowledge of character must not love man knew so little of a lancaster according to did not know by name be just kind of romantic girl to fall in love with irish secretary of yours made up well for part sneered darrel jarman straightened shoulder think be good taste to discus miss starth said can safely assure that doe not love man seem very sure darrel scanned eustace in usual insolent way believe be in love yourself said with short laugh well give same warning a gave lancaster be not disposed to take warning rejoined jarman hotly if denounce lancaster a having be here will deny oh now that have cut there be necessity for to say word interfere see here darrel said jarman controlling temper with effort man will speak to like forbid to mention miss starth name to again will choose for herself know will will choose said darrel complacently there be always two to bargain said eustace drily however a lancaster have gone there be need for to tell miss berry darrel looked up in genuine surprise did not tell miss berry be down here hour ago stated that have told be liar did not say that have told knew that lancaster have be here be only person who spotted what fool others must be said genial darrel however be here there assure on honour that kept lancaster secret may may not have killed starth so long a leaf miss starth alone be in danger from hope will understand understand said jarman coldly now will part on understanding however said darrel striding after eustace that interfere with affair if do will stopped looking at eustace with evil face walked on be warned said over shoulder for moment eustace be inclined to follow dash insolent word down throat act might have jeopardised safety of frank jarman therefore be compelled to swallow anger greatly disliked doing so under circumstance must hing else day wondered what amount of truth there be in assertion of darrel that frank be in love with mildred eustace must not bring to believe that frank must act basely towards make love during absence know that adore mildred soliloquised eustace a paced rough lawn to try to get to must be base thing to do have helped certainly must not betray swear by frank nevertheless in spite of brave word caught frowning at thought finally made up mind to see mildred learn worst be aware that liked into bargain love have entered if really loved frank young man have acted honourably why then be impossible impossible groaned jarman clenching hand must not treat in way troubled in fashion presented at rose cottage looking unlike usual self mildred be in garden watching sunset be walking towards summer house when heard call name turning with cry of alarm came swiftly towards holding out hand eustace be so glad have come be sorry must not see last night why did not come earlier be busy said evasively looked into eye mildred why be alarmed when called faltered thought might be darrel said faintly must not call by christian name mildred blazed up 'd like to see dare said have insolence enough for anything persecutes oh doe cried jarman angrily then will made short work of see if will hing hing panted catching hand be dangerous man know too much about what understand turned red hand dropped mr o'neil said in low voice then covered face have gone away know where be said jarman say nothing dried tear drew into sheltered part of lawn be here whispered have concealed have told story jarman looked at astonished know then that be lancaster nodded with smile chapter xvii sealed letter jarman be so astonished at communication that dropped into garden seat be fortunately close at hand be wonderful enough to hear that lancaster be concealed in rose cottage still more wonderful to hear that knew who be eustace must have thought unlikely that must have anything to do with man suspected of being brother murderer yet admitted fact boldly actually smiled recalled remark of darrel wondered if there be understanding between lancaster how long have known real name asked sternly since went away replied mildred sitting beside be angry eustace agree with that be innocent when came to for shelter what must do even if be guilty must not give up shuddered doe mr perth know yes have to tell have kept secret from jane eustace nodded be just a well girl might babble how be lancaster dared to come here did not know what to do how to escape see mr darrel jarman interrupted know darrel recognised told so to day said other thing for felt inclined to knock down must have done so that a say be too well aware of existing state of thing what did say asked mildred angry light in eye there be need to repeat insolence there certainly be not for know quite well what said be determined to make wife coupled name with of lancaster oh be jealous of everyone said mildred tossing head believe that hope believe what asked eustace wishing for detail like woman having brought matter to point changed subject hurriedly nothing nothing declared hurriedly be engaged to eustace if find out who killed walter so understand replied sadly there be love on side dear told plainly what thought did must not have taken advantage of position think have better stop interrupted in moonlight must see bosom heave have better not say too much let leave subject alone until get out of trouble eustace be quite willing to do must scarcely tax her with being in love with frank on evidence of darrel be resolved to question lancaster at first opportunity meantime seeing that mildred be disposed to grow angry thought best to leave matter alone where be be question mildred looked round a though thought bird of air might overhear be in summer house said there be small room at back fitted up a kind of studio for painting be safe mildred quite safe one ever go there summer house a can see be quite buried amongst tree have hung eastern stuff round wall to conceal door into studio besides added with little hesitation one must ever think of looking for in house be right assented jarman why did come for very reason have stated be afraid lest mr darrel must send message to police so gave key of house to old bowles came in afternoon a desmond o'neil certainly then told story at first be horrified remembering how believed in innocence decided to help a secretary then went for long walk came back at night have studio ready for have be in ever since let see said jarman rising one moment said mildred catching hand will find different to what expect disguise have be taken off be surprised at change blushed fact be eustace saw in theatre on night so knew again when became jarman felt jealous pang began to think that mildred loved boy seeing how blushed when spoke of also voice faltered seemed embarrassed at first eustace almost felt inclined to speak out demand if loved lancaster remembering position of young man being afraid of wrath of mildred held tongue in silence moved across lawn entered summer house be luminous with moonlight eustace saw faint sparkle of gold thread of eastern stuff draped wall mildred gave little cough repeated twice signal whispered with finger on lip in spite of gravity of position seemed quite to enjoy mystery in many way mildred starth be still schoolgirl from other side of wall came cough also be repeated twice mildred drew aside drapery revealed door will leave now murmured can talk to alone come in see afterwards before eustace must say word be gone saw flit across lawn in moonlight then knocked softly at door key be turned door opened frank looked out who be whispered friend jarman said that gentleman stepped inside be perfectly dark save where slender moonbeam stole in through high window frank gave gasp of relief gripped eustace hand in gloom exchanged hearty handshake then frank pushed forward chair a have be long in darkness be better able to see than jarman be so glad have come said frank drawing chair close to of friend so that must converse in whisper have be longing for got letter yes be much astonished to find here thought be best thing must do said lancaster after left darrel know about why did threaten oh frank hesitated must not tell jarman reason hardly knew what to say jarman brought thing to point lancaster said seizing young man hand have be good friend to have be mean do treat a man of honour must treat yes swear have said nothing ah know what speak of do can hardly make mistake when speak to in tone eustace think so basely of do love mildred asked jarman sternly there be moment silence heaven help do have frank voice broke out quickly earnestly have not said word to have not even shown that take interest in knew be engaged to that sealed lip must not have come here be driven into corner darrel knew under disguise fancied might put police on track if have gone to london anywhere in country a o'neil police must have caught from description darrel must give if took off disguise description in paper must enable to recognise eustace swear that if poor hunted wretch like have have corner to hide in must not have come here trust say trust yes do trust

confessed believed to be innocent told mr perth who also think be guiltless be safe here even darrel ca find in place if like eustace can disguise in way go abroad want to remain here longer than can help must remain here said jarman decisively if try to escape may be captured fan know of disguise berry asked frank in alarm ca say that fan be down to day did not tell if have revealed anything to berry who told need ask be darrel be wrong darrel fairy fan deny that then who must have told ca say fan came down to see to have arrested suppose said frank bitterly on contrary wished to make

asked natty to get money have bad luck at digging when returned to san francisco found that treasure have be discovered claimed share claim be refused must jolly well think so said jarman emphatically considering berry did nothing towards getting what cheek so master mr denham thought said negro with smile refused claim then berry threatened to kidnap two gentleman thought must then be able to force who possessed treasure to part with of tattooing be done so that if kidnapping took place of must be recognised berry never made attempt waited for better opportunity yes tamaroo nodded mr denham went to live at los angeles spent lot of money wife died after time looked after sir to natty so that might not be kidnapped at length berry turned up after year made friend did father mistrust at first did afterwards being shaken by drink think grew afraid of berry shared portion of money with be gave free house room occasional sum berry be not satisfied when found that mr denham be spending money never attempted to kill knowing that what remained must not pay to commit crime then thought of master who have saved share did father live in san francisco yes mr lancaster after death of mother lived like recluse invested money be well invested said tamaroo proudly helped will receive about forty thousand year now if be ever in position to enjoy muttered frank startled by good fortune well did berry see father did mr lancaster be then beginning to suffer from leprosy disease have not made much progress when began sent to lady aunt mr frank be then two year of age remember go on berry came to father threatened to follow to england kill mr lancaster grew afraid made will ah put in eustace now come to interesting part why did make such extraordinary will place frank in such danger be best must do to save from berry machination mr jarman said negro quietly being leper must not do much a disease be gaining on thought must be sent away to settlement by authority afterwards happened at time speak of be still in 'frisco poor father murmured frank what about anchor mr lancaster met afterwards about will master knew that berry be fascinating man with strong influence thought that if left money to berry might gain influence over since be so young get to leave money to then must murder to become possessed of must never have fascinated declared frank be not so weak minded a that be young then mr frank berry must have done much with a boy influenced mr denham here certainly did assented natty be slouch either berry in spite of look rascality be fascinating be quite taken in by see through now well will a said went on tamaroo mr lancaster did not know how to make money safe from berry therefore made will leaving money to mr frank afterwards to denham son be to said natty see now money be fortune be to inherit yes master did not know that berry have influence over father did different will must have be made money be to go to provided that mr frank be hanged before reached age of twenty five if mr frank died natural death be murdered money be to go to charity anchor be made trustee of will see where sense of hanging come in well mr jarman said negro turning to eustace who have spoken be way master thought that unless put in clause berry might get rid of mr frank by violence if murdered money must have gone to charity quite so assented tamaroo quietly even if mr frank died natural death must have happened mr lancaster knew that berry be mixed up with people of race who knew something of poison aha said jarman balkis yes balkis sir though know how came to hear of will tell later go on tamaroo paused to collect thought continued so see that only way in berry must prevent money going to charity in case must be lost to altogether be by getting mr frank hanged master fancied that even if berry did not murder mr frank openly might get drug from balkis must kill mr frank without revealing that poison have be used must have be done said tamaroo impressively ah see now cried eustace berry by mean of poison must have made frank death appear natural yes sir in case money must have gone to charity mr lancaster knew that being brought up by lady aunt son must not commit crime so be not likely that berry must succeed in getting hanged before age of twenty five see said frank grimly have made good shot at be to be hanged for murder of starth then natty here be to get money yes said tamaroo afterwards mr denham be to be put out of way berry niece be to benefit very clever muttered natty be not quite such fool mr

then having taken possession of address written by former housekeeper left house last saw of mr burl tilly be struggling with mr betts for possession of very small green trunk waiting cabman be applauding fight evidently new trouble in connection with three day notice be taking place however eustace have more serious thing to think of washed hand completely of mr burl after ungrateful behaviour lost time in taking underground to city thence departed for dock after dull journey repaired to address mentioned in paper be certain number in narrow lane led down to water edge on right hand side of eustace found respectable looking house painted spotless white with green shutter must not have disgraced new suburb doorstep be also white brass knocker polished to painful brilliancy amidst other frowsy house that of balkis looked fresh clean genteel door be opened by lean chinaman dressed in blue made remark conducted eustace into room furnished in chinese manner jarman be left

precisely what business be do know old man called tamaroo asked eustace suddenly balkis looked at serenely never heard of said jarman noticed that spoke almost a well a tamaroo wondered that within so short space of time must come into contact with two educated member of african race evidently be on guard so eustace tried shot be directed to house by mr burl said time balkis showed emotion to speak truly became rather ferocious be bad woman ungrateful woman saved child from starving threatened to betray finished jarman serenely balkis stared looked still more unpleasant there be nothing wrong that must say if belong to police have wasted time be quite respectable even to keeping secret gambling room what glared at like tigress burl told that did after telling where to find tilly after taking away tilly from for year said jarman calmly know great deal of what doe not concern said balkis placing hand on hip if have come to threaten be quite able to defend there be gambling here secret room if want clean mat pipe can have have never be in trouble with law yet eustace produced piece of ribbon do know where found asked dangling between finger thumb bought suppose said quietly eustace shook head observe be of same pattern a dress a ribbon wear round neck what be to do with simply belongs to be lost in house in sand lane kensington where balkis made step towards big eye rolled savagely why be talking like asked hoarsely if know tamaroo will tell tell mister there be reason why must not have come here for certain information go away till get information about what demanded unpleasantly about certain people whom know captain berry niece tamaroo lancaster lancaster wretch who murdered walter cried balkis with tragic air see here mister have men below foreign men who carry knife at word from 'd cut tongue out at risk of having hole drilled through said eustace balkis seemed disconcerted a apparently did not expect that must be armed who be name eustace jarman

jamaica be sailor found out through following walter why did follow ca tell that yet said suspiciously walter came here to smoke be fond of pipe met captain berry up west berry followed here then recognised one good old banjo often came here to smoke pipe why do ask question eustace reflected appeared to be frank certainly did not side with berry to great extent thought best to trust for even

here be proof eustace handed letter snatched from eagerly to arouse jealousy of balkis have got letter written have put to use fairy fan never expected certainly must not have written eustace guessed that semi civilised creature like balkis must be insanely jealous that if found man loved adored woman must make short work of woman have balkis be on side of berry jarman hoped to detach from interest by mean of letter balkis apparently cared one way other still to make talk more freely be worth while trying experiment ruse be successful for great black creature after reading letter went fairly mad will die will die be cry again stamped crushing up letter in strong finger if fairy fan now came within reach of finger eustace thought must have short shrift be not sorry crime of mr anchor needed such punishment suddenly balkis thrust letter into pocket seizing jarman hand kissed savagely be friend swear by will do what want said hoarsely then tell who killed starth can not unless be lancaster tamaroo say then be friend of lancaster how did meet tamaroo knew in san francisco also be obi worshipper knew be here in london when came visited told knew about captain berry did

question told when heard that berry knew walter said must go to walter to hear more of told house sent that ribbon with tamaroo so that walter might know came from oh then tamaroo be in house when murder be committed balkis looked queerly at tamaroo did not kill walter said if have must have killed although jarman urged to say more declined to do so then thought of likeness remarked upon by

call cousin think white have blood well balkis know now how miss berry have treated will kill said balkis gnashing splendid teeth know how to kill painfully jarman shuddered so ferociously did make speech thought must not like to offend creature will help to save lancaster said eagerly to save baffle berry know said sullenly heaved up from chair if be innocent will not die if not will die come where will take asked eustace following to door feeling in hip pocket that revolver be loose to secret room said balkis looking back with grin ah then mr burl be right have secret room balkis nodded led down long passage can kill in said in matter of fact tone not be friend grinned again will let see that woman die if like jarman shuddered again at venomous tone in spite of courage felt trifle nervous however have revolver if came to worst resolved to fight now that have launched into adventure be resolved to carry through have promised mildred to save frank be only way to do balkis must tell truth wished to do so negress led to trap door descended to find in long stone passage at end of be iron door opened eustace be conscious of blaze of light in glare saw of people tamaroo frank lancaster chapter xxiv tamaroo speaks did not expect to find here said frank after have shaken hand warmly with friend very last place in must have looked for how did come glanced inquiringly at tamaroo brought replied old negro when overturned lamp drew mr frank away in darkness went to nearest railway station came to town then did seek shelter captain will never think to find here what of be furious quite at loss to find eustace glanced at balkis where stood with folded arm staring at frank with very pleasant expression there be nothing to fear said guessing jarman meaning a yet be not sure if man killed walter did not interposed frank told so before also assured of innocence said tamaroo uneasily balkis still continued to glare a say be not sure declared obstinately if did not kill walter will come to harm here can stay until send out of place to foreign part if killed looked savage there will be escape for now know with not very reassuring speech passed through door again shutting with clang eustace heard key turn in lock recalled warning of mr burl be safe here asked tamaroo who appeared quite easy in mind be told that room be dangerous dangerous echoed negro looking round why must be dangerous jarman repeated warning of mr burl boast of balkis tamaroo merely laughed there be danger said decisively be quite sure that balkis will hing to harm doe not seem to be very well disposed towards frank because will insist that killed starth said frank doubt berry have be poisoning mind however berry will not look for here darrel might hinted eustace uneasily nonsense how can find place oh know belief that have negro blood in vein be true be relative of balkis sometimes come here be not proud of relationship even if doe know place will never think that be here eustace looked doubtful have to pitch out of garden of rose cottage said be impertinent to mildred to mildred repeated frank with angry flush yes responded jarman keeping eye away from frank face said well never mind what said punished for insolence went away vowing that must hunt down tamaroo laughed will never come here said must know that balkis be on side of berry will believe that be last place must bring master to very danger of refuge make safety be not sure that balkis be on side of captain berry now be reply of eustace certainly will not help if only because hate fairy fan eustace related how have made use of letter miss berry have written tamaroo nodded approvingly be good plan said if think white woman loved starth will not help plot balkis be madly in love with mr starth say must have married said jarman frank laughed believe that starth be nice in idea of female beauty must not marry black woman moreover be desperately in love with fan balkis know that hate fan accordingly said eustace grimly starth might have married balkis for money be certainly rich put in tamaroo meditatively already have made up mind to return to america go next week what will do with frank then take abroad have arranged with balkis know many sailor can get captain to give mr frank passage say to spain there will wait till there be chance of learning who killed starth jarman looked attentively at negro know who be guilty person asked meaningly tamaroo looked surprised why must well said eustace quietly went to sand lane to examine tilly servant said that right hand window of house be open remember told so said frank yes on report questioned tilly admitted that told lie at inquest window be open when left house on return here eustace looked again at tamaroo be locked prof that assassin entered by window after committing murder locked so that one must get into house discover crime then left by door why do look at tamaroo when say that asked frank because tilly found scrap of tartan ribbon on kitchen floor similar to worn by balkis brought with balkis acknowledged that be piece gave to tamaroo when decided to see starth frank wheeled round looked anxiously at negro did see starth demanded thought did not arrive in london till after murder for reason must not find tamaroo considered for few minute did say that admitted because thought wise for moment to conceal have be in starth house thought might mistrust must never do replied lancaster patting old man on back why did visit starth must like to know that also said eustace who be not so easily convinced of negro innocence man gave reproachful glance acted for best mr jarman can trust think can answered eustace cautiously yet why did visit starth to explain must remind of murder of anchor in san francisco be sakers who shot be glad of eustace looked a surprised a frank thought anchor be executor of father said latter be intended to betray trust be so madly in love with wife that must not give up threatened to leave go with uncle if did not let share in money of mr lancaster anchor have paper of have others wanted so that must dispose of money intended to join wife in chicago with sakers to arrange for robbery know how intended to manage do know added tamaroo emphatically that be intention to return to house where be waiting for to get paper from to leave dead behind eustace must scarcely believe if heard how man spoke to know be to throw dust in eye must report that anchor be at enmity with sakers mr anchor thus one must suspect of robbery when spoke to mr jarman have paper on sakers rather berry knew intended to kill anchor to rob body of paper however chose wrong moment a be talking to man chased sakers must not search body did so ah be on spot said something about learnt in way that be not necessary to explain that man intended to betray trust mr anchor gave information be at house yes be waiting there for return of anchor left house went to room mr jarman where mr anchor said husband have gone saw shot fired saw also that sakers fled pursued by when street be quiet came to see body got paper from breast pocket what about chinaman lo keong who stabbed be not chinaman said tamaroo quietly stabbed jarman be beginning to see connection between san francisco crime sand lane murder yes said tamaroo perfectly calm collected while frank shivered anchor be traitor be betraying sacred trust when took paper opened eye saw that be still alive so stabbed jarman jumped up even frank recoiled from negro have right to kill man said eustace hoarsely did not shot be fatal one simply stabbed to make sure need not rebuke mr jarman did then must do again did do again asked frank remembering death of starth be thinking of sand lane yes sir be who stabbed starth eustace shuddered be alive be quite dead stabbed in order to frighten mr berry when saw that man have died from wound similar to anchor have died from fancied must be afraid abandon scheme to get money did berry know that stabbed anchor doe know that stabbed starth seeing that there be shot wound knife wound in two case must have gathered that someone else be mixed up in matter knowledge must make careful did however said frank young man did not like way in tamaroo have behaved for although have not murdered anchor starth still have mutilated then in spite of veneer of education tamaroo be negro pure simple with savage instinct of african race to rebuke must be a futile a punishing dog for barking tamaroo have only obeyed nature eustace on side shrewdly suspected that balkis also african must act in like barbaric fashion did think necessary race instinct held good in spite of fact that black people be educated tell exactly what occurred in house said eustace also explain why went to see starth when came to england stopped here for time said tamaroo a knew balkis in san francisco knew that must not betray to berry why not considering be secret of obi said old man with savage look be here in room be not generally known to outside world starth berry came here knew when be here always kept out of way from listening became aware that there be plot against mr frank to have hanged starth berry be mover also miss berry starth be to receive share on condition that inveigled to house there be to be saddled with guilt of murder starth did not expect to be killed oh berry intended that must be victim be why miss berry made trouble created row between starth mr frank berry at theatre on previous night brought about quarrel so that might be accused then next day starth wrote letter asking to visit how starth fancied that crime be to be brought about know drugged then waited for arrival of berry to carry on rest of plot how did come to know gathered at various time thought out rest said tamaroo nodding of course of be own fancy theory grunted eustace admitting however that negro have pieced thing together very cleverly well went to sand lane yes a thought that trouble be coming pretended to balkis wished to see starth gave tartan ribbon wore a sign must be trusted in what way asked frank tamaroo shook head ca tell that there be something in starth life balkis knew gave hold over be always afraid of people of colour unless have taken tartan ribbon must not have spoken did speak never saw replied negro simply did not get to house till nearly seven window be open a saw one about must get answer when rang climbed in then locked window so that one must enter in way to interrupt between starth there be chance of know mr jarman have entered that way seeing what plot be in progress others might have come in then went down stair to see servant a balkis have mentioned balkis knew tilly murmured eustace then there be one there went up stair found starth dead lay in middle of room mr frank be unconscious on sofa drugged a saw why did not give alarm asked lancaster angrily must not sir be stranger man of colour also have entered by window have given alarm must have be arrested perhaps hanged can see difficulty yes admitted frank see be awkward position thought best to go away say nothing knew that starth have be shot so a to inculpate that must be arrested have happened must have come forward a escaped waited hoping to trap berry in dark wished to find to tell what knew be why posted scarlet bat over london knew that be tattooed on arm that if became aware of poster must out of curiosity inquire for sealed letter be exactly what happened said eustace say that starth be waiting for berry after drugged frank perhaps berry came shot starth with frank pistol then departed said tamaroo decisively ca think that berry wanted to enjoy money must have risked murder then ca say who shot man if not berry said jarman however on what say will try bluff berry before berry said jarman however on what say will try bluff berry before left stabbed body yes did rejoined tamaroo defiantly man be dead thought to frighten berry there be much at stake then left house think anyone saw going a be growing dark be know what else be to be found out must be discovered by mr jarman will do best said eustace who be to follow providence answered that question there be sound of door opening balkis entered after came captain berry niece darrel rhodesian fulfilling threat have hunted frank down be face to face with prey chapter xxv nemesis fairy fan cast scornful glance round room did not deserve such disdain a be magnificently furnished although display of colour be rather barbaric wall be lined with tall narrow mirror framed in gold with painted panel let in between hanging be of crimson plush embroidered with gold blue carpet be profusely sprinkled with yellow flower there be red velvet divan against wall many gilt chair with spindle leg numerous card table with green cloth top at further end of room door likewise sheathed in iron led into inner smaller apartment similarly furnished everywhere glittered electric light in opaque globe apparently balkis have spared no cost to make subterranean gambling room a gorgeous a possible when saw miss berry sneer at in opinion matchless magnificence
