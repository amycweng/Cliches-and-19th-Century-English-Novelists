motor car within two hour be driving out of half moon street be soon dodging traffic of piccadilly be so delightful manipulating machine in sunshine acting a chauffeur so appealed to that be minded to

sight certainly felt drawn to looked like captive angel without knowing right wrong of case prelice mentally pronounced to be entirely innocent calmness if not beauty acquitted a susceptible heart decided for woman with unclean conscience must have faced judge jury with such manifest confidence prelice thought of joan of arc on trial for sorcery of mary stuart before prejudiced tribunal of marie antoinette of vestal who proved innocence by drawing tiber water in sieve might also have recalled marquise de brinvilliers likewise calm beautiful guilty did not court be filled with more le fashionable people who came to make roman holiday of sir oliver lanwin violent death miss chent position doubtless have be well known in society who have be friend be here to watch in new role of accused criminal prelice be disgusted at heartless conduct of lady who whispered tittered used opera glass to stare at unfortunate girl internally commended aunt for having have good taste to remain absent then turned eye on array of barrister to search for ned shepworth if prisoner be serene in consciousness of innocence counsel certainly be le composed strong will second nature of custom kept shepworth sufficiently controlled to deceive who have passing acquaintance with personality prelice who have known young barrister for year noted that usually ruddy complexion be whiter than usual that eye seemed to be sunken in head by reason of dark shadow beneath shepworth be slim handsome man brown haired brown eyed with clean shaven face resolute mouth in wig gown looked very presentable son of themis if somewhat le composed than traditionally unemotional lawyer must be be seated at long table with two older men who apparently be coadjutor near defence trio counsel for prosecution appointed by public prosecutor on behalf of crown be chatting amiably with colleague keen faced young barrister behind sat many other lawyer wigged gowned who be taking deepest interest in proceeding for moment court be so still that rustling of brief a barrister turned page must be plainly heard be two fellow assisting mr shepworth in defence prelice whispered to legal looking bystander at elbow replied man in low voice big fellow be cudworth kc other be young arkers who act a junior counsel shepworth be not defending a be in house when crime be committed will be called a witness so lady sophia be inaccurate a usual prelice felt somewhat disappointed that must not have opportunity of hearing old school chum orating however have little time to think for at moment prosecuting counsel got on leg to open case prelice felt that curtain have risen on tragedy wondered what must be scene when curtain fell chapter ii trial counsel in clear deliberate voice opened speech with unvarnished statement of case very remarkable story unfolded prelice a experienced traveller have always believed in impossible seemed to that have returned to prosaic england to hear veritable fairy tale there be something extremely fantastic about way in crime be said to have be committed a set forth by speaker event happened in wise sir oliver lanwin last male heir of ancient kentish family whose seat be situated near hythe have found forty year previous to trial pauper with newly inherited title seeing chance in england of rehabilitating fortune have taken what little money possessed to new zealand leaving only sister well provided for a wife of army officer named chent after making money in various way at hokitika sir oliver have purchased fruit schooner to trade amongst south sea island being successful have bought other ship for more than thirty year have be kind of polynesian merchant prince owing to wealth enterprise keen business capacity have never married because of early disappointment ten year before have returned to england with capital representing ten thousand year with have retired to ancestral seat near hythe there proposed to end day in comfort after fashion of famous sailor of arabian night brought with old shell back mariner steve agstone by name who be important witness for prosecution unfortunately said counsel man have disappeared immediately before inquest after hinting to housekeeper mr blexey that have actually witnessed committal of crime for prisoner be being tried in spite of effort made by police witness must not be discovered be impossible to say why have disappeared counsel hoped to produce other witness who must prove beyond shadow of doubt that prisoner be guilty after proceeding thus far counsel sipped glass of water hitched gown more comfortably on to shoulder continued speech amidst breathless silence of listener being bachelor sir oliver felt somewhat lonely since be of sociable disposition for few month kept open house a nature proved to be exacting imperious did not get on well with neighbour finally proclaimed that be idiot closing door became more le of recluse be then that sir be widowed sister mr chent died suddenly leaving daughter mona prisoner to care of uncle sir oliver became extremely fond of young lady who be of lively amiable disposition indeed attachment be so great that made will in favour by be to inherit ten thousand year family seat here proceeded counsel impressively may mention circumstance in light of after event have bearing on case mr oliver while bathing at samoa have leg taken off from knee by shark thus be unable to indulge in field sport in game indeed in kind of out of door life therefore took to reading of somewhat unusual kind jacob bohme paracelsus eliphas levi be favourite author from can be judged that dead man took deep interest in psychic question also consulted palmist fortune teller astrologer crystal gazers frequently asking down to lanwin grange in fact at very time when crime be committed madame marie eppingrave well known bond street interpreter of future be staying in house will be called a witness can see gentleman of jury that late baronet be exceedingly superstitious man although clear headed in business perfectly capable of managing affair be at point shepworth caught sight of prelice nodded in friendly manner then scribbled note sent by usher to young man proved to be request that prelice must wait for at door when court adjourned for luncheon prelice slipped missive into pocket nodded reply shepworth seemed to be pleased with prompt acceptance immediately resumed attitude of attention while counsel continued to boom out fact with drone of bumble bee a narrative proceeded appeared that few month before death sir oliver have received south sea visitor in person of young sailor called captain felix jadby whose father have known at tahiti baronet be extremely intimate with visitor practically gave run of house captain jadby came went at will sir oliver talked to great deal in connection with matter dealing with polynesian trade be not to be wondered at since baronet having be trader be pleasant for to converse with one who knew about such thing unfortunately captain jadby fell in love with prisoner wished to marry refused to become wife on plea that loved mr edward shepworth be engaged to sir oliver be annoyed at engagement a desired marriage with captain jadby to take place on day of death quarrelled seriously with prisoner according to madame marie eppingrave evidence since be present during quarrel sir oliver stated that if prisoner did not marry captain jadby must disinherit prisoner still refused retired to room saying that must not reappear until captain jadby be out of house for sake of peace jadby went up to london same day with intention of returning by ten o'clock train then if prisoner still remained obdurate intended to say good bye to host leave for colony within week now gentleman of jury continued counsel with hitch of gown come to most important part of story previous to going to london captain jadby have wordy quarrel with mr shepworth from word quarrel came to blow mr shepworth foot slipped slightly sprained ankle so that be not able to leave lanwin grange a desired position be unpleasant one since sir oliver be not well disposed towards on account of engagement existed with prisoner a captain jadby have left grange mr shepworth wished to go also must have gone that sprained ankle prevented removal therefore remained in room now gentleman can see position of several people connected with matter at time when crime be committed captain jadby be in london intending to return at ten o'clock mr shepworth be in room with sprained ankle prevented leaving prisoner be also in room even though captain jadby have departed for time being declined to come down to dinner madame marie eppingrave sir oliver dined alone then baronet retired to library where until nine o'clock according to madame marie evidence chatted with on occult subject also a madame marie will state sir oliver expressed strongly on subject of prisoner refusal of jadby a sir oliver be in habit of retiring early to bed on account of health factotum steve agstone entered library at nine o'clock to bolt bar window there be shutter please remember gentleman a be important point servant have already retired after making library safe steve agstone left room with intention of waiting up for captain jadby who be expected back by ten o'clock train who intended to walk to grange madame marie lingered for few minute to say good night then retired to bedroom declares that be five minute after nine o'clock left library sir oliver so say be seated at table near window reading smoking here gentleman pursued counsel taking up plan be drawing of library passed by usher to foreman of jury will see that there be only one door to library lead out into hall be opposite to fireplace inner wall of room on three side be covered with book fourth outer wall gentleman have in three tall french window lead on to terrace over lawn lawn extends for distance ending in flower bed in turn being encircled by shrub back by park tree when madame marie left room sir oliver be seated at writing table marked x immediately before middle window a night be chilly there be fire burning in grate understand gentleman good now come to discovery of crime counsel then went on to state captain jadby returned according to promise at ten o'clock be train arrived at station be about mile from grange walked to sir be house a have luggage to carry night be fine if somewhat cold on emerging from avenue on to lawn saw that there be light in library be here that counsel again drew jury attention to fact that window have shutter captain jadby therefore thought that a sir oliver have not retired to bed must knock at one of window enter house way so a to avoid rousing other inmate by ringing bell advanced to lighted window looked through middle one be veiled a be others with curtain of indian beadwork to surprise saw that sir oliver seated at desk be lying forward on writing table be precise to fault here gentleman said counsel jocularly be absolutely to be even pedantic so that will understand sir oliver continued be lying with face on outstretched hand in armchair near fireplace sat prisoner in white dressing gown with hand on lap captain jadby must not see very distinctly owing to beadwork curtain saw sufficient to guess that something be wrong especially a knocking produced effect either on sir oliver on prisoner unconsciously pushed at middle window to surprise discovered that be not locked therefore entered what saw made ring bell at once to summon household what did see gentleman of jury saw that sir oliver be dead have be stabbed to heart under left shoulder blade apparently while seated at desk body have naturally fallen forward prisoner seated in armchair with hand on lap be in unconscious state hand white dressing gown be stained with blood with blood gentleman said counsel impressively of uncle before anyone must enter room revived on seeing body of uncle displayed great terror horror steve agstone who have be waiting up for captain jadby be first person to enter on discovering dead body of master to whom be sincerely attached at once rushed out of house for doctor by time servant be aroused by noise with came madame marie eppingrave even mr shepworth lame a be managed to crawl down stair so loud have be clamour have awakened what did prisoner say to gentleman told most ridiculous story to account for presence in library according to statement inspector from hythe took down in presence of witness prisoner said that must not sleep on account of quarrel with uncle came down stair at quarter to ten o'clock entered library with intention of making friend with uncle when entered so declares room be filled with pungent white smoke through must dimly see sir oliver seated at writing table smoke made sens reel by holding handkerchief to mouth managed to stagger to middle window have just managed to unfasten catch when fell unconscious next thing remembers according to preposterous story be presence of captain jadby declares that did not know when sir oliver be stabbed when entered library did not know why must be filled with smoke when captain jadby entered a will tell there be smoke fire have burned down to red cinder again counsel have to drink sip of water a have be talking for time there be low murmur of conversation heard before again began to speak story alleged that miss chent have told seemed ridiculous even prelice prejudiced a be in favour thought that defence be absurd miss chent never moved muscle did not even change colour quiet without word sat in dock waiting patiently for innocence to be made manifest yet a everyone thought tale be too ridiculous for word finally gentleman said counsel taking up brief must draw attention to medical evidence doctor called in stated that sir oliver be murdered about ten o'clock mark that gentleman about very time that prisoner confesses be in library in state of unconsciousness captain jadby did not arrive until thirty minute after ten a did not walk very quickly again gentleman weapon be found wherewith wound wide clean

believe foolish tale of pungent smoke prisoner unfastened when entered immediately before fainted gentleman did faint not then no can not guess what took place prisoner came down stair to see uncle

gentleman while sir oliver turn again to book stab in back then open window buried paper knife bloody in garden on re entering sight of dead body show what terrible crime have committed instead of refastening window stagger forward with intention of regaining bedroom of playing part of innocent woman nerve maintained strength consciousness so far fail at critical moment manages to reach

prof be alive when entered library at quarter to ten be dead blood be smearing prisoner dressing gown at half past ten when captain jadby arrives time prisoner say that be unconscious quite so be up to moment of captain jadby arrival from moment when staggered into room after burying knife in garden now gentleman here counsel went on to state that in spite of effort knife must not be found also detailed more explicitly medical evidence gave name of witness whom proposed to call ended with damning indictment of reason have led prisoner to commit crime amongst be fact that by sir oliver death prisoner must inherit ten thousand year at once must thus have be enabled to marry edward shepworth when speech be finished counsel sat down wiping brow hum of conversation rose in crowded court mona eye wandered here there rested finally on pitying face of lord prelice for moment remained calm then flushed deeply first sign of emotion have given moment later be led away in charge of warder while

left to time when addressed jury after evidence on side have be heard thought be rather prejudging prisoner ned shepworth shuddered call mona prisoner expostulated time that infernal belmain alluded to so felt sick be rough on undoubtedly murmured prelice not wanting more food for shepworth agitation have spoilt appetite turned to waiter ordered coffee shepworth passed along cigarette case very rough on ned oh talk about rejoined barrister restlessly think of mona young girl gently born bred being accused of murder being put into prison be horrible seemed to to be calmest person in court

said prelice quickly that jadby have reason to murder sir oliver say shepworth glanced around in alarm talk so loud there be shadow of evidence to connect jadby with crime be in london on day only returned by ten train however claim property until trial be ended nothing will be done about humph said prelice reflectively expect be on account of earlier will sir oliver wished miss chent to marry jadby shepworth nodded thought to kill two bird with one stone to let have money so to speak blend two will into one jadby love mona too hate moreover be engaged to mused prelice tipping ash off

religious girl who must not hurt fly much le sir oliver whom loved in spite of ridiculous quarrel same well well go on said prelice impatiently that knife breathed shepworth nervously jade handled paper cutter well have in hand when where prelice must not grasp true significance of very serious statement in library when be unconscious in chair how on earth do know ned shepworth looked round again wiped face see here whispered be in bed with sprained ankle a belmain said in row gave worst of including black eye although fought like cat with nine life tripped hurt foot a belmain said in speech be swollen painful not so much what must have got away to town why did because mona asked to stop support expected further trouble with uncle lay awake trying to bear pain a best must for ankle got worse when lay down about quarter to ten heard mona pas door go down stair how did know that be miss chent must know footstep amongst hundred admitted afterwards that have gone down to library at hour wondered where be going lay quiet listening for return at fifteen minute so after ten o'clock must bear suspense no longer hobbled downstairs in dressing gown thought that might have gone to library to see uncle that further trouble might be brewing a promised to stand by ankle ankle seemed right must learn what be going on very reasonable of ned continue prelice be deeply interested opened library door saw seated in armchair be there sign of smoke there be peculiar smell in room what kind of smell shepworth wrinkled brow can scarcely describe said after thought sweetish heavy sickly scent like tuberose be a near a can get mona told afterwards also thought resembled thick perfume of tuberose came from smoke of course must have come from smoke believe in smoke then oh yes sir oliver have evidently be trying magical experiment prelice looked doubtful magic be bosh remarked be not so certain of dorry there be queer thing done even in twentieth century h be then believe miss chent improbable story do because saw insensible in chair listener reflected be sir oliver dead then yes sitting in chair lying half on desk have be stabbed in back be window one of window open never noticed remember jadby did not say that middle window be ajar only that latch have be unfastened remember that what happened next shepworth explained found sir oliver dead mona unconscious one moment please prelice became quite like cross examining barrister have fainted be more than faint dorry be in kind of trance quite like person seized with catalepsy know be sure because shook pinched tried best to rouse must have opened window to admit fresh air never thought of doing so be too agitated natural enough natural enough murmured other absently cast eye round restaurant idly while thinking of what next to say gaze fell on slim boyish looking young man of medium height who have just entered who be looking at unconscious shepworth with undeniable scowl who be that asked prelice in whisper seems to know shepworth looked up across crowded room whereat man be dark clean shaven somewhat italian in look scowled more than ever jadby said barrister under breath captain jadby stared hard at enemy on part captain returned stare with scowling interest dropped into seat near door great distance away look like half caste breathed prelice glancing furtively at young man good looking too with bad temper must say if expression went for anything jadby certainly did not posse superlatively even temper mouth be hard eye be filled with sombre fire seemed to be alert wiry impetuous man who must hold own excellently in fight dressed in well cut frock coat with dark stripped trouser white waistcoat highly polished silk hat patent leather boot with spotless spat looked great dandy quite of bond street piccadilly pall mall type same there be suggestion of sea in way rolled in gait held slim brown hand dangerous man to have for enemy thought prelice looking furtively at smooth feline face sullen eye however a jadby busied in selecting luncheon from menu card prelice after taking in picturesque personality paid further attention to did shepworth captain scowled grudging recognition of one then ostentatiously looked in other direction lord prelice lighted cigarette resumed conversation episode of jadby entrance have interrupted say that miss chent be holding paper cutter when found yes be dangerous indian dagger blade hilt be stained with blood mona hand dress be also stained really believed for moment that have killed sir oliver only thought be how to save terrible situation murmured prelice looking round again for jadby then saw to surprise that man have disappeared be apparent that captain not liking to be in same room with barrister who have thrashed have gone out again however be just a well a jadby must not listen so removed knife said prelice eying friend yes seemed most reasonable thing to do took away at once seeing must not rouse for explanation be intention to hide knife in bedroom then return to take mona away ran upstairs with knife concealed in mattress then cautiously came back to library when reached door however heard someone moving in room so thought best to go back think coward dorry must see be in a dangerous position a mona after hid knife quite understand replied prelice swiftly expect captain jadby be in library be be certain be for just a reached first landing heard library bell ring remember that said rang a soon a found insensible sir oliver dead what have done with knife be concealed in desk in study in flat dare not produce lest must get into trouble besides production must do mona harm a must evidence of finding in hand must hold tongue dorry lie a best be able now can see how needful be for to hold tongue have beside must be silent stand by prelice shook hand rose to return to court action brought round to face door there at marble topped table saw jadby sipping coffee a though have never moved h be said prelice rather puzzled fellow come go like ghost just like half caste cat stealthily glanced at captain who be ostentatiously reading newspaper took notice even when young men brushed past to leave restaurant say ned remarked prelice thoughtfully when be outside do think that miss chent will be proved guilty suppress evidence about knife remember then destroyed will be in favour sole chance for prosecution to prove mona guilt be to find steve agstone declares that be looking through window saw mona kill sir oliver to whom did say to mr blexey housekeeper be witness for prosecution be nearly broken hearted love mona like everyone else h be do believe agstone story no old man hated mona for reason besides be drunk when confessed to mr blexey expect when sober again found that must be forced to prove word knowing that must not made scarce hope that wo be found dorry what doe matter if be telling lie believe be lie dorry so do will judge jury believe a do if agstone appears stick to what told blexey hang hope will not turn up who do think murdered sir oliver ca say remember that middle window be unfastened anyone must have entered from outside stabbed forget said prelice quickly miss chent confesses to having unfastened window quite so recollect also that did not know when entered library if uncle be dead alive quarter to ten be surely must have made sign if interrupted shepworth decisively what of thick white smoke at everyone jeer probably rendered sir oliver insensible a did mona can explain smoke can not unless sir oliver be trying one of infernal experiment in connection with next world what book be reading when found dead there be several book open on desk explained shepworth one be first volume of captain cook voyage pierre loti beflets sur la sombre route ' third 'polly in polynesia ' silly book with silly title by silly feminine globe trotter expect sir oliver have be refreshing south sea memory be book open at page dealing with particular subject demanded prelice after pause shepworth considered when examining sir oliver body glanced down at open page saw something about easter island did take much notice a may guess illustration of easter island statue be displayed in cook voyage will tell queer thing dorry afterwards when murder be discovered three book be closed be natural agree with rejoined shepworth emphatically desk must have be left in original untidiness until police came to take possession someone closed book what do make of demanded prelice abruptly well theory be that someone ca say who wished to prevent police seeing that sir oliver have be reading about easter island why know perhaps may be making mountain out of mole hill mole hill be important on occasion said prelice dryly witness death of william iii easter island easter island went on in musing way h be h be h be now what dickens do know about easter island in connection with case asked question in vain memory refused

must be angry at spying stole back into house by front door went to own room at back of house there waited for captain jadby rushed into library when heard bell belmain understood that agstone told that have actually seen prisoner kill sir oliver prelice in body of court thought so too a remembered what ned have said during luncheon mr blexey emphatically denied such story mentioned matter to mr shepworth be sure that said nothing steve might have talked in drunken way to others might have told different story know that there be prevailing impression that saw murder did not say so to so spoke mr blexey belmain looked worried be telling truth demanded in vexed tone be here to tell truth retorted mr blexey be so there after somewhat incoherent speech be cross examined by cudworth expressed belief that agstone have scarcely measured word being devoted to sir oliver have always be very jealous of favour shown to miss chent fairly hated undoubtedly wild maunderings be intended to hurt miss chent to get into trouble agstone have disappeared before inquest where must have have to give evidence on oath mr blexey firmly believed have be put on oath must not have substantiated what have said to never must bear that steve cried be sneaking dog saving presence have love for anyone except sir oliver do know where be now asked belmain returning to attack sir want to quite believe rejoined counsel dryly seeing that be prejudiced in prisoner favour a mr blexey have surmised that steve might have told story of actually seeing prisoner kill uncle to other servant belmain recalled several witness not one of must state that current report be true steve have certainly hinted to several that must bring home crime to miss chent have supplied detail a hint be given when be drunk one paid much attention to on afternoon of day following night of murder steve have gone out for usual stroll in direction of sandgate have not returned evidence of detective proved that have taken train to london have be traced a far a charing cross station there have disappeared in spite of search whereabouts must not be discovered by time be growing late judge jury lawyer listener exhibited symptom of weariness therefore court rose with intention of sitting at eleven o'clock on following morning be general opinion that unless steve agstone must be placed in witness box prisoner must not be convicted also miss chent calm demeanour loyalty of grange servant have placed character in so attractive light went far to enlist public sympathy in favour who left court have more belief in innocence than when have entered many insisted that must not possibly be guilty others pointing to fact have be forthcoming at inquest that have burned new will disinheriting declared that without doubt have murdered uncle so a not to lose money same majority favoured prisoner many well wishers hoped for acquittal shepworth be pleased hopeful tide be quite in mona favour dorry said to prelice when court rose unless steve agstone turn up must be set free for want of evidence there be question of burnt will know ned can prove that be will made in mona favour be burnt said shepworth decisively sir oliver made new will a have not left house for quite month must not have altered will before then lawyer never came down to grange to draw up will if sir oliver have drawn up new one must have asked of servant to be witness know that one be asked to witness document captain jadby steve agstone might have witnessed there be chance certainly that agstone might have done so one signature must have be of use have jadby witnessed new will must not have benefited under besides since have will made in south sea sir oliver assuredly wished to have money along with mona have to be done be to destroy will made in mona favour then jadby having cash must leave penniless unless married be just what have happened ended shepworth of course said prelice thoughtfully miss chent might have be trying when seen by steve to rescue will from fire into have be thrown by sir oliver shepworth wheeled round do believe that be guilty oh must look on side agstone be liar interrupted barrister quickly believe that saw mona bending over fire be insensible by own showing from moment entered room until jadby woke remember found insensible must help if said so agree with be examined about presence in library might let slip that knife yes yes said prelice hastily see will be better for to hold tongue hope that agstone will not appear if doe not mona be safe rejoined ned with sigh of relief oh poor mona think of in prison dorry will soon be out of answered prelice soothingly be quite sure that will be acquitted where be going now home to flat be quite worn out come look up evening about ten eleven when have have sleep live at alexander mansion kensington gore number forty alexander mansion repeated prelice surprised why here be long arm of coincidence ned mr dolly rover have asked to masked ball be giving in flat most unsuitable place for bal masque think oh said shepworth with flush of colour though why must show emotion prelice must not say flat occupied by mr

of wife be miss newton know very clever very beautiful dolly fancy man being called dolly short for adolphus be not uncommon abbreviation be contemptible for man be rat dolly rover added shepworth contemptuously fooh effeminate monkey well good bye will see between ten eleven when ned jumped into cab prelice walked home wondering why must run down dapper little stockbroker whom miss newton have married then remembered that shepworth have admired miss newton before changed name to rover chapter v mr rover masked ball be long lane have turning lord prelice began to believe that there might be truth in proverb for lengthy lane of idleness down have sauntered for many year seemed to be rounding corner to open out into road of industry chance observation of lady sophia have sent to new bailey have become sign post a be showing way be to go in other word be now involved in shepworth trouble out of sheer friendship ned have confessed that required assistance have turned to old school chum for same prelice be naturally willing to do what must towards aiding ned in extricating miss chent from perilous position so found work for idle brain to do of course a tried to believe must resume former life when service be duly rendered wedding bell rang for mr mr shepworth must dismiss best man once more to sauntering a prelice began to think be easier said than done mainly owing to look of miss chent have not spoken to girl knew character solely through evidence of grange servant who have be placed in witness box also ned a remembered have said very little about affianced wife prelice knew none whom must question a to prisoner quality yet for scanty knowledge felt strangely drawn towards unhappy woman confessed inwardly that must feel pang on seeing become mr shepworth without doubt prelice be in love although not head over ear swore at for being so disloyal to friend mona name slipped quite naturally into mind mona must assuredly be acquitted unless missing agstone appeared be extremely unlikely then must a assuredly marry ned who have so manfully stood by in grave trouble therefore behooved prelice a honourable gentleman be to put out of mind if wished to continue meeting shepworth gaze squarely after peer worth twenty thousand year must pick choose almost woman for wife be hard on ned that peer must play part of david in parable select le fortunate commoner one ewe lamb struggle between more than liking for mona feeling of genuine friendship for ned made prelice waver in determining future behaviour first inclination when aware of feeling be to cross channel for prolonged stay abroad leave shepworth to own device then occurred to that course must be cowardly resolved to remain help nothing that world must cavil at must ever take place since prelice with high sense of honour never dreamed of paying marked attention to miss chent same if came often into mona company seemed inevitable must remain life happiness must certainly be at stake must have feeling to smother therefore a plainly saw must be most unhappy prelice at early stage of infatuation termed feeling towards girl affection knew very well that given time opportunity affection of sudden kind might easily increase to love in case seeing how miss chent be engaged to be married must be vainly cry for honeymoon lordship then felt le happy in evening than have done in morning then have be heart whole now sight of beautiful woman in peril have aroused deepest most chivalrous feeling of nature be capable placed thus between devil deep sea prelice compromised dangerously with conscience resolved to crush down newly born desire for mona to help ned a best must in way did young man mix fire snow in vain hope that such hostile element must blend common sense must have told otherwise having so decided although not over pleased with decision with good reason prelice dressed for dinner remembered that have promised to partake of agreeable meal at aunt solitary chop at club must have be preferable a be disinclined for company aware from experience that lady sophia must strongly object to excusing telegram prelice smothered unwillingness reached

did kill if did deserved a be nasty old bully prelice desisted in despair helped to fish lady sophia seemed to change mind half minute never considered fact when wanted to deliver opinion besides preferred fiction a be le trouble to invent than to remember same sympathy appeared to be with mona prelice felt pleased that must be so must girl be acquitted position must be extremely difficult must require staunch friend of own sex why must not that friend be lady sophia whose support must do much to efface stain of criminal court until case be decided prelice did not dare to hint such idea have crossed mind a servant be hovering round table must not talk confidentially to aunt so drifted into general conversation about mutual friend thus became posted up in latest mayfair gossip so be brought up to date in necessary knowledge lady sophia knew a much about london a asmodeus did about madrid like delightful demon must unroof house to purpose luckily for men woman about whom talked

always take one at foot of letter wo come with oh very well help into brougham horrid boy believe will fall in love with mona give criminal for niece be lady sophia parting shot when motor brougham spun towards first turning out of square prelice laughed long loudly aunt be nearer truth than have be whole evening although be far from suspecting never entered elderly head that man of world such a nephew certainly be must fall in love on spur of moment must not have suspected of such lunacy thought lordship a turned in direction of half moon street to procure domino mask for ball street before alexander mansion be filled with carriage motor four wheeler hansom together with crowd of onlooker who passed remark complimentary otherwise on many guest of mr rover mansion be palatial splendid with royal flight of broad marble step to main entrance prelice shuffling on domino assuming mask climbed to find with other reveller in vast hall with two staircase ascending on side at farther end between two lift cage of soared sank with party of pleasure seeker prelice delivered rainbow hued ticket of invitation to gorgeously uniformed commissionaire took time in climbing long stair many other people did same instead of waiting for lift a be masked cloaked young man must recognise one a shepworth have stated mr mr dolly rover occupied whole of third floor be tenanted two flat faced other outer door of opening on to spacious landing have be removed from hinge thus guest must pas easily from one flat to other landing between be nest of greenery rose like hanging garden of babylon flat have wide corridor spacious room lofty ceiling so be capable of receiving large number of guest on occasion be crowded must seem a though mr rover have invited everyone on visiting list there may have be others not set down on list since mask domino prevented recognition prelice looked about for hostess found received by tiny pale faced man with large plaintive blue eye set in white expanse of absolutely colourless skin wore domino over smart evening dress mask be so clipped curled brushed washed that prelice easily guessed to be poodle mentioned by lady sophia pushing out small tightly gloved hand murmured nervous greeting to new arrival after ceremony be ended no one seemed to take notice of a who came be masked prelice wondered how mr rover must possibly know whom be greeting of course there be rainbow hued ticket given to commissionaire below must guarantee respectability of presenter ticket of sort must be stolen forged a further supervision be exercised to ensure identity of guest prelice considered that procedure be somewhat rash thought be confirmed by dried up little man who appeared without mask who be rebuked by mr rover for originality must know expostulated host in penny whistle kind of voice one be to know anyone until clock strike twelve when unmask for supper why even wife insisted must receive in place must be spotted know if stopped here to shake hand doe want to be found out until midnight whole fun of masquerade lie in secrecy so obey rule haken put on mask prelice started when heard name twisted neck to see if new comer really be uncle by marriage be simon haken sure enough for one must mistake look let alone celebrated chuckle young man laughed wondered what haken by mean society butterfly be doing at ball of lady whom wife openly disliked then remembered that lying telegram from city mr haken have little secret must seem be more human under rose than when posing a money making machine dutiful nephew determined before evening be out to let sly uncle know that misdoings be discovered meanwhile little millionaire be chuckling masking be risk know rover observed dryly know who be here swell mobsmen of london may have come after diamond oh dear how can talk so haken said host fretfully man below examines ticket a if anyone must not forge steal one retorted haken voicing nephew thought well in to morrow paper will look for criminal scandal with odious chuckle haken brushed past prelice towards ballroom of left hand flat lordship tired of watching new arrival thought that also must go view reveller have hardly moved dozen pace when unexpectedly began to think of easter island sweet heavy perfume a of tuberose be wafted in nostril why must such familiar fragrance recall desolate land environed by league of ocean chapter vi startling discovery odour be one of strongest aid memory can have chance whiff of particular scent will recall to most lethargic brain circumstance trivial important of long forgotten year well known fragrance of tuberose usually brings funeral to mind since flower be so extensively woven into burial wreath mortuary cross be strange indeed that must conjure into idle thinking mind vision of heathen festival there be many people crowding corridor so that be impossible for young man to tell who wore flower gave forth magical scent for magical be in effect might adorn man button hole woman bodice must not tell since evening dress of sex be veiled by voluminous domino a leaned against wall vision became clearer more insistent body be in london in alexander mansion at masked ball a well knew scent of tuberose have drawn spirit across league of trackless sea to uttermost part of earth present vanished beheld past before a interior vision opened saw colossal image of vanished forgotten race rudely hewn into semblance of human being bearing cylinder according to captain cook description on gigantic head reared from vast platform of cyclopean architecture overgrown with tropical vegetation strewn with bleaching bone in soft radiance of southern moon prelice beheld kneeling crowd of bronze hued worshipper tattooed painted adoring weird stone god old priest face body streaked with white pigment murmured strange name over rude stone altar whereon blazed clear fire invoked terrible deity incarnate in giant idol kanaro gotomoara marapate areekee cast upon flame yellow leaf of sacred herb thick white cloud of smoke spread like milky mist before statue veiling grotesque look vast outline sickly scent of tuberose grew powerful then did priest become rigid a dead spirit blended with spirit of grim god worshipped finally fragrance loaded heavy air whether of easter island london prelice must not tell passed away with odour passed vision must only have lasted minute so be so terribly vivid that prelice must scarcely believe that surroundings be real when material asserted sway have closed eye to behold vision scent have invoked opened again with bewildered expression to see pushing laughing chattering throng of guest although commonplace young man contemptuous a rule of unseen felt that recollection have not be brought back for nothing dead man at lanwin grange have be reading about easter island when foully stabbed accused girl have described to lover white smoke sickly perfume also have to do with isolated land mona also prelice remembered faithfully what shepworth have told have be in state of catalepsy like priest of vision after although chose to call what have seen mentally vision be simply vivid recollection of what dr horace have beheld year two before what have fetish worship in easter island to do with murder in kent be question prelice must not answer there be time to invent possible explanation to reason out answer being in rome momentary dreamer have to do a roman did a prelice be at ball be compelled out of courtesy to hostess host to enjoy did not have far to go for adventure a lady in blue domino with fringed mask to disguise voice stole to side engaged in airy conversation who be young man did not know probably be equally ignorant of identity on especial night mr rover flat be liberty hall with vengeance for men woman trusting in mask domino for concealment flirted danced drank laughed with one in most outrageous manner there be need of introduction of reticence of timidity in eden bower of flower fern face be hidden soul be revealed blue domino proved to be most charming companion full of fun flirtation delightful dancer prelice found extremely entertaining appeared to reciprocate feeling after particularly perfect waltz inspiriting glass of champagne lordship did best to lure unknown into corner where might unmask lady shook head laughingly ran off to ballroom with man whose stature of life guardsman have caught roving eye prelice solaced with glass of wine looked about for female of man be then that chuckle at elbow made turn now then now then said gentleman who have chuckled let come to refresh spoke irritably pushed past prelice in hurry waiter waiter glass of champagne thought be teetotaler uncle whispered prelice mr haken betrayed by chuckle wheeled suddenly spilt wine be about to sip to nephew surprise be trembling stammering voice betrayed agitation who who be prelice whispered name need be alarmed added wo tell aunt sophia that be accepting enemy hospitality haken drank off wine in one deep gulp set down glass with hand still shaking must rather did not tell said in low tone sophia dislike mr rover must be annoyed if knew be here have come on business what business at ball invent more credible story uncle be true insisted haken becoming more composed have to see political man from continent about loan doe want to be known that be meeting so thought that must be best place to ensure secrecy not word of prelice of course not replied young man puzzled to know why haken must take trouble to explain mention name also wish to be unknown what be doing here asked haken abruptly came to ball also have to see ned shepworth who shepworth gasped haken backing nervously oh yes friend of charming hostess friend of mine also be here no must not come to ball when promised wife be in prison of course not very creditable of to be sure muttered haken took glass of wine with whispered apology be teetotal a rule know society always try nerve need sustenance wish man have to meet here have chosen office in city must have done must have done there must be trouble be known that be in london what be time prelice mention name will mention yours said prelice impatiently drew out watch be eleven o'clock haken nodded must meet man eleven fifteen be time a to mentioning name what doe matter came here without mask never thought of putting on prelice nodded in turn saw when rover received then hold tongue hold tongue not word to sophia mind not word prelice promised gravely mr haken drawing long breath must seem to be of relief at having extracted promise vanished into many hued crowd with usual chuckle while millionaire gave vent to chuckle there did not seem to be much chance of concealing identity lord prelice looked after somewhat puzzled must quite understand why haken did not want wife to know of presence in alexander mansion be difficult to account for old man agitation quite unnecessary explanation a rule haken be extremely reticent on important matter a secret meeting with continental diplomatist must be much more so yet have gone out of way to set right with nephew by telling private business when gay excuse of needing night off must have be sufficient to account for presence however prelice simply shrugged shoulder did not deem incident worth remembering why must not simon haken enjoy in way if liked turn mr rover ballroom into office wherein to meet foreign client same prelice gave passing thought be strange that chance meeting with one who knew must so upset be still stranger that if mr haken wished to preserve incognito must have arrived unmasked having lost uncle charming blue domino prelice took tour through room in search of further adventure must only afford few minute since have to call upon shepworth at eleven o'clock be already that hour a have told haken still few minute more le must not matter prelice wished to see if must espy mr dolly rover in order to renew acquaintance with to compliment on success of ball undoubtedly be success for everyone seemed highly amused laughter small talk went on incessantly many people be dancing to music of gaily uniformed hungarian band many more be ensconced in flirtation corner making best of hour must elapse before everyone unmasked for supper prelice therefore wandered leisurely throughout two flat exchanging few chaffing word with different woman who addressed looking for tall form of hostess ala there be many tall woman who looked a imperial graceful a mr rover prelice felt like ali baba robber when examined be chalk mark on various door therefore began by way of diversion to admire costume of woman showed more le plainly from under flowing domino of silk in fact heat of night of room be so great that many lady loosened string button of domino permitted frock to be plainly seen must have removed mask also in case so stifling be perfumed air rule of ball stopped from doing so still a many revealed gown be wearing be probable that must pay for flirtatious sin when supper hour recognition came young man have eye for colour knew very little about millinery so if anyone later have asked to describe various dress must have be puzzled one woman wore dress attracted from oddity be flowing gown of white silk from hem to waist skirt be adorned with triple line at interval of narrow red velvet space between triple line be equal line of red velvet ran apparently entirely round skirt effect be bizarre rather fascinating what made prelice note dress so exactly be wonderful ubiquity of lady who wore went into ballroom of right hand flat there be dancing strolled into left hand ballroom found flirting in corner with partner then stumbled across in corridor later discovered at buffet sipping champagne domino be green a be mask seemed to be in several place at once prelice be amused at activity at way in seemed to permeate entire place be certainly getting enjoyment must out of ball spoke to once made reply disappeared before must address again rather annoyed that must not respond prelice yawned discovering that be half past eleven decided to descend look up shepworth stair be crowded not only with people leaving arriving with flirting couple who be cooling in purer air ascended from main entrance of mansion expostulated loudly sometimes silently if irritated gesture went for anything with who pushed past to go up down prelice came in for share of blame a cautiously steered way to second floor here there be few people a guest kept to third floor stair to leading to fourth look at left hand door a came down showed prelice that be number forty so pressed button of electric bell waited for door to be opened a did so while be leaning against wall still wearing mask domino ubiquitous lady in green domino with oddly trimmed frock descended stair alone cast swift look at a passed be not until vanished below prelice became aware that scent of tuberose be again in nostril have mind to run after assuming privilege of masked ball ask if be wearing such flower in idle way did not think be worth while remained where be one came to answer bell so prelice judged that shepworth servant be out perhaps fraternising with mr rover domestic at ball overhead rang again however believing that shepworth must be within awake by time a again door did not open prelice raised hand to knocker to surprise door yielded trifle then discovered that be slightly ajar so little so that have believed to be closed for moment there be one on landing so stepped into shepworth flat without closing door after say ned ned be in cried young man pausing in corridor be similar to overhead in mr rover flat say ned be be prelice slipped off mask there be still reply then prelice smelt stronger than ever that strange odour have evoked easter island vision thought again flew back to heathen festival walked along corridor wondering why scent must follow here on left hand side peeped into drawing room be empty door opposite be surely that of dining room be closed prelice opened walked in to look for friend shepworth be in room sure enough prelice uttered irrepressible cry when amazed eye fell on barrister in deep saddle back chair placed between fireplace near window sat shepworth bolt upright with hand resting upon knee in hieratic attitude of egyptian statue intensely calm face be pearly white brown eye be fixed in glassy unnatural stare appeared a rigid stiff unbending a though hewn out of granite there be disorder about clothing evening dress wore be a accurate neat a though have got ready to go to ball overhead prelice stared at tongue tied motionless with astonishment then eye mechanically wandered round room fell immediately upon figure seated on far side of dining table with outstretched arm sprawling nervelessly across cloth on rested huge head covered with shaggy red hair drawn a by loadstone prelice stole forward with staring eye saw with sudden shudder that man at table be stone dead have be stabbed ruthlessly in back under left shoulder blade everything in room be in absolute order only one man dead sat at table sprawling half across other man insensible be stiffly seated in armchair whole apartment be permeated with scent suggested easter island suggested also that other murder at lanwin grange chapter vii shepworth explains unsteady footstep roused lord prelice from momentary stupor wheeled automatically to see little man masked wearing black silk domino swaying to fro at open dining room door sight of two apparently dead men presence of possible murderer seemed to sober new comer in single moment before prelice must spring forward gasped fled almost immediately voice tense with terror be heard shouting news of discovery to reveller on stair prelice cursed under moustache ran into passage to close outer door now remembered have foolishly left ajar possibly little man being intoxicated have stumbled up stair on way to ball finding door open have so far mistaken way a to stagger in prelice wondered if stranger be haken rover small of stature recollected that have never seen drunk besides drunk sober rover haken must never mistake shepworth flat for one overhead at outer door prelice swiftly changed mind saw that murder of red headed man be similar in respect to of sir oliver lanwin then miss chent have be given time to recover so have be accused of crime although protested that have be in state of catalepsy induced by scented smoke shepworth likewise be insensible judging from odour in dining room from same cause must be better decided young man rapidly that shepworth must be seen by score of witness thus insensible for then must be proved so helpless man must not have struck blow thus when crowd of startled people came pouring down staircase into flat on second floor prelice threw open door widely admitted with hurried explanation there have be terrible crime committed declared leading way to dining room came here few minute ago to find mr shepworth owner of flat insensible a see other man stone dead have be stabbed stabbed several voice echoed word one woman gave faint scream passage be crowded to

masker in blue domino who have placed directly in front of mob blocking doorway addressed prelice manner be offensively suspicious know disclaimed that young gentleman quietly for seemed absurd indeed that must be suspected came here to see mr shepworth only ten minute ago how did enter tone of question be still offensive outer door be slightly ajar explained other suavely pushed open a have appointment with friend decline to defend further a seem to suspect send for police send for police said many voice rough male voice be heard recommending that prelice only voice called murderer must not be allowed to escape what nonsense cried young man indignantly raising voice on hearing so direct accusation have nothing to do with matter be lord prelice if anyone here know utterance of title

agstone gasped missing witness prelice also startled backed against wall with outstretched hand open mouth in flash saw how dangerous be position of barrister indeed many confused voice be muttering a to guilt of shepworth captain jadby letting eye fall on dead man made spokesman for shepworth murdered to win case said nodding ask pardon lord prelice for suspecting must rather continued to do so cried prelice angrily be absurd to think that shepworth killed man look at pointed to rigid form in armchair be incapable of raising hand miss chent be also incapable sneered captain yet be innocent stormed prelice fiercely more killed uncle than did shepworth witness everyone be listening eagerly with open eye ear to altercation be impossible to say how long must have continued for entry of police two constable pushed way through crowd forthwith when have taken in situation began to clear place crowd of pleasure seeker now unmasked for most part be driven outside fled down stair anxious to get away from scene of tragedy while others returned to rover flat fact of murder ruined ball broke up like macbeth famous banquet with most admir 'd disorder in ten minute room be deserted everyone ran away a though from plague mr rover looking like frightened rabbit came down to make inquiry be shepworth dead asked tremulously of stalwart policeman whom found guarding closed door of number forty everyone say that shepworth be dead wife have fainted doctor be with mr shepworth now said constable gruffly know what be matter with ai duty to say anything sir oh dear oh dear rover

man deferentially be mr shepworth servant be valet lady be cook yonder be housemaid have right to enter ca until doctor inspector have done with master said constable stolidly why be in bed cook large red faced lady gaily dressed replied mr shepworth allowed to join mr rover servant at masked ball then none of be in flat when murder be committed questioned policeman doing little detective business on own account oh lor ' cried housemaid timidly have be upstairs since nine o'clock helping mr rover servant with party do let in mr policeman stay where be until order come commanded officer sternly trio sat disconsolately on stair with instinct of self preservation have thoroughly explained absence from scene of crime now felt perfectly safe meanwhile in dining room young medical man who have fortunately be present at ball be reviving shepworth with brandy ammonia window have be thrown open fresh air be filling room so rapidly that scarcely trace of tuberose fragrance remained prelice having laid aside mask domino be standing near door with hand in pocket watching man in uniform who examined dead along with official doctor whom police have called in first individual be inspector bruge keen looking sharp eyed man with clean shaven face closely clipped grey hair abrupt red tape manner captain jadby be not present having departed with rest of too curious onlooker lord prelice remained a have be first to discover crime bruge wished to hear account of already inspector note book be in hand to note down result of official doctor examination there be dead silence in room faintly broken by distant roll of vehicular traffic with occasional hoot of motor horn bell of near church boomed out midnight so unexpectedly that prelice jumped might well be excused for doing so a nerve be considerably shaken twelve o'clock said bruge crisply when did discover crime lord at half past eleven replied prelice shivering good heaven be only hour since then seems like year be on spot in ten minute said bruge with official satisfaction have be long in getting thing ship shape now that lady gentleman have gone can look into matter doctor glanced at young man attending to shepworth be patient reviving trifle answered other rising help to place near window in draught be long faint said inspector helping to wheel armchair to open window be not faint at man be in cataleptic state induced by administration of drug induced by odour of burning herb mean said prelice looking at rigid face of shepworth be a expressionless a of dead man at table what be questioned inspector turning head prelice waved hand will explain later after have seen friend dr horace horace horace medical man who be examining corpse looked up at remark know slightly great traveller be yes answered prelice quickly travelled with to little known part of world called easter island lucky that did so be with between may be able to solve mystery of cataleptic business know that be catalepsy induced by odour of course do have seen man in state before prelice pointed to rigid form of shepworth where asked bruge looking at with keen eye somewhat puzzled on easter island inspector must have asked further question when elder doctor rose from examining agstone body stretched well thornton asked curtly man be dead right enough said thornton with shrug stab under left shoulder blade reached heart at one blow see weapon with be committed crime mean have searched flat yet rejoined bruge brusquely if remember thornton weapon killed sir oliver lanwin be not found either what have case to do with sir oliver lanwin death bruge looked surprised read paper doctor there be murder case on at new bailey resembles in particular sir oliver lanwin be stabbed seated at desk under left shoulder blade niece who be accused say that be innocent be in cataleptic state just a counsel of hers be what see here mused bruge will go long way towards helping to prove innocence mr shepworth need not have got rid of agstone in way did cried prelice sharply will stake existence that mr shepworth be perfectly innocent lord know that prosecution hoped to convict miss chent on agstone evidence be necessary that defence must keep out of way here be man very forcibly removed in room of young gentleman who be not only helping to defend miss chent who be affianced husband look strange prelice pointed to shepworth who now showed sign of reviving say to a said to people who burst into flat when alarm be given that shepworth be incapable of lifting hand ah know how long have be incapable said bruge cunningly when be agstone murdered doctor thornton who be twisting cigarette answered promptly enough must say judging from condition of temperature of body time between ten eleven o'clock can tell asked inspector turning to other doctor how long mr shepworth have be insensible said young physician promptly will tell soon be coming round even a spoke shepworth opened eye stared vaguely at in room gaze wandered in bewildered manner from inspector to prelice from prelice to two doctor finally looked meditatively at dead body be stretched right across blue cloth of dining table with glassy eye staring at ceiling shudder shook barrister frame a though moved by wire sprang stiffly to foot prelice prelice cried voice grew stronger a strength came back a did colour sens look look be same a in grange library agstone be dead have be in trance know then asked bruge swiftly that dead man be agstone yes have seen many time at grange how did come here who murdered eye questioned present dumbly be what wish to ask said inspector shepworth passed hand across forehead be now moist with perspiration police murmured agstone dead will place in dock beside mona asked bruge passionately prelice sprang to side caught by hand ned ned urged pull together tell how agstone came to be murdered in room ca tell cried shepworth wrenching away hand can tell no more than mona must be in trance saw nothing only coming out of to find dead beside be in trance saw ah broke off wild eye went roving round room where be woman what woman asked bruge suddenly kept eye on shepworth face with look of severe scrutiny woman who came in masked cloaked came in agstone admitted waved bronze cup before then oh what doe mean asked breaking down with reason considering what have undergone prelice shook gently by shoulder be beside ned be looking after only tell everything remember shepworth stared straight before then a though spring have be touched began to speak swiftly coherently be sitting reading in drawing room when heard three heavy blow struck on wall of room a servant be upstairs assisting at ball wondered who be in flat came out to inquire door of room be closed opened to find thick white smoke smelling sweetly sickly curling from bronze cup placed on table fume choked staggered instinctively to open window before must reach fell senseless interpolated thornton keenly shepworth turned irritably how must be senseless when heard saw everything up to point be what did see questioned bruge eagerly must move neither hand foot must call out went on shepworth slowly lay on floor half propped up against chair then saw shuddered large hairy hand push aside tablecloth shortly man crawled from underneath be agstone for recognised without difficulty growled in pleased manner lifted into chair then went out remained absent for time when returned tall woman be with wearing mask green domino taking bronze cup from white smoke still poured waved under nose sens left knew more until woke to find in room agstone be dead ended barrister trembling agstone be dead agstone said bruge significantly be chief witness for prosecution chapter viii private explanation shepworth made reply to insinuation contained in remark of inspector brain be still dazed with fume of white smoke after telling story sat indifferently in armchair prelice watched closely recognising mental confusion then laid hand on poor fellow arm have better come lie down said gently glanced at thornton certainly certainly answered that gentleman briskly in reply to unspoken query of prelice few hour sleep will cure mr shepworth completely can stay with friend demanded prelice turning to bruge inspector nodded absently a be evidently following train of thought will be necessary to make further examination of inquired looking at dead body at thornton not at present when have be removed to dead house will see to further examination have seen body before rigor mortis have set in so be be necessary man have be stabbed time between ten eleven be a dead a coffin nail thornton drew on glove good night good night replied inspector allow to see to door conducted medical men out of room leaving prelice alone with still dazed friend shepworth be not so dazed a pretended to be for moment door be closed sprang to foot dorry dorry gasped swaying knife look for knife then dropped back again in chair too weak to stand what do mean demanded prelice sharply much puzzled shepworth clutched did not tell stuttered hurriedly must not have done to tell listen dorry agstone came back again alone alone tell before brought lady be still conscious although unable to move in way held knife in hand jade handled paper cutter with sir oliver be murdered have a know be concealed in desk in study agstone must have found agstone must have used agstone be dead forgot someone must have used to kill agstone oh head head grasped hair rocked to fro then with effort look for knife under table perhaps under before must end sentence prelice realising importance sprang forward lifted corner of tablecloth trailed on ground at same instant inspector bruge appeared again unexpectedly keen eye immediately fixed on prelice what be doing lord asked imperatively making search retorted other bluffly did not know what else to say hoped that ready natural explanation must lull newly aroused suspicion entertained by officer did to certain extent must allow to do lord think have better take mr shepworth to bed may a well cover thing until be taken away added bruge gathering up fold of tablecloth to lay over stark dead creature staring at ceiling shepworth moved at same moment a bruge prelice guessing that wished to interfere held down with iron grasp when lifted cloth exposed bare leg of table young men caught sight of object lying underneath bruge stepping back espied also with trained faculty of instant observation stooped to pick up jade handled paper cutter lay just where foot of dead man have rested before body have be shifted on to table wonder be that have not be discovered before then have be concealed by drooping cloth weapon with crime have be committed murmured bruge in complacent tone after stabbing victim assassin must have allowed knife to fall under table perhaps threw there intentionally jade handle h be look like dagger too eastern dagger where have seen where inspector fell into brown study turning twisting paper cutter slowly prelice pressed shepworth shoulder to keep quiet cleared throat to answer be knife used to kill sir oliver said felt shepworth jerk body in surprised remonstrance at unnecessary frankness bruge glanced up in amazement why so be remarked wonderingly very dagger remember now that read description given of in newspaper report of inquest at hythe h be so that be how fancied have seen before balanced knife on palm of hand very good piece of description must have be to so enable to recognise glanced suspiciously at prelice how did know young man shrugged square shoulder be easily explained replied suavely went to hear case at new bailey to day a thought that friend here again pressed shepworth shoulder significantly be to speak in defence of miss chent at court heard knife described be quite simple see wonder how come to be here mused bruge nodding acquiescence to lucid explanation odd be not at rejoined prelice easily assassin of sir oliver lanwin brought here to kill agstone miss chent be in prison remonstrated inspector must not have never did in case interrupted shepworth faintly rousing sufficiently to defend promised wife be innocent be natural that must say so remarked bruge with polite scepticism then added significantly did expect agstone shepworth eyebrow went up wearily why must have expected witness for prosecution to call upon have told happened until entirely lost sens first saw of agstone be when crawled from under table then smoke have rendered not unconscious unable to speak move can smoke mention do speak from experience mr inspector miss chent if remember told same story oh see that two crime be connected said bruge hastily circumstance be same a regard mysterious smoke curious power say added turning to prelice say lord that assassin of sir brought knife to kill agstone yet see waved hand towards corpse that agstone be victim quite so may have brought knife for then imply that agstone murdered master imply nothing retorted young man restively knife must not have got here unless someone brought a be missing from lanwin grange library only murderer who used must have possessed moreover prelice pressed shepworth shoulder to make particularly note next sentence moreover mr shepworth saw knife in agstone hand bruge wheeled swiftly towards barrister did not say that not when doctor be in room said shepworth languidly be only beginning to recover sens remember told lord prelice that agstone after left room returned looked in to see if be insensible suppose before brought in lady then have knife in hand what do infer asked bruge pointedly there can only be one inference drawn said prelice before shepworth must speak agstone must have have knife in pocket then agstone must have murdered sir oliver said bruge triumphantly shepworth shrugged shoulder staggered to foot feel too dizzy to give opinion said leaning heavily on friend know that agstone be devoted to sir oliver why must have murdered besides accuses miss chent naturally cried inspector who followed eagerly scent of red herring prelice have drawn across trail if agstone be guilty naturally must throw blame on person if be possessed of knife must be guilty be missed from grange library reappears here masked lady might have brought suggested shepworth bruge extremely pleased with own theory shook head sapiently mr shepworth saw knife in agstone hand before became insensible can swear to that asked barrister yes said shepworth truthfully can swear to can swear that masked woman killed agstone ca say that when waved bronze cup before became entirely insensible inspector looked more knowing than ever of course said in complacent way did not wish to see stabbing agstone why must have stabbed ca say until know lady did recognise be masked cloaked green domino think said green mask supplemented shepworth must have be at mr rover ball mused bruge not necessarily interpolated prelice a many people masked cloaked be ascending descending stair may have taken advantage of ball to get into flat unobserved quite so assented inspector who admitted agstone must have done said shepworth probably who admitted agstone barrister shook head ca say replied in tired tone heard noise three heavy blow struck in room a told when seated in drawing room did not know that anyone be in flat what time did servant go to assist at ball shortly before nine o'clock when dinner be over have dinner then oh yes came from court worn out slept for long time then have light dinner agstone must not have be at table then under mean think not said barrister slowly be not large table a see must either have heard must have felt with foot servant may have left outer door ajar shepworth nodded perhaps can question after dining returned to drawing room before nine o'clock did not re enter room until came to see what three heavy blow meant did not must have be struck to make enter room think so mr inspector agstone wished to be smothered with smoke be why bronze cup be smoking on table where be bronze cup bruge looked about ca say last saw when lady waved under nose inspector meditated be queer case altogether mused undoubtedly be connected with lanwin murder mused again then looked up abruptly believe that second murder will exonerate miss chent said quietly hope so rejoined shepworth walking towards door heavily still leaning on prelice shoulder if be condemned for murdering uncle must certainly be arrested tried for murdering agstone have reason to kill since on evidence hang fate of miss chent may a well speak in past tense mr shepworth seeing that man be dead for part believe that agstone murdered master be ready to throw blame on miss chent so a to save own skin only assassin of sir oliver must have be possessed of knife be to consider arrested demanded barrister rejoined bruge promptly held open door of course must keep eye on added smiling ambiguously shepworth nodded languidly went out with friend come into study prelice said almost in whisper knife hush prelice gripped barrister arm hard quite understood what shepworth wished to so loud need not have be so cautious for door of dining room have be closed by bruge who be now probably searching clothes of dead man for more evidence two young men went into study be at end of passage there found that desk have be forced open be three drawer on side six in in most dexterous manner agstone have apparently come provided with house breaking tool so a to gain possession of dagger how did know have asked shepworth perplexed daresay be watching through grange window saw take from miss chent suggested prelice shepworth nodded let put room tidy said hurriedly closing door want police to fuss about here room really be untidy for in searching for knife agstone have scattered loose paper lying on desk over carpet young man collected placed in order then shepworth closed drawer of desk carefully in few minute after replacing chair have be kicked over smoothing rug have be rucked up study looked quite in order nevertheless shepworth stared anxiously at now innocent looking desk hope police will not examine said nervously think so since have explained so much ned attention will be confined to dining room wherein murder took place will go to bed shepworth sat at desk want examined let sit here have strong coffee prelice shook head advised better let steal to bedroom say nothing about having be here if police examine desk can pretend ignorance express surprise on other hand if bruge come in make discovery while be here will naturally demand why kept silence inquiry must lead to difficulty leave thing to chance shepworth agreed with reasoning since be useless even dangerous to create difficulty at present juncture two walked silently to bedroom here barrister stripped to put on dressing gown then lying down outside bed placed hand behind head stared at ceiling while prelice lounged in armchair close at hand why did tell bruge about second entrance of agstone with dagger asked shepworth suddenly because have already seen dagger rejoined prelice promptly be a well to tell truth when possible just a well that inspector must think agstone who can not now contradict brought dagger heard what said about agstone possible guilt frankness will probably save miss chent a murder of sir oliver will be attributed to agstone because possessed that paper cutter shepworth groaned if bruge knew that took from mona then there must be serious trouble let thing remain a be ned know that miss chent be innocent must save know that agstone be guilty certainly be not on reasoning of bruge seeing that know agstone did not bring dagger here man be dead if can be made to act a scapegoat for innocent woman so much better barrister sighed be environed by difficulty murmured then added significantly unexpectedly jadby called to see evening what prelice be startled thought that have quarrelled so have so did with fist too when be reading in drawing room thinking of poor girl shut up in prison heard ring at front door servant have gone to ball a know so have to open door captain jadby be there after stiff greeting asked for interview took into drawing room one moment did close outer door of course why do ask fancied that might have unconsciously left open agstone might then have entered to conceal said shepworth decisively be certain that closed with jadby went to drawing room there frankly expressed regret that have quarrelled wished to make up to join force with to save poor mona because love quite so make secret of fact that be madly in love with mona hand to hand fight at lanwin grange rose solely from fact that must insist upon forcing attention on appealed to a lover so tackled jadby knocked down however seemed to be sorry that have behaved like bounder so shook hand then sat down to consider how must act with regard to mona position h be prelice looked sceptical from glimpse caught of jadby must not think be sort of man to forgive punch in eye much le loss of girl love might have come here with intention of trapping might have admitted agstone replied shepworth quickly be with time opened outer door to admit closed when departed a be under eye while in flat have chance of admitting agstone secretly know how man managed to enter conceal under table jadby have nothing to do with added barrister decisively jadby told that be a ignorant a everyone else of agstone whereabouts oh blighter like jadby must say anything shepworth protested think have judged jadby wrongly dear ned be altogether too good for wicked world trust jadby for one instant play for own hand know doe admits that intends to claim estate of sir oliver that love mona swears that will take step until be set free then can marry if chooses prelice laughed ironically believe seemed to be in earnest about setting miss chent free oh yes be sure of intends to marry may be sure jadby be very philanthropic how doe propose to save miss chent by finding agstone sending out of kingdom agstone appears shortly after proposal h be h be h be must have personal interview with captain jadby ask ask what if have ever visited easter island what on earth do mean demanded shepworth curiously lord prelice refused to explain further chapter ix dr horace next day everyone from man in street to lady in drawing room be talking about murder at alexander mansion a rule in society talk very little about such horror on occasion people more le fashionable felt that crime have be committed so to speak on very doorstep mr rover ball have be broken up by discovery of crime many of guest crowding down to shepworth flat have seen murdered man for first time in frivolous life wonder tragedy made sensation moreover second crime in london be connected one knew exactly how with first crime at lanwin grange hythe sir oliver have be murdered by niece who be now being tried for offence victim have be baronet prisoner be well known figure in social world now missing witness upon whose evidence be supposed to hinge condemnation acquittal of miss chent have be violently done away with hinted gossip in spite of appearance barrister to whom flat belonged must have killed man so that damaging evidence might be finally suppressed thus two crime have much to do with society a whole newspaper placard informed lower order of tragedy in high life stump orator in hyde park chose placard moment to talk of decay of upper class of need of revolution to sweep away tyrant born in social purple finally there be thing interested fashionable folk many guest at masked ball have be robbed of valuable jewellery police be entirely at loss to trace thief undoubtedly what mr simon haken have prophesied jokingly to host have come cruelly true swell mobsmen light fingered lady have taken advantage of use of mask at ball to mingle with legitimate guest appropriate gem gold of great value bracelet ear ring chain brooch even ring many of have vanished scarcely single woman have escaped rapacity of unknown thief in be sufficient to make mr dolly rover entertainment notorious that terrible murder must cap climax of such roguery be almost too much for belief next day journal sold like hot cake one topic of conversation with high low have to do with astounding criminality lord prelice returned to room in moon street just a dawn broke over astonished indignant mayfair threw on bed to recuperate tough a be with travel adventure needed sleep very badly after exciting event of dark hour a dropped off into slumber struck forcibly that time of superabundant leisure have gone by for ever formerly idler who took comparatively little interest in life certainly none in doings of other people found committed through friendship to strenuous career ever since lady sophia visit on previous morning have gradually become entangled in other life until crooked way of have be made straight saw chance of reverting to happy go lucky existence prelice having high ideal of friendship resolved to help shepworth through miss mona chent with brain power physical power social power at command opportunity of doing so be not unpleasing to active minded man who have hitherto fritted away intelligence in butterfly pursuit woke at noon to receive telegram man brought in with apology for disturbing proved to be from shepworth contained amazing news that barrister have be arrested for murder considering that inspector bruge have assured shepworth in prelice presence that there be chance of suspicion being cast upon in way young man have to read wire twice thrice before must fully grasp sinister significance seemed absurd dozen of people including bruge two medical men have seen insensible form of accused man be content at time that must not raise hand much le execute crime needed clear headedness strength be more ridiculous to arrest shepworth because barrister have given plain account of what have happened so far a remembered be similar in most respect to what have taken place at hythe of course prelice recollected way in ned have concealed true story of knife be impossible that shepworth now quite in possession of wit must have told unnecessary truth if have prelice believed that must be arrested also a accessory after fact thought made uncomfortable until brushed away ned be not exactly idiot on plea have be arrested certainly must not have to do with story of knife be necessary to learn what have taken place also to bail ned out so that might work together to elucidate mystery must be difficult considering charge be one of murder prelice indulged in cold bath to freshen physical power after dressing rapidly took hansom back to alexander mansion here be confronted at door by same burly police constable who have prevented shepworth servant from re entering master flat hour before treated lord prelice in same way ca come in lord inspector order wish to see mr shepworth argued prelice vexedly be against order lord be within lord be allowed to see anyone will take note in from lord ca do can see inspector bruge be at police station lord prelice stamped with vexation at obstacle placed in way did best to argue official machine into something resembling reasonable humanity without success shepworth learned be to be taken to prison later in day constable hinted that since charge be so serious there must be chance of barrister being let out on bail there be other course open to see inspector bruge so prelice drove to kensington police station only to find that man wished to see have gone to scotland yard presumably about case apparently there be nothing to be done at moment in connection with new trouble so prelice be half minded to repair to new bailey listen to further progress of charge against miss chent now that agstone be dead did not think that must be convicted also repetition of circumstance of hythe crime in alexander mansion must assuredly strengthen position since jury must now be compelled to believe story of stupefying smoke formerly have be regarded a absurd be when thought of smoke entered mind that prelice recollected that dr horace lived in neighbourhood therefore walked to rutland square asked at number twenty for former fellow traveller chance stood young man friend for doctor be within saw at once be unexpected pleasure prelice said doctor beaming thought be in west indie returned only few day ago be busy friend be always busy horace indicated case of beetle butterfly with be dealing when guest entered room be large one with two broad window looking out onto quiet square available space be taken up with record of doctor travel floor be carpeted with wild beast skin for horace be noted hunter wall be decorated with polynesian war club with zulu assegaies with redskin wampum belt beaded moccasin also there be japanese god chinese jar of grotesquely decorated porcelain hindoo sword persian tile reft from mosque african canoe paddle rudely carved a horace never allowed servant to meddle with treasure room be extremely untidy dusty generally neglected with exception of gigantic dining table of mahogany two chair there be civilised furniture yet place be so crammed with barbaric curiosity that prelice must scarcely find clear place to stand in finally stumbled through narrow passage of egyptian mummy gigantic maori idol to uncomfortable cane chair near window here sat down looked at host with disgust why dickens ca live like civilised being when be in london asked lighting cigar to dispel frowsy smell of room be perfectly comfortable said horace clearing place on table to sit on be home live here camp here think never saw such messy place in life huh grunted doctor filling german pipe with strong tobacco must come here in bond street kit well what be be longing to be on trail again be on sort of trail certainly admitted prelice slowly inspecting ash of cigar manhunt ah eye light up at that bloodthirsty old pagan manhunt repeated horace meditatively in london slow business well know horace be one requiring great deal of subtility have come for assistance huh said doctor again nodded be with prelice reflected for few moment before beginning explanation of errand did not know how much to tell how much to withhold horace saw hesitation ascribed to right cause must know everything prelice said quickly else assist have notion of working in dark failing through ignorance can read thought a usual see commented visitor more of clairvoyant business expect well have case to lay before will tax occult power to utmost fire away said horace placing hand on table rocked to fro looking absurdly like monkey missing link called in wild certainly name be deserved horace be small man with long body short leg lengthy arm very powerfully built very shaggy in appearance prelice looked at doctor large head covered with tangled red hair at beard moustache of same hue untrimmed untidy concealing nearly flat face at big horn rimmed spectacle hid brightest keenest of blue eye wore old pair of flannel trouser still older flannel shirt sleeve of be turned up over two hairy wrist encircled with matabele wire bracelet to complete barbaric look large ear furry a of faun be adorned with gold ring more quaint more extraordinary figure be not to be met with outside freak museum dr horace must have be exhibited in one if only on account of beautifully executed tattooing prelice must see on sunburnt arm on chest through unbuttoned shirt one must have taken man monkey to be clever learned scholar with heart of gold fund of knowledge second to none prelice knew esteemed have fought with for doctor be obstinate beside in naked land at back of beyond when held life in hand same being fastidious sincerely wished that when doctor returned to civilisation must leave behind in wilderness uncouth manner shabby dress general appearance of being prehistoric man of lady sophia favourite stone age go on go on said horace impatiently keep waiting have lot to do ca waste time have lot to do in way of dress think come have turkish bath visit nearest barber then can take to tailor to be clothed properly horace interrupted characteristically by throwing pipe at young man be deftly fielded returned do remember easter island asked prelice when doctor be again smoking then in reply to consenting grunt see do sacred herb eh horace scowled how do come into matter growled into what matter queried other oliver lanwin murder be in paper quite so why must remark about sacred herb make think that referred to lanwin murder be there need of explanation asked horace coolly if did guess a did that sacred herb be used to make smoke why do talk of matter at then think that herb course course growled horace beginning to rock again lanwin haunted south sea knew there must have got herb from easter island a be only place grows in when read girl yarn of smoke guessed straight off that lanwin have be trying to induce trance with burning herb do think that miss chent murdered no library be filled with smoke of herb anyone not used to fume must go down like shot a did then believe miss chent story asked prelice eagerly horace nodded must not have made up such clever yarn then why in heaven name questioned young man rising did not volunteer evidence to save will save assuredly everyone regard story of being stupefied with smoke a absurd if tell what saw on easter island in front of statue tell intend to be going to court now said prelice with emphasis be coming with horace knocked ash out of pipe why must demanded with stolid air be long story retorted prelice restlessly can give ten minute talk through hat knowing man visitor did not waste time bluntly detailed how came to be drawn into lanwin murder case naturally suppressed feeling for beautiful prisoner put down interest with emphasis to pure friendship for shepworth on reaching end of hythe portion of story paused to draw breath be that asked horace grimly first part only replied prelice promptly narrated event of previous night from time went to mr rover bal masqu to time left kensington police station to call upon listener during latter part of history dr horace became restless wandered about untidy room stumbling over obstacle softly swearing with wonderful command of language appeared to be inattentive in reality have not lost single word when prelice stopped came to halt before young man will go with to court declared first thing to do be to save girl after can consider how to get shepworth out of difficulty be innocent of course observed prelice trying to read rugged face of new ally never said be grumbled doctor then reflected for few moment raking long beard with out spread finger see here burst out finally will allow to engineer business will only be too glad be going to use occult method need to have own idea having read newspaper then think that agstone murdered lanwin more than think shepworth murdered agstone on own showing barrister friend brought knife to flat be on false evidence of knife shepworth supplied that inspector bruge seems to judge agstone still oh talk poppy cock interrupted little man impatiently be not polite horace be ever polite demanded other scornfully to do justice be always consistently rude then why expect impossible retorted horace again stumbled about crowded room swearing softly when again abreast of prelice who be sorely puzzled by strange conduct doctor thrust out large hairy paw shake said brusquely prelice did so promptly inquired why because be giving pleasure in allowing to help friend looked at odd creature perplexedly understand what mean declared frowning never mind returned horace with chuckle when be necessary for to understand will straighten out thing then have theory have more than have certain knowledge of what in heaven name high cockalorum snip snap snorum be jocular enigmatic reply come to bedroom can chatter while dress well said prelice a sauntered after friend be glad that be not going in rigout be fifth of november silly as snapped traveller get dressed up doll to help right come to toy shop help to choose one dr horace began to laugh why ca talk sense growled will do so if will set example very good have of sacred herb here will take to new bailey give judge jury counsel practical illustration of how miss chent shepworth went into trance can if like by way did give portion of herb away horace doctor who be plunging hairy face in water gurgled grumbled made reply prelice be nettled why ca be plain with confound right horace began to dry face vigorously believe that miss chent be guilty that shepworth killed agstone knew that before said prelice dryly tell nothing new oh retorted horace mockingly want to hear something new like athenian of st paul period very good do know why take so deep interest in case unless be to help ned care red cent about ned care trifle about agstone poor devil prelice sat up straight stared in heaven name why because said dr horace slowly looking at prelice puzzled face in glass because steve agstone be brother chapter x verdict here be surprise indeed prelice knew that dr horace have worked way up from humble position laid claim to being of gentle blood have never referred to existence of single relative young man have always believed to be alone in world now seemed that agstone be brother when prelice recollected that agstone be same hirsute red haired uncouth animal in appearance flashed across mind that brother be twin extraordinary thing be that have not noted close resemblance before since have seen agstone dead horace alive within last few hour idea of connecting common sailor with eminent scientific man have never entered mind in cab on way to new bailey horace gruffly gave companion few fact to substantiate statement prelice observed that said a little a must full name be horace agstone explained doctor bluntly a got on in life rose in world dropped last kept to first steve be elder brother by one year be son of suffolk labourer have brain of family in one way managed to cultivate same brain with result very great one see steve went to sea did not meet for year year when returned to england with old lanwin went down to suffolk to look up family parent be dead buried steve learned name address from vicar came to look up a did not hit off very well considered best to live life apart a formerly be prelice threw cigarette out of cab stared at horse in meditative way strange that must be connected with case also remarked dreamily doctor grew red looked fierce what devil do mean by have nothing to do with case brother have nothing to do with brother be born of same mother beyond be mean be seeing be dead nothing to one if chooses to kill people be killed be affair one can connect steve agstone with dr horace save vicar of burfield in suffolk unless betray not that care mark prelice learned that fable of old man as very early in life never trouble about people opinion intend to betray said prelice coldly flushing over freckled face can be brother to satan for care moreover have given confidence for confidence if know about relation to agstone know about knife evidence shepworth suppressed right right get hair off said horace gripping companion knee in painful manner be chum of wild old son of breed go back on one released prelice knee leaned back thoughtfully of course be shock for to learn of agstone death did see in morning paper have more to do than to read riff raff rubbish be first to inform well horace leaned arm on splash board calmly steve be gone to see father mother on astral plane expect will quarrel with a usual never got on together prelice suppressed smile at odd unchristian way of viewing death nodded quite understand why believe agstone to be guilty remarked after pause meaning be born fool retorted horace genially make mistake old son if steve be guilty must not defend in way be too devoted to old lanwin to murder besides doctor suddenly checked be here there son what be asked prelice alertly never mind ask question will be told lie here be at door of temple of falsehood get out prelice alighted with companion sorely puzzled to know what enigmatic remark meant that horace knew of something have to do with lanwin case be perfectly sure that something implicated late mr agstone be also certain prelice knew friend sufficiently well to be satisfied that must not explain unless appeared to needful to do so must be done be to trust blindly to rugged old sinner perhaps must be able to lead concerned in case out of labyrinth of crime certainly appeared to hold clue dr horace more brusque domineering than ever pushed way into crowded court eliciting comment reverse of complimentary of with characteristic cynicism took notice secured good place for prelice in few minute scribbled note sent to cudworth kc counsel read with puzzled air glanced at writer across crowded court whispered to usher shortly dr horace be requested to go to lawyer table be soon in deep conversation with big barrister while be taking place prelice stared at miss chent who looked weary sad a sat in dock strain of perilous position be beginning to tell upon be scarcely to be wondered at again roving eye caught sight of prelice again blushed time drawing corresponding signal from apparently nature of two be sympathetic case be rapidly drawing to close a witness for prosecution have be examined now for defence be giving evidence from solicitor at elbow young man learned that cudworth have succeeded in proving destruction of will in mona chent favour have be done by production of half burnt minutely torn scrap of paper rescued from grate in library pieced together have revealed mention of prisoner name of ten thousand year of love affection felt by testator for niece a will must not be found be certain that sir oliver have framed no new testament presumption be that burnt document be will in question despite effort other side must not prove otherwise be assuredly great point in prisoner favour a have murdered uncle must certainly not have destroyed deed made wealthy be with great surprise prelice saw shepworth placed in witness box to give evidence since have left practically imprisoned in own flat possibly inspector bruge have received instruction from scotland yard on detailing what have happened in alexander mansion to afford judge jury opportunity of seeing how similar murder of agstone master be to one shepworth be perfectly cheerful composed much more so than have be on previous day so apparently have fear that arrest must lead to conviction indeed be so clearly innocent that prelice expected must be set free after inquest proceeding on agstone body have taken place meanwhile caught friend eye smiled after smiled again encouragingly at mona shepworth evidence be to effect that miss chent loved uncle must never have harmed in way sir oliver in course of occult conversation have referred to certain herb did not give name when burned produced trance apparently when prisoner entered library to make up quarrel with sir oliver baronet have be testing herb fume have reduced miss chent to unconscious state then shepworth went on to detail own experience narrated same story a have told to prelice to two doctor to inspector bruge finally mentioned that agstone have re entered dining room before returning with masked lady holding knife a shepworth naturally be not asked if knife be concealed in desk there be need for to commit perjury must have be unwilling to do even to save girl loved while barrister be giving evidence lord prelice be called to cudworth side introduced by dr horace learned that counsel wished to appear a witness substantiate shepworth story young man be perfectly willing to do thus happened that when shepworth retired cudworth examined prelice heard from how shepworth have be found unconscious how many people including captain jadby have seen in helpless state evidence induced recall of jadby reluctantly swore that barrister be indeed unable to strike murderous blow have slain old sailor shepworth prelice have given evidence a to finding of knife under table by inspector bruge officer next appeared to say how have picked up mr blexey madame marie eppingrave two of grange servant be then called to depose that paper cutter with jade handle found in flat by bruge produced in court be same have lain on sir oliver writing table in library wherein crime have be committed thus jury indeed everyone else believed that agstone have murdered master then have brought knife up to alexander mansion presumably to kill shepworth of course question a to who have killed agstone be not touched upon final witness be dr horace dealt entirely with question of perfumed smoke alluded to by prisoner by shepworth producing grotesque brown root several stem covered with purple leaf more le withered doctor deposed that be certain plant growing in easter island nowhere else so far a knew native gave name termed sacred herb be used by priest to induce trance in spirit be supposed to leave body appear before god incarnate so to speak in gigantic statue of island belmain for prosecution did give portion of herb to sir oliver lanwin witness emphatically be acquainted with sir oliver in south sea never met in england did not get on well together be better apart belmain then how did sir oliver become possessed of herb by own showing be to be found only in easter island witness can not say how sir oliver got herb of course be sailing south sea for year probably went to easter island if did certainly must have secured portion of herb from native priest seeing that took so profound interest in occult matter belmain then think that sir oliver be experimenting with herb when prisoner entered library witness think extremely likely considering presence of white smoke tuberose perfume be exactly kind of scent given off by herb when burnt fume of herb must choke prisoner in way stated reduce to unconsciousness belmain significantly to complete unconsciousness witness think so seeing that be not accustomed to smoke of herb slight smoke must place anyone in cataleptic state merely dense smoke must take away consciousness did so apparently in case of miss chent although mr shepworth be simply cataleptic at first waving of bronze cup under nose plunged into deeper state belmain how did agstone become possessed of herb to burn in alexander mansion witness really can not tell perhaps went to easter island with master got leaf of herb might be that when taking knife away from library also secured leaf be lying on sir oliver desk belmain quickly how do know leaf be there witness coolly be only surmising if lanwin be experimenting with herb must have got out packet of leaf root expect not being used to herb be reduced either to catalepsy to unconsciousness while thus helpless be murdered belmain by steve agstone witness be not prepared to say very dryly very improper question rebuked judge belmain sat down feeling that have not scored off rugged witness before dr horace left witness box judge prompted by foreman of jury requested to burn leaf of herb at once reduce to state of catalepsy said judge with smile have to finish business know china plate be brought on horace gravely laid two three leaf of sacred herb on applying match thick curl of pungent white smoke arose like summer cloud odour of tuberose be perceptibly indicated in heavy atmosphere of court prelice who be standing near witness box so smelt perfume very strongly suddenly felt sick swiftly pushed way into fresh air be inclined to faint being susceptible to odour that good samaritan addicted to alcohol have produced flask of brandy must have become unconscious when quite restored thought how very powerful herb be when even so slight breath of smoke must muddle sens wonder that miss chent sir oliver shepworth have become unconscious when full power of burning purple leaf be poured through room prelice did not feel inclined to re enter court sat outside in vestibule smoking cigarette here be joined by captain jadby rather surprised young man a thought that sailor love for mona chent must have kept in court also prelice be surprised when jadby approached in quite friendly way with apology hope have forgiven for rudeness last night lord prelice be ingratiating remark never gave thought retorted prelice brusquely pray apologise again did so last night thank said jadby smiling over smooth feline face be glad that take in spirit by way never knew that be acquainted with dr horace prelice stared at impertinent remark very probably said stiffly then know nothing about know that went to easter island lord prelice heard of visit when went there oh said prelice alertly then visited island also have just said so rejoined jadby coolly did not bring away of herb if be what mean be not what mean said other wondering why jadby must say thing accuse of murdering sir oliver even though inherit property be thus pointed rude to get rid of smiling man before a felt same antipathy to jadby a must have done to cat one animal prelice must not endure sailor be not at annoyed if be did not show rather did smile in very satisfied way yes do inherit property remarked there be good reason why must really observed prelice considering what reason might be unwilling to ask really retorted captain still smiling of course be sorry for miss chent when marries will be well forget sir marries mr shepworth be engaged replied jadby with shrug think that will ever be married mr rover prelice interrupted imperiously what do mean by mentioning mr rover name in connection demanded flushing oh said jadby with hateful smile understood that mr shepworth be intimate friend good day before prelice must stop captain jadby have vanished amidst crowd leaving like wasp be sting behind prelice frowned recollected shepworth blush lady sophia remark now considered captain jadby hint must seem that friend be either in love with mr dolly rover be entangled in way if be case must not possibly love mona if did not prelice face grew crimson eye brightened then shook free of thought jadby be implying that shepworth be behaving dishonourably prelice must not bring to believe that such be case have known ned too long to doubt same felt that explanation must clear air concluded to ask shepworth for one a delicately a possible upon explanation must depend future movement lord prelice walked up down vestibule musing on mona on perilous position on shepworth possible entanglement with mr rover late miss constance newton on enigmatic hint of dr horace dealing with mysterious case in friendship have involved thus thinking lost note of time be only when court official came to turn on electric that became aware of passing of time glancing at watch found that be several hour since have left court determined to enter again hear speech of counsel for defence prosecution just a turned in direction of court heard cheer excited throng of people poured out in two minute prelice be in possession of news learned that mona chent have be acquitted be free chapter xi dr horace warning when london be made acquainted with verdict majority of people be satisfied that justice have be done miss chent behaviour while in dock open sympathy of grange servant occurrence of second murder so similar in respect to first evidence of horace with regard to ansthetic property of sacred herb of easter island went far to enlist public in favour of accused girl perhaps also youth brilliant beauty have something to do with loudly expressed pleasure of who read in newspaper that have be set free of course there be usual malcontent who agreed with one wrote to journal stating that verdict be wrong communication to daily telegraph insisted that miss client must have lied declaring that fell senseless while unfastening window for fresh air if have be case captain jadby must have found lying near window whereas be discovered in armchair near fire distance away supporter of late prisoner replied to by pointing out that murderer of sir oliver undoubtedly have picked up girl while be insensible placed in chair first correspondent retorted that sir oliver be dead murderer conspicuous by absence when miss chent entered library so must not have shifted from floor on to chair to defending writer wrote that there be proof of sir oliver being dead when miss chent entered a be apparent that fume of herb have drugged into insensibility therefore murderer must have entered later to kill baronet remove niece from place where fell by own showing to chair in be discovered by captain jadby so war of letter writing went on although mona be free from danger of hanging character be still stained in opinion of people with blood of uncle prelice be furious when read correspondence on face of did not see how must defend mona since have evidence to bring forward in favour on testimony of knife be generally considered that agstone have murdered master then have come to alexander mansion to kill barrister of course shepworth friend knowing true story of how knife came into agstone possession be by mean certain that old sailor be guilty mystery of sir oliver death be no longer one to public a everyone have be misled by suppression of evidence dealing with knife continued to be one to who have suppressed that same evidence of one thing lord prelice be certain namely that mona character must have to be completely cleared by discovery of real criminal with idea in mind went next day to alexander mansion learned somewhat to surprise that shepworth be within inspector bruge informed of at chance meeting on stair affably told constable guarding door of number forty that lord prelice be to be admitted to see prisoner not that be prisoner said bruge nodding be merely detaining mr shepworth until inquest be held on body of agstone when doe inquest take place asked prelice lingering to ask necessary question to morrow at three o'clock in afternoon at greyhound hotel kensington beyond fact that jury will bring in verdict of wilful murder against person person unknown think that police be lord can give evidence to indicate assassin of agstone then why accuse mr shepworth accuse if why arrest be best to be on safe side said bruge dryly notwithstanding what mr shepworth may have written to lord arrest have not taken place be merely detained pending inquest under suspicion flashed out prelice loyally inspector shrugged square shoulder if like to put in way said indifferently be absurd to suspect mr shepworth cried prelice excitedly many people saw insensible in same way that miss chent be insensible if be guiltless competent jury have acquitted mr shepworth also must be innocent evidence of dr horace quite so lord interrupted bruge with rather bored air will be discussed at inquest need not enter into now considering have insufficient premise to go upon if anyone murdered agstone certainly did since man can stab in back must have be lady seen by mr shepworth finished prelice hum might have be hallucination moon may be made of cream cheese retorted prelice heatedly may be assented bruge gravely know reason to contrary lord talk lead to nothing be very busy go in see friend will find dr horace with dr horace echoed young man staring inspector bruge nodded so may guess that when thus permitted to see friend mr shepworth be not legitimate prisoner by way added bruge formally a took leave be delighted that miss chent have be acquitted of course be innocent entirely innocent in opinion very beautiful also mr shepworth be lucky man lord good day inspector descended stair leaving prelice somewhat puzzled young man must not quite determine whether bruge believed shepworth to be innocent guilty at one time said one thing again hinted at however be useless to ponder over enigma so prelice entered flat after word two with uniformed cerberus who guarded door be conducted by somewhat pale parlour maid to library here found dr horace looking more uncivilised than ever in deep conversation with ned latter sprang up when friend entered shepworth have lost of ruddy colour eye have dark circle under otherwise appeared to be quite composed not at like man accused of serious crime in spite of bruge protestation prelice believed that inspector did so accuse mentally at event be just in time prelice cried shepworth grasping new comer hand warmly in addition to mystery of murder have to solve in person of friend here there be mystery about said horace gruffly merely advise to leave matter a stand prelice looked a astonished a shepworth say cried wanted to take hand in game horace have taken hand retorted doctor coolly have won aim be to save miss chent from being unjustly convicted for whomsoever murdered lanwin be convinced that be innocent a be now free prevailing opinion seems to be that agstone be guilty why stir up muddy water waken sleeping dog forget said shepworth rather tartly have to be cleared bruge say that be innocent fact that have practically arrested prof that think contrary horace who be smoking ungainly german pipe shook shaggy head vigorously when inquest take place will be discharged without stain on character that being case advice to be speedy marriage with miss chent who be also free bother head further about two murder when horace mentioned marriage with mona so pointedly prelice darted side glance at chum bearing in mind hint of captain jadby lady sophia a expected shepworth coloured looked confused at present be not rich enough to marry mona said in halting way by burning of will loses property horace chuckled silently go to captain jadby earlier will come into force now that latter one have be destroyed in case observed horace complacently puffing at pipe must advise to marry captain jadby shepworth still looking uneasy went to stare out of window be prelice who replied be hanged if will do why not inquired doctor with keen glance jadby have money by shepworth showing be bad looking love devotedly also be sir oliver wish jadby cattish ruffian cried prelice warmly with sudden access of colour know where come from from south sea old son who be continued prelice impetuously must be shame so delightful girl must marry shady buccaneer ned be engaged to miss chent why speak there be nothing to say replied barrister somewhat coldly if miss chent will take pauper a be will only be too charmed to make wife prelice raised eyebrow conviction be forcing upon ned have real love for girl if be case why have become engaged to why have so vigorously defended of late then there be mr dolly rover prelice knew nothing about mysterious lady a have not seen since returning to london have mind then there to demand explanation from ned presence of dr horace restrained with afterthought of wisdom determined to interview mr rover before coming to understanding with barrister a be therefore unnecessary to pursue subject a already horace be asking mutely why must take such interest in engaged young lady prelice changed subject by attack on doctor ca understand why must wish to abandon search into case when be so keen yesterday to run show on own horace quite understood slang of concluding remark merely quoted proverb about letting sleeping dog lie said coolly why be afraid for certain person questioned prelice meaning agstone listener relationship with agstone oh retorted doctor quite aware of what prelice be referring to person hint at be dead everyone belief guilty of first murder doe matter who killed a shepworth here be sure to be acquitted care damn one way other a will respect confidence what confidence asked barrister suddenly one made to prelice here said doctor dryly then heaving up squat figure from armchair waddled towards door there paused addressed to prelice if go on prying into matter said with uplifted finger will be very very sorry son what do mean gammon spinach said horace again enigmatic hurled out of room still smoking unwieldy pipe two young men stared at one be mad asked shepworth mad like hamlet south sou'west rejoined other in vexed tone unless be in league with jadby bounder whom knew in south sea know what mean by backing out surely suspect jadby asked ned startled why not be at mr rover ball nonsense doe know remember jewel robbery said prelice dryly great number of people unknown to host hostess be at ball jadby shepworth bit finger perplexedly ca suspect came saw then went away be woman whom agstone brought in must have killed agstone prelice shrugged shoulder sauntered about room perhaps remarked carelessly sauntering about room certainly have reason to suspect jadby save that be at ball how do know be one of crowd rushed in to see insensible wore domino mask a did rest of then how did spot unmasked that show innocence declared shepworth quickly for if have come to ball to slip down murder agstone must not have revealed hum hum perhaps not prelice threw into chair however will keep eye on jadby then be still searching into case into case corrected other lighting cigar want to learn who killed lanwin who murdered agstone out of friendship for cried shepworth grasping chum hand be brick dorry prelice returned grasp blushed trifle knew that love for mona prompted desire to search a much a friendship for man before if must only understand shepworth attitude towards girl towards mr rover again be on tip of tongue to ask leading question suppressed desire kept to earlier resolution to see lady in flat overhead by way said prelice carelessly have seen miss chent no answered shepworth rather ruefully wish must have seen bruge hurried away from court to keep a kind of state prisoner here however mona wrote short note thanking for have done said that be going down to lanwin grange if belongs to jadby will be proved yet interrupted barrister quickly until be mr martaban think mona must stop at grange mr martaban late sir oliver lawyer kind clever old chap have taken mona down to

meanwhile dorry must do great favour prelice raised eye what be go down at once to hythe see mona know said prelice taken aback although face grew hot heart bounded at idea of meeting adorable girl with whom now knew to be in love will give card of introduction tell be right will be down a soon a can right assented prelice feeling guilty joy in thus yielding to delightful temptation case can look after until inquest be over then when have seen mona future be settled by martaban living income mean can look into matter be a keen a be to get at truth of two murder dorry can dispense with horace wish knew exactly why backed out muttered prelice thoughtfully be so unlike horace to jib perhaps have something to do with matter seeing that possessed sacred herb said shepworth jocularly nonsense horace must kill one man dozen men in fair fight be not chap to stick anyone in back by way tell one thing ned lady who came in with agstone waved cup under nose to make insensible wore green mask said yes green domino also prelice nodded did catch glimpse of frock by chance did sens fail did not fail too quickly did see frock be white dress with thin line of red running horizontally

asked shepworth doubtfully of course do otherwise why must be scented with perfume of sacred herb have to do with crime shepworth shook head unable to answer question chapter xii mr dolly rover shortly after reference to unknown lady lord prelice took hasty leave there be nothing more to be said a matter up to date have be threshed out thoroughly between until inquest have be held on body of agstone shepworth immediate future be decided move must be made towards elucidating mystery moreover prelice be mortally afraid lest shepworth must alter mind about making ambassador to miss chent at hythe strong willed a young man be when chose to exercise same will must not deny pleasure of being in mona company if only for ten minute besides very much wished to learn if truly loved ned for by time felt sure that ned have very deep affection for in hurry to catch train to hythe prelice quite forgot determination to see mr rover learn how matter stood between barrister power direct action of

finding that feminine persistence must hing in face of official barrier turned away biting lip come upstairs dorry said beginning to ascend can hing with fool prelice smiled at parthian arrow slipped florin into constable hand to pacify for parting insult then ran up after lady reached on next landing ought to be pleased constance said slyly have have last word must like to have have last half

green mask domino mr rover stiffened with white dress streaked with line of red velvet why do laugh asked for mr rover be trying to suppress mirth why cried shaking with merriment because wore that dress mask domino prelice looked horrified yes why do look at like that prelice backed to door in silent horror must not trust to speak finally disappeared leaving mr rover petrified with amazement perhaps with dread chapter xiii lanwin grange in exercise of profession legitimate detective must have waited to question mr rover since have said so much must have forced to say in order to get at truth a speedily a possible lord prelice be new to business emotion be not entirely under control on leaving alexander mansion felt that be in possession of most dangerous perilous secret publication of must cause even greater sensation than produced by crime shock of learning that mr rover be woman who have be brought by agstone into number forty be very great quite confused prelice usually strong brain did not dare to call again on shepworth lest must say too much will be seen that prelice being untrained detective jumped somewhat hastily to conclusion mr rover have admitted that wore dress mask domino shepworth have seen on unknown lady constance did not know that ned have so described appearance if have must probably not have admitted that have assumed costume at bal masque mere fact that even in ignorance of shepworth description have a saying go given away must have proved to lord prelice that must not be guilty have mr rover entered number forty in agstone company have struck blow assuredly must not have incriminated so unthinkingly rather must have denied that frock mentioned by prelice belonged to after first shock while prelice be in train going to hythe began to revise earlier opinion on above mentioned ground common sense came to aid told that if guilty mr rover must not have confessed even to half truth certainly have not done so maid knowing what dress mistress wore at ball might have blurted out secret then so far a world knew inquiry must have be made about wearer of especial frock of course assuming that in thoughtless moment mr rover have foolishly confessed truth prelice must find motive for behaviour in committing crime might be that agstone wished to kill ned mr rover to save life of man loved have struck down sailor unawares having committed deed must easily slip back to own flat mingle with masked crowd then again a prelice further argued while train drew near to coast mr rover must have known that in murdering agstone be not only securing freedom of mona chent whom hated also be placing lover in dangerous position agstone be necessary witness for prosecution whom shepworth of men did not wish to see placed in box so supposition must be be man found dead in number forty shepworth have killed to save mona chent a matter of fact be exactly what have taken place in saving ned from sailor knife mr rover always presuming that be guilty have simply condemned lover to death on scaffold that prelice have be clever enough to admit crowd of guest so that might see barrister helpless position be certain that man must have be arrested probably sentenced to death since must have be extraordinarily difficult for to clear character in face of circumstance therefore on assumption for be more prelice after much reflection decided that mr rover be innocent finally young man recollected that woman dressed a described by ned in costume mr rover confessed to wearing have passed down stair while be waiting for entrance to number forty immediately before discovery of crime must scarcely have be mr rover for a lady must have easily proved alibi by returning to guest casually unmasking at right moment must have be useless for to leave mansion of course lady whether mr rover stranger certainly might have followed prelice down to door knowing that must be certain to discover tragedy might merely have descended to return to ballroom overhead when young man entered shepworth flat then again person in question must not have known that prelice masked unknown be going to enter number forty so there must be reason to track there to conclude murderess if woman be guilty must have known shepworth being in cataleptic state must have seen remembered very peculiar frock on whole prelice arrived at certain conclusion by mean inimical to mr rover by time alighted at hythe station believed that constance be innocent for four reason firstly if guilty must not have confessed to wearing dress since confession must necessarily lead to detection secondly by killing agstone must not only have placed shepworth in dangerous position by getting rid of inconvenient witness must have enabled mona to escape possible condemnation thirdly must not have followed unknown man a prelice be by reason of mask domino down stair with intention of seeing what took place fourthly lastly must not have sought safety in incriminating flight a similarly dressed woman on stair apparently have when must have be much safer in own ballroom amongst own guest only by such course must have provided alibi mr rover in spite of startling admission be innocent sole conclusion that prelice must arrive at be existence of double outwardly at event remembered extraordinary ubiquity of green domino in red streaked white dress decided very naturally that there be woman in field what woman possessed motive sufficiently strong to urge to murder agstone a prelice felt quite worn out with arguing in mr rover defence decided to leave answering of new question to portentous moment when further evidence might reveal identity of unknown lady meanwhile on arriving at hythe rested at quiet hotel soothed troubled brain with hour necessary sleep later on after invigorating bath excellent dinner started to walk towards lanwin grange be summer romance be in air at least prelice scented presence by sixth sense be going to see girl loved girl with whom have not a yet exchanged single word therefore although past peacock age be particularly attentive to appearance when assuming evening clothes a strolled inland along leafy lane through july warmth of twilight somewhat premature wooer looked a comely well groomed swain a damsel not demanding apollo must desire be great proof of prelice infatuation that in looking forward to meeting mona almost forgot that be merely emissary of man to whom girl be engaged whole position be extraordinarily queer adored girl without being personally acquainted with be affianced to best friend yet must not be certain if same best friend really loved girl even palais royal farce must offer more fantastic complication than prelice felt that after running round wild world in search of unusual have returned to find romance sitting on doorstep way to family seat of lanwins twisted inland uphill through deep lane umbrageous wood on emerging high up from belt of tree prelice found on wide unshaded road snaking over bare down for distance toiled upward then road mounted rise to slip down into cup shaped hollow brimmed with cultivated wood in midst of saw old grey house seemingly prevented from falling to piece by ivy covered mouldering wall from lip of hollow stretched rolling grassy down dotted with nibbling sheep grey in shadow of coming night be not yet night for sky be filled with luminous light pervading yet emanating from certain point breathless peace brooded over vast treeless upland even deeper peace seemed to enwrap ancient mansion appeared to be veritable palace of sleeping beauty set amidst enchanted wood prelice thrilled with idea beauty awake unkissed awaited prince in seclusion of faery castle following road here grew somewhat narrower lord prelice descended into hollow passed under shade of overhanging tree came out into kind of artificial glade smooth with carefully tended lawn brilliant with flower grange be somewhat sunken in ground entirely level with lawn looked like part of wood so clothed be with darkly green ivy there appeared weather worn escutcheon over great doorway light gleamed from oriel window in east wing to left prelice saw three tall french window opening on to wide terrace have be referred to at trial window appeared quite out of keeping with tudor architecture of mansion visitor eyed with great interest be through one of window agstone jadby have looked to see tragedy of sir oliver death have that not taken place prelice might never have be brought into contact with most charming girl in world heart beat loudly a rang bell afterwards lord prelice never must explain clearly how have first come into presence of goddess in bewildered manner waited in antique hall after delivering card to pompous footman in bewildered manner be led into long low wide drawing room with oriel at farther end brilliant with family crest in stained glass so far a must recollect did not look at cumbersome georgian furniture at aggressively modern grand piano seemed to be out of place at portrait of cavalier lady decking mellow hued wall even at painted ceiling carpet tinted with rainbow colour subdued by time to grateful sobriety have eye save for tall slim girl arrayed in white dress with somewhat pale worn face who welcomed in sweetest of voice with most grateful of smile be glad to see ned best friend said voice sounded like faery music in new comer ravished ear to thank to thank muttered prelice staring at lovely face in mellow lamplight saw in terrible court said swiftly way in looked at gave comfort other people friend call stared a though be wild animal lord prelice threw out hand with eloquent gesture full of grace ned wrote told that be friend be here to be yours also stuttered prelice suppressing wild desire to kneel worship be friend already doe not need word to confirm friendship offered accepted mutely with gratitude prelice felt more bewildered than ever here be girl so entirely unconventional that defied usage of society prescribed etiquette for primary meeting between bachelor maid be marvellously sweet to be thus greeted prelice must have revealed delighted surprise too clearly for miss chent laughed be afraid that proffer of unasked for friendship surprise said smilingly see poor uncle instructed somewhat in psychology look at inner rather than outer said miss chent that friendship be asked for in court said prelice earnestly be a ned best friend claim to be yours also bring message from ned will deliver presently said mona turning to stout white haired gentleman with genial face who be standing near window silently just now must allow to introduce mr martaban loyal friend also waved hand towards spindle legged versailles table a two men shook hand must have coffee prelice accepted gratefully a must have taken poison from hand of delightful girl so long a served a did coffee with own white hand martaban took cup also resumed seat from have arisen when prelice entered miss chent pointed out chair to visitor reclined on louis treize sofa then three began to talk on immediate earthly matter prelice be forced to descend from transcendental height in room at hour in presence of such angel seemed desperately hard to abandon romance for reality there be help for ned message questioned mona anxiously be all right will be down a soon a can get away replied emissary delivering exact word of friend then think that be in danger of being accused of second crime interposed martaban in genial authoritative voice have told before tell again that under circumstance one can accuse mr shepworth added solicitor bowing towards young man be due lord to wise action in admitting crowd to see mr shepworth insensible prelice nodded thanks ned be perfectly safe said quietly mona clasped hand with thankful gesture be so glad be so thankful whispered softly have be dear good friend in standing by when so sadly needed help oh prelice be rather indignant seeing that be something more than friend to miss chent must scarcely fail to lay life at foot be only what english gentleman must do to lady respected much le loved mona coloured turned aside face rather embarrassed by impetuous outbreak of lover friend english gentleman english lady held aloof when be in danger said simply so can understand how much prize friendship of ned of mr martaban here seeing that never believed be guilty one must believe that cried prelice still impetuous throwing usual discretion to wind moment set eye on face knew that be innocent miss chent coloured again rather retreated from confidential attitude have assumed prelice be going ahead too fast womanly nature in spite of occult training be taking alarm must say that seeing did not know belief be somewhat rash rejoined coldly however thank will allow to help asked prelice eagerly timidly help miss chent said lawyer looking keenly at young man glowing face in what way prelice laid down cup crossed leg delivered of opinion be just a well that mona martaban must learn of determination to enter into life everyone be delighted with few exception said somewhat incoherently to girl that have be acquitted insist that must be guilty forgive for inflicting pain added rapidly be necessary so that may entirely understand be safe from law miss chent with idiot character be not yet clear also ned in spite of absurdity of thing may be accused of making away with steve agstone in interest in order to set everything right be necessary for to make certain who killed uncle who killed sailor agstone killed sir oliver said martaban quickly evidence of paper cutter quite so quite so interrupted lord prelice hurriedly skating quickly over thin ice ca prove agstone guilt beyond doubt without further evidence for miss chent sake truth whatever may be must be made public what do think be truth demanded martaban puzzled prelice bearing mr rover in mind shuffled again be not prepared to give opinion off hand replied politely what wish miss chent to understand be ned shepworth have accepted service towards hunting down author author of double crime wish miss chent if will to accept also willingly with gratitude said mona extending slim hand prelice contrived to press in friendly way not kiss a felt strongly inclined to do effort be great then can go ahead said easily a be now admitted to inner circle a be must like to know exactly how matter stand about miss chent for instance do remain here girl flushed glanced rather embarrassed at lawyer yes replied latter captain jadby who undoubtedly inherits now that second will have be destroyed have made move towards assuming possession of property moreover there be certain legal formality to be gone through before can become legitimate master of grange until everything be straight suggest that miss chent remains in home be not home captain jadby answered girl colouring painfully must much rather go away added piteously yet with proud effort of self restraint have nowhere to go to uncle oliver have disinherited parent died insolvent if leave grange go into world penniless alone prelice winced at picture drew there be always ned remarked lamely miss ghent shot swift glance at distressed face answered coldly in own word yes there be always ned young man felt more puzzled than ever voice did not sound like of girl in love a have gathered from constance man mona be engaged to have not given heart if be case be beginning to appear obvious why have two agreed to marry prelice did not know what to say so miss chent seeing embarrassment explained in somewhat embarrassed fashion ned be poor remarked with deliberate self control have way to make in world must never do for to burden with pauper wife two be stronger than one miss chent there be strength in unity not in case retorted quietly dismissed subject will come to house dear said martaban who seemed to be devoted to luckless client wife will be glad to have so will aunt sophia interposed prelice quickly struck with brilliant idea know aunt miss chent lady sophia haken be friend of yours save mr martaban ned have have friend since be put on trial for murder said mona in level voice decline to trouble person until innocence be proved have be proved at trial said prelice mr martaban echoed speech legally not socially rejoined rising accept service lord prelice learn who killed uncle who stabbed poor agstone earn faltered earn gratitude prelice looked disappointed yet what else must girl say chapter xiv mr blexey opinion despite threatening cloud on horizon hinted at coming trouble day passed very quietly at grange a elderly male chaperon mr martaban remained to look after client very respectable mr blexey be also useful in necessary capacity prelice unable to tear away from too dangerous society of mona dangerous be considering feeling engagement to ned lingered at hythe hotel shepworth strange to say did not put in appearance be odd remarked prelice when strolling over lawn on third day of arrival be odd that ned doe come down put observation in form of query so mona who strolled beside be forced to reply did so unwillingly a briefly a be possible very odd said indifferently lord prelice cast puzzled side glance at beautiful face looked ethereal rosy under red sunshade even a yet must not understand what be feeling towards friend a be more in love than ever situation be perplexing from very vagueness in sheer desperation tried to make talk of ned did very rarely by continuing topic ned said young man eyeing tree lawn sky house with fine affectation of indifference ned have be acquitted at inquest jury gave verdict of wilful murder against person person unknown in orthodox style agstone have be buried here be waiting for interview with ned to settle course of action towards elucidating criminal problem yet have not come down have not even replied to letter miss chent shifted sunshade from one shoulder to other expect will come down when be ready said calmly oh jerusalem excuse swear word miss chent if be ned must have come here age ago did lord prelice if be so anxious to interview ned quite admit necessity why not go up to london companion wriggled uneasily searched brain for excuse to remain in uncomfortable paradise well see er be dear young lady be to put plainly er aunt know lady sophia be coming to folkstone arrived there last night lord prelice eh what er say so mona laughed young man be glad to hear laugh gave way rarely to merriment during undecided present why did write about to lady sophia asked girl gently prelice be quite prepared to lie decided not to when saw expression of face well see be understand that aunt be aunt never thought that be uncle course not there see aunt expected to write have written need have made subject matter of letter who said that did asked prelice growing scarlet lady sophia received note from morning considering position very kind note seems that wrote asking to stand by have come to folkstone to do so loud cheer cried prelice shamelessly always thought that aunt sophia be brick never believed be guilty know went on confusedly said manner of nice thing about to whenever met now will take under wing make thing hot for society fool dare to say word against why do do for lord prelice asked mona in rather faltering tone averting too speaking face be be well ned friend know oh mona voice became steady turned to look at squarely so enlist aunt on behalf for ned sake be there ever perplexing girl moment ago seemed pleased at being championed by lady sophia now look voice be cold prelice in sheer desperation blurted out truth in blundering manner little bit for own sake also be glad of be time be young man voice became unsteady for did not know whether be on head heel be right sentiment of honour towards absent shepworth who must not look after own interest made end thus lamely mona laughed again be a enigmatic a sphinx be extremely good of lord prelice went on in guarded manner lady sophia can help greatly to recover position in society have never lost blurted out prelice crossly did lose have lost answered sadly will never recover entirely until murderer of uncle be discovered lady sophia who really like love love like let say that have affection for be greatly to be appreciated state of mind for one woman to be in towards be rather german sentence be know what mean muttered prelice beginning to find out that after experience in four quarter of globe be neophyte where woman be concerned mean that lady sophia liking affection for will do great deal to rehabilitate that punishment of uncle oliver assassin will do more marriage with ned will do most of mona mocked marriage cover multitude of sin doe prelice clutched head hair be too closely cropped for to grip be to be best man said feebly found delight in torturing have ned selected for post did when be at eton see then be engaged when at eton how precocious young man groaned glanced at despairingly quite unable to understand mood lately have be sad now eye be dancing with merriment be glad be happy said in surly tone for mystery of engagement tortured be assented swiftly for three reason may hear certainly in first place ned will find out who killed uncle poor old steve so a to clear character in second place lady sophia be coming over to day thus begin necessary whitewashing for to re enter world in third place ended seriously throughout trouble have have firm conviction that god must help have helped by saving life from legal death will help to clear character day perhaps in near future there wo be single stain on name now speak held up hand be about to say that there be not stain now there be to remove trust in god first in second what about ned asked prelice restlessly oh in ned also rejoined looked at quietly a made observation must not out of sheer perplexity turned on louis quinze heel be going in to get ready for visit of lady sophia said abruptly prelice watched red sunshade vanish into house then dug stick into turf swore volubly have considerable command of language in respect rarely exercised vocabulary on occasion did since ordinary word failed to soothe even a be swearing did little good so prelice started to walk violently aimlessly only desirous of restoring temper to usual state of cynical calm by abnormal exercise must not make mona a called mentally out in way whatsoever be certainly engaged to ned yet spoke of quite unemotionally a must have done of well not of acquaintance perhaps of friend must not possibly love if did not must certainly not be engaged to ned have money position so assuredly must not be seeking to better by marriage certainly gratitude might induce to become wife since have stood by then here prelice swore again have be engaged to time before death of sir oliver when gratitude must possibly have entered into acceptance if be merely grateful ned must not marry on account especially since on authority of mr rover loved woman for third time prelice swore over problem determined to throw delicacy to wind so far a shepworth be concerned moment ned arrived at grange must ask plainly what meant what meant what whole infernal complication meant be quite impossible that young aristocrat with large income healthy frame loving heart must sit on thorn longer blankety blankety blank raged prelice looked up on hearing exclamation of horror at elbow aimless walk have led to kitchen garden to bed of pot herb mr blexey be laboriously picking being stout like hamlet scant of breath housekeeper wheezed like creaky wheel a stooped to gather sage thyme retained enough breath to cry out with horror when hearing handsome young gentleman swearing a afterwards described like late mr blexey who have be skipper of renown in way of bad language beg pardon said prelice showing white teeth in smile won mr blexey heart be little put out did know lady be within earshot bless lord be not lady never laid claim to be one so swearing though not proper worrit over much call back old time sir really did swear mr blexey looked indignant why belong to united inhabitant of celestial region what be religion said mr blexey simply what might call sect lord there be very few of go to heaven there be nothing like being certain of destination said prelice dryly be about to move on when housekeeper stopped pardin lord have be trying to catch eye ever since came here never managed till now in kitchen garden too ended mr blexey mournfully seem to be place for lord of high degree to speak in suited to swear in however murmured prelice frivolously then added in louder tone what do wish to speak to about not about be gone remarked mr blexey referring to lost spouse though language begging lordship pardin be a like yours a bean pod because of such talk will never come back never a have will keep indeed be whomsoever may be fond of think so lord see be well be dead lord prelice put up hand to twirl moustache hide smile then think that be sorry for blexey interrupted housekeeper firmly did belong to united inhabitant of celestial region so pointed stealthily downward let hope be not so bad a said prelice choking with suppressed laughter wish to speak to repeated politely to catch lordship eye a be have be accomplished what next mr blexey groaned made effort be about miss mona young man merriment died away looked keenly at red faced shapeless old woman what be that demanded in imperious tone formerly have used towards recalcitrant soldier mr blexey being timid dropped with thud on to sage thyme placed podgy hand on ample breast gasping like fish out of water heart lord mother side ai strong if lordship must speak le like gun going off certainly interrupted prelice in most silky tone what have to tell about miss mona ai about exactly lord there be will know madame eppingrave a called though believe be name for air grace nearly a old a a stout too for tight lacing prelice leaning against mellow brick wall where nectarine grew stared at fat woman who be still prostrate amidst herb if knew of such thing mr blexey why did explain in court because believe in court in a be in court said mr blexey fanning with pink sun bonnet got to give what called evidence say thing against dear pretty miss mona nursed sir be born in grange have served lanwins life when mr chent went away with husband followed when died came back here with miss mona a sir oliver wished to be housekeeper prelice nodded sympathetically know that be devoted to miss mona said approving of devotion be too lord ai asked old woman pointedly young man grew a red a brick wall against be leaning mr blexey seeing sign of anger went on hastily mean boldness lord indeed miss mona doe need friend sadly lord tell that be one be said prelice firmly flushing again be glad that spoke thus of about madame marie eppingrave never liked lord oily flatterer be with gimblet eye buttery tongue be always trying to get better of sir oliver gave that nasty thing made smoke prelice naturally looked startled why sir oliver brought herb from easter island at least fancy did lord what be more did went into library to ask master what 'd have for dinner madame eppingrave if be name old bag o ' rag be showing master lot of dry stem purple leaf talking about trance suchlike rubbish be just week before sir oliver death what do make of mr blexey asked prelice thoughtfully make anything of sir be strange that nasty smoky weed gave master must bring about death madame marie have reason to wish sir oliver dead oh lord why lost good friend in often must have desired to be alive kicking same sir gave withered leaf through master came by end prelice nodded absently required time to think over matter turned away to be alone then thought struck returned to housekeeper what about will demanded be burnt must be mistaken court much lawyer knew about cried mr blexey struggling to foot never said to because said a must help miss mona to get out of nasty clutch if will be proved to be burnt so said what be told for miss mona sake sir oliver be writing out will how do know asked prelice sharply much disturbed saw writing said mr blexey firmly be never signed to knowledge can take word for lord that unsigned will be burnt miss mona be entitled by other to property chapter xv jadby play card mr blexey communication certainly afforded lord prelice ample food for reflection what have said about madame marie a young man mentally termed implied that fortune teller be somehow implicated in tragedy of sir oliver death yet have be good friend to lady by death lost valuable client be impossible to think that have killed baronet have be consenting party to death undoubtedly according to mr blexey firm asseveration have given lanwin root leaf of sacred herb from using in prescribed way to induce trance sir oliver have be rendered helpless have not be chained hand foot by fume of herb must not have be killed a in spite of lost leg be despicable antagonist herb therefore be main factor in tragedy madame marie have placed same in man hand of course be just possible that someone name unknown have found sir oliver helpless so have taken opportunity to kill madame marie may have discovered guilty person to recompense for loss of wealthy friend have be bribed by same person to silence pointed to guilt of captain jadby who might have be anxious to get rid of baronet so a to enter into heritage assertion of housekeeper about new unsigned will went far to show that sailor be innocent captain jadby assuredly must have destroyed will gave property to mona not unsigned document mattered nothing to much puzzled by new aspect of case prelice sought out mr martaban related what have heard in kitchen garden solicitor at first scoffed at idea of unsigned will being destroyed later cautiously ventured remark that there might be something in though mind remarked thoughtfully mr blexey doe not prove case a say in legal circle state that sir oliver made new will in own handwriting can not prove that be particular will be burnt sir be handwriting must be recognised urged prelice be replied martaban tersely will leaving property to miss chent be in late client handwriting also always preferred to write out own testament to draw up mean not in especial instance lord will leaving to captain jadby made in south sea year ago be personal document since have seen unsigned will also be personal a so far a know sir oliver did not employ lawyer to draw drew out document by miss chent inherited sir oliver copied have signed by mr blexey agstone so see that ca actually say will be burnt a there be not sufficient remaining of document from of scrap found alluded to miss chent a bey dear niece must seem that will in favour must have be destroyed since sir oliver when angered must not have spoken kindly of in document alluded to by mr blexey prelice nodded absently presume that new will must also have be signed by mr blexey agstone a witness think so since sir oliver trusted according to housekeeper will be not witnessed for know may not even have be signed mr blexey say that be think be right said martaban thoughtfully since testator have to sign in presence of witness mr blexey must probably have be one what about captain jadby be absent on many occasion have signed a witness must not have benefited madame marie eppingrave humph martaban considered agstone might have signed certainly in case must have come forward to state to whom new will left property must not have be jadby since old will held good if second be destroyed madame marie may have be bribed by jadby to hold tongue about third will so that first must stand point to fact that second must have be destroyed yet mr blexey say that be not agree admitted prelice a say doe not prove case martaban nodded sole way in case can be proved be by production of second will of third remarked prelice quietly assassin of sir oliver burnt one will know not hold other will produce when be ready so lay open to arrest ended martaban neatly paused went on deliberately advise waiting game waiting game martaban nodded other side move first do mean captain jadby asked prelice abruptly unknown assassin who hold one of last two will jadby know retains first give property to will probably come down to insist upon right will refuse to let have grange income until other will be proved to be destroyed at least until prof that burnt will be one giving property to miss chent be proved at trial quite so mr blexey story requires that case must be reopened not for trial of miss chent cried prelice in alarm martaban laughed heartily can make easy on score lord one can be tried twice for same offence well agree with that be best to wait see what jadby doe then can checkmate a suggest meanwhile will go to london call on madame marie in new bond street may know of something likely to elucidate mystery of lanwin grange crime if doe said martaban with chuckle certainly will not speak out clever woman madame marie can deal with clever woman said prelice rather conceitedly deal with miss chent then finished lawyer conversation ended for time being be very well for martaban to suggest dealing with mona that young lady be much too feminine for prelice to tackle must make nothing of sometimes be kindness to then must hold at arm length with freezing politeness even a yet must not determine relation to ned otherwise than official engagement existed gave chance of learning exact truth when praised ned must assent cordially to most enthusiastic eulogium yet when hinted being in love must not help hinting that ned did not behave a lover must entirely agreed in desperation must have spoken to about constance rover feeling of loyalty to absent friend prevented doing once twice prelice determined to leave for london wash hand of mystery of miss chent be not least be so deeply in love awkward a position be must not tear away yet like true gentleman prelice never revealed by word deed even look that be at mona foot be with feeling of relief that prelice came one day to grange found lady sophia officially established a mona friend day long young man have be walking off feeling on down trying by violent exercise to calm agitated nerve tore along at top speed for mile cursing for fool in submitting to be lured by will o ' wisp since seeing how matter stood between mona ned must not hope to make girl lady prelice however far went loadstone of grange magnetised by miss chent mere presence always drew back to dainty foot there to sigh hopelessly for moon on occasion arrived back to afternoon tea be greeted effusively in drawing room by aunt though ca say that look well prelice said lady sophia putting up lorgnette what have be doing with late hour indigestible supper doubt ask miss chent replied prelice somewhat sulkily know what rake be mona who be presiding over well provided tea table glanced at dark circle under young man eye at lack of colour noted cross look survey for reason appeared to give large amount of satisfaction know lord prelice character observed demurely be dormouse always asleep said lady sophia sipping tea so ned told nickname also be very energetic dormouse surely in exploring world a have done humph must be much better if stayed at home married prelice must not stand observation in mona presence be entirely personal matter aunt sophia snapped not at answered lady coolly a be head of house member must have say in marriage unless marry nice girl sha' call on have more tea lord prelice said mona sorry to see how very annoyed be yet secretly pleased heaven know for what reason thank passed cup be glad to see aunt sophia surprised ended with emphasis lady sophia put up lorgnette again one be always surprised to find virtue in unexpected place remarked coolly plagiarise that from molire dear yes be virtuous coming over into wild on hot day want reward of virtue what reward do want asked prelice gruffly right to look after dear girl lady sophia patted mona arm propose that will come abroad with for few month then next year can return can present again at court never believed rubbish that people talked sweetest mona so can safely trust under wing will be delighted said mona giving elder lady arm little affectionate squeeze think ought to remain here until truth be found out silly child truth have positively be shouted from housetop everyone know that be innocent not added lady sophia in usual inconsequent fashion must blame if be guilty never liked sir oliver be very kind to said mona impetuously meant well that condemns people one doe like always mean well however be dead so will say no more about will come to germany with dear be going to bad ca tell name exactly be too long sound too much like swearing be new bad have to do with new disease have got new disease aunt sophia never be healthier in life dear boy there be cave near bad with bone skull of stone age want to see what like poor dear thing be in happy time wo look pretty a merely bone said prelice dryly perhaps not only dog like bone daresay there will be dear little ax with cut off head of animal lived before flood bead too perhaps fancy bead brings poor dear thing so near to to think wore bead while lady sophia rattled on thus talking about everyone everything to set mona at ease girl herself be listening fly said starting to foot expectantly where asked lady sophia looking up at ceiling what sharp ear must have child hark miss chent walked to drawing room door opened passed through moment later heard voice raised in joyful welcome prelice tried hard to suppress jealousy did not need lady sophia to tell that be that shepworth man same contrived to be fairly amiable when ned entered with greeting how do do lady sophia dorry be glad to see what hot day have be thank mona will be glad to have cup of tea prelice stared a ned sat down in comfortable chair near miss chent for must not understand shepworth who have so lately escaped peril chatting in silly fashion barrister did not look well either a face be pale eye sunken expected down here before growled prelice after pause must not get down rattled on ned stirring tea lump of sugar please mona there be much to do now that agstone have be buried character cleared have come down to circumvent friend captain jadby mona started nervously oh ned be there anything wrong not at present jadby will try put thing wrong will be here in quarter of hour here mona rose in dismay be sure shepworth nodded cast hasty glance at prelice came to yesterday said that be coming down to see for certain purpose a prelice be here know very well what jadby want to say thought best to come down too by watching at station found what train be going by nipped in also at hythe secured only fly so have got ahead of shepworth glanced at watch will soon be here then paused then queried lady sophia astonished bless mr shepworth what then how mysterious be surprise captain jadby will surprise more rejoined shepworth dryly so be glad that be here dorry why demanded that young gentleman who be a astonished a aunt shepworth merely nodded mysteriously whispered to mona who nodded in reply with very bright eye with glance at puzzled prelice must not understand even in presence of engaged couple if really be in love shepworth be certainly attentive mona be extremely amiable there be something wanting in behaviour have not kissed for one thing a engaged lover surely must do perhaps sign of future marriage have taken place in hall lady sophia also puzzled must have asked question more diffident nephew be afraid to put that footman brought in card captain jadby said mona reading same ned must see will be a well rejoined shepworth significantly in presence of martaban have gone out for walk wo be back for time explained girl nervously feel safe with lord prelice why with prelice asked when footman departed to usher in south sea sailor be always so kind observed in low voice cast down eye blushing scarlet much to prelice amazement really did not know what to make of be sudden colour ebbed from cheek when captain jadby entered for appeared to be rather afraid of buccaneer jadby halting bowing on threshold did look rather lawless in spite of civilised flannel garb have arrayed in white wore scarlet cummerbund scarlet tie touch of too vivid colour added to smooth dark face with fiery black eye curly black hair general hint at foreign blood bespoke buccaneer from fringe of empire manner also left something to be desired for after bowing to lady sophia miss chent greeting prelice with sullen nod turned towards shepworth then eye flashed mouth grew hard have stolen march on declared coming forward a see replied shepworth very coolly after what told yesterday be necessary wonder that be not

everyone stood still silent out of sheer amazement unexpected have happened with vengeance dr horace quite delighted with sensation that have produced rubbed hairy hand with grim chuckle quite dramatic be said horace martaban drew long breath clutched document a though feared that must vanish into thin air like macbeth witch be surprised confessed staring at doctor how did become possessed of sir in asking very pertinent question anticipated speech of others horace did not answer immediately without requesting permission produced immense german pipe already stuffed a full a must hold with strong tobacco lighted calmly prelice looked annoyed at breach of good manner must have stepped forward to remind horace that be not in native wild mona guessing intention made little gesture to stop seeing what dr horace have done be prepared to forgive everything besides great traveller be such eccentric person that one must be angry when behaved like bear seemed natural that must meanwhile lawyer becoming impatient repeated query how did become possessed of said horace lying back luxuriously puffing out white cloud of smoke well might say that murdered lanwin might yes might remarked mona smiling will not sighed horace with odd expression on large face must be anti climax oh hang dramatic instinct said prelice crossly why ca answer question be about to if will hold tongue sit down

xviii power of herb have be prelice intention to ask ned about love for constance rover before leaving grange on second thought resolved to wait until learned more concerning murder before putting shepworth in witness box nevertheless be somewhat upset to think that best friend be entangling with married woman prelice be prude have not be sir galahad same did not think that be acting rightly of course case be hard one since two truly loved one constance have be sacrificed on family altar to man who took advantage of sacrifice to play tyrant a much a dared poor woman be very unhappy be to be presumed that man who loved be unhappy also said great deal for shepworth mr rover that have not long ago defied conventionality eloped since have not gone length prelice argued that be trying to bear several burden a honourably a possible how long must such endurance last according to shepworth mona knew of love for constance since have explained same when pretended engagement be made to save girl from jadby wooing sir oliver persecution prelice in first flush of love shrank from questioning about so distasteful subject on side mona be loyally silent until ned chose to speak thus came about although prelice met friend at breakfast made remark about very private business shepworth did not volunteer explanation rather did conversation turn on unexpected appearance of lost will martaban explained future action included immediate journey to london with mr blexey who have to make affidavit a to authenticity of document under circumstance a shepworth must scarcely remain at grange when martaban housekeeper be absent arranged to go to london with by ten o'clock train prelice must fain have lingered in delicious garden with mona a knew view kept to determination however when trio drove away to hythe prelice have golden hour so to very wisely made most of be with great regret that took way to station at hythe to train be to bear mile away from goddess memory of last kiss gave cheered somewhat despondent mood way to charing cross on stepping on to platform of metropolitan station prelice shook off dream addressed to task in hand a day be fine prelice a usual felt need of exercise to tame exuberant spirit have quite recovered during journey walked to new bond street somewhere about three o'clock found reading brass plate inscribed madame marie eppingrave afterwards entered narrow dark passage to mount steep flight of stair finally came to second floor of building where fortune teller received client dark complexioned lad of fourteen dressed in white robe with blue scarf round waist received new comer informed that madame marie be engaged for ten minute so prelice therefore sat down glanced over paper lying on round table mostly dealt with occult matter up to date speedily grew tired of reading much must not understand room be small commonplace even ugly in adornment table aforesaid few cane chair old horse hair sofa completed furnishing two dingy uncurtained window overlooked bond street there be nothing of mystical about very ordinary apartment prelice concluded that madame marie certainly did not spend earnings on magical frippery in order to impress who called upon after glance round spoke to lad who be seated cross legged at door asked if be hindoo answered boy in very good english with flash of snow white teeth come from south sea indeed answered prelice in turn somewhat astonished have mistress be in south sea yes sir brought from tahiti want to go back again prelice reflected tahiti be home of captain jadby former haunt of sir oliver lanwin wondered if madame marie have met baronet there lad be not likely to know so asked question doe mistress know captain felix jadby effect on boy be somewhat strange leaped to foot muttered word in native tongue apparently be not complimentary to captain judging from savage expression of face madame doe know said at length come to see here very often like kicked must kill if be in tahiti here boy shrugged shoulder to show that english law be much too particular madame love captain want to marry went on boy apparently so carried away by hate that said more than be wise considering dependent position love here sound of inner door opening made lad aware of folly in speaking secret to stranger cringed caught prelice hand will say nothing to implored prelice assured slipped crown into hand later must tell more also dislike captain jadby will tell can to harm said boy viciously kicked struck son of chief tell added pointing with trembling hand to inner door oh soul tell for can send spirit to torment young man promised again thinking that lad in way be somewhat like caliban in fear of spirit looked upon madame marie a sort of female prospero who must have pinched black blue have little time to think about new ally who might be of assistance in undermining jadby scheme for lady fashionably dressed holding handkerchief to face emerged from inner room lad showed out prelice waited for reception silver bell sounded within boy returned to point meaningly at door laying finger on lip in token of silence prelice nodded reassuringly stepped into shrine if approach to holy of holy be commonplace shrine certainly be not prelice beheld room of great size furnished very oddly be to say be not furnished in ordinary acceptation of word ceiling be painted dull red plain carpet of same hue be spread over floor two window looking on to bond street be filled in with painted glass representing various mystical sign four wall be hung with lustreless black stuff made place look like chapel during funeral service odd thing be that red carpet be strewn with perfectly white cushion there be table chair tall pillar of black marble stood in four corner bearing glass ball on summit between window be placed bronze tripod in smoked perfumed fire what with dim religious light black wall red carpet snowy cushion of silk prelice felt somewhat dizzy theatrical parade be evidently designed to produce confusing effect unseat a much a possible reason judgment of madame dupe annoyed that must give way so easily young man pulled wit together looked at priestess who have conceived artful mise en scne madame marie clothed in long white silk robe made perfectly plain knelt japanese fashion on cushion in front of tripod with back to painted window be stout heavy looking woman of apparently great height with colourless face very large smooth with mass of snowy silvery hair tumbled down back in wave of white what figure might be prelice must not judge because of robe noted that hand be slender beautiful also ringless indeed did not wear single ornament of description kneeling perfectly motionless with closed eye looked like idol carved out of alabaster be cleverly done prelice sceptical must quite understand how majority of people yielded to carefully prepared spell of managing woman be when madame marie opened eye that prelice became aware of true secret of power over weaker mind be large blue clear looking from under white eyebrow in penetrating way fathomless a sea a mysterious prelice met mystical gaze calmly felt skin prickling will power growing weak aware that seeress be trying to hypnotise a doubtless hypnotised other client young man concentrated will to meet baffle hers for time stared at one prelice looking down from height madame marie gazing upward from cushion then woman closed eye again with somewhat annoyed expression be not weak man said in deep melodious voice like sound of mellow bell no answered prelice calmly be not sat down cross legged on cushion directly in front of sibyl then why do come to asked looking at steadily only weak person wish to know future man who be strong self willed sceptical a be need learn nothing of future lie in own hand in hand of god rather corrected prelice do know who be be lord prelice how do know might say by magic must not believe that always suit to nature of meet therefore will give commonplace explanation saw in court when gave evidence during trial of miss chent for murder prelice nodded might have guessed that do know why have come madame marie folded hand calmly before replied equally calmly have come to solve secret of murder be very clever guess rather think that can solve secret madame why must think so asked with absolute calmness gave sacred herb to sir oliver did sacred herb of easter island need not explain to since heard what dr horace said in court herb induces trance sir oliver wished to go into trance by aid therefore gave few twig why did sir oliver wish to go into trance desired to explore astral plane if understand that quite understand have studied theosophy well there be nothing more to be said rejoined madame marie with little shrug hinted at french blood went into trance while spirit be absent from body be murdered who by ca tell even with power be great be not permitted to know who killed sir oliver lanwin be karma have to bear since reaped only a sowed karma of murderer have nothing to do with therefore sight be veiled can not read truth if must added woman with emphasis must be aware if have studied occult must not be permitted to tell without permission from who rule lord of karma asked prelice wondering if be talking in earnest merely wriggling out of awkward position madame marie bowed solemnly see understand somewhat may ask to be more open with regarding purpose of visit can hardly have come to accuse of crime said prelice studying face carefully think that be innocent let leave murder alone for moment want to help paused to add effect to next word with captain felix jadby woman hand moved restlessly began to lose calmness when name be pronounced know nothing about captain jadby beyond fact that met at lanwin grange be not guilty of sir oliver death if be what mean oh dear be not what mean at rejoined prelice in most airy manner resolving to be very plain fact be that captain jadby be rival madame marie rose a though moved by spring then saw that be little tremendously dignified rival repeated marble white face became crimson with angry blood at length have managed to break through calculated calm understood miss chent be engaged to mr shepworth oh whole world know that replied prelice still airy in manner be merely official engagement to prevent jadby from worrying miss chent sir oliver be in favour of engagement with jadby for reason know reason know that felix let slip name forgetting that have disclaimed intimacy that felix be son illegitimate son said prelice with emphasis yes by daughter of chief to whom be married in native fashion lord prelice of course captain jadby have name stiffly by time remembering slip came home to look after interest wished to marry woman forgetting cried madame marie beginning to pace room that be engaged to marry woman lord prelice remembering what native boy have said prelice expressed surprise rapidly resolved to work on jealousy congratulate captain jadby more than do remarked gravely oh know that be not good man cried now quite woman kicking several cushion out of way loved have always loved owes much to promised when met in south sea that must make wife not that be young beautiful because found in so said good comrade gave money to come home see father to secure inheritance if possible saw that girl loved oh how hate that girl who stole heart need not said prelice very dryly miss chent dislike jadby immensely pretended to be engaged to shepworth so a to escape clutch otherwise sir oliver might have worried into consenting to marriage hated jadby came down other evening to lanwin grange know now that engagement be false one what doe not know ended prelice emphatically be that miss chent be now engaged to to madame marie stopped in sheer surprise then went on pacing room talking half to herself why must be astonished saw look at in court noted how glanced in direction told jadby that loved that loved oh must be certain cried prelice blushing have occult power enable to read heart said madame marie coldly believe disbelieve a like will believe if will read heart now there be need of exercising occult power for replied waving beautiful hand wish to learn truth about murder so miss chent name may be cleared felix thwarted yes said prelice coolly be right can help to clear miss chent name to discover truth a can help to marry jadby how can do by marrying miss chent madame marie nodded thought pressing hand to head can help by power of herb said rapidly listen will go into trance induced by herb do say attempt to waken simply listen to what say then leave room will send spirit to seek out truth first said slipping down on to cushion again tell how much know prelice saw objection in being thus clear even if madame marie wished to work against seeing that love for jadby be at stake did not think that must all that told must do little to harm own scheme therefore made demur detailed everything from time lady sophia have first drawn into case by sending to new bailey madame marie listened intently nodding at interval be useless for felix to strive said when ended with air of triumph fate of be mingled with of girl love so speedily now because loved before in previous incarnation karma be karma felix can never marry can mr shepworth marry even if did not love mr rover pardon cried prelice quickly made mention of mr rover beyond fact that wore green domino scarlet embroidered dress a explained be innocent have right to talk of mr shepworth love for married woman lord prelice said madame marie quietly moved towards wall knowledge of affair be greater than imagine mr rover have consulted felix learned how matter not that loved mr shepworth however can talk of thing time will go into trance search in alexander mansion for what can find only a said after have spoken have become silent leave room at once in due time will come out of trance when power of herb be exhausted prelice nodded in silence madame marie drawing aside portion of black hanging revealed small recess from took purple leaf moving towards tripod threw on perfumed fire lie down on face commended else fume will send into trance quick smoke rise certainly did in thick white cloud madame marie stood over letting odour flow into nostril not wishing to experience power of herb a have witnessed result before prelice full length on red carpet smoke be circling so high up that must not breathe although sickly whiff of tuberose perfume came to nostril perhaps draught sweeping from under door neutralised powerful scent at lower level be a may prelice lay perfectly flat a in dream heard madame marie speak after manner of tranced in unemotional voice very distinctly leave room said in mellow tone rise high pas across london street be under see park now poise above alexander mansion sink pas through roof be in mr rover flat search for dress commanded prelice softly there be pause then calm voice sounded again search in mr rover room dress wore be there in wardrobe together with green domino search for dress said prelice risking chance dress of same style again there came pause be searching said voice silence ensued for quite two minute endured then madame spoke again still with same awful calmness man dressing room in flat across landing see cupboard in many clothes be hanging up men clothes be behind be green domino with scarlet embroidered dress sewn to who wore asked prelice heart beating can not tell be not permitted by power then came long silence chapter xix circumstantial evidence be with extraordinary feeling that lord prelice emerged from that mystic room into everyday world of bond street after refusal to declare name of person who have worn dress madame marie have become silent prelice raised head to see standing rigid white between painted window white smoke have disappeared into thin air save that strong tuberose scent still lingered behind there be nothing to show what have placed in trance obedient to instruction young man left still figure in lonely room passed through outer apartment on way down stair boy cross legged in corner looked up anxiously a went out have said nothing breathed apprehensively nothing answered prelice softly descended stair when stood in street again removed hat drew long breath of smoky london air impure a be dispelled slight dizziness odour of sacred herb have produced then young man chartered hansom to reach room in moon street not until be in very own den seated in armchair with brandy soda within reach did find time to reflect reflection be considerably aided by first class cigar queer adventure thought prelice meditatively what be to do next must like to know of course answer to be obvious must go at once to alexander mansion learn if what madame marie said be correct very difficult errand to go upon prelice thought a must be hard to induce mr rover to explore husband dressing room in search of evidence might bring into trouble what excuse must make without telling whole truth then again mr rover might scoff at madame marie astounding statement made under such astounding condition yet on reflection prelice did not think that must scoff considering that have consulted fortune teller believed in occult there be considerable vein of what vulgar call superstition in constance rover that dress be there prelice have not least doubt of course on face of ordinary mortal must laugh at idea of evidence being procured in such way prelice have travelled too widely have seen too much to make sceptic in cairo in west indie in south america in south sea have witnessed occult ceremony doings proved clearly existence of unseen world at many people laugh of people be afraid drink drug music rapid movement even absolute stillness be aid to open psychic sens a prelice knew very well madame marie have used fume of sacred herb to rend spirit from body quite believed that have gone to alexander mansion to make strange discovery when woke from trance must be according to psychic law quite unconscious of what have said here lord prelice began to doubt madame marie have admitted that knew more than prelice imagined seeing that have be at grange during tragedy be closely connected with jadby seemed very probable that be aware of much be necessary to learn before actual truth must be made manifest so far a prelice must judge be shrewd reader of character fortune teller be entirely honest in dealing with if wished to gain jadby a husband be necessary that must be so since only by marriage of lord prelice must girl whom buccaneer loved be removed from path be not worth while to play prelice false since aim hers be identical prelice desired to marry mona madame marie wished also be anxious to make sailor husband prelice be quite willing that must be so since must put end to jadby troubling might perhaps take out of england therefore prelice believed in madame marie eppingrave credited power also for have true eye of one who can see into astral world must not be certain if have used occult power on occasion may have known beforehand of dress might merely have used trance a mean of communicating without arousing jadby wrath if dress be found evidence therefrom be forthcoming likely to solve mystery of agstone death captain wishing to keep mona in uneasy terror for reputation must be much annoyed then madame marie must explain that have only gone into trance for prelice a ordinary client be unaware of what said under circumstance buccaneer must say nothing well said prelice stretching talking aloud habit have contracted when travelling in silent place be rum business altogether if dress be in dolly rover wardrobe what then ca accuse a certainly have reason to kill agstone humph wonder if be what horace meant when said must be sorry if searched further into case certainly want dolly to be hanged if be be quite sure that ned must console widow ugh prelice shivered what horrible thought rover be bounder blighter cad honestly think that be criminal of sort believe that have pluck for one thing for have motive hum reflected 'd best get along see constance on glancing at watch prelice learned that be half past five concluded that probably mr rover must be at home sipping tea after manner of woman worn out with shopping decided to give hour then catch seven train from charing cross to hythe come might young man intended to get back to hythe night in order to walk over see mona assured that must be anxious must wish to learn how have sped might a well have confessed truth to namely that pined hungrily for sight of face that moment passed away from side be spent in outer darkness where there be wailing gnashing of teeth said prelice to quite ready to wail gnash if missed train a fate must have mr rover be at home came forward to greet friend in wonderful tea gown suited queenly figure rose hued blind be down room looked like grotto of venusberg in spite of softening aid mr rover appeared somewhat haggard be greeting of prelice very friendly indeed be so harsh that congratulated on finding alone then have anyone else be present must have be smile gentle word how dare come see after leaving a did last time be mr rover polite salutation know why went too yes may look look lord prelice know explained conduct to ned told how have described dress to mean asked prelice calmly unflinchingly mean cried in stormy tone mean that believed to be woman who came in waved bronze cup under ned nose did believe for one minute confessed friend making clean breast of in view of what be coming of course on reflection saw how ridiculous be to suspect be be be retorted mr rover sitting down tapping foot have not many friend lord prelice did think that dorry be one of dorry be assured fair weather friend pooh to suspect went on angrily of all people a if must have hurt ned have be that chent girl might have have cause speak gently about miss chent said prelice quietly sha' why must because be engaged to mr rover started to foot in delighted amazement ned ned engagement be merely official one to prevent jadby oh yes yes know about did believe ned be speaking truth thought that be throwing over for horrid girl look at like be horrid girl now that be engaged to will love lady prelice much more than loved mona chent engaged engaged mr rover made ball of handkerchief tossed in air what rage lady sophia will be in be in already said prelice dryly care of course be man man oh how love man not that married life give experience ended bitterly constance said prelice seriously sit down let talk quietly about married life wish to talk of retorted nevertheless took seat pointed to must be friend a very truly say admit now that be engaged to mona say dorry yes will call dorry now say be rather sudden have only known week two be case of love at first sight said young man very earnestly pooh pooh believe in thing did either until experienced sensation really did love mona from moment saw in dock be only honour held back from speaking even earlier honour what honour asked mr rover contemptuously be supposed to be engaged to ned know only when learned that engagement meant nothing be able to speak out have very many scruple said mr rover with shrug evidently forget that be fair in love war be purely feminine view constance have ned really be in love with mona really engaged to must have left england without saying word so like man retorted constance scornfully why if dozen woman loved ned must give up constance forget that be married dolly never give chance of forgetting constance prelice spoke sharply be foolish headstrong woman do want to be disgraced there be chance of cried mr rover in fury how dare talk to like because see going headlong to ruin see nothing of sort be loyal wife to dolly ned know love now a loved before marriage know dorry a doe how marriage came about know ought to make best of be making best of cried constance rising to stamp foot in royal rage there be not breath of scandal against name one can couple name ned together scarcely ever meet ca prevent feeling still urged prelice in rather futile manner since have elected to become mr rover must consider husband let consider first made bargain with accepted knowing that loved ned not have broken bargain in meanest manner father died of sheer worry through breaking of now have to stifle deep love for ned act part of loving wife feel like hypocrite think need constance people say that treat rover badly be a well that must know do know have heard that before dolly put that story about love pretend to be a obedient kind a can be told that treated like dog so do like pet dog dog be fed up smoothed cosseted given cream meat thing poodle dog like dolly go about posing a husband be badly treated doe not dare to say have deceived however added drawing deep breath must suffer for if did miserable a be abide by bargain broke what be to be end of know know wailed mr rover pacing room holding hand to head really believe that dolly want to see disgraced took flat above ned in spite of protestation want to go away wo oh said prelice thoughtfully so mr rover took flat above ned did purposely know constance paused looking startled why do ask lord prelice considered constance want to do favour yes mr rover spoke softly with effort do think that husband wish to get ned into trouble constance put hand to head hate ned said at last in strained voice because know that ned love do ned for jealous watching can not find anything wrong between ned because added drawing up to full height there be nothing wrong never will be have not answered question repeated prelice quietly do think that rover wish to get ned into trouble yes believe that must be glad to see dead well then constance answer question must like to see husband get into trouble said with startled air dolly be fool cruel can scarcely endure same wish harm be right said prelice rising then can trust to hold tongue about what why be so mysterious poor girl must rather hold peace than tell what be about to tell be necessary that must know if move in matter someone le friendly to rover may do so then only god know what must happen dorry constance caught hand passed tongue over dry lip slowly what do mean have gone through so much that be quite able to face worst wo scream be not fool oh what be blazed out with stamp clenching hand clenching teeth also prelice raised hand must tell a best can said in peremptory tone quietened after may be mistaken be that dress wore at ball in room for answer constance pressed bell button when footman appeared gave order tell maid to bring frock domino wore at ball at masked ball said then faced prelice when man went out be about to accuse ask question constance be sorry to keep in suspense ca help whole thing be so extraordinary what thing what thing prelice perhaps mistakenly must not tell maid entered with domino dress prelice at once recognised a masked ball costume simply cast one glance at then can tell to take away again remarked mr rover did so wonderingly waited to hear what have to say next take to husband dressing room in other flat what for asked how do know dolly be dressing room be in other flat never mind take there said prelice impatiently wished to get thing over a speedily a possible a saw how strung up be yet until be certain how must accuse rover in heart of heart lord prelice wished that might be spared disagreeable task of accusing rover at if did not do so be not improbable that jadby to further own end might intervene be much better that jadby at cost must be kept out of business since be not likely to spare constance husband come come cried prelice impatiently seeing that did not move take to husband dressing room constance led thither like woman in dream left one flat crossed landing to other when in dressing room be luxuriously furnished mr rover remained silent observant at door while friend examined sanctum of husband so mysterious be word movement that began to wish that have not admitted since did not desire to harm dolly objectionable a found if must not trust dorry in way who must trust meanwhile prelice peered into wardrobe shook out many suit contained searched large wooden press wherein shirt underlinen handkerchief collar be neatly laid out in case failed to find that for hunted drew long breath of relief perhaps after madame marie be wrong in spite of magical power to laid claim when at wit end prelice turned to constance be there cupboard asked over there said pointing to hither side of fireplace must be blind not to see oh be unlocked added noting that hesitated dolly have secret there be nothing in old clothes rubbish trimmer be mr rover valet stows there look into cupboard by mean young man made reply to sarcasm opened cupboard of bluebeard be deep wide with many peg at back round side upon hung many clothes out of date slightly worn on floor be heterogeneous pile of shabby slipper discarded boot sundry medicine bottle tin box of polish many odds end showing that be bag o ' rag receptacle for sheer rubbish prelice speedily pulled out clothes threw on floor while mr rover shrugged stared at zeal suddenly came upon green silk domino inside be sewn front of white dress streaked with thin line of red velvet whole made one garment easy to slip on off when worn must look like dress domino very ingenious garb be hidden behind discarded clothes apparently have not be disturbed for considerable time only by removing all a prelice have done must domino clever fixing have be discovered there said young man holding up for mr rover inspection with staring eye mr rover drew near handled fabric imitation of frock domino wore at ball gasped then added after pause woman never wore ned said that person who waved bronze cup under nose to make insensible be woman said prelice significantly oh gasped constance taking meaning at once dolly be lie chapter xx mr rover explains be lie repeated constance seeing that prelice did not say word dolly be little cruel fool who tyranni to full extent of weak power believe that killed agstone well drawled prelice reflectively on face of there appears to be reason yet sham frock be in rubbish cupboard dolly can explain breathed mr rover hopefully can explain why entered ned flat to did did be impossible tell constance declared other seriously said that mr rover must be glad to see ned dead out of sheer jealousy quite believe that believe also that have not pluck to kill did best to get ned into trouble by killing agstone what rubbish cried mr rover feverishly if killed one must have murdered other must have chosen ned in preference humph perhaps with refinement of cruelty rover wished ned to be hanged so slaughtered agstone in hope that ned must be accused accused ned must have be cried prelice decisively brought in guest to see helpless mr rover twisted hand in hair be impossible tell lamented hoping against hope dolly be fool never must be murderer have pluck heaven know have cause to love that stand in way of happiness tell dorry must have cut off right hand sooner than have brought in here to spy out shame be glad to hear say that constance returned prelice quietly for show that have honour if not love even to secure happiness with ned will not stoop to injure man who be husband think dear girl be not better must find than jadby jadby man who love mona have got to do with everything said prelice tersely wish to secure mona a wife will stop at nothing may wonder how came to guess that husband dressing room be in flat how came to know that sham dress be hidden behind clothes can explain very shortly consulted madame marie eppingrave that fortune teller gasped constance staring have consulted myself told lot of rubbish surely believe what say in shoddy room of hers be bound to believe said prelice dryly seeing that domino with attached frock front be here a stated may not have told so by mean of occult power in spite of claim to exercise same in earthly way know not how knew where touched domino be to be found will tell captain jadby to whom be much attached then will come here to make what trouble can therefore can understand that be better for rover must be discoverer yes see see murmured constance tottered towards chair to fall into oh horrible horrible there must be explanation dorry think of one think of one woman a prelice reflected at moment be most extraordinary here be wife who avowedly hated husband of tricky effeminate sort yet when chance placed weapon against in hand refused to use despite temptation of thus ridding for ever of marital incubus rover have practically killed father have cheated into match loathed be doing best to make unhappy in face of deceived wife defended against strong desire have for man who truly loved truly woman be strange however be not prelice business to analyse mr rover feeling what have to do be to learn meaning of rover hiding domino in cupboard proceeded to do be jadby at ball asked abruptly never asked know replied clasping hand tightly know that owing to mask many people shady people too be there captain jadby might have come also did come said prelice quickly for be one of first to unmask when seeing ned insensible to blame certainly may have come up stair opportunely since wore domino mask be sure that be at ball what colour be domino blue light blue rejoined prelice promptly there be many blue domino murmured constance wonder why man came to ball ah be what have to find out question prelice cleared throat presuming a must that husband wore made up thing did know what must wear yes assented mr rover then started up with cry very pale face oh dorry dorry be going to say that dress be imitated by so that might be accused look like said prelice reluctantly what else must say ca believe that dolly must be so wicked said poor wife anxiously yet dress be same there be only front to be sure when worn anyone must have mistaken for man always look taller in woman clothes be hardly woman clothes sufficiently like to deceive anyone said that spoke to someone wearing dress like mine be not dorry must have remembered be dolly never spoke to to anyone dressed like said prelice quickly only told that to get at truth never expected to hear say that have worn dress one thing may tell added that green domino seemed to be ubiquitous saw presuming husband be person talking drinking dancing over place be dancing also said constance if dolly wore similar dress be natural that must see frock domino often dolly received guest unmasked know remember later vanished then might have prelice touched domino significantly still there be one thing to be said added how did husband enter ned flat remember said raising head agstone brought in lady dolly suppose when ned be in cataleptic state forgot that who admitted agstone what be matter asked because constance rose suddenly to foot with cry of astonishment mr haken be at ball said alarmed know saw be recognised by chuckle well mr rover sat down again know that mr haken be godfather remarked when prelice nodded went on be much distressed over preference for ned seeing be married came to remonstrate with on night of ball humph said prelice coolly wondered why be at ball most unusual festivity for dry a dust old man like uncle simon to be at gave key said constance in low voice key what key key of ned flat constance how did become possessed of key with bent head hurried low voice explained dolly be very cruel to at time even struck must not strike back at little rat like told ned who be furious wanted to frighten dolly prevented so that there might be scandal ned then gave key of flat have extra key told if dolly ever struck again to come to must not have thought of doing so to quieten ned consented to take key what injudicious thing to do breathed prelice alarmed if husband knew might do lot of damage how did uncle simon get key out of told about night of ball got into quiet corner to remonstrate so explained everything mr haken be angry at ned for having given key be quite right interposed prelice ned ought to have have more sense than to do mad thing go on mr haken insisted upon having key then said that must go down see ned prelice turned suddenly pale be what horace have warned against when advised to leave case alone did uncle simon go asked in stifled voice know certainly said that must go down give ned back key talk to about folly in letting have prelice felt very uncomfortable thought flew to aunt with merry way must be terrible for lady sophia if haken be involved in dreadful case indeed if be a seemed apparent from constance story prelice wished that have taken doctor advice have left well alone while be puzzling over new problem trying to find reason against uncle complicity heard constance cry out looked up to see rover standing in doorway little stockbroker dressed to perfection overdressed at looked more dapper neat than ever face be more colourless eye more plaintive blue than have be in artificial light in have received wife guest mean looking bloodless man must scarcely get into rage yet venomous look crept into eye a surveyed wife visitor what be meaning of demanded trying to assume dignity of injured husband sat very badly on before constance must speak lord prelice stepped forward with domino over arm spread out be meaning of being in dressing room mr rover said sharply perfectly cool found behind clothes in yonder cupboard how dare search into private affair cried dolly standing on tiptoe growing red be not better must do so than police mr rover little man looked genuinely puzzled police what do mean by mentioning police dress domino be imitation of dress domino wife wore at ball lady who be introduced by agstone to make shepworth insensible if remember case be arrayed in way instead of turning pale dolly became redder than ever turned like snake on wife said savagely entered shepworth flat dared to never be near flat said constance coming very close to looking down contemptuously from great height if dare to hint at thing will leave for ever have put up with enough from drive too far mr rover have enough to do to defend without troubling constance said prelice quietly dolly started what do mean asked nervously sham dress be hidden in cupboard never saw before did know be there dolly gasped for be beginning to scent danger presumed woman introduced by agstone be dressed in went on lord prelice mercilessly hated shepworth wished to get into trouble so prelice stopped leave to draw own inference ended dolly trembled a well might for visitor have drawn up very good case against tell never saw dress before quavered how did find be here there said prelice wishing to shield constance from mean wrath of little man later on police can explain police police dolly grew a white a sheet constance laid hand on shoulder be afraid dolly believe that killed that man agstone dolly brushed hand away with snarl of terrified cat keep to yourself snapped showing teeth hate so need not defend love answered constance bitterly have small cause to considering way in tricked same wish to see get into trouble over crime truly believe have not pluck enough to commit be quite right retorted husband shamelessly never did have pluck enough to kill fly much le human being must have stabbed lover long ago if have shepworth be not mr rover lover said prelice quietly be be always howling after taunted venomous little man sold to did not pay price said constance scornful still dolly chuckled got better of there be wife now will make pay shepworth can marry criminal girl whenever like hope will so a to torment mr rover eye flashed ned will never marry began when prelice made sign to to keep secret of new engagement spoke coldly sternly miss chent character have be perfectly cleared by acquittal mr rover if dare to say word against will throw out of window how brave be in defending shepworth bride said dolly wincing at flash in prelice blue eye be replied other not contradicting mistake under saw dolly laboured a yet have not proved innocence there be need to prove be voice whimpered unsteadily be ridiculous to accuse dress be hidden in cupboard insisted prelice what of room be used a place for coat hat of men who came to ball one of might have hidden domino frock there did not received guest unmasked afterwards put on black silk domino ah prelice took step forward then be who appeared in shepworth dining room who gave alarm yes be came down to see shepworth to make plain to that be not to make love longer to wife never did make love since marriage flashed out constance with scorn ned have be true to honour a have be prelice raised hand to stop promising quarrel between ill matched couple only rover knew what kind of dress wife be to wear at ball said judicially only must have have similar one made so a to get into trouble expect person knew cried dolly with flash of triumph in china blue eye yes asked haken to come to ball to remonstrate with constance about love for shepworth be godfather to constance a know be aware that constance must try to dodge haken a did want to be scolded so described dress to that there might be mistake haken be at ball lord prelice why accuse young man sneered although felt distinctly nervous at many proof accumulating against uncle haken have reason to get shepworth into trouble have nothing must have pleased better must have stopped short of putting neck into noose did tell again that know how domino frock thing came to be in cupboard that never entered shepworth flat a certainly must not do so without key be man in black silk domino who gave alarm when entered flat then have left door open explanation be perfectly natural dolly gave with air of truth that prelice be reluctantly obliged to believe young man threw domino over shoulder moved to door will take with said curtly see police asked rover with twinkling eye not at present not at time if value uncle liberty what do mean prelice faced round sharply mean nothing a know nothing there be a much evidence against haken a against if accuse will accuse how will lady sophia like scandal of sort eh prelice turned away without vouchsafing reply will see again constance said coldly will not see until shepworth marries mona chent snapped venomous little husband will move heaven earth to bring about will need to retorted prelice remembering engagement thinking how angry dolly must be when learned truth let tell rover that if ill treat wife will make business to thrash dolly drew back snarled seemed distinctly afraid prelice with nod to unhappy wife passed from room out of flat felt distinctly nervous about simon haken chapter xxi possible scandal after lord prelice did not return to hythe on night much a desired to in view of new complication threatened domestic peace of lady sophia haken nephew decided to remain in london give energy towards solving problem must not think that haken have anything to do with murder of agstone in first place have reason to kill man in second did not posse leaf of sacred herb with to make shepworth unconscious certainly be agstone who have kindled leaf in bronze cup must have obtained from mr haken presuming be disguised lady since must have obtained in other way sir oliver have possessed portion of plant have used in library when be murdered so old sailor must not have procured leaf in direction prelice began to wonder if haken have got leaf from madame marie eppingrave to execute purpose then so far a prelice knew uncle be not acquainted with bond street fortune teller again be well acquainted with dr horace who admitted to possession of leaf more than have actually burnt sacred herb in new bailey lord prelice decided first to call upon uncle in city lay fact discovered before then to interview dr horace in two several way might get at truth also somewhat later decided to again speak with madame marie if possible see in presence of captain jadby when buccaneer learned that mona be engaged to man that have inherited property might bow to fate leave thing alone finally prelice knew that have powerful ally in fortune teller from what have seen of strong willed character guessed that must stick at nothing to secure a husband man with whom be infatuated bearing circumstance in mind prelice sent wire to mona stating that business detained in london also went to club to write first love letter in carefully refrained from mentioning case merely poured out heart in passionate dithyramb in honour of goddess mona for moment felt disappointment when noted absence of information regarding madame marie later confessed that lover be right must never have done for first letter have passed between to be soiled by sordid tragedy in have be implicated same much a appreciated prelice slightly turgid prose heart hungered to learn of doings relative to case felt that must not know happy moment until truth be made manifest then must become lady prelice with light heart next day prelice went into city to see uncle learned that mr haken have gone to paris for few day be expected back on morrow a already have be absent for time so that eager nephew must do be to posse soul in patience prelice returned to club rather disappointed there found telegram waiting for have be sent to hythe hotel have be repeated on to club since be marked urgent proved to be from horace asked prelice to come up at once be at house at three in afternoon important said wire wonder what mean prelice asked uneasily fretted over matter until time came for to go to rutland square there be getting over fact that mystery of case be telling on prelice strong nerve be uneasiness diminished when found that dr horace be not alone with be captain jadby madame marie eppingrave of whom appeared to be on very good term with host a usual room be untidy with litter of curiosity prelice managed to find seat with back to light did so a to keep face well in shade a have premonition that there be about to be duel of word indeed first whispered remark of horace hinted at storm about to break silly as grumbled doctor in beard a went forward to welcome guest why must leave thing alone a told to now fat be on fire with vengeance prelice shrugged shoulder with carelessness be far from feeling saluted madame marie with bow of captain jadby who stood fidgeting by window took notice buccaneer noticed omission resented english manner suppose sneered half caste pointedly prelice sat down calmly took up challenge considering last meeting when treacherously fired on friend can hardly expect to behave courteously wish have killed flashed out jadby viciously quite believe that did not harm in least retorted prelice lying bravely to defend ned to annoy captain wounded in arm snarled jadby did marie certainly saw that mr shepworth be slightly hurt replied fortune teller in trance of course ah replied prelice negligently trance be not always reliable madame think have found that one be at least replied in turn very significantly what doe captain jadby think asked prelice genially felt sure that woman have not dared to risk buccaneer rage by explaining what have said madame marie told that went into trance on account said jadby taking chair sullenly of course did not remember what said must not explain to since madame be certain that especial trance be reliable be prelice retort must remember something oh deuce take chatter shouted horace ruffling shaggy red hair in high state of irritation did ask here to waste time in drivel in case a time be also valuable have better go confound said horace crossly seeing that prelice knew well how to treat humour madame here jadby wish to speak to seriously fail to see upon what subject upon subject of miss chent cried buccaneer savagely decline to discus absent lady said prelice coolly be engaged to be indeed sha' marry wo see here prelice rose very tall very straight very cool headed if persist in going like captain jadby will be compelled to twist neck english manner sneered half caste again not at colonial manner south sea manner if will very necessary manner for dealing with ruffian such a be will kill for muttered jadby sinking back into chair with little gun taunted prelice pleasantly hope will shoot straighter never saw so rotten shot can do more than shoot yes can bark bite too see here asked here to tell in presence of horace that if stop meddling with thing concern will disgrace uncle prelice never winced have kind of idea that something of sort be forthcoming merely laughed aggravatingly uncle said calmly have two three mr simon haken oh indeed prelice turned to horace be on side on side of blackmailer demanded madame marie arose furiously be not blackmailer cried deep toned voice became shrill with anger did not want to say anything if felix doe not swear to give up girl will refuse to speak out snapped jadby with fierce glance at strange to say courageous woman looked cowed will speak a direct be on side on theirs prelice asked horace again on yours hang snarled ugly little man if be not must find in queer street can tell prelice took notice of outburst turned to woman be against demanded be neutral retorted uneasily see jadby there be open enemy well now that understand situation perhaps will let know how mr haken can be disgraced by two three can accuse of murder said jadby choking with anger at exasperating coolness of young aristocrat good go on of two murder spat out half caste better better have understand then that captain jadby madame marie accuse mr haken of killing sir oliver lanwin steve agstone yes snapped captain yes breathed woman very pale prelice looked quietly at prove charge said one moment said dr horace getting out german pipe remember prelice that business be none of bringing about warned against meddling in case must not take warning have only to thank for what be coming be perfectly ready to take responsibility of action be stiff retort of young man turned to jadby go on captain bursting with venom be only too pleased to relieve in torrent of word before father sir oliver died frequently talked to about estate sought counsel in fact thus learned that mr haken although supposed to be wealthy man be in difficulty owing to disastrous speculation asked sir oliver to lend fifty thousand pound to tide over crisis father refused to do naturally mr haken be very angry probably put in prelice coolly what say doe not prove that mr haken killed sir oliver let speak now said horace rapidly be sole possessor of sacred herb if remember prelice brought from easter island gave to haken who desired to get same for sir oliver see pursued traveller haken knew that lanwin be much interested in occult study so thought to tempt to lend necessary fifty thousand pound by getting rare herb a know produce trance see prelice nodded then mr haken confessed to that desired loan of money did saying that affair be in bad way with gift of sacred herb hoped to soften sir oliver heart be somewhat hard where money matter be concerned never knew that mr haken be aware of lanwin inclination to occult said prelice quietly be in way said madame marie suddenly taking up story of course told more being very friendly with sir oliver a know mr haken be superstitious a saying go frequently consulted about stock share what prelice looked incredulous do mean to tell that hard headed man like mr haken consulted did be enabled to serve by power understood lord prelice that believed in occult world do rejoined young man dryly because have have considerable experience posse imagination mr haken believed also interrupted fortune teller quickly came to for advice be who recommended to apply to old friend sir oliver for fifty thousand pound when sir oliver refused told mr haken that must get of sacred herb from dr horace give to sir oliver in hope that gift must make sir oliver hand over money how did know that dr horace have herb asked prelice sharply madame marie be acquainted in samoa put in traveller when met in london told that have succeeded in getting famous trance herb of easter island asked for leaf to use in business declined why when gave same to sir oliver inquired prelice because wished to keep herb to myself said horace rugged face growing dark when haken asked for to get money out of lanwin gave readily hated lanwin thwarted in tahiti matter not how treated brother steve like dog knew that haken must lose fifty thousand wished lanwin to see last of cash must have ruined lanwin if must be quite new light on character horace

in spite of nonchalance be more nervous than chose to admit now tell how friend bring home crime to why told about business will tell whole case from beginning said prelice after pause connection with began when aunt sophia came to bully into doing something haken nodded sympathetically when aunt interferes there be generally trouble well prelice settled to work recounted whole story ending with parting from madame marie on stair of horace house oath upon crucifix haken smoked quietly while narrative proceeded merely raising eyebrow when heard how ingeniously fortune teller jadby proved guilt when prelice concluded haken chuckled passed port have glass boy said quietly must be dry over talking same prelice noted that perspiration be beading old man brow that be exercising considerable will power to keep in hand while prelice sipped fresh glass of wine haken walked up down length of dining room keeping silent after quite five minute began to talk still walking steadily must have come to for money said in conversational tone only that like taking advantage of wife relative needed fifty thousand pound badly when lanwin refused to lend money scarcely knew what to do however cash turned up unexpectedly although have to make sacrifice to get calculate that will have to pay cent per cent for money however be worth worst be over everything be going swimmingly will have further trouble so look glum prelice oh be not afraid of finance said young man quickly a know head for figure know also that soundest men in city have money trouble on occasion be thinking of being in power of wretch be added prelice correcting in power of jadby think that madame marie be so bad horace be gruff honest oh horace be all right marie be a bad a make nonsense want to help selfishly in order to

madame marie went to bed be admitted haken coolly by time lanwin have not commenced hanky panky with herb asked straight out to lend money refused with word two of abuse so walked away back to folkstone where be stopping there be row a disdained to reply to lanwin coarse language madame marie left library at five minute after nine by fifteen minute past left also by window on way to folkstone what happened after left can not say what be lanwin doing when left fiddling with herb came shut window after have gone shouted out word two a departed do suspect anyone of crime haken shrugged shoulder unless be jadby no replied thoughtfully jadby be in london did not return until later heard evidence in court then agstone must be guilty agstone certainly hated master said haken why prelice looked astonished understood that agstone be devoted to sir oliver so lanwin said everyone believed fact be a learned from madame marie that agstone be lanwin slave sir oliver knew something about used a threat so kept in bondage lanwin be not pleasant character ended city man twirling cigar oh prelice sunk chin in breast thought knew well enough that so far a evidence of knife be concerned agstone must not possibly be guilty nevertheless since agstone have brought missing will to brother assassin must only have procured will must seem that old sailor after have struck blow why have tried to put blame on mona by placing knife in hand by accusing did madame marie say that agstone hated mona asked prelice raising head on contrary understand that agstone liked miss chent because be kind to sir oliver however be of jealous disposition agstone be afraid to display liking do suppose that madame marie killed lanwin certainly not have nothing to gain by doing so moreover lost valuable client by lanwin death marie be fond of money too want to make can so a to marry jadby be strangely infatuated with rascal jadby be good looking in way replied prelice humph seems to that be a far a ever from learning truth doubt assented uncle still one thing be certain that did not kill lanwin a to agstone hesitated be not going to confess that killed said prelice with wry smile haken chuckled never tell unnecessary lie certainly saw dead shepworth insensible oh prelice be quite unmoved so did make use of key said haken again unexpectedly there be need to went down intending to remonstrate with shepworth on behalf of rover found that door be unfastened entered saw what saw so at once came upstairs reclosing door a have found why did give alarm what with jadby hanging about already intending to blackmail for lanwin death must have given into hand of philistine with vengeance have raised alarm see so jadby be continental swell whom told that be to meet yes insisted upon seeing at ball why chose place know how got to ball ca imagine oh be easy remember mask jadby have only to assume mask domino must slip in easily dress did wear interrupted haken quickly woman disguise be last thing must think of assuming with figure face to say nothing of age be opinion paused well well questioned prelice impatiently that madame marie wore dress how must come to ball constance never invited answered that question few minute ago with reference to jadby madame marie must easily have slipped on mask domino have come to ball to meet jadby probably wore that dress to implicate constance concealed in rover dressing room to bring into matter remember madame marie told where sham dress be to be found yes assented lord prelice thoughtfully how did madame marie learn what kind of costume constance must wear rover told yes came to about constance love for shepworth told that in effort to gain wife love have gone to see if madame marie must give philter of sort infernally silly to act in way now day madame marie told to learn exact costume constance must wear at ball see constance be keeping style of dress secret even from husband so rover must watch if went down to see shepworth rover learned about dress from constance dressmaker told also told madame marie be easy then for madame marie to get frock imitated slip down to shepworth flat by doing that managed to kill agstone to implicate young shepworth to throw blame on constance confoundedly clever woman be marie eppingrave ended haken chuckling lord prelice rose thoughtfully further go into case more complicated doe become remarked certainly agstone knowing madame marie must bring into room while not knowing constance must not then again madame marie knew about herb constance did not must seem stopped walked abruptly to door must sleep on said wearily know that be innocent now have explained said old man following speaking anxiously liked prelice did not wish to have bad opinion of uncle by marriage prelice grasped haken hand believed in innocence before gave explanation replied wish aunt good night for uncle simon be going home to think over thing aunt will be annoyed not so much a will be if listen to scolding good night haken grumbled trifle at being left to explain to lady sophia on going to drawing room found that wife have gone to concert in park lane thus be saved trouble of making thing smooth went to bed very thankfully haken be not young man interview with prelice have shaken greatly meanwhile prelice have driven straight to room have gone immediately to bed thinking that must better argue out case a stood when lying down than when sitting standing be so weary with talk with strain of last few day that fell sound asleep before must arrive at conclusion

said prelice leaning forward to shake shepworth hand be having deuce of time karma oh hang theosophy very good one waste word in speaking to deaf besides matter of mona rescue be more important than anything else hang how slow beastly train be be hard on engine driver who be doing best actually be sending along train at top speed have prelice be mounted on flying bombshell must have found speed too slow since thought outstripping other mean of locomotion have flown long since to house in hollow however longest river get to sea in end young men found on hythe platform motor car ordered in advance by wire waited be soon buzzing upward to lanwin grange on arriving at great mansion be met by mr blexey tear lamentation prelice in stiff military manner soon reduced to common sense talk learned that although inquiry have be made possible place searched a yet mona have not be found have disappeared a completely a dewdrop doe in ocean even local police must hing be just like local police growled prelice say ned take car scout over down somewhere about there jadby may hold prisoner oh sir wailed mr blexey do think that nasty man have run away with miss mona be sole solution of disappearance can think of mr blexey there there talk more ned go round down use car for speed will wait until arrival of madame marie then search folkstone humph prelice looked sharply at ned do know if jadby have boat yacht steamer of sort yes said shepworth starting to foot now mention did hear say to sir oliver that have small steamer anchored in thames ca give particular never mind will set police to work on possible clue if steamer have be brought round to folkstone harbour may be sure that mona be held prisoner on board if be so jadby have gone off to south sea be just what must do will borrow uncle simon yacht twin screw triple expansion devil to go will follow jadby to polynesia to hell if necessary ended lord prelice grimly arrangement being thus made shepworth went off in car with policeman who knew neighbourhood with chauffeur who be magnificent driver driving of best be needed on rolling upland of down prelice left behind waited for madame marie in meantime asked mr blexey about herb horace have given to girl be small white parcel asked housekeeper yes contained root leaf miss mona took with explained mr blexey asked to make linen bag then sewed inside dress good said prelice adding to if have herb can make use of may render jadby insensible escape reflection that mona have mean of protection quietened somewhat anxiety rose again to fever heat when madame marie appeared on woman on occult power depended chance of saving mona have prelice told to police must have be jeered at however have own method of going about thing be not needful for to expose to ridicule watched anxiously for fortune teller be amazed when arrived in unexpected company of mr dolly rover what devil be doing here asked prelice rudely will tell said little man very deliberately looking at other with dilated blue eye morning went to see madame marie about wife love shepworth want shepworth removed out of path mine did propose murder to madame asked prelice coolly replied rover with shudder while fortune teller sat down wished captain jadby to marry miss chent deuce did to shepworth be fancied that jadby must manage business offered through madame marie here sum of money if marriage must be brought about oh indeed did madame marie tell told nothing interrupted woman in deep voice never intended to without permission a said that be friend wire came while mr rover be talking be messenger came so brought mr rover down with came to help to find miss chent said rover hurriedly want to be found married to shepworth money can offer to help in search have ample money to deal with matter said prelice pleased to find that fortune teller have respected confidence about new engagement see why need have applied to jadby to bring about marriage because know that jadby love miss chent want to marry lord prelice a know must not remove shepworth beyond wife reach wished to bribe jadby into letting shepworth marry miss chent a be arranged then wife right right cried lord prelice irritably worry head rover will see to have better clear off back to london jadby be rough customer if get involved in row will be bad for heart dear lord prelice yes anyone can see oh pooh worry heart be weak said rover with dignity wife behaviour be not likely to make strong nevertheless will wait help in search for miss chent bribe jadby a said must not marry young lady wo madame assured coolly will marry prelice turned to fortune teller will go into trance see where mona be have already be in trance before leaving bond street then know madame looked at unflinchingly must see nothing cloud cloud cloud responded only one thing be certain of be that miss chent be hidden somewhere amongst down prelice shrugged shoulder much good that information doe quite believe where ca say added madame marie with animation can tell that steamer felix owns be coming round to folkstone harbour afternoon felix asked two day ago to tell captain to take boat round did know why wished that can understand now so can rejoined lord prelice quickly jadby intends to take miss chent to steamer at do bunk yes replied fortune teller breathing hard leaving in lurch sha' sha' will kill first young man looked at curiously wished to ask if have killed agstone did not think that be wise to irritate at so critical moment so merely asked what be name of steamer kanaro be name of one of easter island statue be worshipped by native jadby seems to be very closely connected with easter island certainly have made good use of sacred herb what do mean asked madame marie angrily nothing replied prelice wondering why must grow so angry think that have talked enough mr shepworth be exploring down in motor car so mr rover here can go also if like yes yes said fortune teller eagerly with very bright eye can do must rather go alone said dolly piping out decision wish to aid in finding miss chent must get married to shepworth very good said prelice with short laugh go hunt will go into folkstone see after kanaro describe madame woman did so at once prelice left house hour later with full knowledge of what kind of boat jadby owned walking to hythe took train to sandgate then used funicular to reach lea here swept horizon harbour with marine glass to seek for steamer in jadby intended to fly with mona chent must see sign of boat have prelice be absolutely wise must have gone to police station to engage couple of constable to board vessel preferred to trust in own strong arm in own wit have hitherto served excellently also unless constable have warrant must not board yacht if refused permission be better thought young man to go alone interview captain if jadby be not open to argument captain might be intimation that law must be put in force if miss chent be kidnapped might prevent commander of kanaro from risking own liberty liberty of crew so prelice went down to harbour watched for coming of steamer to surprise found that have arrived hour since be anchored distance away from land there be doubt that be kanaro a not only did correspond to description given by fortune teller by mean of glass saw name on stern lord prelice acted promptly engaged boat to be rowed on board steamer when climbed up rope ladder hanging over side be greeted unceremoniously by rough looking man in nondescript sort of uniform in reply prelice handed card upon officer manner changed to one of courtesy conducted lord prelice to richly furnished cabin removed cap with explanation know name lord said politely madame marie mentioned to be captain brisson in command of yacht belongs to captain jadby brisson shrugged heavy shoulder so say lord think that be property of madame marie still a captain jadby be to marry can own captain jadby want to marry young lady whom be kidnapping be prelice sharp reply if aid to do so law stop sir said brisson rising first mate said something of to day will bring in tramped heavily out prelice waited man did not return then tried door of cabin found locked flashed across at once that have be trapped chapter xxiv beginning of end after strong word two prelice sat down philosophically to consider position weaker man might have raged aimlessly have wasted strength in battering at closed door lord prelice be too wise to kick against prick have be trapped sure enough did not see way out of trap one knew where be save boatman who have brought even a thought came into mind heard raucous voice of brisson telling man that passenger must remain on board more than brisson paid waterman sent away until hue cry be raised owner of boat must say nothing so be absolutely certain that prelice must have to remain in durance vile without hope of immediate rescue situation however be not devoid of certain consolation without doubt jadby plan be to bring mona on board kanaro steam away with to polynesia prelice at event must be on same boat a girl if came to fighting with jadby felt certain that must hold own moreover if a brisson declared yacht belonged to madame marie a captain owed fealty to rather than to jadby fortune teller certainly must not allow steamer to carry mona chent to south sea to be bride of precious felix thing on reflection be not so bad after in case prelice felt that be in thick of whole villainous business soon must be within arm length of mona when be dragged on board by scoundrelly kidnapper must then be time to act prelice lovingly fingered revolver have strapped behind wondered if must be necessary to use weapon formed strange addition to very civilised suit of tweed wore be out of place in sober law abiding england then danger murder sudden death have entered into life be necessary to prepare for emergency be not bloodthirsty man said prelice while seeing that gun be well loaded worked without hitch must like one clean shot at felix jadby may be mentioned that if shooting took place prelice must probably hit bull eye represented by buccaneer be clean shot very quick with weapon a who inhabited uncivilised part knew from experience afternoon wore on to six o'clock still prelice be left alone in floating dungeon probably brisson did not desire personal explanation knowing that must not make very pertinent reply to breaking of law be possible that preferred to leave explanation to jadby when arrived with prey personally prelice cared very little knew that mona be safe though in power of scoundrel for be brave girl religious girl who firmly believed in god so did prelice be quite content to think that god who be slightly stronger than felix jadby must look after angel being so young man knowing that god must bring everything to pas for best in own good time prelice quietly smoked cigarette after cigarette throughout weary afternoon then stretched on divan went to sleep wondering how ned be getting on with search what madame marie rover be doing be awakened about eight o'clock by bright light sense that someone be looking steadily at with yawn opened eye saw that steward be lighting swing lamp over central table captain brisson be looking down upon sailor have rugged somewhat good natured face possessed extraordinary athletic figure promised well for fighting purpose well said prelice swinging leg on to floor be going to starve brisson burst into horse laugh while unwilling guest blinked rubbed eye be plucky chap lord said approvingly thanks awfully prefer food to compliment be just about to eat hurry up steward then when man have gone out brisson threw cap on chair resumed wonder maybe why keep here said prelice stretching be in game what game asked brisson abruptly very dangerous one be playing along with jadby mistress with dr horace too for know never met horace whoever may be retorted brisson gruffly know of game be have to obey order if break owner finished prelice remembering saying will break before have done none of lark lord have got gun so have answered prelice loaded in six chamber need make mistake brisson intend to stop here see game out to end captain jadby have to settle account what sort of account well jadby be kidnapping lady to whom be engaged ca expect to stand guess not assented brisson agreeably be hitched up with girl of spirit if anyone dare to clenched huge fist looking pistol dagger maxim gun be proper spirit brisson by way prelice got out cigarette might tell how much know of business very little reckon answered captain more more puzzled by young man coolness jadby madame came to london month ago started fortune telling racket while went to see uncle anchored boat in thames river went loaf round coast at time to keep barky in trim then other day madame sends message be to bring kanaro round here have done now be waiting for further order when jadby come on board with miss chent brisson nodded take order from son of sea cook can bet boot madame owner want to run in double harness with jadby rum though taste may be if be skipping with girl be madame lookout sail until give office prelice nodded approval in case jadby will get left remarked coolly for be trying to play low down on madame marie by way if know so little of game why detain well said brisson scratching head madame visited yacht at time when be swinging off gravesend told there be trouble over murder know about only what read in paper madame said that be taking hand in meddling way that 'd like to keep out of whole business a like madame who be dandy fine woman with temper put in quod moment heard name must stop here lord until madame come on board have acted in somewhat high handed manner without instruction to go upon said prelice calmly if wanted to make row must not in ship growled brisson oh think so yonder be port hole there be very much distance between boat shore also there be other steamer lying at anchor close at hand not to speak of boatman having be in position to be spoken to from port hole must fire shot two rouse harbour must have hailed boatman before sent away did none of thing why because be in very position wish to be in jadby be coming on board want to meet jadby to rescue girl to rescue young lady corrected prelice coldly if attempt to clear out with miss chent will make hot for what can do what said have revolver see prelice whipped out weapon before brisson must move have covered what be to prevent from shooting racing on deck to swim ashore captain did not move muscle can put gun down lord said with note of admiration in voice promise wo steam for southern cross until madame give word madame wo come on board then wait until doe retorted brisson will put that gun down be to be shot be more use to alive than dead said prelice slipped derringer behind handy for grip see tea be on table be infernally hungry brisson smacked great thigh looked at prelice with much admiration guess will come home on winner said a sat at table must just love to see get bulge on son of sea cook meaning jadby meaning jadby assented brisson gravely have salt tack hungry guest assented very readily ate decent meal of extremely bad sea food prelice be not fastidious when in wild passed over table like prairie fire at conclusion of meal brisson mixed tot of rum handed along box of very good cigar have never paid duty then to pas time until jadby arrived chatted amongst other thing prelice learned that brisson have met sir oliver lanwin did not like baronet
