opportunity of enjoying society of vicar for be ever grateful meg be constantly with though miss linisfarne liked such companionship relished infinitely more call of mr jarner be more inclined to society of men than to of own sex unexpected appearance of dan at farbis wrought revolution in quiet life here be handsome young gentleman for have doubt on point who conversed intelligently who have plenty of time at disposal to idle away at farbis court deprived for so many year of such congenial companionship miss linisfarne welcomed dan with enthusiasm made free of house a have before be

name station wealth to marry adventurer be what intended though tried to salve conscience with reflection one so handsome must be desirable in other respect yet must not help feeling that must be a well to discover antecedent before committing further to end sent for vicar in belief that if one must know something of attractive stranger if inquiry proved satisfactory be resolved to make husband to pitch of rashness did mad passion bear jarner guessed that coming interview have something to do with dan a also have heard rumour of miss linisfarne infatuation also have be present when dan be visiting have seen eager look of lady at guest needle to say greatly disapproved of way in be behaving resolved to speak mind at interview must turn on subject indeed a miss linisfarne have never sent

resembled that of man loved glanced occasionally at book on lap set forth history of elizabethan history have found in library on reading have discovered that sir alurde vagrant possessed many trait in common yet strange to say never crossed mind that there must be reason for such resemblance did guess that sir alurde be ancestor of man who chose to call dan have made discovery must have given pleasure a saw that dan be not in love with trusted to poverty wealth to bring about desired marriage vicar contracted brow a saw how infatuated be with picture for also be aware of resemblance meg have told a jest now that knew that dan be lord ardleigh no longer wondered at likeness be not at portrait looked at miss linisfarne change in appearance quite astonished for seemed year younger in

scorned in then state of mind needed assurance of jarner that dan loved meg to change miss linisfarne passive dislike of girl into active hatred have long be aware that meg be rival confirmation by third party showed how easily might lose prize at same time be sufficiently clever to see that meg be quite unconscious of dan devotion hoped by taking advantage of fact to draw away from one presumably indifferent to regard be difficult delicate task miss linisfarne deemed capable of carrying through come what may be resolved that meg must not triumph to forward scheme be necessary that must have interview with dan therefore sent note to dell requesting to call young man duly received invitation though reluctant to visit lady with whom name be connected by gossip must not find sufficient ground for refusal so sent back to say that must call at noon a desired have known of jarner interview might have be placed on guard so refused meeting must only end in disaster jarner be

nameless vagrant although tinker tim vicar knew name be well assured that miss linisfarne be ignorant of so must see reason to believe rumour of marriage dan be cautious astute young man in case have to measure wit against woman a natural consequence failed cleverest man be fool in matter when compared with even silly woman yet dan came through ordeal more creditably than might have expected miss linisfarne be by mean silly have plan prepared for subjugation of dan intended to tell meg indifference be caused by fact of having lover whom wished to marry there not being representative of mythical lover in parish of farbis miss linisfarne decided to locate at safe distance where must not be easily found be very clever quite forgot that dan insight into human nature be a keen a own that must find difficult to believe that mere child like meg must keep secret so important factor in life a future marriage dan be honest straightforward notwithstanding miss linisfarne fine spun web of sophistry contrived in end to break through though not without difficulty pain failed in one respect a antagonist be woman unscrupulous be successful in end a strong love for meg proved safeguard against wile of enchantress miss linisfarne received in own particular corner of drawing room knowing ill health dan quite expected to find stretched languidly on couch be astonished a jarner have be to find welcomed by bright eyed lady alert merry presided over tea table invited to be seated nothing loth for walk have given appetite dan drank tea devoured cake while miss linisfarne chatted to on unimportant subject be too clever to introduce meg name into conversation lest suspicion might be aroused left to make first mention of girl did while talking of mr jarner discussing matter incidental
