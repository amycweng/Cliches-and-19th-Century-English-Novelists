looking miss cranstoun be unavoidable made up mind to see a much of life a must during day of freedom proceeded to do so to own detriment morally physically pecuniarily when chanced to meet with eustace gartney eustace gartney whimsical in fancy took liking to lonely lad left to own device in such dangerous place a london persuaded to come to italy hoping to acquire influence over young man keep on right path until return to dunkeld castle there be certainly spice of selfishness in arrangement a eustace be attracted by exuberant animal spirit irish wit of lad formed contrast to general run of young men of to day to own pessimistic view of life so much a disliked putting out in way determined to stand by inexperienced youth save from impulsive good nature love of pleasure lord dunkeld deeming wise that angus must see something of continental life having full confidence in straightforwardness of johnnie armstrong agreed to journey much to son surprise be how hon angus

artificial existence riddle hard unguessable to everyone around for one thing always spoke truth that in be sufficient to stamp a eccentric individual who have motive for existence in society where friendship of member depends in great measure on dexterity in evading again gartney be iconoclastic in tendency loved to knock down break up otherwise maltreat idol society have set up in high place for purpose of daily worship goddess of fashion idol of sport deity of conventionalism kind be abomination to disrespectful young man who displayed lack of reverence for such thing be truly appalling be not a though have emerged from unseen world of lower class of upper ten know nothing to denounce folly fashion of hour indeed eustace gartney have be born in purple inherited plenty of money be brought up in conventional manner astonishing idea possessed so destructive to well being of society be certainly not derived from parent father mother have be of most orthodox type must doubtless have looked upon son eccentricity with dismay have lived a finished with thing of life shortly after be born be mercifully spared misery of reflecting that have produced firebrand indeed might have checked radical iconoclastic pessimistic folly at birth have lived fate willed otherwise in addition to robbing eustace of parent have given careless guardian who rarely troubled head about so that

bore without doubt singularly loveable man child adored animal fawned on friend ah be rub seeing that denied existence of such thing classing in category of roc sea serpent hippogriffs such like strange beast therefore dismissing word friend only applies to uncreated being substituting word acquaintance be good enough to ticket one fellow creature with acquaintance of mr gartney liked said liked very much absence in case doubtless made heart grow fonder a eustace be rarely in england preferring to travel in most outlandish region usual address being timbuctoo mountain of moon dominion

selfish feeling a be genuinely anxious to save friendless lad from dangerous tendency of impulsive nature nevertheless liking be not entirely disinterested seeing that enjoyed bright boyish nature of otterburn with impossible longing enthusiastic hero worship of so spoilt child pleased with new toy saw world fellow men in more kindly light than usual provided mood lasted there be chance that happy disposition of macjean might ameliorate to extent gloom of own temperament on part angus be flattered by friendship of such clever man moreover secretly admired cynicism of companion though truth to tell did not always understand vague utterance of oracle for gartney be somewhat enigmatic at time still on whole angus liked enthusiastic nature led to enuow idol with many perfection certainly did not posse thus two incongruous nature have come together how long such amicable state of thing must last be questionable there be always fatal rock of boredom ahead upon friendship might be wrecked if gartney grew weary of otterburn otterburn of gartney result must be well result be still to come chapter ii incomplete madonna be maid who hath look prophetic in eye longing for know not what yet if by chance when kneeling rapt in prayer raised eye to mother mary face within breast thought till then unguessed amazing dreaming virginal must show by vision motherly something needed to complete life

gaze hungry longing for fondling arm inarticulate cry of child only once have seen look on human countenance be on lady errington before marriage have same hungry look in eye can only be appeased by birth of child will give special love affection needed to complete life therefore call incomplete madonna for when becomes mother that yearning gaze will pas away for ever be succeeded by serene beatitude that painter give face of virgin when clasp child jesus to breast encircled by adoring host of heaven be very poetical interpretation of picture said otterburn when eustace have ended doubt however if must draw same conclusion be to see picture will not see picture refer to will meet lady errington then can give opinion be afraid will not coincide with yours if love be thus centred on coming of child when be born will love passionately to exclusion of husband perhaps replied eustace calmly however will see be curious study of woman character be anxious to see if idea be correct one of however be certain that day child be born to alizon errington will be sad day for husband if worship over much for will have to be satisfied with crumb of love fall from child table ah be one of

under gloom of distant mountain here by garish light of hotel pulse of life be beating strongly indescribable tone of idle frivolity seemed to clash with silent solemnity of nature perhaps eustace felt incongruity a eye strayed towards steel coloured water for after time willow conversation of victoria jarred so painfully on ear that with hurried excuse left young couple to own companionship wandered away alone into fragrant darkness of night be awfully fond of own company observed victoria indicating departing eustace queer taste hate being left to myself so do asserted otterburn eagerly

beauty of sky at interval across star smitten surface must move dark slim form of boat oar breaking water into thousand of flashing diamond far beyond glimmered orange coloured light of blevio sudden whiteness of tall campanile shooting up in slender beauty from amid dark mass of surrounding house sense of perfect fragrance in still air charmed silence around wondrous restful feeling under cool magic of night then mellowed by distance faint far like aerial music silver tone of peal of bell sounded at interval through clear atmosphere until whole night seemed full of sweet sound be night when

chapter ix oh wilt thou be bride kathleen say 'yes ' before part come joy woe say 'yes ' love thee so hope fill heart say 'yes ' before part there be doubt that angus macjean be very much in love with miss sheldon to wiseacre must appear rather foolish seeing that have only known three week a according to kit marlowe never loved who loved not at first sight otterburn have fulfilled such practical advice to letter however rapidly love have sprung up in heart in short space of three week have become sufficiently powerful to dominate other faculty a to wisdom of sudden passion be somewhat doubtful for two reason one being that did not know whether victoria must accept other that even if did father might refuse to sanction match very probable contingency seeing that old lord have already settled matrimonial future of heir under circumstance otterburn much a be in love felt rather embarrassed a to manner in must proceed adored bright eyed piquant beauty with soul so according to neck nothing tradition of love must have thrown other consideration to wind having inherited from father vein of scotch caution deemed wise to proceed with due circumspection gartney might have advised half hearted lover otterburn knew that lady love friend liked one so thought useless to ask for opinion must be diametrically opposed to own desire seeing therefore that there be nothing satisfactory to be obtained from eustace otterburn made up mind to find out indirectly what johnnie armstrong thought of matter may appear strange that must condescend to speak of such subject even indirectly to servant then johnnie be much more to than servant being old faithful friend of family who have seen grow up from childhood regarded in light of humble adviser to young heir in absence of mactab to whom johnnie deferred a spiritual adviser according to view of matter must have be quite incomprehensible to eustace who regarded valet a useful machine johnnie be ordinary servant although angus did not intend to ask right out how thought union must be received at dunkeld castle yet knew that once johnnie tongue be set going must soon find out wanted to know johnnie in represented home authority feeling very doubtful in own mind a to view might be taken of affair after much cogitation angus determined to ascertain sage johnnie opinion on subject one morning while be dressing broached idea in most artful way be standing before mirror brushing hair johnnie be hunting for special necktie have be told to find when following dialogue took place johnnie asked angus without turning head be ever in love johnnie paused for moment rubbed bald brow with one lean red hand weel maister said with habitual scotch caution will nae gang sae far a tae say michtna hae be there wi reed heeded mysie ye ken canty lass wi ' braw tocher ye will mind sir doon burn near kirsty lachlan ' ben ca say recollect replied angus carelessly girl be red headed about dunkeld well did love mysie maybe did said johnnie coolly ' maybe must hae made decent gudewife if hadna be for blithering sawney macpherson gowk wi ' daft mither whae yattered saul oot wi ' skirlin ' about braw look ' sae married wasna happy foregathering concluded mr armstrong spitefully for sawney ower fond o whusky ' meenister have warned fower time kirk o ' tabbylugs how do like italian girl asked master who have be listening with impatience to johnnie long winded story puir lot maister puir lot feckless thing warship scarlet wuman wi ' gew gaws ' tinkling ornament in high place be aye yelpin fra morn till nicht wi idolatrous procession graven image a religious view of godly johnnie did not interest otterburn proceeded what do think of miss sheldon johnnie be nae sae bad oh nonsense be angel weel have seen waur johnnie be evidently determined not to commit in way so angus spoke straight out what must say if married johnnie losh ejaculated armstrong in dismay ye will be clean daft to dae sic thing auld lord must never forgie ye maister ' mistress cranstoun oh hang be not going to marry retorted angus snatching necktie from johnnie paralysed grasp misdoubt what godly mactab wull spier d mactab hech just listen tae cried johnnie with uplifted hand meenister whae brocht up in psalm o david led by mony water through paraphrase hold tongue said master stamping foot did ask to make remark what be wull then demanded johnnie sourly do think there will be row if married aye do be very pretty ye mauna gang like th israelite after strange wumen be got plenty of money artful remark appealed to johnnie strongest passion considered question weel will nae say what that micht dae gude said cautiously oh maister be auld lord fear be meenister o ' tabbylugs a ye weel ken if ye get richt side o ' lug maybe ye can tac ' dochter o belial tae kirk if fear maister there will be deil tae pay angus made reply to speech a knew what johnnie said be perfectly true so having thus ascertained exactly how marriage to victoria must be taken rapidly finished dressing ran downstairs leaving faithful henchman shaking grizzled head in dour scotch fashion over probable anger of mactab daft bit laddie commented johnnie folding up master clothes tae fly ' face o ' providence aboot lass auld jeezebel whae dodder after must like fine be thinking tae see lass leddy otterburn will tac ' responsibility on laddie ma gang tae auld laird ' meenister will nay say aye misdoot maister gang ain gait for skirling meanwhile angus be standing at front door of hotel thinking over conversation have just have having considerable amount of common sense saw that johnnie armstrong be correct in remark about mactab being man of great shrewdness genuine piety have attained strong influence over somewhat stern nature of lord dunkeld who knew that mactab advice if not always palatable be essentially sound lord dunkeld have set heart on marriage of only son with miss cranstoun a ill favoured damsel be heiress to estate adjoining that to angus be heir such match must considerably increase territorial possession influence of macjean family in border land nevertheless angus though not fortune hunter knew that victoria sheldon be very wealthy in democratic age excellent match in way so provided father be satisfied regarding birth of young lady fact that mother be macjean be greatly in favour there be chance of success especially if mactab approved of however angus be doubtful for minister greatly admired miss cranstoun owing to assiduous attendance at kirk deuce take whole lot of grumbled otterburn a thought over wish 'd let fellow fix up own life one must think have feeling way order about cranstoun girl be a ugly a sin see why must marry just because be got next estate to ours why doe father marry if be so jolly anxious to get property a for mactab ought to mind own business instead of meddling with mine hang wo stand be not engaged to cranstoun thing so can do a like victoria go away to morrow lord only know when will see again so will take bull by horn ask to marry if wo there be harm done if will whole lot at dunkeld can howl hoarse for care having therefore made up mind in impulsive manner otterburn in order to give time to change walked off in search of victoria to offer heart father fondly trusted be in keeping of miss cranstoun of ilk miss sheldon be seated in chinese room writing letter so absorbed be in occupation that did not hear otterburn enter be lofty fantastical apartment with oval roof tinted dull grey on be traced red line of symmetrical pattern to resemble bamboo framing wall be hung with chinese paper forming kind of tapestry on artist ignorant of perspective have traced strange tree brilliant bird impossible tower bizarre bridge odd looking figure in four corner of room on slender pedestal sat almond eyed burly mandarin cross legged with long hand folded placidly on protuberant stomach pagoda shaped hat with jingling bell on pig tailed head chinese matting on floor lounging chair of bamboo work oblong table on stood barbaric vas of porcelain gave room strange eastern look suggesting thought of crowded pekin odour of new gathered tea vision of queer tower rising from rice plain under burning sky otterburn be not thinking of flowery land however a mind be too full of victoria stood silently watching graceful head bent over writing until by strange instinct warns everyone that someone be near raised eye saw standing close to door oh good morning cried gaily a advanced sit down for few moment interrupt be engaged in most unpleasant task writing to aunt jelly why be so disagreeable said young man sitting down in one of light chair creaked complainingly under weight very replied miss sheldon nodding head pursing up lip very very disagreeable being guardian always seems to think be in mischief have to report once week to like ticket of leave man rather woman do tell everything asked otterburn rather aghast with certain reservation yes hope be included in reservation well yes at least have not yet sent aunt jelly portrait of will ever gain that enviable distinction miss sheldon shrugged shoulder with laugh do think enviable to be dissected for benefit of carping old woman be sure besides a be friend of mr gartney will meet dreadful aunt on return to england can criticise instead of gaining impression second hand from if do meet hope criticism will be favourable why so because be ward see connection replied victoria with feminine duplicity heightened colour showed that understood meaning otterburn being by mean deficient in understanding regarding sex immediately took advantage of secret sympathy thus suddenly engendered between be very plain sort of fellow miss sheldon said with certain boyish dignity ca talk so glibly about thing a most men think can guess what want to say to paused for moment a victoria made observation drew long breath continued love want to marry if will have in spite of brusqueness of declaration crude in extreme adorned with fine flower of speech passionate protestation of eternal love victoria felt that spoke from heart that manly declaration be more to be believed than sickly sentimental speech of honey spice still made sign to show how deeply honest straightforwardness have touched scribbled idly on blotting paper with pen whereupon otterburn emboldened by silence gently took hand be lying on lap went on with increasing hopefulness of tone trust think presumptuous in speaking so soon although have only known few week yet in time have learned to love very dearly if will only become wife will do everything in power to make happy withdrew hand from grasp throwing down pen on table turned clear eye gravely on face then without maidenly confusion mock modesty answered calmly although tremulous quivering of nether lip showed how deeply be moved be doing great honour mr macjean assure appreciate manner in have spoken can not be oh surely replied lifting hand to stay further speech be only girl know then have be brought up in colony in matter think australian girl be more self reliant than in england might have be schoolmistress delivering lecture on manner so coldly did speak like respect love must marry man without loving have only known other three week so be in total ignorance of other character mr macjean much a thank for honour have done greatest honour man can offer woman yet must say no can give hope think must be wise to do so part to morrow may meet others like better so must be foolish for to bind in way otterburn seeing from cool composed speech that mind be made up arose to foot with look of despair on bright young face upon also arose from chair laid hand gently on shoulder believe will think a do later on said in friendly tone forget that conversation have ever taken place let be on same footing a before part to morrow a said before be more than probable that will meet in london if so let meet a friend composure with spoke irritated otterburn fearfully more so a be so unexpected brilliant piquant creature who must have be fire passion talked to a if be schoolboy argued about love a if be elderly dry a dust professor of science perhaps victoria knew a did not wish to marry thought that cold blooded way of discussing passion from worldly point of view must have effect of making care le about refusal to marry stood looking at one for moment man angry at what considered unjustifiable treatment woman composed withal trifle frightened at tempest have provoked well part friend said holding out hand with quiet smile angus looked at with glance of anger in eye coquette growled out between clenched teeth taking notice of extended hand left room quickly left to herself victoria sat down thought over scene declaration of angus have touched by manly honesty a have not thought of marrying mode of refusal have certainly be best possible in order to cool passion anger however fast word have uttered opened eye to situation saw that determination to spite eustace by taking friend away have be more serious than imagined reflection made angry with of course vented rage on angus simply because have treated badly stupid boy said to herself angrily might have seen be not in earnest never gave to understand must marry men be so conceited think have only got to throw handkerchief like sultan lesson will do good yet be nice honest boy be sorry did not part friend never mind expect will come back shortly be sure ought to beg pardon if be got sense of decency foolish boy tried to write felt too angry with angus whole world to do so therefore ran up to own room worried ill over whole affair ultimately ended up in having good cry fit of self commiseration meanwhile otterburn ' in towering passion walked outside seeking secluded seat under spreading oak sat down in most doleful mood heartless coquette said ill used young man aloud staring dismally at lake wonder what think man be made of to be preached at asked for love gave sermon good lord thought must have cried made fuss like other girl did confound fancy talking about ignorance of character stuff when fellow dying of love a to being friend be not style be not going to run after like poodle dog be driven away two minute will see gartney will go away at once will never see again never never never be emphatic at event said quiet voice at elbow on turning round saw eustace standing near complacently smoking cigarette oh be said otterburn in ill tempered tone yes forgive must help overhearing last few word spoke hope have be successful in wooing know what mean retorted angus sulkily stretching long leg out thrusting hand into trouser pocket beg pardon replied eustace ceremoniously have wish to force confidence master made reply glared savagely at boot while eustace taking in situation at glance stood silently beside not without secret gratification that otterburn have be punished for base desertion of friendship for love be so like gartney whose colossal egotism saw in success failure of others nothing what tended to own self glorification gartney said otterburn suddenly looking up be deadly sick of place everyone seems to be of opinion answered eustace complacently erringtons go to day mr trubbles to morrow of course la belle victoria accompanies be inconsolable be cruel of eustace knew be not retorted angus doughtily be not only girl in world wish to heaven 'd talk sense tell when be going to start when like for vienna be rather tired of vienna said gartney listlessly have be there four time be always same if mind 'd rather tried fresh locality care said otterburn with scowl will go anywhere to devil if like be looking too far ahead replied eustace ironically what do say to cyprus have be reading mallock book about seems one place not in grip of cook tourist baedeker guide book can take train to venice go down adriatic very well said macjean rising with huge sigh if mind will go to milan to day can follow to morrow right said eustace quietly judging best to let young friend go away for time get over disappointment in solitude will come with to como can see erringtons off at same time then will go tell johnnie to get trap together certainly look here old fellow although have not honoured with confidence can guess trouble worry about oh be very well for said otterburn reddening be not in love be not so sure of murmured eustace in dreary tone whereupon angus laughed scornfully doe sound like by way can say goodbye to mr trubbles for miss sheldon hang miss sheldon too retorted otterburn thereupon bolted so a to give eustace opportunity of making further remark love eustace philosopher doe not improve manner macjean be like young bear with sore head miss sheldon well be got scalp to hang in wigwam chapter x auf wiedersehn goodbye goodbye life divide drift apart on life broad tide faint hearted sad solemn eyed by fate decree goodbye goodbye not farewell tho ' side by side may not dwell day will meet who can tell if will be so time of parting have come at last a must come to men woman who have met by chance at italian lake be about to separate who must tell effect intimacy of last few week must have on future life seemed a though love romance of victoria otterburn be over killed by woman even if did meet again must be under such widely different circumstance that must surely never be able to renew earlier intimacy true to resolve otterburn departed for como without seeing victoria again eustace saw safely off in train with faithful johnnie in attendance then went to say goodbye to erringtons who be going up by st gothard line intending to stay few day in paris prior to returning to england goodbye old fellow said guy shaking hand with eustace in tumult of station when come back to town forget to look up wo forget replied eustace gravely though privately determined to keep out of temptation way a much a possible know when will be in england go to cyprus first then may look in at athens go up dardanelles must get married settle down said guy gaily what do say alizon be afraid to give opinion replied lady errington discreetly when mr gartney return may be able to say something looked at eustace in friendly manner a saw cold pure look in eye knew at once passion for woman might feel have not succeeded in awakening response in impassive nature statue statue said to poor guy say goodbye to mr macjean for said lady errington giving hand a to yourself will not say goodbye au revoir whistle blew shrilly train moved slowly off eustace with bare head holding hat in hand stood silently amid crowd with vision before mind eye of sweet face with cold pure light in blue eye statue statue said again a went back to cemobbio be foolish passion have for dare say few month travelling will make forget such chilly perfection exists on return to villa medici told valet to pack up everything be ready to start by early train next morning in order to meet otterburn leave milan by afternoon train for venice a victoria must be at milan next day otterburn did not wish to meet again a for young lady although did not care much about otterburn yet self love received rather severe shock when learned how promptly have taken dismissal where be mr macjean asked eustace that night after dinner a sat smoking outside in garden have gone away replied eustace who be anxious to prolong curiosity a much a must let drag fact of case piecemeal from reluctant mouth where to milan victoria flushed little under keen gaze tapped foot impatiently on ground thought be going with to morrow so did for reason preferred going by to day oh there be vexed tone in ejaculation eustace smiled to a thought of anger knew reason of abrupt departure so did eustace of perfectly understood one therefore when victoria saw smile curling corner of gartney mouth felt inclined to strike in exasperation why did not say goodbye demanded sharply know did not honour with confidence be lucky for eustace that victoria did not at moment posse regal power for must then there have ordered off to execution a must not do did next best thing to retreated gracefully from field of battle if be mr gartney must teach that friend of yours manner said superciliously however be not likely to meet again so doe not matter go to morrow morning do not yes go in afternoon so wo have pleasure of being fellow traveller goodbye goodbye shook hand coldly with mutual dislike then victoria went away gaily so a to afford eustace opportunity of seeing mortification when arrived in own room raged like young lioness how dare treat in way said wrathfully referring to absent otterburn because choose to marry need not slight so openly before friend ah that wretched mr gartney how detestable be always sneering supercilious must like to kill know there be doubt that triumph be now with gartney through own fault have refused offer before maker of have always taken defeat meekly continued to haunt step otterburn however have treated a man have ever treated before when grew calmer with whimsical inconsequence of woman actually began to admire independence be man at event said drying tear be glad be got mind of own if do meet again will make propose again in spite of temper then will pay out for going off like be truly bad look out for otterburn if remained in same mind then chance be that promptitude of action having secured admiration must end up by making love when met again be doubtful who must come off victor eustace on side be very much gratified by conversation have have with victoria after bidding farewell to mr mr trubbles went to bed in quite good temper next morning left cemobbio started for milan on arriving found otterburn at station looking tired haggard be due to want of sleep not to dissipation a eustace charitably surmised young man be in fearfully bad temper although be burning to question eustace about victoria yet own sense of dignity must not allow so during journey to venice sat in sulky silence reading book inwardly raging at fickleness ingratitude caprice of womankind since have last occupied railway carriage together change have certainly come over of instead of friendly talk sat in dour silence regarding other a insufferable nuisance cynical french proverb anent woman be without doubt very applicable to in present case might have be gratification to victoria wounded pride to know that have effectually estranged two quondam friend bond of sympathy formerly existing between have entirely vanished though be burning to make confidant of other yet must make first advance so sat grimly silent cursing luck in having other for companion otterburn did not venture to speak to eustace about rejection by victoria a be afraid of being laughed at by cynic eustace held tongue concerning passion for cousin wife a thought with good reason otterburn must consider dishonourable be quick coupled with dead felt so when reached venice although put up together at danieli by tacit consent saw a little of one a possible to great delight otterburn picked up old oxford chum one day finding

regiment who if report spoke truly must have be glad to have married lovely widow mr veilsturm however did not care to tempt matrimony second time refused major who nevertheless remained closest friend for deceased husband have made executor so wily major looked after entire property of husband consisting of small house in country large property of wife consisting of west indian estate to mutual satisfaction of widow major griff be invaluable to in more sens than one a knew everyone everything be enabled to float successfully in london society through influence of friend how be done pepperbox scribe did not venture to say although hinted that major influence in inducing friend to take up lovely widow be not due so much to friendship a to major possession of certain disagreeable secret however let mean used be what might mr veilsturm obtained social success in select circle became quite rage of season major tactic own craftiness added to undeniable beauty enabled to take up excellent position although next season people showed desire to drop mr veilsturm be too clever to let do so managed to confirm social prestige in most dexterous manner have plenty of money great beauty delightful house in park lane be admirable hostess so with galaxy of virtue society be fain to be content spoke well of to face although behind back characterised a adventuress be dangerous to

regarding gambling gambling yes rumour in guise of bewigged old lady over tea must be juvenile old men over something stronger said that mr veilsturm have very charming sunday evening very charming indeed trifle expensive to not greatly blessed with world good at sunday evening reception at late hour of night certain green covered table made appearance such production led to playing of nap of unlimited loo baccarat such like game over good deal of money changed hand be also observed that who ever lost major griff did not that good deal of money on table managed to find way into pocket have nothing to do with mr veilsturm certainly still be curious that wealthy woman must permit house to be turned into gambling saloon for sake of giving major griff nice little income so rumour once more set to work to solve problem made several startling assertion first that society have be imposed upon a mr veilsturm be by mean wealthy that west indian estate be myth emanating from fertile brain of

care that girl must not know of such weakness on part asked victoria good many question concerning people have met abroad particularly about otterburn of whom miss sheldon gave account quite at variance with real state of affair carefully suppressing fact that young man have proposed be refused in fact passed over acquaintance with so very lightly that succeeded in deceiving lynx eyed miss corbin a to feeling towards never by word deed hinted that have interest for in way although might deceive world must not deceive herself in reality thought good deal about man have rejected

month after arrival in england must doubtless have gained consent to marriage otterburn however have be deeply wounded at what deemed unjustifiable coquetry being intensely proud resolved not to submit to second slight therefore kept out of way if kind fairy have only brought two foolish young people together everything must doubtless have be arranged in satisfactory manner between a such aid be not forthcoming seeing live in time when oberon have resigned sceptre remained apart in ignorance of other feeling mutually blamed one for position of affair absence in case made victoria heart grow fonder felt that be really truly in love with angus a saw heard of have to lock up secret in own breast did not add to pleasure of life at invitation of lady errington went down to hall at christmas have very pleasant time despite heart ache a hostess made great deal of young nimrod of county quite lost head over jolly girl who rode so straight to hound taking fence like bird by jove

season kept keen look out for at place went to under wing of mr trubbles otterburn did not make appearance be only by chance that heard have gone to america for big game shooting in rockies evidently there be chance of proposing second time victoria must have put thought of doing so out of heart felt that loved too much to do so hugged secret with pain closer to breast until grew pale thin so that aunt jelly became alarmed about lung thinking be going into consumption with idea old lady who hated change took villa at san remo stayed there for month with victoria minnie pelch change did girl good when trio returned to town aunt jelly took victoria round of visit to several country house proved so successful that miss sheldon quite recovered lost spirit came back to london eager for

carpathians have be great success excitement of sport have for time quite put victoria out of head notwithstanding genuine love have for brilliant australian beauty returned to england however found thought constantly running on with piquant face constantly in mind felt inclined to seek try luck second time pride forbade to do so be certainly very foolish view to take of subject angus however be remarkably obstinate in thing a be determined not to run chance of second refusal put out of way of temptation by going up to scotland on visit to father thinking at dunkeld castle at least must have peace of mind be mistaken in supposition for father being delighted to find so improved immediately urged on necessity of speedy marriage with miss cranstoun master however to father dismay proved very obstinate on point flatly refused to marry lady refusal brought down on wrath of lord dunkeld mr mactab who tried to bully young reprobate into acquiescence plain looking miss cranstoun however proved too much for otterburn seeing that charming face of victoria sheldon be constantly haunting fancy notwithstanding art be brought to bear on held out against match in most stubborn manner lord dunkeld raved mactab quoted scripture to purpose at length becoming weary of dour look continual lecture otterburn abruptly left ancestral home in company with johnnie together with chum whom have met in venice started for america in order to have sport in rocky mountain wrath of home authority at unexpected revolt of hitherto obedient angus can be better imagined than described a there seemed to be absolutely way of bringing young man to reason be forced to let do a pleased for very shame lord dunkeld must not cut off allowance of only son so have to acquiesce in impotent anger in otterburn disobedience hoping that lengthened tour in america must bring young prodigal to reason induce to return to dunkeld castle matrimony submission such a however be very far from otterburn thought a have

malaria arose from marsh making whole neighbourhood unhealthy to live in gartney have residence much more comfortable situated in midland shire with usual fantastic nature preferred when staying in country to inhabit semi ruinous mansion whoever built must have be fond of solitude much given to self communings of dreary nature for certainly one with healthy mind must have found pleasure in contemplating melancholy stretch of marsh in hearkening to sullen roar of surge breaking on sandy shore few of gartney family have stayed in since erection be reserved for eustace in whom melancholy nature of far off ancestor be revived to make habitable residence perhaps weirdness of place have fascination for poet nature dismal fenland pleased distorted imagination at event eustace be rarely in england without paying visit to castle grim staying there few day before departure to distant land other people not being so fond of awesome place gartney must get ordinary servant to stay in consequently be left to care of aged pair man wife who did not mind where lived so long a have roof to cover food to eat chance of earning decent income looked after crazy old place thoroughly when master paid visit contrived to make pretty comfortable considering thing a rule lived robinson crusoe like life seeing one from week end to week end save when went into denfield for provision mr mr

slowly in dog cart with quaint old retainer beside portmanteau behind be very decent dog cart taking round horse in shaft be not by mean bad specimen of kind a gartney allowed javelracks decent sum yearly to keep up place made amends for lonely life by surrounding with luxury be able report said be miser perhaps there be truth in rumour whenever eustace came down always found thing in order so never troubled head to ascertain what proportion of income allowed have spent on place what portion stowed away in odd corner indeed if have found that two old servant be spending a little a must without being found out putting rest by for rainy day must not have be particularly annoyed for be only within right in having pleasure in castle grim eustace wrapped well up in ulster for wind blew very keenly across marsh a horse be restive soon left village behind be moving rapidly across straight road stretched narrow white thread until vanished on verge of horizon gable of errington hall showed whitely above sombre wood around after rapid glance at roof covered woman loved gartney shook rein impatiently to make horse go faster stared resolutely at red glare of sky lowering over wild waste landscape will see to morrow thought a hoof of horse beat steadily on hard white road then can see for how thing stand between guy long sombre cloud lowered heavily over crimson of horizon a if night like dark winged bird be waiting to settle down on chill earth keen cold wind blowing sharply from distant ocean brought salt odour of sea to nostril javelrack huge form bowed by age rheumatism caught from marsh mist sat grimly silent beside master with large hairy brown hand clasped on lap mahogany coloured face with wiry black beard so screwed up with facing cutting wind under weather stained brown hat looked like fantastic chinese idol eustace wrapped up in own thought paid attention to silent companion bowing head against blast indulged in vision of alizon errington dreary country with wide spreading marsh stretching on side for mile long straight road running through heart of swamp sluggish slimy pool of oily stillness fringe of stately reed swaying to fro in blast smooth patch of green grass pleasing to eye treacherous to unwary foot here there broken down fence deeply implanted in weed of luxuriant growth bordering deep ditch of black earth filled with stagnant water on floated green slime row of depressed looking willow on occasion gaunt stump of tree sticking up a if to mark site of submerged forest then suddenly against dull red of sky misshapen pile of gable chimney on verge of slight rise girdled by gaunt ring of leafless tree beyond heap of wind blown sand covered with sparse vegetation standing a barrier between marsh ocean tossed in wave of blood under evil red sky a moaned in querulous voice on starved looking strip of sandy beach be castle grim eustace stopped tired horse at door of house rather horse stopped of own accord giving rein to javelrack jumped down at door be met by mr javelrack large gaunt a husband with same embrowned face same distorted feature suggestive of chinese deity indeed a male javelrack took portmanteau into house stood by wife looked like two ogre inhabiting castle grim who be prepared to make meal of eustace a soon a be safely within wall male ogre however took master portmanteau into bedroom then coming out again took dog cart round to stable while mr javelrack face twisted into hideous grin meant for smile brought hot water for weary traveller be long with dinner mr javelrack called eustace a closed door sir croaked mr javelrack in hoarse voice a if have be frog out of marsh 'ull be ready a soon a sir mr gartney washed in warm water took away smarting feeling in face caused by keen salt wind having changed clothes sauntered into one habitable room of place did for dining room drawing room music room for eustace have sent down very good piano stood in one corner humph rather spoilt by damp said to a ran lithe finger over key perhaps amiable mr javelrack have be trying to cultivate music ogress brought in dinner waited on eustace in ponderous manner giving news of neighbourhood be remarkably scant talked through meal in subdued roar when eustace have finished removed dish brought in coffee after making up fire retired to kitchen company of mr javelrack gartney heard chatting even through thick wall for dampness of marsh have made somewhat deaf consequently shouted so loudly at one that be difficult at time to tell whether be ocean roaring ogre conversing be very comfortable room having be furnished by eustace according to own idea wall instead of being papered be hung with dull red cloth after fashion of tapestry waved at interval a searching wind crept in shrilly through crack cranny wide fireplace in blazed large coal fire between grotesque brass dog several comfortable arm chair on one side small book case containing selection of gartney favourite author at distant end of room grand piano with music piled neatly beside cumbersome old fashioned sofa deep square window with diamond pane quaint oaken seat set in depth eustace drew arm chair close to fire near to small table upon mr javelrack have placed coffee produced pipe be soon puffing away in most comfortable manner picked up slim volume of poem entitled rose dreaming turned over page listlessly a sipped coffee feeling drowsy sensation steal over verse in poem called temptation however roused from lethargic state throwing down book paced restlessly up down room repeating four line quietly to love so hard winning for ever will endure if world be sinning why must two be pure be afraid wo take same view a that muttered to discontentedly thinking of lady errington yet if doe love husband may have kindly feeling for a to child surely woman not even madonna can devote exclusively to still child be obstacle between herself husband so perhaps will be obstacle between herself oh must love must love if must only let will let be certain of guy have brain be starving for want of intellectual food child be excuse be real reason of coldness between one of most extraordinary part of gartney delusion concerning chance of success with lady errington lay in fact that present reasoning be diametrically opposed to view held when first meeting lady errington then asserted that must never care for husband when became mother must lavish love on child view of alizon character be correct one a eustace in innermost heart well knew wilfully deceived in thinking that now have obtained heart desire must give up for sake of man whom have hardly seen eustace however have be so uniformly triumphant with female sex that idea of failing with alizon never entered mind thought that if laid siege to lady errington in dexterous fashion must give up everything husband child name home in order to gratify selfish desire when came to england after many month absence in arabia gartney have determined not to see lady errington feeling that loved rather idolized memory so much that must not be able to suppress passion thus behave dishonourably towards cousin guy by running away with wife aunt jelly however by telling of estrangement between pair have banished honourable hesitation from heart a felt forced by fate to see woman loved face to face be very convenient excuse with to quiet conscience for wrong doing having settled in own selfish mind that fate be too strong for determined to estrange husband wife still further so that must have le trouble in overcoming lady errington scruple to dishonourable proposal idea held have be singularly strengthened by remark of aunt jelly when said that guy in present state must be prey of first clever woman came along eustace therefore determined to introduce guy to clever woman who must entangle in net woman have fixed upon in own mind for vile purpose be mr veilsturm be curious that must have fixed on special woman to do seeing that be ignorant of mr veilsturm grudge against lady errington did not know how eagerly must seize opportunity of revenging on woman who have slighted so scathingly merely chose mr veilsturm because be beautiful clever unscrupulous so hint to must be quite sufficient to induce to fascinate guy by mean in power eustace gartney be by mean thoroughly bad man indeed have very good quality although be to great extent neutralized by indomitable selfishness therefore suffered several qualm of conscience over dishonourable scheme have in hand intense egotism love of gratifying however came to aid argued into satisfactory frame of mind by heaven only know what sophistry doe care bit about husband reflected pacing room with measured stride never did care about be pity to see clever woman like tied to unsympathetic log with life will be much happier than with after get divorce will marry will live abroad where there will be narrow minded bigot to scoff at what will call false step will do at cost life will be blank without will be unhappy with guy so will be far best for of to come together even at cost of public scandal be sorry for guy one must suffer for many daresay in after year will thank for taking from wife from whom even now after le than two year of married life be estranged so eustace sophist a be argued in favour of dishonourable passion must have even succeeded in persuading that be much injured person by having to undergo such trouble for certain uneasy feeling that ruthlessly crushed down having settled plan to own satisfaction eustace have smoke then going to window drew aside curtain looked forth into black night wind be rising whistled shrilly round house lashing dark wave into line of seething white foam glimmered ghost like through gloom while overhead thin filmy cloud raced across sky over face of haggard looking moon must hear thunder of surge on distant beach wind muttering drearily among tree casting eye overhead saw pallid moonlight streaming in ghastly radiance through ragged cloud dropping curtain with sigh sauntered across to piano began to improvise weird fantasy in keeping with feeling aroused by wild scene without roll of sea wuthering of wind rustle of reed be transmuted into strange harmony under touch of skilful finger stealing out at interval from amid tempest of sound stole strange sobbing strain fitful wayward a breeze a if malicious demon be piping heart stealing love song to sky night lonely marsh remained time at piano following changeful fancy when clock struck nine closed instrument have one final pipe before going to bed a sat in front of fire looking into heart of burning coal went over again in own mind detail of scheme by hoped to secure cousin wife to yes said aloud in silence of room be all right there be flaw there be flaw however one in blind egotism complacent selfishness entirely overlooked be love of mother for child chapter xxi from husband point of view statue cut in marble white to give cold delight although 't be fair care for joy begin end with sight woman pure a virgin snow within whose vein life blood flow whose smile reveals love feel ah such one be be true rose next morning eustace made up mind to go to errington hall in afternoon meanwhile amused in leisurely strolling along beach watching wave rolling landward behind sand hill rose in low mound with scanty vegetation shutting out marsh beyond then came narrow strip of sandy beach on footstep left deeply imprinted mark before sombre under leaden coloured sky stretched heaving ocean with thin line of white crested wave breaking to cold foam at foot sky filled with rain charged cloud lowered heavily on chill earth midway flew wide winged sea gull uttering discordant cry be dreary scene eustace with hand clasped behind stared at dismal prospect be quite in keeping with own disturbed feeling be meditating dishonourable action knew so in spite of determination to carry through to bitter end felt oppressed by vague feeling of dread that villainy must be of avail in course of selfish life have done many foolish thing at world have looked askance hitherto pride have preserved from dishonour now stood on edge of abyss into be about to plunge of own free will in spite of egotistical philosophy trembled at prospect before supposing did induce lady errington to return passion leave england with what benefit must bring to to to ruined home memory of deserted child prospect of exile from social circle endless regret for fall to delighted companionship for time then sense of weary disgust of futile sorrow for past must not be undone constant discord between partner of shame be worth risk be running for chimera fanciful creation of own brain desire for vision might never be realised time with characteristic selfishness not thought for deserted husband for motherless child hallo eustace where be gartney arose to foot with ejaculation red blood rushing to face guy be guy cousin man whose wife loved man whose home intended to destroy even wrapped a be in triple armour of pride egotism self complacency felt sting of remorse be too late however to think of such thing having fully made up mind to act so crushed down feeling might have made better man went forward to meet cousin who be walking smartly along beach eighteen month have not made much change in errington save that be little stouter looked a handsome a ever only there be discontented look on face a if be thoroughly dissatisfied with life a indeed be have evidently ridden over a be in riding dress advanced towards eustace with one hand in pocket other holding hunting crop with carelessly switched boot well dear old fellow be glad to see again said coming to cousin holding out hand be very kind guy faltered eustace quietly shaking hand with feeling of remorse again dominant in breast be going over to see afternoon be said errington listlessly oh yes of course heard at village have come to castle grim so a be mounted thought 'd come on here have left horse with old caliban of yours came down to look up be very glad to see returned eustace turning away head will go back to house not yet responded errington throwing down on dry sand let talk here want to speak to privately eustace be best place gartney knew in own mind that errington wanted to speak about wife so sat down near recumbent form of cousin waited for to begin conversation nothing be said however until after moment silence guy looked up at gartney face with frown good lord man have left tongue behind in arabia said roughly leaning cheek on hand eustace laughed little bitterly perhaps must have be a well if have done so said deliberately might save soul burden of many lie a whimsical a ever do think so doubt solitude be rather apt to confirm man in eccentric habit by way have not told how wife be quite well replied errington shortly son heir on whose birth must congratulate oh be all right guy spoke last sentence in bitter tone eustace must not help turning round looking at be gazing moodily at sand glanced upward a felt rather than saw that gartney have turned round smiled ironically seem surprised said at length be surprised answered eustace deliberately when saw in italy spoke very differently very differently indeed ah see be in character of newly married man sneered guy picking up handful of sand letting stream through finger that sort of thing be over why be over asked eustace coldly eighteen month can scarcely make so much difference make difference in case why guy sat up suddenly clasped hand round knee staring at ocean answered in dreary voice utterly devoid of feeling daresay will sound ridiculous to man like eustace doubt world will laugh at when know reason can not help have fought against feeling a much a ever must have made sort of excuse for wife be of use be quite in dark a to what be talking about be talking about wife said guy deliberately know how much in love be with when married be not in love with now yes be then what have to complain of complain of echoed errington with bitter laugh have nothing to complain of according to view of world alizon be perfect wife perfect mother perfect woman in way in fact be what do complain of be too perfect good heaven man cried eustace now thoroughly exasperated understand word be saying if alizon be perfect a wife mother what more do want want love returned guy in low deep voice blood rushing to face want love affection be starving for one kind word can not obtain sound ridiculous doe not for man of year to whimper about love like silly schoolboy can not help married alizon in order to have true loving wife find be tied to statue can not understand of course ca cried errington vehemently leaping to foot how must cold blooded man who can do without love affection who doe care two straw about human being only adores phantom creation of own brain great heaven said unfortunate young man staring wildly up at leaden coloured sky if be only man like how happy must be be not be only fellow who want to be loved by wife even be denied married alizon for love loved then love now care more for than doe for yonder ocean surely child be bond of union between child repeated errington fiercely child must have drawn closer together have put farther asunder than ever longed for child to succeed in estate now have obtained desire wish have never be born hate child seems horrible eustace do hate talk like guy cried eustace springing to foot laying hand on cousin arm be terrible own child own child own child repeated guy with senseless reiteration yes own child thrust hand into pocket abruptly turning away walked short distance in order to conceal emotion while eustace stood silently in same place wondering at cousin grief over what appeared to to be such trivial matter might seem so to certainly be not to guy whose whole nature be smarting under sense of neglect injury after few moment errington returned with hard look on face cynical laugh on lip beg pardon eustace said ceremoniously for troubling about affair if have someone to talk to about believe must go mad went up to aunt jelly other day told what be now telling did seem to think much of make mistake there said gartney quickly aunt jelly thought great deal about in fact be because urged to see what must do be down here ca do anything replied errington listlessly one can do anything alizon be ill wedded pair quick coupled with dead be perfect wife perfect mother in eye of world possessing treasure in matrimonial way be most miserable devil alive eustace felt sudden pang of compunction at idea of misery proposed to add to unhappy young man life after short struggle between generous selfish instinct of nature former triumphed determined to do best to reconcile husband wife with new resolve in mind approached guy taking by arm walked slowly across beach with towards castle grim come to house old fellow said kindly be working into perfect state over nothing have luncheon with then will drive over together will do best to put thing right impossible said guy gloomily quite impossible how so be easy enough explained when married wife thought coldness must wear off did not to love tenderness be a cold a ice kind enough in cold blooded sort of way a far a answering tenderness feeling of sympathy might a well have be statue be hard enough to bear a may imagine when child be born be much worse be statue now by mean whole soul be wrapped up in child be never away from never stop talking about life in nursery never come near if offer to caress frown resents display of affection love heart be given to child have got to be content with cold look about five minute conversation day hardly ever see sometimes doe even come to meal when remonstrated with turned on in cold fury asked if wanted to neglect child what be to do eustace ca force to love against will ca keep from child there seems nothing for to do to be satisfied with life be leading now be hell eustace hell be big word to describe little thing be world must laugh at if heard talk one can understand unless undergo spoke with great emotion although eustace failed in great measure to understand deep feeling on subject must not see that cousin have great cause to speak young man of ardent nature to whom love be necessity finding tied to woman who chilled demonstration of affection lavished adoration on child of be father be truly pitiable situation yet one at world must laugh because tragic element be so simple gartney listened in silence to long speech saying nothing in reply made cousin have luncheon while thought over whole affair wo speak to mr veilsturm thought to pouring out guy glass of wine if can will bring together again then leave england for ever during luncheon talked gaily enough to errington cheering up by mean in power making up mind in meantime a to what be best course to pursue when meal be finished ordered javelrack to bring round horse with sir guy be soon trotting along road on way to errington hall now listen to guy said when be distance on journey think exaggerate good deal of thing be not half so bad a make out alizon be young mother know always adore first born to exclusion of everything else think be naturally of cold nature when first outburst of joy on child be exhausted will doubtless give that love be due so much need in meantime be foolish of to remain at hall a will only work up into frenzy over nothing solitude be worst thing in world for man in condition so best thing can do be to come up to town with for week so can not leave alizon alone objected errington in perplexity why not wo be lonely a have child besides if neglect a say be because

among descendant of ishmael have inoculated imperceptibly with strong belief in predestination in fact adaptability to way custom of east seemed to so marvellous that almost inclined to theory of transmigration believed have lived before amid lonely desert at event last sojourn among have developed instinctive vein of superstition in strongest fashion came back to england fully convinced that thing be preordained by deity call fate be very convenient doctrine a enabled to blame supernatural power for own shortcoming when anything happened out of ordinary course of event said kismet like veriest follower of mahomet with belief be little to be wondered at that believed saw finger of fate intervening in matter of love for lady errington argued question in style on return to england have determined to abstain from seeing alizon so a to keep out of way of temptation fate in person of aunt jelly have forced to meet against will in order to see if must bring about understanding between young couple yielding to passion have made up mind to gratify moved by spectacle of guy misery have gained victory over strove to reconcile husband wife with aim have taken guy up to town thinking short absence might be beneficial fate for second time interfered in most innocent fashion in world fate instrument have delivered young man into power of bitterest enemy by introducing to mr veilsturm hated lady errington must certainly do best to estrange husband wife still further thus field be left open to eustace to declare dishonourable passion twice therefore have striven to conquer

whence must have be able to go over to errington hall daily pay court to alizon feeling of honour however be not absolutely dead in breast so determined to await course of event see if mr veilsturm must manage to subjugate guy in case determined to interfere knew quite enough about mr veilsturm for opinion to carry considerable weight with lady although be not pleasant thing to step between panther prey yet made up mind to do so must occasion arise if fate intervened for third time rendered trouble useless eustace felt in own heart that further struggling against destiny must be beyond strength at present however have rather over estimated situation a guy be by mean abject slave of mr veilsturm deemed to be love for alizon although ill requited still have possession of guy whole being formed safeguard against dangerous assault of cleopatra errington be constantly in attendance on put forth art to enmesh in toil although three week have now passed saw that have not made much headway guy liked for kindly manner towards admired for beauty felt flattered by preference in reality be a heart whole a when first saw have wife lifted little finger must have flown to side without moment hesitation cleopatra be much too clever woman not to see felt rather nettled that man must dare to withstand charm moreover being bent on separating errington from wife have very powerful reason to do best in reducing to state of bondage therefore spared time trouble in attempting to do so errington love for wife however stood in good stead despite temptation to be subjected did not succumb in way major griff be by mean pleased with new fancy of friend partner a rule by dexterous management must make do what liked on occasion broke away from leading string did what pleased present desire to captivate errington be due not to feeling of love to more powerful one of revenge griff being astute reader of character saw that in present frame of mind must hing with be terrible

of number of men who have lost large sum of money at mr veilsturm hinted that west indian estate be myth that cleopatra be better than adventuress society suddenly discovered that have be deceived that base woman have passed off a purest of sex that have nourished viper in bosom so now society in righteous wrath be prepared to denounce mr veilsturm major griff with bitterest vindictiveness from

xxxvii truth about mr veilsturm have skeleton everyone hide away from cheerful sun tearful sad merry gay have skeleton hidden away eustace duly arrived at san remo tired out by long journey a have written to guy before leaving london be rather surprised not to find cousin waiting for at railway station however took matter philosophically enough after usual fashion although be seriously annoyed

seriously ill confined to bed must have come sir concluded man sir guy must let leave have just slipped down stair for moment to explain thing be very glad have come sir so be thought eustace a followed servant upstairs have idea be ill wonder must not come to england when entered bedroom found cousin be really seriously ill being in highly excited state asked eustace kind of question about alizon about death of child talked incoherently about mr veilsturm mixing everything up in most nonsensical fashion being evidently quite light headed gartney answered question soothed a well a be able be very much perturbed over matter although did not show real feeling at last got guy to lie down quietly then leaving room sent for doctor who be attending young man in few minute dr storge arrived tall spare man with keen clever face sharp manner who talked straight to point without loss of time yes mr gartney replied briskly to eustace enquiry sir guy be very ill indeed in highly excited state brought on by worry fretting saw that be in bad way about week ago when first consulted something will not tell about have occurred since then result well see upstairs surely when errington consulted explained explained nothing dear sir now be so ill that dare not ask a make excited be what wish to avoid perhaps can give idea of what be wrong yes can be necessary must know what be good of calling in medical man if intend to confide in said storge coolly know what balzac say that man reveals nothing to priest what suit to lawyer everything to physician want to find out cause of sir guy excitement then may do good a be well see for be working in dark reasoning appeared to be very just so gartney making virtue of necessity drew chair close to of doctor told everything fact be said eustace after pause during collected thought cousin wife have have quarrel about woman ah thought a much mr veilsturm what know nothing absolutely nothing replied doctor sharply have only put two two together fool know that make four more le well sir guy love wife very dearly belief that have compromised with know if ought to tell dr storge made gesture of despair thought be man of world mr gartney said quickly although appreciate delicacy with regard to well say mutual friend though only know by sight must insist upon telling 'go on dear sir go on confession be a safe with a must be with one of dingy priest in town being satisfied with explanation gartney smothered scruple went on talking see be use beating about bush doctor cousin have quarrelled with wife on account of mr veilsturm whom love pardon interrupted storge smartly mean love vastly different thing nonsense doe care two straw about said eustace bluntly if explain mr gartney cried doctor angrily will have a bad a friend upstairs then listen dear sir pray interrupt said eustace tartly mr veilsturm who be lady holding good position in london society thought slighted by lady errington in what way doe not matter determined to revenge by taking lady errington husband away from have succeeded cousin doe not really care for mr veilsturm owing to unfortunate misunderstanding with wife have drifted into false position woman have entangled in net wo let go until can bring about divorce will certainly be end errington have doubt have worried into fever over thing thinking be between devil deep sea other day only child died so expect news of death put finishing stroke to whole business understand said storge who have be listening attentively can quite appreciate position need hardly tell mr gartney that cousin be dangerously ill be honourable man who find in dishonourable position through fault of own knowledge have worked up into state of frenzy be afraid of brain fever good heaven hope not be afraid so returned doctor sagaciously be quite off balance with business however now be here thing may turn out better for must be kept quiet perfect rest be what be needed what be to do keep mr veilsturm away surely doe visit said eustace in astonished tone because in first place doe care for in second be too cautious to jeopardise position in society doe not exactly visit replied storge rising sends message flower fruit three cornered note rubbish of course keep perpetually thinking about then think about wife between two be afraid of result well will go see mr veilsturm said eustace grimly have doubt will be able to persuade to leave cousin alone envy interview observed storge who be sharp observer either still be fine woman fine devil retorted gartney with le than usual caution look like said doctor coolly going to door creole be ah thought so got considerable touch of tiger in must say must like to be under claw too risky well will go up see patient will go see mr veilsturm 'd better have lunch first said storge will need strength very good advice doctor will adopt at same time be afraid of be match for storge laughed looked keenly at gartney powerful face yes think be said carelessly have read look goodbye at present when doctor have vanished eustace sat down to consider situation be certainly rather problematic at present especially with regard to errington veilsturm episode when strikingly handsome decidedly unscrupulous woman set heart upon turning head of disconsolate man with somewhat weak character generally succeeds in task guy have be certainly rather weak with regard to sex feminine in bachelor day since marriage love for wife have be safeguard against dangerous raid of daring free lance owing to unfortunate quarrel with alizon however have lost shield of mr veilsturm have taken instant advantage securing thereby indisputable victory in england gartney have felt doubt regarding entanglement of cousin with cleopatra now saw plainly that guy be still true to wife that required utmost dexterity of charmer to keep captive in chain if must only be brought face to face with wife eustace be convinced that everything must be arranged influence of mr veilsturm over weak soul destroyed must like to have written to alizon asked to come over in order to nurse be reconciled to husband be afraid must not do so only thing to be done therefore be to try get errington cured a soon a possible take away from dangerous neighbourhood of cleopatra in order to do according to doctor be necessary to force mr veilsturm to leave victim alone a brought constantly to mind exercised malignant influence upon whole nature highly detrimental to recovery eustace therefore agreed with doctor that first thing to be done be to deal with mr veilsturm made up mind to do without delay a guy must not be removed from neighbourhood of mr veilsturm next best thing be to remove mr veilsturm from neighbourhood of guy in plain word to make leave san remo at once be difficult task involved disagreeable interview still desperate disease require desperate remedy so eustace wasted time in hesitation determined to call upon mr veilsturm afternoon a mr gartney be nothing if not methodical proceeded very deliberately with preparation truth to tell felt rather jubilant at prospect of tussle with cleopatra who be foeman rather foewoman worthy of anyone steel after cold bath invigorated considerably after tiresome journey changed travelling suit for one more in conformity with afternoon visit then made early luncheon followed by soothing cigar physical want thus having be attended to ascertained from liste d'trangers mr veilsturm be staying at villa garcia departed on errand of mercy cleopatra have certainly aptitude for making comfortable for villa garcia be charming little house with white wall vivid green shutter dusky red tiled roof embosomed among grey olive tree slender palm stood distance back from corso imperatrice from broad terrace there must be seen tideless blue of mediterranean sea church of madonna della guardia on capo verde sometimes glimpse of far off corsica floating in golden mist lying amid rose red cloud of dawn like brnnhilde within magic circle of wotan fire happily for eustace lady sought be at home so on sending in card be conducted to artificially darkened drawing room where mr veilsturm be seated in comfortable looking chair occupied with french novel fan one be with a major griff have gone off with thambits mr jiddy for day pleasure at monte carlo errington not being obtainable mr veilsturm be delighted to see eustace who be much more amusing than own thought be arrayed in loose dress of white chinese silk with great mass of scarlet geranium at throat waist suited so well that eustace with view to making everything pleasant must not help congratulating on appearance know be looking well said cleopatra indolently a gartney settled in low chair near south always agrees with so much better than smoky london come of being daughter of tropic suppose look in proper place under burning sky observed eustace poetically there be more of gorgeous cactus about than english rose be to take a compliment most woman must daresay then see be unlike most woman replied cleopatra fanning slowly be rather good thing think what horrible idea to be replica of dozen of one dearest enemy have enemy asked eustace looking keenly at plenty principally of own sex think doe trouble however a think be rather distinction than otherwise person without enemy must be without character by way mr gartney have asked what be doing in san remo what do think be too hot to answer riddle replied mr veilsturm languidly be sure ca tell restoring health writing book hiding from friend there have given choice of three answer none of be right have come over to attend to cousin errington how devoted of said lady ironically be not aware be so fond of cousin a be not answered eustace nonchalantly rather oversight on part seeing that errington have be close friend life angry colour glowed in cleopatra swarthy face a detected covert insolence in reply having sharp tongue of own lost time in answering ah see like doe not always draw to like certainly not in case reverse be true be not bit like errington in way for example can always take care of myself sir guy can not suppose not when there be woman in case a there be now mr veilsturm have never liked eustace a knew more about former life than cared must being eminently diplomatic woman have always treated a friend now however saw that attitude be distinctly hostile prepared to give battle be now matching wit against one knew must take wonderful skill cautious dealing in order to come off victor in such remarkably equal contest understand said mr veilsturm after pause try responded eustace curtly why must because understand well enough only wo admit do know gartney be very rude said creole quietly pshaw cried eustace angrily be use fencing with button on foil have come here for certain purpose know what be be sure said mr veilsturm doggedly none so blind a who wo see pithy retorted cleopatra sneeringly very pithy irrelevant not at a will soon show look here mr veilsturm be going to be plain brutally plain to do justice generally be be necessary in case especially in one said gartney quietly be not here to discus personal character to save cousin from presume exactly did not think must have admitted that have made false move in doing so saw that eustace have taken advantage of rashness so throwing down book sat straight up in chair spoke with firm deliberation be talking nonsense dear mr gartney be thing care about say have come here for certain purpose perhaps will be kind enough to tell meaning of remark certainly replied gartney promptly know about way consider to have be slighted by lady errington know that have tried best to inveigle errington into net in order to be revenged have come here to ask to leave cousin alone leave san remo very cool request upon word cried creole viciously with evil smile on angry face one intend to comply with think will be a well for to do so sprang to foot in fury stood looking at with clenched hand face convulsed with rage threaten do shrieked savagely how dare how dare will tell major griff will tell will tell one said gartney calmly be wo if be wise cleopatra stood silent for moment struggling with temper then stamping foot walked rapidly up down room eustace watching meanwhile with sardonic smile on lip also have risen to foot a knowing maraquita temper of old thought wise to be prepared for possibility at last lady collected sufficiently to talk quietly stopping opposite antagonist spoke in low suppressed voice be far more deadly in meaning than first outburst of wrath a say may a well take button off foil consider removed so far so good assented eustace not taking eye off go on carambo still remember spanish see said mockingly be not in south america now wish be hissed savagely bringing beautiful distorted face so close to own that felt hot breath on cheek oh wish be replied without blenching might treat a did manuel cried terrified expression flitting across face not that name not that name here then let keep to subject in hand said eustace politely if look must have killed gartney must have there then fallen dead at foot of creole suddenly changing tactic flung on sofa in storm of tear how cruel be oh how cruel wailed hiding face in cushion be only woman coward only woman be remarkably good actress dear mr veilsturm replied eustace coolly in wise moved by sorrow tear be very weak try something else more original after scoffing remark resumed seat waited till passion must have exhausted happened very soon for mr veilsturm be too sensible woman to waste weapon when found be useless drying eye carefully sat up again quite cool composed warned eustace that must be more on guard than ever cousin fool said viciously do think be pleasure for to have running after hate detest persistent bore that be think 'd better drop flower of speech replied eustace leisurely be pretty necessary go on with main subject will come to quick enough retorted mr veilsturm sullenly be right about lady errington did slight in way woman can forgive forget 'd hate if be only for fact that be gabriel mostyn daughter traitor hate twice a much on own account vowed 'd punish for insult will too by causing divorce that separating altogether think have managed that now can think what please said eustace coolly at event have done worst not yet not yet oh yes have now be going to write cousin letter saying care about well say what like give to understand wo see again then demanded with sneer then will leave san

with ah so think have enough proof to do so do what like defy don t think will be wise of to do so said eustace in low voice of concentrated fury know lola know world of south america know also jumped up crossing over to sofa bent down whispered in ear can tell about connection with gabriel mostyn in regard to boy son who disappeared have nothing to do with muttered shrinking from manuel lopez be silent little gambling saloon at lima hush for god sake will ruin intend to said eustace relentlessly unless pointed to desk without saying word arose to foot dragging slowly across room sat down at desk began to write eustace said nothing remained standing by sofa with smile of satisfaction on massive feature nothing be heard in room steady ticking of clock scratching of mr veilsturm pen a moved rapidly over paper in few minute came back to holding out sheet of paper read carefully without taking out of hand will do said quietly will be so kind a to put into envelope direct darting look of hatred at showed how hard be for to control temper returned to desk did what asked then leaving on blotting paper went to seat by window while eustace picking up letter glanced at address slipped into inner pocket about leaving san remo asked turning towards mr veilsturm will leave in three day replied harshly will that suit yes wo see again bon voyage turned to go mr veilsturm voice arrested of course will say nothing about south america said quietly no have done part will do mine must go to lima again if be said mr veilsturm with deadly hatred might be dangerous have doubt of replied eustace carelessly if want to turn table have better send emissary to africa left room without word cleopatra sitting at window saw walking down garden path be holding handkerchief in hand with sudden anger tore in two if have only be in south america said in low fierce voice oh if have only be in south america chapter xxxviii last temptation death ever rends asunder marriage bond so must die husband undesired must be free to woo wed again might haply gain hand heart yet there be folly in argument for such course must breed sterile love seeing first link in chain of circumstance be ominous indeed dead man grave having thus routed enemy eustace returned to hotel very well satisfied with victory hoped must be productive of good in removing obstacle to reconciliation of husband wife for own part felt considerable astonishment at self abnegation of conduct seeing that be doing best to place woman loved so devotedly beyond possible chance of being anything to since last interview with lady errington astute man of world have be quick to read true feeling have therefore given up hope of winning love besides have arranged with laxton to go to africa have not be for accident of guy illness must have started almost immediately for mysterious continent since thing have turned out otherwise resolved to do duty by cousin even against desire of gratifying self be true have done in power to conquer dominant faculty of egotism have parted with alizon for ever have saved errington from machination of mr veilsturm great temptation be yet to come in guise least anticipated by tempted of course told dr storge about success in delicate matter of mr veilsturm at success physician expressed highly delighted a undoubtedly thought that removal of disturbing influence on errington life must have beneficial result on health doctor be not infallible however result of attempt to quiet patient mind only succeeded in exciting still more state of case considerably dismayed storge gartney guy being under impression that wife have cast off for ever have be touched by interest displayed towards by mr veilsturm clung to idea of disinterested affection a drowning man cling to straw old simile certainly one hold good in case thought that wife did not love that have never loved that cleopatra be only woman who have tender feeling towards in heart be true that world notoriously ungenerous critic said that be capricious cruel fickle a wind still so cleverly have feigned love did not feel that errington really believed have inspired genuine feeling in hard heart day when tender message arrived for with present of fruit flower mentally thanked heaven that one woman at least truly loved remembered in hour of trouble when however message with accompanying gift of fruit flower ceased to arrive wondered at omission became querulously suspicious why have forgotten what be reason of sudden change must be false to seeing that have made such protestation of love no must not be yet there must be reason be question kept continually asking thereby working into such mad frenzy that seemed a though nothing must avert threatened attack of brain fever true to promise must cost too much to break mr veilsturm have departed from san remo taken up abode at nice together with major dolly thambits mr jiddy alleging that found italian watering place dull preferred lively gaul to more sedate latin errington however knew nothing of sudden exodus excited brain suggested thousand reason for sudden silence of quondam charmer be ill be afraid of exciting have be called to england on business what must be reason of sudden change from attention to neglect from warmth to coldness day night night day weary brain puzzled over perplexing question suggesting discarding thousand answer with tick of clock eustace did best to allay cousin excitement without telling truth to purpose so in despair spoke seriously to storge a to what be best to be done under circumstance thing ca go on like much longer said decisively if cousin be ill when arrived seems to to be much worse now be very difficult case remarked storge musingly so difficult that hardly know what step to take have made keep to room see one given sedative yet be better in fact think be only at beginning of trouble well have got that woman out of way said eustace bluntly so be something gained be not so sure of replied doctor biting nail habit have when irritated of course advised be done for best still upon soul mr gartney must think fool here be duly accredited md yet know what step to take in order to cure patient be perplexing sighed eustace drumming with finger on table errington have got into head that woman be good angel faugh to what length will love carry man said be not in love with neither be be one of rare case be veritable enigma most unaccountable a far a can see whole thing be simply cousin think wife hate a mr veilsturm have played game so cleverly belief love doe love be intensely grateful for what think be disinterested kindness now have withdrawn light of countenance imago that be forsaken for second time feeling be one of absolute despair cans't not minister to mind diseased quoted storge musingly very true remark of shakespeare seems to judging from theory with must say agree be in very much same dilemma drug be use while mind be in such turmoil cure mind gartney will cure body be very well saying that replied eustace pettishly give hardest task suppose send for wife wo come surely when know tell wo come repeated eustace sternly think have behaved shamefully be afraid be rather unforgiving storge ran hand through hair in most perplexed fashion made reply a be quite at wit end what to suggest be a suggested more mental than physical case though felt competent to deal with nerve brain tissue be quite helpless in emergency required aid of external circumstance external circumstance be best known to eustace gartney so gentleman be only man who must have influence in matter tell said gartney after pause during have be thinking deeply errington imago mr veilsturm angel of light be worrying because think good woman have forgotten suppose show to in true colour then then finished doctor caustically will fix up nicely for very bad attack of brain fever be one presumption only one agree with will undeceive about mr veilsturm then will see snare have escaped oh do think will quiet asked dr storge sarcastically think will turn thought back to wife if so will write to to come over what about forgiveness will tell be case of life death will surely soften whirl about like weather cock friend said storge grimly tell decisively that wife be unforgiving wo come then say might soften view be right one impossible nothing be impossible with regard to woman what do say to plan know what to say then will try said eustace determinedly approve of remarked storge in desperation still a be case of brain fever if thing go on like chance of accelerating disease doe make much difference so 'd better begin disillusionising at once very well replied gartney with sigh of relief closed conversation be disagreeable task to undertake not more so than connected with mr veilsturm eustace made up mind to speak to errington at once sooner thing be brought to crisis better thought a went up to cousin room a stand now be quite impossible to move way guy be lying with arm outside counterpane when mr gartney entered turned eye unnaturally bright in direction of door when heard cousin footstep anything from mr veilsturm asked eagerly nothing responded eustace took seat beside bed what can be matter with said guy feverishly eustace why find out be cruel of to keep in suspense wo keep in suspense longer what guy sat up in bed with cry eustace forced to lie down again keep quiet wo tell said sternly by way if want albert have better go downstairs want to speak to privately yes yes can go albert mr gartney will stay with well trained valet bowed head in answer arranged few thing on little table beside bed then noiselessly withdrew leaving cousin together well eustace well said guy plucking restlessly at bedclothes what be matter nothing wrong with mr veilsturm not that be aware of responded gartney drily be lady who can take remarkably good care of talk like about said guy with weak anger be friend friend repeated eustace scornfully yes same kind of friend a be to man eustace sat up again with fierce look on face calm gaze of cousin disconcerted sank back on pillow with impatient sigh understand said fretfully understand head be aching aching terribly guy old fellow said eustace in low soft voice have indescribable charm in tone want to speak to about wife wife yes have confession to make to love wife guy looked at cousin vacantly a if did not understand love wife repeated mechanically love wife yes said eustace steadily going through self imposed ordeal with stern determination although face be grey with anguish heart ached with pain humiliation be terrible thing to confess to to husband true nevertheless when first saw at como worshipped for calm spiritual loveliness made so beautiful in eye said nothing went into exile for sake trusting to come back find happy wife mother went away to forget came back to remember oh guy if only knew how have despised for thus thinking about wife believe be not in sensual fashion of world loved worshipped a one might worship star be higher purer than who kneel to splendour love be pure still strove to crush out of heart in vain came back to england saw once more happy mother indeed not happy wife be not fault poor boy for know did best to win heart child blinded better nature must not see that father yearned for love required a much a son then came episode of mr veilsturm be one of cruel decree of fate man can guard against parted a thought for ever obeyed instinct of lower nature while remained sternly unforgiving in purity purity must not understand temptation of weaker soul tried best to make look more kindly on mistake a be living man guy did best to bring together again be useless then lost head devil whispered in ear spoke to of love result be what might have expected from wife told that loved child must not stoop to dishonour for sake said more not in word indeed in look in manner in irrepressible tear that loved guy that be sorry for cruel justice that longed for father of child for husband of vow to clasp in arm once more be punished for daring to lift eye to saw must be nothing to such spotless purity of soul
