be poor knew so did madame alpenny so did one in boarding house yet implied doubt resolving to ask for explanation when occasion served young man dismissed particular matter from mind thought of misfortune in losing zara have always admired now that have spoken to so eloquently admired more than ever hitherto more le silent have never displayed common sense quality of mind before therefore

present be very miserable only hope of escaping from mother clutch in manner described enabled to endure trouble hench in new character of brother consoled promised to do what must to forward aim did not see at present moment how must do anything madame alpenny returned on third day other absentee still remained away old woman looked very satisfied with hinted that have done good business must improve zara position be markedly civil to hench encouraged greatly to pay attention to daughter a two now understood one to do be easy for hench to pay for zara to receive madame alpenny remained in dark a to true meaning of comedy then on second day after return surprising thing happened with have to do what be hench learned while sitting at lonely breakfast madame alpenny who always took meal in own room came down unexpectedly arrayed in greasy dressing gown flourishing newspaper in hand rhaiadr rhaiadr called out excitedly what doe mean hench looked at in surprise tumbling water told said after astonished pause remember mean that clapped express on table before pointed with one chubby finger at advertisement mean what do make of rhaiadr one can have anything to do with word father hench more puzzled than ever by excitement read advertisement upon finger rested if rhaiadr read aloud will come to gipsy stile at cookley essex at eight o'clock on st of july will hear of something greatly to advantage there said madame alpenny triumphantly looking more shapeless than ever in dressing gown what do think of have nothing to do with said hench with shrug nothing to do with screamed why name rhaiadr show that have everything to do with go there see what mean ah always said that be mystery now be sure of rubbed hand chapter v next step hench must not help admitting that mention of peculiar welsh word rhaiadr in newspaper have something to do with undoubtedly be person whom unknown advertiser wished to meet whole matter be so strange unexpected that determined to think over carefully before taking step for reason said little to excited hungarian lady who be rather annoyed by reticence did not take notice of hint retired a speedily a possible to own room there lighted pipe sat by window read advertisement twice thrice again after laid down newspaper so that might think more freely thought have to do with past life when travelling with father record of earlier day be bare enough a hench decided when recalled same father have paid stranger to look after immediately after death of mr hench when owain be only five year of age for year lad saw very little of parent who be always moving from one place to after fashion of wandering jew then came education at private school afterwards wider training at winchester later owain have expected to go to oxford father finding need of one to lean upon in old age have summoned boy to berlin unexpectedly be mysterious parent proved to be aristocratic looking gentleman perfectly dressed perfectly acquainted with motley continental world perfectly heartless hench senior frankly acknowledged that cared for one turned son into kind of superior servant two travelled over europe in moderately good style a mr hench always seemed to have enough to keep in comfort if not in luxury last also obtained by gambling a frequently won large sum of money be always squandered in extravagant whim fancy if owain have not possessed sterling thoughtful nature must have be ruined by hand to mouth existence be distinguished by continual ups down young man have own view of leading decent life when unhampered by spendthrift father determined to carry out opportunity did not come to until be twenty year of age when mr hench died in paris be buried without parade in pere la chaise cold hearted selfish to end passed away without suggesting how son to whom have given profession be to exist simply told to go to gilberry gilberry solicitor of lincoln inn field on twenty fifth birthday when certain paper must be handed to thus can be seen that young man have little reason to regret demise of so egotistic parent who have be curse rather than blessing what paper in charge of gilberry gilberry might contain owain must not guess have dying father enlightened fancied that might have something to do with proving identity of dead man owain have always suspected from strict silence preserved by father about past that hench be assumed name hoped that mysterious document might afford clue to family history sole clue young man have to guide to knowledge of sort description be mention of father of rhaiadr a place where have passed youthful day yet word have proved to be of value for mention have evoked memory of madame alpenny early romance although story have proved to be more interesting than useful now appeared that talismanic word be being used to lure to meet stranger who a advertisement put must tell of something greatly to advantage owain having reached point of meditation rose to pace room consider position be of two mind about answering summons since open air meeting seemed scarcely business like even reasonable also be now last week in june appointment be arranged for first day of july on tenth day of month came birthday when must be placed in possession of paper for have waited so long young man considered prudently enough that must be just a well to curb curiosity for nine day a document might throw light on admittedly odd advertisement if obeyed summons to gipsy stile cookley essex on first of july must be at disadvantage of being in dark since must know nothing while person who met must know much rough tumble life have led since death of father inclined owain to prudence a knew from dire experience what tricky people there be in world therefore determined to take notice of advertisement at event for present since have week to think over matter calmly wait until became possessed of paper on twenty fifth birthday finally resolved to say nothing to spruce who luckily have not yet returned to ask madame alpenny to keep nut in ignorance of advertisement certainly must have to be more le frank with hungarian lady since have drawn attention to notice in express madame alpenny be full of curiosity when met hench at afternoon tea a have room to immediately proceeded to ask question hench baffled a well a must found difficult to do so appeared to be certain that be more of mystery than ever insisted upon scenting fortune in same naturally a zara mother be anxious to know if belief be correct a then hench must make girl wife supply meritorious mother in law with ample fund a usual wore eternal orange spotted dress shabby bead mantle flamboyant picture hat looking quite merry old blackguard of adventuress hench have long since decided that be such one of course will keep appointment said madame alpenny eagerly when handed hench tea be not sure see may not be person wanted pfui said woman contemptuously large dark eye sparkled why word rhaiadr prof conclusively that be person be strange mr hench continued with great vivacity must have heard word from only few day before advertisement appeared be very strange assented young man with eye searching face know nothing about advertisement suppose eh why must asked in amazement only by chance did see name rhaiadr immediately brought paper to remembering conversation of day back presume sir went on with shrug that think put in advertisement oh by mean said owain hastily might have mentioned welsh name to one else said madame alpenny decidedly be mentioned only to zara took little notice of what mentioned of course there be mr spruce who be in room when talked about meeting with father be not likely to have asked to meet in essex when can see here day also probably have not seen advertisement oh suspect spruce madame that reminds will be a well to say nothing to spruce about matter be chatter box fool asked madame fiercely with lowering look on face certainly will say nothing to mr spruce must tell take place when meet whosoever be to meet be going to meet one retorted hench resolutely there be need for to do so friend will hear of something greatly to advantage a said in newspaper expostulated woman frowning mean to wait until get paper from lawyer on tenth of july madame may tell of something greatly to advantage without going on wild goose chase into essex understand objection be if go now be quite in ignorance of family history with appointment have to do a shrewdly suspect if go after tenth of july will be in better position to deal with matter a think paper at lawyer will tell much about father madame alpenny nodded there be something in same advertisement concern not father who be dead buried paper also concern father past life therefore concern present argued hench seriously have waited so long for light to be thrown on past can easily wait few day longer have made attempt to get at past up till now oh yes after father death went to lawyer hench did not intend to tell madame alpenny name of firm asked about paper admitted that have promised to deliver on twenty fifth birthday otherwise must say nothing what did do what must do save go away do best to keep alive for five year went a sailor on tramp vessel met with many adventure found that have talent for writing in san francisco managed to get short story of mine accepted printed paid for then went to peru afterwards to south sea coming back to england through australia china india persia rather roundabout way of progression admit be like leaf blown by wind of fortune bitter wind be in one way chiefly by writing short adventure tale managed to keep afloat year came here six month ago to wait for tenth of july here met zara said madame quickly hench looked at with peculiar expression raked brown beard with outspread finger be on tip of tongue to relate how have be refused by girl on second thought refrained according to zara mother have quick temper if be told girl might suffer from temper also madame alpenny being given clue might learn that zara bracken be engaged knowledge must assuredly lead to trouble on whole therefore hench decided to be silent replied evasively ah yes met charming daughter of course admired persisted madame not finding speech sufficiently ardent in tone admired to extent of asking permission to propose to of course when refused that because be poor have changed mind a gentleman can do le a lover can do much more retorted old woman with look of annoyance remember be favourable to proposal when learned that be son of man who wished to marry so long ago yet be still poor said hench ironically have yet to be proved rejoined madame bluntly oh look so astonished friend be old be shrewd have learned by experience that two two make four paper mention together with advertisement plainly refers to appear to proof that will inherit money see madame unless of course father gave hint that there be money in family mr hench gave hint said lady

give one address sir be yours till death folded arm with noble air hench drove away rather bewildered boy be mad said boy be not chapter vi seeking trouble be for two reason that hench left home of mus vanished so far a paying guest be concerned into unknown in first place wished to render zara position more easy in second desired to have nothing more to do with madame alpenny also there be third le important reason have to do with cuthbert spruce while owain drove westward in taxi amused by surveying position with regard to girl hench be beginning to grasp fact that really did not love must have be more moved by frank confession of love for bracken what have said be quite true a now acknowledged admired being lonely wished for companion so a to make centre in life round must revolve be odd comparison very true one other woman handsome kind hearted affectionate must have done a well a zara to bring about desired end owain confessed to that to propose such business like scheme to girl be rather cold blooded way of looking at love be confessed also quite right to refuse to accept offer of man who adored being case hench decided that only remained for to go away since presence must more le embarrass in spite of brother sister compact finally being very human owain felt that be impossible to stay witnessing bracken triumphing where have failed on whole therefore be well pleased to escape from bethnal green feeling suffered very little from exile second reason have madame alpenny for excuse be also connected more le indirectly with zara refusal since idea of money coming to have occurred to hungarian lady have be more amiably disposed towards hench with regard to half hearted wooing of daughter yet a be still uncertain that owain must be rich have not according to slang phrase forced pace if fancy became fact mysterious paper really did place in possession of fortune hench felt tolerably convinced that madame alpenny must worry worry zara until brought about marriage under circumstance be not to be thought of a apart from fact of readjusted relation with girl madame alpenny be by mean desirable a mother in law be poor inquisitive scheming decidedly dangerous always on alert to make what must out of others a hench believed unscrupulous in method of gaining what desired already have told more about private affair than be altogether wise more le against will a must seem since have wormed way into confidence with remarkable dexterity struck forcibly that be wise to avoid by leaving boarding house congratulated on promptitude in dealing with situation a have done so judiciously be unlikely that madame alpenny must ever trouble again be when taxi be sweeping down quiet street near british museum owain came to third minor reason concerned nut also be much too curious about affair nothing to do with in way seemed to take pleasure in meddling be just kind of person to read other people letter give unasked advice take thousand liberty out of pretended good nature same hench firmly believed that interference be intended in end to benefit spruce owain must not see how old school friend must in way make capital out of nevertheless instinct warned to avoid man a something dangerous by leaving mr tesk establishment have avoided be a unlikely to meet again a be to meet with madame alpenny taking everything into consideration hench alighted at new abode with conviction that have escaped from danger must not put name to just in time owing to unexpected good fortune in connection with gold mining share hench possessed quite one hundred pound be sufficient to keep in comfort even in luxury until must call on gilberry gilberry visit expected must result in throwing light on somewhat dark path perhaps must bring wealth yet being cautious husbanded resource lest expectation must be disappointed therefore hotel came to be quiet cheap hostel in burney street bloomsbury chiefly patronized by country people be much better class establishment than of mr tesk hench found very comfortable have be there on former occasion when in england found very little change manageress be same staff have not be altered on whole owain felt that place be more home like than have be in also having risen out of submerged tenth young man brushed up apparel have hair cut beard trimmed got out scarcely worn suit of dress clothes for next week amused in quiet way generally sauntering in park exploring museum enjoying theatre music hall taking what quiet inexpensive pleasure came in way wished to do be to pas time pleasantly until twenty fifth birthday when intended to call on gilberry gilberry then must learn fate future career must be ordained by content of paper time hench be haunted by uneasy feeling regarding advertisement brought to notice by madame alpenny have stayed at boarding house assuredly must not have obeyed request for meeting a woman must have become aware that have done so did not wish to do since regarded a dangerous did not know what result of errand to cookley must be now that madame alpenny belonged to past owain be inclined out of sheer curiosity to keep appointment for st of july learn why word rhaiadr have be used of course a have already recognized paper at gilberry gilberry might place in possession of detail must enable to deal more openly with person who wished to meet at gipsy stile wanted ten day to birthday by brooding over advertisement hench became so curious that finally decided to take journey into essex there be spice of adventure about matter appealed to pioneering spirit moreover a have nothing to do thought that might a well employ mind time in satisfying curiosity according to dr watt satan find mischief still for idle hand to do never be line so exemplified a by hench action although did not know be going out to seek trouble when left hotel for liverpool street station besides being haunted by advertisement hench during week in bloomsbury have be also haunted by feeling madame alpenny be somewhere in vicinity twice thrice have fancied be at elbow have a many time made sure that have caught glimpse in distance of orange spotted frock bead mantle picture hat a walked to railway station feeling be insistently strong hench found searching crowd here there everywhere for sinister face red hair of old woman saw one who resembled until be descending stair after taking ticket to cookley then be positive that in throng moving below recognized shabby garb of course did not find when mingled with mob laughed at trick eyesight have played why must be so haunted by woman in thought be a did not believe that there be ground for suspicion must not say be not until be seated in third class smoking compartment that shook off feeling of near presence be case of nerve assured by time be well on journey thoroughly convinced of fact at event a train gradually left london behind owain quite got rid of nightmare cookley be slightly over thirty mile from metropolis so hench having left latter at five o'clock arrived at destination somewhere about half past six o'clock appointment at gipsy stile be precisely at eight so have hour half to wait time employed in learning whereabouts of rendezvous a have not least idea of direction in lay a there be hurry took thing easy sauntered leisurely out of local station down long road led to village after lengthy period spent in smoky city pure air rural sight of country be exceedingly pleasant village be not large decidedly picturesque being one of somnolent old world hamlet beloved of artist wondered at by tourist formerly stranger came near since advent of ubiquitous motor car have become quite centre of interest be mainly owing to squared towered norman church venerable stately structure be much too large for so small place also there be saxon cross on village green sundry roman remains in adjacent field archologists antiquarian together with tourist chiefly american frequently came to inspect object of interest artist often took up quarter in bull inn to paint church ancient cottage surrounding country be quite nook student must have loved much too quiet for restless young man such a owain hench assuredly be quicksilver in vein never allowed to remain long in one place yet even confessed to feeling charm of cookley one took much notice of for slight be thankful in shabby suit of blue serge woollen shirt ragged panama hat looked like ordinary tramp gentry of road be much too common in cookley to be even glanced at also night be closing in in soft warm twilight young man passed almost unheeded fact upon afterwards have reason to congratulate after wandering through several crooked street emerged into gracious space of village green made for bull inn easily recognized by gigantic sign where treated to tankard of beer in tap room owain really did not require drink ordered so a to give excuse for question ancient of village be already gathered for evening symposium room be filled with blue haze of tobacco smoke be none too well lighted by solitary oil lamp hench sat down in secluded corner to enjoy briar sip ale also when occasion served asked buxom wench who attended to thirsty customer where gipsy stile be to be found looked at in surprise why one hereabouts know where be be stranger here one of tramp ai said girl tossing head well ca miss gipsy stile there be path leading out of churchyard across meadow that take into heart of wood where will find right in way oh be in wood be questioned owain secretly wondering again a have wondered before why such rendezvous have be chosen why yes parley wood be called lie long side squire evans old house there be only red brick wall divide wood from park thank said hench politely attended to beer pipe while villager talked politics crop local gossip amused by listening to crude view in old day before cookley have be brought into near contact with outer world stranger must have be more closely observed conversation must have be listened to so many tourist now came to village that inhabitant paid little attention to in dark corner owain sat for close upon hour wondering at narrow limit of cookley intellect still be interested in old fashioned view of labourer time passed quicker than noticed glance at watch showed to surprise that be few minute to eight so rose hastily to seek destination a have already paid for beer there be nothing to detain be speedily passing through green on way to square tower of church stood up blackly in luminous twilight so far a owain must guess there be danger of losing way narrow lane sloping slightly upward to lychgate conducted to churchyard soon found surrounded by tombstone old new dotted irregularly amongst long grass of enclosure keeping to gravelled path made circuit of vast church finally came to stile set in stone wall girdling place on climbing over found foot treading well defined path meandered across wide meadow to enter into parley wood be visible distance away owain with aid of match found that be eight o'clock chime of church again assured of fact fearing lest must be late hurried quickly long leg soon took under shade of ancient tree here be somewhat dark hench have eye like cat must very easily follow path wound deviously through woodland around in fragrant dark life be stirring heard piercing song of nightingale occasional hoot of owl became aware that sundry creature be moving more le noiselessly amongst undergrowth at time moved across dell where light be stronger then again must plunge into gloom of tree young man enjoyed adventure apart from reason have led to undertake a have great love of nature enjoyed beauty at length emerged into wide clearing across ran ragged fence of time stained wood overgrown with woodbine more le buried in nettle darnel shrub young tree in centre of there be old fashioned stile owain took to be place of meeting beyond open ground stretched for distance faintly in warm twilight must see tall wall beyond thick foliage of oak beech elm be undoubtedly place a remembered how girl at bull inn have assured that wood lay long side park of squire great distance from red brick wall therefore owain walked briskly up to stile taking off straw hat for sake of coolness looked round place to see if person who have advertised be waiting saw one glance at watch after lighting match showed that have be fifteen minute walking from church to stile so wondered if person have grown tired of waiting be unlikely since be not so very much behind time man presumed that be man who have advertised must certainly wait longer when have taken so much trouble to bring about meeting hench therefore believed that something have detained person in question sat down on stile to wait already moon be well up in cloudless sky silver radiance flooded whole solemn woodland owain admired mingled beauty of light shade listened to distant nightingale singing triumphantly stared now then round about to make sure that must not miss man since did not know from quarter must appear then came surprise highly unpleasant one in course of glancing here there everywhere became aware that in long grass distance beyond stile distance away from meandering path lay dark object at first hench thought be merely trunk of tree a moonlight grew stronger outline of object more distinct began to believe that be man doubtless a concluded hastily tramp have thrown down to sleep in safe cover of wood where policeman must rouse from slumber hench knew that be scarcely wise to sleep in moonbeam so clambered over stile walked towards man with intention of awakening shortly be bending over presumably sleeping tramp then became aware with shock of surprise that man be clothed in evening dress over dark loose cloak have be thrown with vivid feeling of fear hench turned man over be lying on face started back with ejaculation of horror stiff white shirt front be red with blood in man heart be buried knife with horn handle owain struck match to assure of truth although moonlight be so strong that scarcely needed to take such trouble while held match with shaking hand over dead face wavering light showed very plainly that be right man be dead man have be murdered there lay mysteriously done to death in heart of lonely wood of course hench first impulse be impulse of ordinary human being when brought face to face with crime be to run back to cookley village give alarm even a turned to fly halted struck with sudden thought made blood freeze in young vein have be lured to place by mean of advertisement here found dead body of man not long stabbed to heart be trap have be brought to solitary spot to be entangled in crime seemed very like swiftly thinking over matter hench did not see how must exonerate must give alarm with feeling of absolute terror bent over dead so a to make acquainted with appearance of poor creature there be doubt that man be gentleman since be in evening dress be wearing stud sleeve link of gold together with silk lined overcoat rather cloak face be clean shaven with aquiline nose thin compressed lip decidedly that of handsome man from lined countenance white hair owain took to be about sixty year of age although being dead there be astonishing look of youth about even a hench stared line on old face seemed to fade away leave young smooth yes be gentleman a be apparent from well bred disdainful face did not need evening dress silk lined silk sock patent leather shoe to show man station in world here a occurred to owain be gentleman who have strolled into wood after dinner there to meet with terrible death at hand of unknown person starting to foot young man remembered how girl at inn have talked of squire evans estate lying long side wood divided therefrom by brick wall here be wood yonder wall in question so came strongly into hench mind that dead man be squire evans who have killed why have be killed hench looked round searchingly into shadow of tree must see lurking form whosoever have struck blow have done so shortly before hench arrived a body be still warm still supple after man be dead sure enough must be useless to run to village for succour in fact must be dangerous a owain thought with fear knocking at heart for how must prove innocence of crime there be motive for to kill unknown man certainly not even motive of robbery a stud sleeve link have not be taken by assassin hench wavered between desire to consult own safety by flight wish to rouse village hunt hot footed for murderer for two long long minute pondered over horrible situation then without backward glance raced at top speed along unknown path leading into further recess of wood while ran heart beat tumultuously perspiration beaded forehead body shivered with cold in spite of warm night safety be what made for tore onward a if officer of justice be already on track innocent man yes be innocent man yet circumstantial evidence might hang in spite of same innocence instinct led hench to avoid returning to london by passing through village boarding train at cookley station already thought of possibility with terror face figure might be remembered by keen sighted yokel there be conversation with girl in tap room have talked long enough with to be remembered even though atmosphere hazy with smoke have only be illuminated by one dingy lamp then again have spoken about gipsy stile have asked where be at gipsy stile murder have taken place then there be advertisement police must be sure to find out if there be reward offered madame alpenny might speak to authority about same then must be linked with crime run risk of arrest when confronted with girl at inn must probably recognize then what possible defence must make to accusation of murder many other thought buzzed like distracting bee through owain brain a fled from awful place idea be to get away to reach other railway station to hide in london remain quiet until saw what police must do on face of must be safe nowhere yet with instinct of self preservation plunged onward through wood in hope of escape hench be brave man have faced many danger to be hanged for crime have not committed to be entangled in circumstance over have control made choose least of two evil once twice halted in headlong flight wondering if must not be best to return give up to village policeman a after have motive to kill man moreover must produce advertisement resolution be momentary simply must not face trouble even though did best to screw up courage to sticking point wiping forehead drew long breath strode onward be too late now to think of returning a body might already have be found must do be to walk on on on in hope of leaving terror behind after leaving wood hench found traversing other meadow similar to near cookley church bordered narrow lane into stile afforded access from lane gained high road from sign post learned that must conduct to london at first owain intended to walk on until arrived at nearest railway station for there be yet time to catch late train to town on reflection decided to use leg a there must be le danger in solitary pedestrianism than in venturing to ask for ticket at local station where appearance might be observed also night be warm moon gave full light journey to london must be more pleasurable on foot than must be be cooped up in train besides be much too agitated by what have gone through to sit quiet under gaze of fellow traveller innocent though be conscience made coward of knew that careless eye cast upon must make wince be safer to walk so walk did owain never forgot that thirty odd mile tramp through lovely summer night when a saying go saw bird in bush certainly be guiltless of crime yet fate have connected with one felt like cain so strong be power of imagination again again asked if must not have be wiser to dare worst trusting in god justice own innocence again again came reply innocent men have be hanged ere now on purely circumstantial evidence that have done right to fly danger of judicial death hench cursed for not having waited until twenty fifth birthday have taken notice of advertisement a originally intended to do must not now be in plight be too late to blame now have come to rendezvous have found dead body have fled like true criminal from spot so be use cry over spilt milk be in store for must have to face a have sown so must have to reap chapter vii amazing discovery owain reached hotel in early hour of morning finding one about sleepy night porter who be just leaving have difficulty in getting to bedroom almost unobserved once in haven drew long breath of relief wearied by long tramp threw on bed without undressing notwithstanding anxiety have increased instead of lessening speedily fell fast asleep into heavy dreamless slumber resembled lethargy rather than natural repose be high noon when woke feeling much refreshed a hungry a proverbial hunter considering trouble in be involved be fortunate that travel have steadied nerve to face worst if need be result of experience of danger led to prepare for possibility therefore took cold bath to brace dressed more carefully than usual with great deliberation went down to make excellent breakfast a yet hue cry be not out against so have ample time to consider position over pipe in smoking room glanced at several of daily paper naturally found therein nothing about murder in parley wood at cookley be more than probable that evening news must contain account of finding of body for hench knew description of a criminal of however be uncertain since have not be noticed closely in twilight conversation with girl of bull inn have taken place in darkish smoky room dimly lighted by solitary lamp of course girl must say that man have asked where gipsy stile be to be found person have conversed with must be suspected questioner assuredly must not be described unless serving wench be sharper than owain gave credit for being only very inquisitive observant person must have examined closely enough to give fair word picture of to authority owain experience led to believe that few people ever did observe with much degree of accuracy so far a girl at inn inhabitant of cookley be concerned felt tolerably safe there be person to consider in connection with adventure be madame alpenny hungarian lady certainly knew that be man required to meet advertiser at cookley a use of word rhaiadr have enlightened on point therefore be probable that when detail of murder be made public must inform police about matter woman did not know that have kept appointment a have given to understand very plainly that did not intend to do so assuredly feeling that be at elbow have haunted when have set forth on errand have fancied that have be lurking about liverpool street station even then have set down faint belief to imagination so there be reason why must conclude that actually have be spying on in fact did not see how possibly must have done so since have not given address only bottle knew that bottle a hench felt sure be to be thoroughly trusted so far young man must see cause for alarm hour reflection made resolve to make thing doubly sure against discovery thanks to twilight dimly lighted tap room hench made sure that description given of appearance must be more le vague be not likely to be recognized by one in hotel when appeared in newspaper nevertheless so a to place matter beyond doubt paid bill packed luggage took departure late in afternoon for victoria station here left box portmanteau in cloak room went down to south kensington in search of quiet lodging before venturing to inquire for same owain sought out barber shop in brampton road have heavy brown beard removed must rather have shaved so a to do away with possibility of barber noticing description in newspaper even though same be vague inaccurate to do be impossible must not change appearance before leaving bloomsbury hotel without exciting remark did not wish to present at new lodging in degree like old self a be known to paying guest of mr tesk establishment therefore be obliged to risk barber razor barber curiosity one thing be certain that when emerged from shop one must have recognized for man who have entered removal of beard altered wonderfully making look year younger improving good look in marked degree owain sat in barber chair bearded colonist of type dear to penny fiction rose from looking like hermes of vatican even hairdresser exclaimed at extraordinary transformation complimented on improved appearance hench be rather annoyed that man must take so much notice paying hurriedly departed a swiftly a must without exciting suspicion then walked down brompton road sought out quiet side street in south kensington where knew there be room to be let place be already known to during last six month a under same roof lived old school friend with whom hench have kept up correspondence on returning to england have looked up friend have renewed acquaintanceship with uncommon fervour therefore owain deemed best to live near so that might make use of must trouble ensue from adventure may be remarked that friend be barrister a such so hench considered must be able to attend to legal detail if necessary room in question be still to be have a voluble landlady assured mr hench so engaged for month paying rent in advance then left message for friend returned to get luggage from cloak room in victoria station by seven o'clock owain be installed in tolerably comfortable bedroom sitting room be dawdling over hurriedly provided meal friend be informed be not expected back until nine o'clock so hench passed time in reading evening paper have bought at railway station when getting luggage in two of found what sought account of parley wood crime be necessarily meagre a so short time have elapsed since discovery of body that police be not in possession of much information appeared from scanty detail that dead man be a hench suspected squire madoc evans lord of manor owner of cookley grange have gone for stroll in wood shortly after dinner not having returned search have be made with result that poor old gentleman be found stabbed to heart near gipsy stile weapon used to execute murder be common carving knife with horn handle medical examination showed that evans have met with violent death about half past seven account ended with information that police be making inquiry in hope of tracing criminal a yet have be unsuccessful owain breathed more freely a there be word of girl at bull inn of conversation with still be early day yet young man felt very sure that shortly must speak out account of man who have inquired where gipsy stile be to be found must assuredly appear in print then must depend entirely upon memory acuteness of girl whether must be traced of course if madame alpenny became suspicious owain be positive that must become so story to police must certainly result in arrest then when confronted with girl of inn there must be small chance of denying identity with tramp who have made fatal inquiry hench felt extremely uncomfortable in spite of innocence longed to have one to whom must talk freely later on in evening while gloomily smoking in armchair young man thought that must trust old school friend james vane be quite different man to spruce who also have be at same school be a true a nut be false after much reflection hesitation hench decided to unbosom to barrister since danger environed be so great that must not deal with unaided at nine o'clock precisely sharp knock came to door of sitting room hench sprang up to greet visitor

strong circumstantial evidence vane stared reflected have beard when saw last now shaved to day so that there might be chance of being discovered by description that girl at bull inn might give girl at bull inn what do mean hench lost time promptly gave full account of adventure from time left liverpool street station to moment that sat down to dinner in very room in two be speaking vane interrupted frequently face grew grave a recognized that hench be in woeful plight of course have acted like as confessed owain in rueful manner how must have acted jim sitting in chair being wise after event must have faced thing out said vane slowly have be in shoe in wood must probably have run away a did paused shook head stared at carpet damn muttered emphatically thought best to speak to murmured owain anxiously vane nodded quite right what be use of pal if doe rise to occasion after if madame alpenny doe speak to police ca prove to be guilty have motive to murder evans be quite stranger to quite same same hold confounded tongue insisted barrister advice to be to sit tight wait event madame alpenny exactly if be old adventuress think be from description certainly appears to be think need have fear for moment why not because will wait until be in possession of paper on twenty fifth birthday if place in possession of money will be silent on condition that marry daughter wo nothing must induce to marry girl who love man oh say that must marry that madame alpenny must try make marry until hope fails in direction will say nothing about advertisement of course if there be money old hag will split especially if there be reward a squire evans seems to be landowner rich man expect there will be reward see then best thing for to do be to wait exactly will support can talk heart out to be good fellow jim why half believed must think talk bosh vane jumped up irritably why be whitest man know old school pal a soon believe guilty a now be off to bed go thou do likewise worry after speech shook hand with hench two parted for night for next nine day have many such talk kept well informed of progress case be making so far a must learn in print of course girl at bull inn did tell police about interview in tap room of course great capital be made out of a owain have suspected girl being inobservant not having seen very clearly in smoky dimly lighted atmosphere gave most incoherent account of appearance must say be that questioner be rough looking tramp with bushy black beard who spoke civilly enough who be not gentleman vane chuckled when read unflattering description be sufficiently wrong vague to preserve hench from suspicion indeed if girl have be confronted with hench must never have recognized in handsome clean shaven young gentleman fashionably dressed rough tramp who have drank beer in tap room be vane who made owain dress fashionably so a to make look a unlike old bearded self a possible took to tailor to haberdasher to bootmaker to various other tradesman with result that owain new wardrobe did full justice to handsome look hench being of pioneering legion rather kicked against being thus civilized recognized that vane be right to insist upon transformation madame alpenny might have thought did not put thought into action for nothing appeared in paper likely to show that hench be suspected by police inquest on squire madoc evans body be duly held verdict be brought in of wilful murder against person person unknown although one be pretty certain that shabby tramp who have inquired way to gipsy stile be culprit have vanished thanks to madame alpenny silence word came to police suggesting identity with owain hench funeral took place in due time gave owain thrill when read that body have be taken to rhaiadr in wale for burial be said that evans came from place that ancestor be buried there incidentally be mentioned that dead man have left daughter who inherited cookley grange by father death became lady of manor think be right now said vane when matter reached pitch after nine day wonder excitement will gradually die away by jupiter cried barrister be exactly nine day owain old son be birthday off with call on gilberry gilberry wo come also jim wo ca get into trouble in respectable legal office be so changed that one be likely to spot a man who be wanted for squire madoc evans death owain be content to go alone although felt slightly nervous strongest card must anything come out be that have not known evans therefore have reason to kill by time be growing used to situation since madame alpenny be holding tongue why acted in kind way must not understand accepted explanation provided by vane however if came into money probably must find out move in matter therefore be with reluctance that hench went to gilberry gilberry office in lincoln inn field wanted to let sleeping dog lie be unwilling to become rich a by doing so must certainly bring madame alpenny down on head same hench felt very curious when faced white headed old gentleman who be head of firm be rather astonished by warmth of greeting received be glad to see said mr gilberry heartily come in nick of time dear young friend to do what sir to inherit ten thousand year what owain became pale with amazement gilberry chuckled oh yes be a say mr evans what cried owain again time louder with quavering voice of course of course old man chuckled once more think that name be hench not so not so be owain evans of rhaiadr heir of squire madoc evans of cookley grange in essex what relation be to to to oh yes know why dear sir madoc evans be uncle owain gasped turned a white a corpse have seen in parley wood chapter viii family history like m jourdain in moliere comedy vane be only surprised when found virtue in unexpected place certainly be astonished in direction when hench stumbled into chamber white faced wild eyed trembling barrister hastily arose supported friend to chair a hastily produced glass of brandy to hold to lip drink owain commanded wondering what have happened to put visitor in such state say word until feel better hench drank whole glassful of fiery liquor colour began to return to wan cheek did not speak a requested sat in chair with broken down look startled vane more than showed looking anxiously at friend came to sole conclusion must come to seeing what knew in connection with hench adventure madame alpenny have found out hench shook head be worse than that muttered faintly then worse be better must brace up to face be vane irritable retort have glass of brandy although approve of dutch courage more brandy wait bit will soon pull round vane nodded approvingly turned back so a to give man time to recover went to window looked at busy traffic of chancery lane in thoroughfare chamber be situated same be directly opposite that gateway lead into lincoln inn field through highway byeways of pleasant ground sacred to goddess themis hench have evidently come straight in way from office of gilberry gilberry vane wondered how have managed to arrive without attracting observation being stopped so wild have be look when entered chamber journey be very short truly appearance of man be sufficient to warrant interference evidently unexpected have happened to throw hench into abnormal state with shrug of shoulder vane turned to see how be getting on hench smiled faintly a met inquiring gaze of barrister wiped forehead be wet with perspiration then essayed to speak apologize succeeding after one two desperate attempt sorry jim must help myself seems like snapped vane trying to bully into calmness have never before seen hench so upset a man be usually very quiet controlled something very bad must have happened to unnerve in way must like to know what be meaning of went on vane crossly upon sam owain if did know be sober chap must have believed that be drunk when came in wonder policeman did run in between here be inn field did see people staring at replied hench in stronger voice a brandy have done work be rapidly recovering balance perhaps if have come by longer way might have got into trouble see distance yes yes vane dropped into own favourite chair know about old son come to point what be up have have shock oh lord a if most stupid person be not must see a much can only conclude madame alpenny have told police be in danger of arrest yet deny that such be case do madame alpenny have nothing to do with particular matter yes have have shock be right now hench shook like dog coming out of pond drew long breath then continued to talk calmly first remark be question if did get arrested jim suppose best line of defence must be to say that not knowing dead man have motive to kill be opinion admitted barrister well well there be chance of taking up line of defence why not told that did not know squire evans did contradict admission then why ca defend if necessary on score will answer question by asking who be vane stared looked wholly bewildered owain hench so thought now learn from gilberry gilberry be owain evans what vane uttered ejaculation in a astonished tone a hench have done in solicitor office be relative of dead man be nephew well unexpected be always happening commented vane after pause of sheer surprise even so a did not know uncle never met can still say if necessary that have motive to murder ca owain rose began to pace room ca be worst of jim a say did not know never met evil tongue might give lie seeing what stood to gain what did stand to gain ten thousand year ten thousand year vane echoed word with gasp of astonishment say owain mysterious paper left by father did mean fortune after a madame alpenny suspected hench nodded sat down again with disconsolate air be dangerous position that be in owain evans of rhaiadr with ten thousand year come to now that uncle madoc be dead be who be knew nothing about inheritance who will believe that asked owain derisively already a tramp who asked way to gipsy stile be accused of crime must truth of keeping appointment become known motive of gaining ten thousand year will be imputed to a excuse for committing deed go too fast owain said vane sharply remember only gilberry gilberry have information can prove that knew nothing about same on first of july when man be murdered true enough same kept appointment persisted hench stubbornly who be to prove did not have long interview with uncle in parley wood who be to declare that did not admit be heir that death must place in possession of so large income remember jim that be poor man must do much to gain ten thousand year man like owain must hing mean dishonourable cruel to gain double sum said vane sharply be fool be fool know jim other people supposing madame alpenny tell what know to police set on track doe know address told so told truly doe seeing have given usual name at hotel stayed at to landlady of lodging in south kensington there wo be much difficulty in police finding people will talk know have shaved off beard too that might be quoted against a sign of guilt might assented vane restlessly for recognized that position be dangerous one depends upon madame alpenny so far have made move now that really be rich will hold tongue provided marry daughter suppose inquired owain dryly of course woman be adventuress a say mean to make money out of marry daughter supply with fund will place in power of possible blackmailer hench face became dour obstinate in look even if madame alpenny placed in dock at new bailey wo marry zara give old woman single penny be with old son vane leaned forward shook friend hand can depend upon to do can to pull through be good sort jim to stand by said hench much moved pooh pooh pooh take right view of friendship be said vane cheerfully come old man let discus situation have ample time a madame alpenny will hold tongue until openly refuse demand be sure to make who gain time gain everything lot of thing may happen before can place neck in noose be in dangerous position be wish to minimize risk undervalue madame alpenny a enemy remember owain that be not enemy until give cause to be so by declining to marry girl pension madame thus police will learn nothing for many long day meantime can act in what way why in trying to learn who really did murder uncle vane drew long breath by jupiter old son wonder be knocked of heap by information that have new relative ten thousand year oh be that upset explained hench with shrug knowledge that uncle be dead man found in parley wood gilberry gilberry know that suppose of course not kept that information to did even so far a must gather know anything about advertisement must have spoken about said nothing very wise of wonder mused barrister why uncle put in advertisement to make understand jim will be necessary to repeat family history a mr gilberry told to be have be wishing to do for last fifteen minute old boy here take cigarette make comfortable when be in possession of fact will be in better position to advise need advice sighed hench lighting up well shed tear over sonny fire away vane banter anxious desire to cheer up did hench good produced large blue envelope out of pocket contained several paper young man glanced at doubtfully then laid on table can examine at leisure said leaning back comfortably in chair will tell story instead of reading will be best assented vane brightly begin scheherazade grandfather said hench conversationally lived at rhaiadr in south wale where family have resided for century be minor prince believe before first edward conquered country dwindled in importance a century went by when family estate came to grandfather all have be considerable property in rhaiadr tumbledown family seat be called mynydd evans curious christian name commented vane lighting fresh cigarette yes gilberry who seems to know something of welsh language told that mean 'great ' so grandfather be really great evans so called because be chief person in rhaiadr because be stout bulky man over six foot three in height be discontented with lot a wanted money power position deuce know what rather grabber owain considering that be lord of rhaiadr be queer name mean water tumbling over rock waterfall in fact said hench with nod father mentioned word to madame alpenny gave translation well to continue mynydd evans collected what money must came to london there set up a merchant being clever in wonderfully short space of time made large fortune must have done so considering must leave uncle ten thousand year said vane emphatically why did return to rhaiadr mr gilberry must explain that expect old man found welsh parish of ancestor too narrow for ambition perhaps too far from london place of business bought lordship of manor of cookley in essex took up abode in old grange there died uncle madoc a eldest son became heir now be exactly what did not happen mynydd evans have two son father owain madoc father be elder of two be hench wriggled uneasily be rotter be breaking fifth commandment in saying so jim well said barrister coolly from what told of father when met six month ago rather think be bad lot unfortunately yes said hench hastily be dead so let say a little about a possible anyhow contrived so mortally to offend grandfather with doings that be cut out of will what did do particularly shady ca tell said hench with shrug from what gilberry said gathered that be one shady deed culmination of many that induced mynydd evans to give estate to uncle madoc be good boy of family mynydd evans knew that hard earned fortune must not be dissipated in hand father be allowed five six hundred year told to keep away from england did so afterwards married abroad english governess mother died in due time be sent to england to board with stranger then went to private school afterwards to winchester where met jim yes know that afterwards father sent for ultimately died in paris told about life since when came back six month ago why did father relate family history to why did keep in dark really jim ca say unless be that felt ashamed of doings must have have to tell that be not straight to account for being cut out of will know anyhow saw gilberry gilberry left with paper include birth certificate baptismal one thing be necessary to prove identity know gilberry gilberry be father lawyer lawyer of uncle grandfather saw that school fee be paid kept eye on while father be in exile so have difficulty in proving who be in fact old gilberry knew from likeness to father moment entered office be right so far if money be left to uncle how do inherit well seems that mynydd evans always have qualm about cutting off direct line suppose hoped that third generation must be better than second a represented by father anyhow made will excluding father save for five six hundred year allowance left whole eleven thousand pound per annum be worth to uncle madoc said be ten thousand yes of extra thousand five hundred went to father during life remaining five hundred might be four with six to father a be not quite clear about exact amount to gwen evans first cousin uncle madoc daughter oh there be girl then yes if old gilberry be to be believed be very pretty girl understand that be about twenty year of age can talk of later jim anyhow must understand that uncle madoc only have income grange for life afterwards be to go to offspring of father who be true heir be sole offspring so inherit see pondered vane well seems clear reasonable enough only must like to know why uncle did find out treat a heir must have done so through gilberry gilberry who a say kept eye on time according to mr gilberry uncle hated father fervently did not at approve of mynydd evans will left property to son of brother detested made inquiry understand be quite content to enjoy property let deluge in shape of come after of course must rather a mr gilberry said have have gwen get property must not a will of grandfather be too clear well can understand that brother did not love one said vane after pause family feud be unfortunately too common what made old man put in advertisement a did mention advertisement to mr gilberry for obvious reason must obtain information on point explained owain looking somewhat perplexed why sought out in peculiar way at eleventh hour ca say might a well have done thing straight through family lawyer anyhow suppose thought that mention of name rhaiadr must show be wanted although ca understand why worded advertisement so obscurely that father mentioned place of family to must have bothered about matter let alone fact concluded hench after pause must have seen advertisement at for madame alpenny be queer be jim that advertisement must have appeared with name rhaiadr just after remembered meeting father over twenty year ago so queer said vane dryly wonder if madame alpenny have anything to do with insertion of advertisement oh be rubbish jim never met uncle must have put in advertisement on own a did know rope uncle put in sure enough must not have be in wood to meet why deuce must choose out of door a meeting place instead of asking into own house ca understand be evidently original said barrister with shrug by way if died if have never be born who must inherit estate gwen cousin of course will left property to offspring of eldest son failing such offspring to child of second son why do ask that jim well occurs to that cautiously worded advertisement appointment of so lonely place to meet in suggests foul play on part of beloved uncle foul play hench stared what deuce do mean madoc might have intended to murder so that daughter might inherit oh rot not at must look at possibility madoc hated father doubtless hated also a son of father if must have done out of inheritance by murdering see why must have held hand know man character protested hench may have be very harmless person very cunning plotting person anyhow said vane quickly else why carefully worded advertisement strange place chosen for meeting owain conjecture may be wild there be truth in be sure madoc intended to get rid of lucky star led one to get rid of before appeared on scene lucky star said hench rising how can say that when be in danger of being arrested for death there be danger just now until madame alpenny move when doe move may be able to counterplot will move a soon a enter into inheritance know that therefore if be must not take up inheritance just yet how can prevent gilberry gilberry will take immediate step to place in possession business be sure to get into newspaper then madame alpenny will see that be rich come to bother of course can tell gilberry gilberry to hold over action until learn who murdered uncle once find true assassin will be safe from malice of madame alpenny other people oh there be one can spot madame alpenny said owain confidentially not even spruce asked vane significantly certainly not know nothing about affair told that knew about paper be to see on twenty fifth birthday oh yes paper wo connect with uncle madoc death only advertisement can do suppose spruce have set eye on let hope not said vane uneasily since heard name rhaiadr when meeting with father be explained by madame alpenny certainly might put two two together if did see advertisement if old woman saw why must spruce see dear jim why manufacture trouble when have enough to deal with a thing stand if spruce doe get on trail will deal with very promptly assure be not afraid of little rat rat can be dangerous owain spruce be meddlesome animal always on make with ten thousand year must be god send to now if will take advice what be tell gilberry gilberry to let thing remain a be until tell to place legally in possession of property can look after ten thousand odd pound coming to allow cousin four five hundred year to be entitled then go down to cookley a owain hench look about for possible person who might have knifed uncle gilberry gilberry will think queer what devil doe matter what think so long a get fee have to do be to execute order if like can make romance out of business tell that be going down to cookley to see cousin under false name so a to find out what be like of course can hint that may fall in love oh rat interrupted hench inelegantly be not likely to fall in love believe that understand what love be seeing what hash made of attention to zara made hash because did love old son may fall in love with cousin anticipate worst said owain dryly anyhow advice be good jim will tell gilberry gilberry to hold over will give to understand wish to see beautiful heiress have dispossessed a hench will go to cookley look round for criminal with changed appearance suppose will be spotted think be safe so far said vane looking at friend in critical manner risk seeing girl at bull inn may recognize voice will tell what owain will give introduction to old aunt of mine mr perage who be great swell in part respectability may help to hold own amongst very suspicious narrow minded people one find in country jim be brick oh fudge will loot when enter into kingdom vane laughed uproariously at small joke see if make pay up chapter ix gwen naturally gilberry gilberry be extremely astonished when heir to cookley grange refused to enter into kingdom immediately such wonderful reluctance to enjoy large income splendid position have never before come under notice fortunately however mr samuel gilberry senior partner who attended particularly to business of estate be of romantic turn of mind unusual in lawyer owain suggestion of acting part of disguised prince rather appealed to adopting vane suggestion hench a persisted in calling for time being artfully pointed out that must be just a well to make acquaintance of cousin a stranger before revealing did not wish a put to be biassed by fact that be son of father for see sir said to old gentleman who be white bearded benevolent person somewhat like traditional father christmas so far a can gather from paper father left behind brother who be parent of gwen be not friend hated one fervently if mind saying so be emphatic response of old lawyer a took pinch of snuff mind stating truth mr gilberry be what want to get at replied hench readily well then admitting that two hated one be more than likely that uncle madoc have great love for have not young friend pointed out to frequently that a have never set eye on must scarcely form judgment good bad indifferent declared that be son of father that good must come out of nazareth quite so doubtless passed on opinion to daughter think be extremely likely although can not speak positively mr owain said solicitor by way may a well call by name since refuse to take proper appellation like to call mr hench mind what call owain assured so long a let cat out of bag cousin be sure to have bad opinion of since father be so bitter being case will have chance of becoming friendly with if present a cousin wish to carry on feud so be necessary for to gain gwen good opinion therefore under name father adopted will make acquaintance a stranger win friendship entirely on own merit be rather fantastical way of acting be scarcely business like be gilberry reply same idea be not without merit be quite ready to help can do so by saying that be abroad think be even necessary to say a much let gwen know have communicated with have decided to wait for time before taking over estate can put down to eccentricity to late father influence if like anyhow suppose will trouble to search very deeply into matter will probably be pleased that take possession of cookley grange immediately can continue to live there until give notice to quit gilberry laughed shook head miss evans be very decided young lady mr owain remarked in judicial manner having own income of five hundred year have already quitted grange because expected to take possession yes there cried hench triumphantly did tell that be biassed by father have left cookley have gone to stay with very charming old lady in neighbourhood called mr perage better better will enable to make acquaintance without unduly forcing upon friend mr vane who be barrister yes yes know name have heard that be clever well well have given letter of introduction to mr perage who be aunt mr samuel gilberry rubbed hand chuckled very good very good indeed young friend be quite romance now to carry same to proper conclusion may suggest that must fall in love with miss evans hench shook head doubtfully private feeling ca be ordered about like private soldier remarked dryly be not kind of man to fall in love mr gilberry pooh pooh handsome young fellow like be sure to experience grand passion let tell that miss evans be beautiful girl clever sensible if must manage to marry went on lawyer coaxingly think how delightfully must end family feud after poor girl be rather hard for to be reduced to five hundred year after enjoying through father ten thousand per annum oh a to said owain promptly can allow two three thousand out of income must take seeing that consent be necessary yet talk about marrying be hench retort have about a much chance of doing that a man in moon however will make acquaintance a hench see what come of by way doe know name father took in place of evans late uncle never mentioned a owain hench be quite safe in making acquaintance will never think that be cousin unless let see how spell christian name welsh spelling may give hint be very sharp remember if have occasion to write will spell name in english way suppose will be necessary anyhow well be right act a have decided will go down to cookley to carry out romance a call mr gilberry one question must like to ask however before leaving be mr owain who murdered uncle mr gilberry took pinch of snuff shook venerable head really be hard to say unless be that tramp who asked way to gipsy stile mr owain suppose saw about in paper hench winced recovered immediately yes did mr gilberry what reason must that tramp have have to murder uncle not robbery if report of inquest be to be believed for then be said that money watch jewellery have be taken exactly so far a can see there be reason why man must have murdered mr evans mr gilberry knitted brow looked perplexed maybe be revenge concluded doubtfully revenge then uncle have enemy dozen must think said lawyer coolly mr madoc evans be very cantankerous person may say that much ill of dead quarrelled with many people moreover be very severe on poaching a magistrate a landowner tramp for know may have be poacher who have grudge against do police think so police say nothing because have evidence to go upon said lawyer sharply sole person suspect be tramp who came to bull inn have disappeared ca find however in village be said that tramp be poacher who murdered squire out of revenge can take leave opinion a like whole thing be mystery to mr owain to said hench in good faith will never be satisfied until learn who murdered uncle that wish doe credit mr owain said mr gilberry approvingly again young man winced considering how unfriendly late squire be towards father well father be just a unfriendly towards returned hench with shrug a say wish to carry on feud good bye mr gilberry when be settled in cookley will let know address will write if necessary be sure that one know name of hench a having anything to do with family at grange be quite sure although call one solitary girl family chuckled old man walking with client towards door good bye good bye hope sincerely hope that feud will be ended by marriage to late friend daughter might a well expect water to run up hill retorted hench sceptically went on way certain that be not likely to lose heart consequent on necessity of preserving secret of identity carefully hench requested vane to introduce by letter to mr perage a mr hench suppressing christian name might have given gwen clue if only from oddness of spelling vane on learning that girl have gone to stay with aunt quite approved of in letter of introduction private epistle to old lady made thing safe a mr hench young man went down to cookley if be forced to state what christian name be resolved to spell in english way must provoke remark from gwen a owen be not particularly unusual designation same hench felt that be treading on thin ice determined to stay at cookley a short time a possible to see more of cousin than must help after be going down not to meet a mr gilberry believed to learn if possible who have murdered unfortunate squire while reading newspaper entitled setting sun in train hench received distinct shock although by time be growing accustomed to being startled amateur detective have written letter to editor of halfpenny evening journal drawing attention to advertisement in express with reference to meeting at gipsy stile of name rhaiadr nothing be said a such be greek to writer of letter fact that one be invited to meet squire evans at very place on very evening when be murdered be largely commented upon very officious person who wrote suggested that police must try learn to whom advertisement be addressed when without doubt letter went on to say assassin will be captured although be rather like asking authority to look for needle in bottle of hay seeing that there be eight million people in london to one of whom advertisement might have be addressed owain felt cold water running down spine not on account of hungarian lady because agreed with vane that must not give information to police until learned if be prepared to marry daughter be spruce feared little rat who be meddlesome secretive unscrupulous who must do much mischief once got on trail from what vane have said be plain that nut have rendered position in west end untenable owing to cheating sole chance have of becoming even tolerable to former associate perhaps not even then be to return with pocket full of money then for sake of winning same might overlook fault probably must not hench be quite sure that spruce believed that money must do anything naturally must do much to get money being anything honourable man a have be ample proved in bethnal green there be few opportunity of making fortune spruce be not sufficiently clever to take advantage even of what chance there be consequently must be quite prepared hench be certain of to get what must by blackmail already believed that there be mystery about hench if saw advertisement letter have drawn attention to same must be certain to get at truth having be present at conversation between hench madame alpenny when woman meeting with father hench father be have be discussed word rhaiadr must certainly come again into mind connecting same with hench young man be convinced that spruce must venture to accuse of keeping appointment murdering advertiser then if came out that dead man be hench uncle so strong motive be provided that arrest must certainly follow be very uncomfortable journey for owain alighted at cookley station with firm idea that be about to have trying time madame alpenny be dangerous so be spruce a wanted cash be wholly unscrupulous however if went to police be not likely to get what wanted so hench comforted with idea before taking action must find out offer to treat on what discovered at cookley must depend attitude a if must only get at truth must place matter in hand of police without danger to on other hand if made discovery likely to prove who be assassin must be necessary to come to arrangement risk consequence hench must not disguise from on face of defence be weak since strongest point that of being stranger to dead man be removed certainly a have never met squire evans deceased be stranger to fact that dead man be uncle whose demise must give ten thousand five hundred year assuredly provided strong motive for commission of crime be puzzling difficult dangerous highly unpleasant hench must do be to wait see what madame alpenny possibly spruce must do one who have experienced suspense will understand what agony unfortunate young man underwent required courage nerve to endure anxiety of next few day to make matter worse vane be not at hand to relieve tension by listening to owain fear be with odd feeling not one of safety hench again set foot in cookley a walked down crooked street noted how many eye of men woman followed movement for moment believed that be recognized be impossible considering contrast between rough bearded tramp who have visited bull inn smart fashionable clean shaven young gentleman now strolling complacently through little town what people looked at especially woman be handsome face distinguished appearance from muttered remark so ear caught owain understood that took for tourist who have come to see lion of place therefore in character young man asked one two where must find lodging of course be at once directed to inn here for obvious reason did not wish to go with idea of finding quiet room have left portmanteau at railway station so a to seek same unhampered by luggage for time be unsuccessful in search until on outskirt of village great distance from church saw notice in cottage window of apartment to let at once knocked at door since place seemed clean quiet delicate slender little woman answered inquiry by stating that be called mr bell have room to let inspection of satisfied young man although be rather poorly furnished decidedly small at once took at very moderate sum demanded mr bell at request sent nephew to station to get new lodger portmanteau little woman who be meek fragile at once took great interest in hench a have kind eye gentle manner in short time two be good friend mr bell congratulated that for one month have such pleasant spoken gentleman under homely roof said a much to big burly nephew when returned with portmanteau on shoulder nephew thoroughly agreed with be natural seeing that new lodger have given crown for trouble so hench be made very comfortable by two who approved of more more day mr bell be busy bee in way of looking after household affair giles nephew who be labourer brushed owain boot clothes for also be great point mr bell be gossip kept very much to herself so neighbour heard little about hench from on whole young man decided that be very well placed hench did not present letter of introduction to mr perage straight away busied in learning what must of geography of cookley examined church explored village never going into bull inn by way even ventured to look at gipsy stile gave qualm when found on well remembered spot saw beyond old brick wall picturesque grange be now property mr bell who knew everything about place talked freely enough when asked although be scandal monger told how miss evans have gone to stay with mr perage since death of father do say said mr bell who always prefaced remark with phrase that ai going to rest until find out who killed be there clue asked owain keeping face turned away no there ai sir unless can call tramp clue did ask betsy jane at bull where gipsy stile be old squire be found there hour later a dead a mutton since then one clapped eye on suppose sir a one ever will do think tramp murdered squire lord sir how do know cried mr bell in panic hev enough to do in house without thinking of murder do say a squire evans be hard man on poacher a giles know having got into trouble over pheasant might be sir a tramp be one of poacher done for squire though to be sure added woman rubbing nose in perplexed way if be poacher hereabouts one must hev knowed must hev have to ask betsy jane of bull where stile be be opinion that for miss gwen trying will never find out who killed father do say a if murderer ai found wo be great grief to a knowed old mr evans what kind of girl be miss evans asked hench irrelevantly ah cried mr bell nursing hand under apron now do say sir a know a be a nice young lady a ever set eye on lovely call small like though quite lady ai be a loved a father be hated do say a be saying great deal do assure sir a 'd rather hev miss gwen for head of place than new young squire a come from one know where hench have many conversation about matter with mr bell gradually came to know great deal during next few day uncle appeared have be very unpopular while gwen be reverse generally be quite believed amongst ancient of village that squire have be murdered by unknown tramp who be poacher verdict be that served dead man right because be always so hard on poor owain be tolerably sure that cookley people must have be quite sorry have presumed criminal be arrested a be person in question be glad that have not be troubled to mourn in way same in spite of questioning be unable to learn anything likely to show who have met squire evans in parley wood so far mission to cookley have proved complete failure then destiny intervened to conduct step further on dark path be leading knew not where towards end of week when be beginning to feel safer more at home in village have adventure consequence of be far reaching owain have gone for long walk into surrounding country be returning leisurely under many coloured glory of sunset weather be warm road be dusty paused by stile to remove straw hat allow breeze to cool heated brow before be church round square ivy clothed tower of jackdaw be flying to right be road melting almost imperceptibly into narrow village street while to left ran same road curving abruptly round corner into agricultural land so dangerous be bend in highway that be marked with one of red triangle elevated on post to warn motorist cyclist not to move at too great pace injunction be very much needed never more so than in present instance hench leaned idling against stile enjoying beauty of evening picturesque character of landscape must not see very far a place be muffled with hawthorn hedge tall tree there be quiet domestic loveliness about prospect soothed tormented soul suddenly eye be caught by moving figure in porch of church be under west window be that of slender girl not very tall singularly graceful a came down path towards lychgate saw that have beautiful face aristocratic in look rather pensive in expression arrayed in white

where for knew madame alpenny might be plotting then wondered what have taken jim to house for there must have gone a be unlikely must journey to district for other purpose perhaps hungarian lady be already weaving net to snare thinker a husband for zara a criminal be very uncomfortable thinking being so alarmed hench did best to talk brightly amusingly for time being be fey a scotch say roused cousin out of gloom by sally mr perage seconded admirably a quite enjoyed contest of wit be rare to come by in cookley food be good wine be excellent company interesting same hench felt that meal be like macbeth banquet behind revelry lurked grim figure of tragedy with bowl dagger at moment banquo in person of madame alpenny might appear of course such supposition be nonsense a hungarian lady did not know where be feeling became so real to hench that cast several uneasy look behind chair gwen noticed remarked on same nervously why do look over shoulder asked petulantly for kill joy said hench in blunt way know miss evans man be never permitted to be entirely happy there be always kill joy gwen will provide with kill joy be needing said mr perage significantly wait until go to drawing room

gleam in blue eye have many side to character charming be sure answered young man courteously so conversation went on frothy about nothing mere spume spindrift of mind lighter became more certain did hench become sure that banquo ghost be haunting room felt quite relieved when mr perage conducted gwen into drawing room for there psychic atmosphere be le oppressive girl however appeared to feel otherwise for after playing on piano for few minute began to wander restlessly round room mr perage attempted to frown into sitting down a proved to be impossible task accepted situation with grim resignation may a well enlist mr hench a champion child will never be quiet until do enlist a champion echoed hench glancing at girl grew flushed that be mr perage pretty way of putting thing be reply a sat down near hostess do wish to help mr hench be not quite sure if be right in doing so perhaps will think be presumption on part somehow having saved life have made more than friend more than friend mean gwen became even more crimson than already be a became aware that have spoken more freely than be necessary more familiar than most of friend who be usually mere acquaintance observed mr perage quietly why beat about bush gwen know that mr hench be clever kind hearted be anxious that must do favour be situation favour can do miss evans began young man eagerly when girl stopped say word until know what favour be said in abrupt manner to do what want may be unpleasant in word want to try find out who murdered father be about dozen word more le sighed mr perage hench took notice of flippant remark be too much taken aback to do so remained silent gwen misunderstood silence looked mortified wo help be thinking said young man gravely of course have read about death of father in newspaper miss evans can quite understand desire to avenge anything can do will be done with very greatest pleasure how do matter stand a stood after inquest explained gwen with shrug jury brought in open verdict general opinion be that father be murdered by man who spoke to girl in tap room of bull inn hench winced one appeared to be agreed that tramp be culprit guessed that if discovered tramp must have little chance of escaping most uncomfortable trial even if proved innocence experience must be unpleasant wondering what mr perage girl must say if be to acknowledge that be man referred to began to ask question in grave voice do think that tramp be guilty person look like rejoined gwen promptly man asked way to gipsy stile evidently went there afterwards father be found dead near stile have tramp motive to murder father how can tell said girl irritably be only taking what evidence suggests guilt why must come to cookley ask way to very place where father be afterwards found dead fact that man asked way to stile show that be stranger in cookley must stranger come here to murder father hum said mr perage suddenly madoc evans have many enemy can name of one in neighbourhood must say snapped old lady cynically exactly one in neighbourhood tramp be stranger might have be hired by one to murder squire said mr perage vaguely in case one must have explained how bravo be to get to stile said hench coolly then wondered if gwen knew anything about advertisement also continued one must have known that squire evans must be at stile at particular time now miss evans can tell if father made appointment gwen shook head ca say father did many thing about told nothing often in summer walked out after dinner a did on night be murdered where went ca say searched park when missed afterwards wood on chance be father agitated on night be agitated from time woman came to see said gwen quickly hench sat up thrill passed through woman yes time in june woman called one afternoon have interview with father in library be with for two hour when went away be very much upset asked who be why visit annoyed a plainly did told to mind own business will be bound said mr perage with grim smile for knew evans thoroughly yes did from time woman called father be silent morose irritable hope wo think that be undutiful mr hench when say that father be not pleasant tempered man after interview became unbearable never knew when be otherwise cried old lady determined that hench must know everything madoc evans be without doubt most disagreeable person have ever met bear must have have more amiable temper well father be dead said gwen coldly so be use calling name oh will be very tombstone for lying about dead if like dear gwen if mr hench be to help must know that father be one of uncomfortable men who never have friend who never wanted one so far a know father be eccentric said gwen colour coming going a explained to young man certainly did not get on well with people quarrelled with grandfather with brother owain with one else said mr perage after mynydd evans must have done better to leave money to owain stole glance at hench a spoke be better man than madoc madoc be father said gwen impatiently so please say a little bad of a possible after estate have gone to cousin owain son though know why doe come take possession what do think be reason mr hench how can tell reason asked hench awkwardly aware that mr perage be looking at significantly let leave fact alone for present talk of woman who evidently upset father who be miss evans have told that father refused to say did see caught glimpse of when went away from grange a happened to be looking out of drawing room window what be like to look at did see face back be turned towards a be going down avenue oh said hench disappointed be pity remember how be dressed that be better well looked untidy old thing said gwen after pause to recollect appearance of important stranger very fat unshapely wore black dress spotted with orange dot black velvet mantle trimmed with jet bead hat much too large for broke off what be matter mr hench owain sudden change of colour sudden start at vivid description of madame alpenny betrayed immediately looked confused not very well knowing how to excuse for obvious reason did not wish to admit that recognized costume described therefore took refuge in white lie told first one occurred to idea struck miss evans that father might have be murdered by gipsy hum cried mr perage quite taken in by plausible untruth be at unlikely madoc be hard on gipsy especially when poached why do suggest gipsy gwen asked owain without attending to hostess well said with affected shrug queer dress of untidy old woman hint at gipsy perhaps be only fancy on part be very good fancy said mr perage emphatically if tramp be innocent may be for know gipsy may have something to do with crime why gwen remember how father turned whole gang of off parley common year ago because be robbing hen roost orange spotted dress be just what gipsy must wear think mr perage that woman murdered father dear suggest anything because know anything say be that mr hench chance shot may have hit bull eye gwen looked down thoughtfully at carpet father certainly be very much worried after interview with woman worry lasted up to time of death gipsy if woman be gipsy might have something to do with matter be only idea of course said owain hastily for did not wish madame alpenny to be run to earth immediately let jump to conclusion must think will be here for few week during time miss evans be wholly at disposal will help to learn who murdered father yes will do best to find out said hench earnestly hum boomed mr perage easier said than done how do intend to begin well remarked hench after pause think will be good start if miss evans take over cookley grange into parley wood where corpse be found then can talk over matter gwen looked doubtful do think cousin must mind if went over grange took mr hench asked hostess mr perage stole sly glance at owain think must why must if come to well father father did get on well together be reason why son daughter must retorted mr perage can take mr hench to grange to morrow at noon now young man rose to full height of lofty stature can depart keep early hour here a be necessary must have beauty sleep a if needed said owain jestingly agreeable visit ended a have begun with badinage frivolity chapter xii cupid garden night hench awoke during small hour of morning with conviction that knew about mystery in be involved have fallen asleep much exercised in mind so far a visit of madame alpenny to cookley grange be concerned remembered that about time mentioned by gwen hungarian lady have gone away from bethnal green presumably to procure engagement for zara in west end music hall certainly that might have be one very good reason why have remained absent for few day now appeared that there be have to do with madoc evans when unconsciousness came owain be still wrestling with problem somehow seemed that same be solved during slumber with working of physical brain scheme broke up be only able to retain fragment proceeded to piece together while staring at ceiling through faint twilight of already dawning day be rather difficult task to put two two together young man recollected that madame alpenny have denied knowledge of elder hench family history recollected also that have done so with certain amount of hesitation now be borne in forcibly upon that father have told woman much more about past than must admit probably have informed her of quarrel with grandfather of dislike for brother explaining also that madoc enjoyed cookley grange large income for life word rhaiadr have brought back interview clearly to madame alpenny mind be more than probable that knew must inherit estate for reason have be agreeable to paying attention to daughter for reason have paid visit to cookley grange hench now quite understood how have come to see advertisement to draw attention to without least hesitation concluded that have learned from father where cookley grange be situated have gone to tell madoc of meeting with pauper nephew why uncle must have put in queer advertisement have appointed so strange meeting place owain must not conceive be certain that madoc have done so have used very word to attract attention have awakened hungarian lady memory of twenty year old meeting be without doubt on look out for advertisement knowing in paper must appear thus have easily be able to show to having so to speak assisted madoc to lay trap have waited result now what puzzled hench be why squire evans must have acted in very roundabout way to bring about meeting honest man must have ignored son of brother hated must have openly invited a heir to visit instead of doing madoc have behaved mysteriously in making appointment have chosen for rendezvous solitary place out of door seemed tolerably clear to owain that uncle have intended to do harm perhaps idea be to murder so that must not inherit squire evans if hint of gwen very plain speaking of mr perage be to be believed be by mean honest so be just possible that wanted to get hated heir out of way hench shrunk from conclusion after much thought must come to other unexpected murder of squire have prevented own death

actually present on platform same be now pretty certain that madame alpenny have be watching that knew be staying at cookley when thought be time must very likely appear to continue plot be very uncomfortable unpleasant to young man who be honest straight in dealing against will be involved in sordid scheme did not see way of extricating from mire must do be to wait until hungarian lady took action meanwhile must do best to try learn who have actually murdered uncle be for reason have so readily agreed to assist gwen in search day be very hot a there be not cloud in sky sun be blazing

furiously letting temper flame out for first time during interview yes daughter dare to stand there declare that love be heart broken poor girl because have deserted came here bearing message when visited where be staying landlady told have gone to place followed quietly hid there flung out arm towards tall tombstone to hear what making love with girl will not be so tell zara daughter will marry not stop cried hench finally managing to stay torrent of word if begin to call name will be sorry for love daughter never loved daughter be true that admired told how desired to marry bracken false one raged madame alpenny zara told did ask hand in marriage be true acknowledged hench boldly paused for low cry of pain broke on ear turned impetuously to reassure gwen of devotion only to see gliding up path towards gate with surprising swiftness evidently foolish admission have given to understand madame alpenny accusation be true without waiting to hear explanation have slipped away in despair gwen gwen cried young man in hoarse tone hastening after girl wait wait be not what think dear be voice broke a gwen without turning head reached gate ran along road ah will not go after hissed bitter voice at elbow madame alpenny grasped arm firmly here stay to speak with old fiend cried hench turning on furiously for saw that be useless to follow gwen explain at present moment a please retorted hungarian lady releasing name do harm friend can afford to laugh do while be laughing hench suddenly became quite cool saw that be in dangerous uncomfortable position a woman have chosen time excellently to complicate matter gwen have pardoned masquerade be far too feminine a believed to pardon proposing to woman in moment hench determined to settle madame alpenny then go at once to enlist mr perage on side well said calmly to marplot have found have done worst what now say that much monsieur said madame alpenny shrilly done worst do declare ah not yet have said what came to say know what have come to say retorted hench taking bull by horn be best thing to do mean to accuse of murdering uncle madame alpenny looked rather taken aback by cool defiance accepted situation with vicious pluck be not so be worth while to reply to so ridiculous question said hench shrugging square shoulder accuse on what ground pray plenty of ground monsieur plenty of ground obeyed that advertisement met uncle to murder get property when did know that be uncle must inherit property in event of death did know that be uncle said woman furiously paper at lawyer did not see until nine day later interrupted young man say so sneered how can prove that lawyer can prove ah what folly madame alpenny brushed away defence with gesture be mr evans who told in wood how be uncle did not never met while be alive say so began madame again only to be cut short hold tongue listen said hench in peremptory tone be very clever cunning madame have trapped by mean of advertisement in hope that can force to marry daughter absolutely decline to do so then tell policeman that be murderer retorted quickly hench laughed oh wo must have done that long ago that wished to blackmail refuse to be blackmailed also madame will have to explain why came down here to request uncle to insert advertisement instead of writing to openly stop hench waved hand a be about to speak have time to enter into detail now on occasion can speak madame alpenny looked at sullenly a be unprepared for defiance saw need of gaining time will wait for one week then come to again said savagely marry zara hang will do said hench calmly turned on heel with contempt one week called out woman furiously in one week come again chapter xv friend in need now that long expected blow have fallen hench be surprised to find how lightly have be struck madame alpenny having come at inopportune moment for have made mischief for time being looked a though be triumphing owain felt certain that be afraid have seen fear in eye when met so defiantly if have be quite sure of position must not have given week to consider matter be not difficult to understand why have done so for murder of evans woman cared very little save a mean to force man accused to do what wanted aim be to secure wealthy son in law must only do by threatening to tell police about fatal visit to cookley if refused to do bidding did tell police then so far a be concerned everything be at end must certainly get into trouble must not have a daughter husband must get money unwilling to push thing too far madame alpenny have therefore compromised by giving hench seven day of grace of course at end of time young man knew that answer to must be same then might revenge by acquainting authority with plausible story be questionable if must do so even then a fear in eye hinted that knew more about crime than dared to admit if anything be made public hench have idea madame alpenny might be placed in dock instead of must not be sure of a even though have called on evans to set advertisement trap there be nothing to show that have come to cookley on evening of murder in case must be difficult for to prove that have really kept appointment in parley wood a hench recognized fact of advertisement being addressed to together with undoubted fact that benefited to extent of ten thousand year by death of uncle must undoubtedly throw suspicion on girl at bull inn might remember voice a of tramp then fact of shaving off beard must suggest that have reason to escape accusation on whole be tolerably certain that if madame alpenny did go to police there must be trouble out of must not be easy to emerge scathless owing to belief that madame alpenny knew more about matter than must admit hench felt sure must not seek assistance of authority in case be absolutely safe for one whole week much must be done in time be best meanwhile to explain thing to gwen so that might be sure of love when learned exactly how have come to propose to zara then must understand that desire to marry dancer have only be longing of lonely man for home companionship with comprehension of fact a hench devoutly hoped love of gwen must return must stand by in coming trouble needed friend must gather round to face thing particularly felt that having cousin to defend must brace up to defend without love young man felt that must not be worth while to fight ten thousand year clearance of name from suspicion must not make up for loss of girl who be now in to therefore first thing to do be to win back gwen heart after that deluge must come so far a hench be concerned returned to lodging glancing through window saw madame alpenny waddling along street on way to station cast one vengeful look on cottage of mr bell did not attempt to enter be sign that did not feel strong enough to go into detail a matter of fact such be case madame alpenny have hoped to dominate hench immediately defiance have taken entirely by surprise therefore have wisely retreated in order to collect intended to descend on at end of seven day with overwhelming proof of guilty deed hench be relieved when saw pas by cottage a did not wish to enter make trouble also be relieved because saw in passing confession of weakness therefore did feel much more cheerful hopeful than have done for many long day mr bell explained that lady have called to see lodger that have sent on to churchyard whither hench have intimated be going hoped that have not done wrong owain told that visitor have only come down to see on business that business have be easily dispatched that lady have returned to london mr bell have acted quite judiciously little pale woman accepted explanation in good faith then went to open door for entrance of lady hench busy with afternoon tea be not surprised when mr perage entered full of wrath have rather expected must come a occurred to that gwen unexpected return from churchyard must lead to question explanation from very first remark of mr perage be certain that knew about matter well said fierce old lady who looked something like meg merrilees in half masculine half feminine garb be nice state of affair young man gwen go to meet with heart full of love return with same heart broken into little piece work sit down mr perage let talk quietly said hench entreatingly talk quietly echoed mr perage sitting down

that loved cousin dearly even though love have grown a rapidly unexpectedly a jonah gourd perhaps like same must perish a quickly gwen attempted to assure herself of must not self hypnotise into belief passion be too genuine too strong too overwhelming to be got rid of so easily yet asked question frequently how must believe that owain loved when have heard from own lip that have proposed to girl gwen considered that have be very generous in forgiving masquerading although admitted that under circumstance assumption of false name have be pardonable that must have loved one else must have

whatever be feeling made wretched for long hour poor child tossed turned shivered wept a wondered what future be likely to be have youth have beauty have money desirable thing be a dust ash lacking companionship of man loved a have condemned out of own month must not see how position of thing be to be altered in bluff way mr perage be very sorry for girl a saw how truly genuine be suffering old lady strongly sympathized with despairing feeling of youth belief that world have come to end because thing turn out a expected not that believed gwen world have ended understood easily enough how girl thought so to put matter right mr perage set to work in hope of proving that sun be merely obscured for moment for day night left sufferer alone so that might get over first stage of misery anger then old dame entered bedroom proceeded to develop scheme hoped must put crooked straight well dear said in brisk heartless manner a seated on bed have overcome fit of self pity oh how unkind be

sipped tea nibbled at toast pride speedily came to aid when meal be finished felt much better self pity be now merged in sense of anger owain have dared to treat so shamefully therefore dressed in prettiest frock with intention of proving to that felt treachery le than might have expected when walked into drawing room mr perage looked up to see smartly dressed young lady with sparkling eye fine colour in place of white faced invalid have left so far result of experiment be distinctly good of course suggested old lady artfully have quite decided to throw owain overboard what else must have do demanded gwen revengefully hum said mr perage in meditative manner think must ask for explanation there can be explanation likely to satisfy that entirely depends upon common sense way of looking at thing said mr perage dryly on common sense if come to by way that girl be coming down here afternoon will arrive in hour what girl hum mr perage skirted round subject did not give entirely direct reply breakfast have be luncheon for be now two o'clock so such queer exchange of meal must have upset perhaps have better not be present what girl be talking about asked gwen colour coming going although knew perfectly well what be meant be in quite enough good health to see girl how dare come here ah mr perage chuckled guess what mean see well dear jim be rather put out about quarrel with

settled let hope good will come of interview rubbed nose gwen handful to manage by contradiction fancy have secured own way of course be quite true although miss evans walking in park be perfectly sure that be acting contrary to mr perage wish by time girl be in fine temper ready to quarrel with one about anything in fact felt very much inclined to fight for what considered be right so far a concerned cousin in queer way gwen arrived at conclusion that by saving life hench have given sort of claim over of course must never marry nothing must ever induce to marry faithless person intended to hint at fantastic claim by ordering to make zara wife then on further reflection did not like to marry dancer a loved still a be unworthy of love perhaps must be a well to allow to carry out proposal to madame alpenny daughter must certainly be miserable must serve right a zara be bound to be minx cat several other disagreeable thing in incoherent way miss evans thought while working off anger a best must by walking at top speed up one path down did not know whether to laugh to cry to rage to fret did know be that everything seemed to be wrong that bottom have fallen out of creation when gwen again ventured into house found drawing room tenanted by mr perage nephew two visitor one of be handsome untidily dressed young fellow who wore hair rather long after manner of musician other be tall girl gaunt striking looking with something of gipsy in appearance wore red velvet hat long red velvet mantle violent hue of harmonized well with somewhat sallow complexion bold dark eye when gwen entered girl be laughing showed row of very white teeth added to handsome look mademoiselle zara be miss evans said mr perage rising to make rapid introduction gwen be madame alpenny

leaving two girl alone gwen eyed zara zara eyed gwen with great curiosity used intuition with so much skill that in two minute girl knew about nature of other girl miss evans must not deny what dancer be handsome enough to attract one even most fastidious while zara thought that gwen be one of most charming young lady have ever seen be sure will be very happy with said abruptly who asked gwen sitting down getting ready to fence zara laughed meaningly dear there be only one 'he ' in world for so thought until found out retorted miss evans sharply oh understand about finding out mr vane gave full description of mother meddling if have waited to hear what took place after departure from churchyard there must have be need for to come down did not ask to come down said gwen pointedly did not mr perage did however a be anxious for mistake to be corrected be anxious also else must not have troubled to take long journey why did undertake then because have greatest respect for mr hench greatest love mean indeed mean nothing of sort said zara candidly have more love for mr hench than have for table did hear mr perage say be engaged to mr bracken yes suppose be admitted gwen reluctantly there be always one who love one who be loved know heine german poet said that miss evans congratulate on wide range of reading show that be not narrow not being narrow trust that will do mr hench justice proposed to heard say so dear said dancer after lenient fashion of elder sister mr hench at time must have proposed to woman of decent character decent look heine quotation implied that although did not love loved there be entirely wrong admired certainly proposed to interrupted miss evans doggedly zara cheek grew crimson voice became sharper be two woman talking together said decisively therefore be useless for to skirt about bush a must do with men mr hench never loved have conception of love when proposed told so ca understand how lonely man must wish for home comrade so that may have centre in life used very word to mr bracken give that true love be more than admiration be mr hench have to offer must not give heart because did not know that possessed one since coming here have made discovery that have heart have given to have seen did tell so took zara moment so to quell rising anger felt inclined to shake silly little girl who be not to be convinced by common sense explanation have not seen mr hench if wish will see oh be nothing to said gwen with air of finality then ought to be mr vane told what mr hench told what be that know quite well retorted zara tartly be that mr hench love better than deserve how can tell what deserve be only going by what see of now said dancer patiently really love mr hench be fighting against feeling because believe that love be not case a can see be speaking truth be unworthy of to speak a do therefore say that mr hench love better than deserve know cried zara becoming exasperated why force to make so unnecessary

appearance very well a be stupid tap room be badly lighted when saw declares that must know voice mr owain hench must then have to prove what be doing on night in question think must be easy certainly must not be easy said hench coolly have admitted that can make out very good case for prosecution same be perfectly aware that be innocent what make say that asked spruce quickly a vane thought in somewhat anxious manner because think know who be guilty person do remains to be seen spruce said vane in menacing manner be playing very dangerous game let alone fact that be trying to blackmail hench run risk of condoning felony ah said nut quickly then suggest that friend be guilty nothing of sort suggest that pretend to believe guilty to get money know perfectly well that be not do mean to insinuate know who murdered squire asked spruce with fine show of indignation certainly do retorted vane smartly put on frill in opinion madame alpenny who knew about advertisement property be guilty person a be worth powder shot be trying to fasten crime on to hench shoulder can mr james vane a will find oh said hench cynically really expect to pay two thousand year to refrain from doing so wo wo spruce be plainly taken aback rather than do so will go to police tell story better be in hand of authority than in yours wo dare to do what say oh yes dare conscience be clear so be willing to stand brunt spruce be plainly embarrassed by defiance did not very well know what to say do if hench acted a threatened to do there must be money for nut perhaps action against a blackmailer be shrewd enough to see therefore shuffled card so that might not drive proposed victim to extremity what do wish to do then asked sullenly before hench must reply vane who be looking out of window turned round sharply there be peter said glancing at friend what deuce be hanging round cottage for answer came from unexpected quarter peter be waiting to see said spruce with dignity be at bull inn when

ask what wish to do reply clear character how can do in way best known to be well aware that madame alpenny be guilty person be not tell lie be better worth while to pay two thousand year to prove guilty innocent than for to give income to merely for sake of holding tongue be thing never did never will do spruce considered if prove madame alpenny to be guilty said with greedy gleam in eye will pay two thousand year will think about then hing to be quite plain can clear character in way say ah knew be lying sha do so unless agree in presence of vane to give price be too large price grumbled barrister large small be what want will give one thousand year if two thousand hench looked at vane vane at hench a be uncertain how to act very difficult question have to be threshed out owain be unwilling to pay blackmail yet if did not there be bound to be trouble if did be quite certain that spruce must clear character for honourable man position be very trying there seemed to be only one
