to know more about who be parent be dead alive why be thrust into world a outcast only person who must explain mystery of life be patience allerby determined therefore to apply to for explanation filled with dismal thought sauntered slowly up street a far a bridge here paused leaning over parapet began to think again be curious thing that young man brought up in quiet christian household must let thought run on morbid idea a possibility of being natural son have experience of vice must therefore have accepted marriage of unknown parent a fact especially when nurse asserted that have be married strangeness of position led to believe that there must be motive for concealment motive determined in own mind be want of marriage certificate real cause however led to morbid analysis of possible relation between parent lay in discovery have lately made discovery changed simple manly life be leading into raging hell of doubt torturing be in love una challoner be woman loved be not that sickly evanescent affection common to adolescence known by name of calf love that strong overwhelming passion of soul have limit dominates sway whole nature drawn in first place towards una by simple admiration of beauty learned later on to discard passion without soul found in kindred sympathy of spirit with own ideal union so rarely exists on part have be attracted to by same quality found in perfect agreement developed in pure spiritual adoration love thus being pure must not dare to offer anything purity anxiously began to examine life in order to discover flaw marred whiteness be not ideal young man still discovered nothing in life must embarrass to explain so felt quite easy in now shadow of possible illegitimacy seemed to threaten disaster must not dare to offer to woman loved respected name be not legally own however be use indulging in self torture when must be ended by getting proper explanation of circumstance of birth from patience allerby hitherto have shrunk from doing with vague hesitation of man who dread to hear truth now be imperative must learn be good evil shape course accordingly at moment of life stood at junction of two road explanation of

touching tomb of crusader with rainbow tint while from tall organ pipe flashed gleam of golden fire be faint shadowy like confusion of dream dusky atmosphere seemed to be filled with subtle perfume of incense have curled up from silver censer in old romish day through sombre shadow stole rich swelling note of organ woke to life under skilful finger of blind girl few great note pealed from mighty mouth of pipe cecilia played majestic melody floated grandly through church then volume of melodious sound sank downward to low breathed whisper a blake began cujus animam with one resonant note rang out like sound of silver trumpet cujus animam gementem contristantur et dolentem pertransivit gladius voice of singer seemed to float high in air like of unseen angel hidden in golden cloud while far below roll thunder of organ seemed to rise fall like sullen surge beating upon lonely shore una closed eye a superb voice with penetrating sweetness rang out mournful word with intensity of dramatic feeling went to very soul with strong religious fervour a last note died away una heard voice behind say bravo on turning head saw dr nestley standing close to accompanied by tall dark man whom recognized at once a basil beaumont chapter ix view of cynic to rule mankind be crave at foot to see curled for if make world slave will ne'er be slave unto world evidently dr nestley have become friendly with quondam enemy for gentleman now seemed to be on best of term with one doctor have succumbed to wonderful personal fascination of beaumont artist have convinced nestley that be wrong in regarding in hostile manner on recognizing miss challoner young physician came forward to greet while beaumont remained in background lost in admiration at wonderful beauty of face appealed strongly to artistic nature did expect to find here miss challoner said nestley eagerly friend heard singing came in to listen by way will permit to introduce mr beaumont una bowed little coldly for remembered what reginald have said about artist hearing name mentioned beaumont came forward be formally presented in spite of distrust una must not admire handsome tired looking face beheld be still further impressed by peculiar timbre of voice when began to talk beaumont certainly possessed in small degree wonderful fascination of manner attributed to ill fated stewart of scotland atoned so much for fickleness treachery ingratitude be mr blake who be singing think observed basil idly have wonderful voice yes answered una with pleased smile have never heard finer not even in germany ah have be in

compliment una frowned at remark please said coldly dislike insincerity nestley reddened little at tone of voice obvious rebuke on seeing una held out hand to with charming smile must not mind what say dr nestley observed bending forward be afraid be dreadfully rude wonderfully charming thought beaumont who however kept opinion to warned by fate of friend young doctor meanwhile have hastily assured una that did not mind severity in fact rather liked must doubtless in sincerity have committed again only that blake commenced to sing come marguerite come from sullivan martyr of antioch listened attentively cecilia played graceful accompaniment of arpeggi lightly while above constant sweep of dissevered chord rising falling with voice high penetrating note of singer flowed smoothly onward a organist played softly full purity of voice must be heard with marvellous effect owing to want of training blake voice lacked in great measure power to give perfect rendering to melody richness mellowness of note be undeniable when have finished beaumont face betrayed pleasure felt una who be watching closely asked opinion wonderful voice said critically a three walked up aisle of course requires great deal of cultivation think be charming interposed nestley eager to curry favour with una by praising one whom evidently regarded a brother of course must think so replied beaumont little contemptuously because know nothing about subject to uncultivated ear blake voice sound well because have wonderfully fine organ to musician there be crudeness of style want of colouring lack of refinement make regret that great natural gift be not trained to full capability be not musician said nestley nettled at superior tone adopted by friend answered basil complacently have heard great

lightly how rude be must introduce two gentleman to organist miss mosser dr nestley mr beaumont beaumont not knowing cecilia be blind merely bowed nestley took fragile hand of girl grasped warmly enjoyed playing so much said heartily where did learn on hearing voice pale face of blind girl coloured painfully eager look crossed feature a if be trying to see speaker countenance in spite of infirmity what beautiful voice murmured softly nestley have to repeat question before answered at school for blind at hampstead said turning towards reply gave painful shock a realized misfortune with delicate tact however passed answer off lightly in conversational manner know much about music myself said easily seems such complicated affair be fond of very answered blind girl quickly see be only pleasure have when go out on to common feel fresh wind smell perfume of gorse come back here try put into music often thank god for being able to play organ be deeply pathetic to hear talk in strain shut out by affliction from beauty of nature must yet thank god for one gift enabled in measure to understand appreciate what have never beheld doctor a rule be not very soft hearted nestley must hardly help feeling moved at thrill of sadness ran through speech perceived with light laugh hastened to dispel illusion have created must not think be sad said cheerfully on contrary never be so

nestley must ask to go a be about to practise think miss challoner friend have gone be waiting for doctor at lower end of church so after saying good bye to cecilia hurried away into dusky atmosphere a reached beaumont organ rolled out opening chord of mass by pergolesi reginald went outside with nestley a wished to speak to about squire una be left standing with beaumont in grey old church listened in silence to deep thunder of bass note echoing in high roof when suddenly in middle of crashing chord sonorous tone died away sweet pure melody thrilled through silence seemed almost oppressive after tempest of sound after fire there came still small voice quoted basil dreamily do remember how perfectly mendelssohn have expressed that idea in music yes heard elijah at albert hall replied una in matter of fact way being healthy english girl not moved by subtle meaning of sacred music touched so quickly highly strung nerve of man albert hall repeated with shrug oh yes very fine have doubt to mind secularizes sacred music to hear there one hears volume of sound immense number of voice in chorus solo by best artiste where be soul of work one only find that in church messiah be first heard in england in westminster abbey be there following example set by king that whole audience arose at hallelujah chorus be not music alone grand a be that produced sudden burst of emotion be august fane grey with century of tradition presence of mighty dead sleeping around to crown dramatic grandeur of chorus together wrought on feeling of present did homage to sublimity of music thing must be impossible in albert hall think be giving praise to surroundings nothing to musician said una quickly true composer must impress idea on hearer without other aid have doubt must replied beaumont carelessly doubt plenty of people have felt emotion at handel music in albert hall even handel genius must never have created effect a have described anywhere in church of course have mentioned memorable shaft of sunlight deserves praise for share in affair something in flippancy of remark jarred upon una feeling so made reply walked outside into cool fresh air followed by beaumont accompanied a far a lichgate then raised hat wo go further miss challoner said be in meditative mood will take look round old place hope to see again soon at grange grange questioned looking at

one be now about four o'clock in afternoon short autumnal day be rapidly closing in grey veil of sky be rent here there showing patch of pale cold blue while setting sun be tinting ragged cloud in west with iridescent hue beaumont stood in long rank grass of graveyard thinking deeply eye fixed dreamily on ancient tombstone around with half obliterated inscription weed grown mound of earth behind be old church grey wall covered with close clinging ivy from out peered grotesque face of gargoyle leering demoniacally at silent figure great square tower built of rough stone stood out massively against dull grey sky round now then flashed pigeon who lived therein gleaming white in faint light of sun must hear hoarse murmur of river flowing past shrill voice of child in street at interval rising falling of organ music within touched artistic sensibility fell into strain of half melancholy half regretful reflection for moment gave better nature than bitter cynicism of usual thought man be not altogether bad have originally started in life with best intention nature have be warped twisted by misfortune temptation into present state be true that be to appearance thoroughly bad that many have cause to regret friendship yet occasionally must do kind action help poor struggler showed that of early belief in humanity yet remained in world worn heart be thinking now thinking of woman woman have loved left many year before thought evoked be anything pleasant with involuntary sigh walked down to gar seating on flat tombstone set forth virtue of susan peller deceased let chin sink on hand gave up to dead memory memory of youth of love of disappointment sudden flash of dying sunlight gleamed over river turning sullen grey water to sheet of gold sight brought back to mind hour when be young leaned over parapet of balcony with woman by side looking at shimmering thames golden in sunset must recall vividly even after lapse of many year shining river confused mass of house huddled under dusky cloud of london smoke far away swelling dome of st paul looking aerial fairy like against twilight sky while above great mass gleamed golden cross shining in firmament like visionary symbol of constantine be poor not very well housed fed glamour of youth hope be about saw in shining river sweeping under golden cross omen of happy future then dream picture grew faint blurred cloud swept across golden heaven from amid sombre gloom there looked forth tearful woman face with pitiful appealing eye with impatient sigh beaumont roused from day dream to find seated on cold stone under sky from whence glory of sunset have departed beside silently stood veiled woman jumped to foot in surprise feeling somewhat cramped be about to speak when woman threw back heavy veil showing pitiful face of dream patience allerby gasped recoiling step patience allerby replied sternly folding hand in front of black dress very woman basil beaumont whom loved ruined deserted in london more than twenty year ago beaumont with effort threw off glamour of past thought have haunted afternoon with sneering laugh relapsed once more into bitter tongued cynical man of world rapidly rolled cigarette having lighted began to smoke gazing critically meanwhile at stern white face looking at from out shadowy twilight more than twenty year ago repeated thoughtfully humph be long time

child child mine one ever knew be mother did not wish sin to be visited on head did not want to be pointed at a nameless outcast very creditable of be sure said beaumont with sneer what did do invented story have be in service of child parent who have afterwards gone to france died there said be child nurse placed in care of doctor larcher to be brought up what little money must spare out of salary a housekeeper be given to vicar a money left to child by father to day vicar doe not suspect truth quite romance said beaumont lightly have idea have such inventive power there be one thing

reginald blake cigarette dropped out of beaumont nerveless finger white face grew shade whiter reginald blake whispered under breath young fellow who sings same beaumont remained silent for few moment thinking deeply have certainly reason to be ashamed of son said coolly looking at patience deserve credit for way have brought up have done so a expiation for sin bah be melodramatic said coarsely brought up because be son not because of expiation rubbish doe know who be have spared that knowledge of shame let bear sin alone humbug sin a call doe trouble in slightest in fact be rather pleased than otherwise what do mean asked in alarm mean that be got uncommonly fine tenor voice see why money must be made out of patience sprang towards like enraged tigress eye flashing fire not by hissed

slave a to rest will take care that everyone in village know story will be drummed out of place a scoundrel be clever a be beaumont saw patience held trump card so suddenly forsook dictatorial manner spoke blandly very well will say nothing to at just now will never say anything to said sternly stay in village if like dare to reveal secret to reginald blake if do will be worse for be not going to have ruined for life by treachery patience own son bah snarled turning on viciously talk like to scoundrel be scoundrel be touch come near breathe one word of secret a sure a there be god above will do what say beaumont made step forward a if to seize with gesture of loathing drew dress around fled away into darkness leaving standing alone by river remained silent for few moment then brow cleared resumed nonchalant manner though face still remained pale haggard son reginald said lightly rolling cigarette have idea of such luck ah cat will cut claw yet will make money out of voice yet in spite of threat fine madame suddenly thought struck a lighted cigarette laughed softly good heaven said with shrug admire miss challoner so doe appears continued mr beaumont sauntering away then be rival of own son chapter xi mr beaumont make discovery when one be playing in game of life 't be wrong to throw away single card lest by odd mistake of circumstance card despised if played with dext'rous hand must gain unexpected victory when basil beaumont came to think over thing struck a somewhat strange that patience must have voluntarily told secret for concealment of have several excellent reason firstly must have have great struggle with pride before bringing to address man to whom owed ruin secondly on informing beaumont that reginald be son must have known there be great chance of revealing whole story to young fellow out of sheer devilry thirdly knowing that reginald be clever must have expected penniless father must try make money out of talent beaumont be too astute reader of character to blind to fact that patience must have be aware of three thing hence wonder at telling what did not want known artist clever a be still lacked discernment to recognise full subtlety of woman instinct else must have readily seen that patience feared ignorance of real state of affair more than knowledge heard that be in village acquainted with reginald blake be also aware that be coming to grange to paint squire garsworth portrait have seen there must have made inquiry concerning position among other thing must doubtless have ascertained that be reginald nurse knowing that have left london with own son weak story a told about blake parentage must not have imposed upon for moment by putting two two together must have discovered everything with natural result that must have recognised blake a own child sought out told whole story of birth in order to avert calamity determined to boldly take bull by horn tell beaumont everything at same time warning that must embitter reginald mind against must dare to speak out result of interview in churchyard be a expected beaumont be too cunning to risk dislike of own son thereby lose chance of influencing for own end so quietly acquiesced in line of conduct laid down patience returned to grange thoroughly satisfied that have disarmed beaumont by pointing out how must turn reginald against so astute man of world abandoning desire to play part of long lost father determined to wait for few week see how thing turned out then intended to let plan be guided to large extent by circumstance have doubt that must then be able to out manoeuvre patience by little dexterous generalship few day after curious meeting with patience in churchyard beaumont set out for long walk in morning a wanted to think over aspect of thing pedestrianism always stimulated brain be bright fresh morning with deeply blue sky cheerful sun shining keen fresh wind blowing across common on to strolled gorse be in bloom breath of wind brought odour of peach like scent to nostril how often in bohemian life have that odour recalled wide bare common with mile of gorse covered ground made long half regretfully for quiet country village where youth have be passed now that common be actually before by curious contradiction of nature did not feel least regret longing for youth on contrary strolled over waste ground hatching kind of plot plan in busy brain at once a stood on edge of gentle slope where ground be hollowed out like cup surrounded by dark green of gorse with golden blossom saw woman seated on grassy bank apparently basking in sun hand be lying idly in lap with face turned upward to bright sunshine be drinking in sweet keen air swept over wild moorland beaumont saw that be cecilia mosser who sat there for moment half envied blind girl in spite of great sorrow for pleasant enjoyment of nature look like goddess of desolation murmured beaumont a descended slope eyeless destiny see nothing yet governs lightly a walked over soft green grass blind girl heard sound of muffled footstep turned face in direction from whence heard come with questioning look on placid face how do do miss mosser said beaumont tranquilly be taking stroll on common saw sitting here alone like genius of solitude often come here observed cecilia placidly folding hand be favourite spot of mine know inch of way be not afraid of losing be at first said blind girl with quiet laugh soon got to know way about must find way here on darkest night like bulwer lytton nydia remarked beaumont idly casting down on grass yes like be always darkest night with replied cecilia with sigh still have compensation for can hear many sound very likely escape notice of fortunate people who can see what kind of sound asked artist more for sake of making remark than because cared to know flowing of river whispering of wind humming of bee rustle of gorse seem to to have human voice tell story can well understand old legend where mortal heard voice everywhere understood saying of wave melancholy voice of night wind a siegfried understood language of bird said beaumont require dragon blood to teach that suppose know what mean exactly replied cecilia in puzzled tone for have never heard of niebelung ring bird do speak to that be fancy do love to hear cuckoo throstle then lark ah lark be most charming of so poet think there be bird who have inspired more poetry than lark from shakespeare down to tennyson suppose put fancy into music yes often try to do so think anyone understands meaning answered cecilia with faint smile know english be not music loving nation depends on how define music said artist cynically great b p like something with tune in when hear anything ca understand such a bach spohr admire same be afraid b p humbug be terribly severe said cecilia laughing hope wo criticise concert assure be most lenient of critic will come to admire beauty not to find out fault besides blake be going to sing voice be charming yes be replied blind girl cordially miss challoner sings very well also be going to sing duet with mr blake if can get away for one night from squire oh will be easily arranged have doubt said beaumont carelessly doctor nestley will attend to a uttered name vivid flush passed over pale face of girl beaumont noticed with secret amazement hullo said to wonder what mean must find out be curious that must trouble about trivial matter beaumont be wise man who never overlooked smallest thing thought might prove useful to at present idea have suddenly shot into scheming brain be only embryo idea still might help in way be completely in mist a to what be going to do cecilia blush have given clue to something tangible immediately began to artfully question blind girl so a to obtain possible result know doctor nestley of course said looking keenly at face from whence red flush have died away yes met few day ago be in church when mr blake be singing observed cecilia in low tone heard speak what beautiful voice ah know reason of blush now thought beaumont love good heaven what hopeless passion love nestley love una challoner how tricky dan cupid be to be sure a have made answer blind girl went on speaking a can not see face always guess what be like by voice doctor nestley have beautiful speaking voice be face handsome rather handsome said beaumont now seized with cruel desire to fan flame of hopeless love burned in blind woman heart yes suppose woman must call face handsome be rather sad sad echoed cecilia in startled tone why be face sad beaumont shrugged shoulder ouf replied coolly how must know because soul be sad presume face be index of mind know daresay run way face be sad because soul be sad soul sadness be caused by sad life be unhappy then asked cecilia breathlessly must say not now said beaumont with emphasis when knew in london few year ago have met with many revers of fortune poor doctor nestley sighed blind girl seized with sudden desire to comfort unhappy man of whom knew absolutely nothing save that have beautiful speaking voice do know story whereupon beaumont who knew from shakespeare that pity be akin to love set to work to awaken cecilia mosser pity told marvellously pathetic story of nestley early life in truth fiction be so dexterously blended that hero must have be puzzled to say be real false attained object however for saw by varied emotion passed over blind girl expressive face how moved be by story poor doctor nestley said again poor poor doctor nestley oh misery be past now said beaumont lightly have weathered storm will doubt day marry woman who will make happy blind woman laid hand on heart a if felt there cruel pain then spoke to beaumont in strangled kind of voice must think curious creature mr beaumont said rapidly to take such interest in man of whom know nothing remember be blind be kind to failing can only judge people by voice doctor nestley voice have affected more than one else why know of course be precluded by misfortune from many thing understand ah must understand how difficult be for to conceal feeling be stranger be blind woman voice rous in strange feeling can not explain even to know be foolish talking like so forget what have said will forget will not miss mosser said beaumont gravely rising to foot may be sure will respect what have heard a sacred confidence thank thank very much cried poor woman while tear ran down cheek know be foolish must despise for way have spoken still be blind blind beaumont felt pang of pity in hard heart at anguish of unhappy woman shut out from all love a between man woman by misfortune be about to speak when cecilia lifted head will go now mr beaumont said in low voice please leave will be right soon can then go home will not forget promise promise be sacred said artist slowly turning away left blind woman seated in hollow with hand clasped on lap sightless eye looking up to blue sky strange thought a lighted cigarette girl have fallen in love with voice doe not even know be in love although half guess know nothing of nestley yet love why because have charming voice suppose must call woman instinct ah if only knew how hopeless love be nestley be too much bewitched by una to waste thought on discovery slight a be gratified beaumont keen sense of intrigue a gave card to play in game against patience if must hing with reginald because be embittered against by mother still must separate from una by circulating few skilful falsehood if cecilia ever learned that nestley loved una be too much of woman to keep silent in matter through una must hear of nestley infatuation again to secure nestley to herself cecilia knowing reginald adored una must tell of new complication with result that nestley reginald must quarrel over miss challoner perhaps in end quarrel must part una lover for ever be very vague intangible a yet still beaumont felt in mysterious way that knowledge of blind girl love for nestley might prove useful to in weaving net around son so a to secure entirely to reginald nestley love una mused a sauntered home cecilia mosser love nestley yes material for complication be there how see at present still more card have to play against patience allerby sooner will win game chapter xii parable of sower sower scattereth seed in rich barren ground soon earth in place of weed with golden corn be crowned meanwhile old squire be much better in health owing to skill of dr nestley dreading relapse insisted upon young doctor staying with for time though miserly a rule yet paid handsome sum

so high that may never fall who lie so low that may never rise lowliest may one day win life prize highest thro ' temptation lose beaumont be man who neglected chance however small by must benefit consequently thinking if discovered squire garsworth secret might prove of use to determined to find out about knew perfectly well that power of persuasion must lead madman to divulge thought so only chance of discovering anything be to reduce to mere automaton perfectly powerless in hand hoped to do by mean of hypnotism of curious process knew good deal while in germany year before have by accident come across heidenheim book on animal magnetism interested so much that pursued subject after reading opinion of grtzner berger baumler on hypnosis turned attention to french authority eagerly following history of animal magnetism from mesmer puysgur downward led by such study to try hand on subject became quite adept in strange psychological science taking up at first merely a amusement on going deeper into subject soon saw that such hypnotic power must be terrible weapon in hand of unscrupulous man a by reducing hypnotised person to condition of mere instrument enabled to do act through such instrument for must not be held legally responsible in book on subject by mm demarquay giraud teulon entitled recherches sur l'hypnotism have come across case in lady in condition of hypnotic hallucination began to tell aloud secret compromised exceedingly taking case a illustration of what must be done during hypnosis beaumont determined to throw squire into cataleptic trance by question suggestion lead to reveal secret being done must restore to normal condition absolutely ignorant of revelation thought if secret be worth anything must then do what pleased having thus definitely settled plan of action next step to take be to guard against possibility of nestley surprising in of hypnotic experiment with a medical attendant of squire must have perfect right to interfere although nestley have become much more friendly with beaumont still regarded with certain amount of suspicion so artist aim be now to reduce to state of subjection in have be in london five year before knew nestley be very clever man remarkably weak likely to be led astray in london under influence of drink have be slave to beaumont here in garsworth artist determined to reduce to similar state of slavery never for moment did think of clever brain must destroy life must wreck wanted be assistance of young doctor in certain plan beneficial to at cost determined to carry out beaumont a matter of fact have in great deal of italian despot nature a described by machiavelli with cold relentless subtlety set to work to ruin unhappy duncan nestley body soul for own end nestley be doubtless weak to allow to be so dominated unhappily be nature if nature endows man largely in one way generally deprives of something else in equal proportion while nestley be brilliant clever man who if left to must have lived honest creditable life yet morally weak nature placed at mercy of unscrupulous scoundrel who thought fit to play upon feeling unhappily circumstance aided beaumont nefarious plan for after leaving una young doctor walked across common to village hoping to pull together by brisk walk at bridge found beaumont leaning over looking at water swirling below on hearing artist looked up with gratified smile a recognised victim what be matter nestley asked after first greeting look well be not well retorted nestley abruptly be nearly worn out by old man morn noon night have got to be beside if be paid handsomely be taking full value out of yes think be replied beaumont deliberately look quite thin not man of three week ago must be kind of medival succubus living on blood of young men must be wise for to leave nestley leaned chin on folded arm be resting on parapet of bridge sighed deeply ca do oh understand said beaumont with sneer beginning to smoke one of eternal cigarette what do understand why wo leave grange there be difficulty in guessing that retorted nestley angrily medical what deuce be grinning at friend said basil smiling medical what honour knowledge interest what like talk rubbish a please look here said nestley turning round with resolute frown on haggard face what be reason leave grange not being in confidence ca say if may guess must think una challoner nestley made gesture of assent turned once more to gaze moodily at grey water of river if only have courage muttered harshly must throw into water end everything more fool remarked beaumont cynically men have died from time to time worm have eaten not for love give rosalind remark lie have doubt love someone else said nestley bitterly have doubt doe replied beaumont tranquilly seem quite worn out between love sickness so come with to inn have something to eat mind said nestley listlessly ca eat thing give way so easily dear fellow said beaumont scornfully a walked along be man not baby be not in love true oh king have have disease badly enough be dead done with now have left venus for plutus think mercury god of trickster have of worship dr nestley made remark being occupied with own sad thought so beaumont said nothing more walked along to inn silently on arriving there went into parlour nestley took seat near window staring idly out at dusty road while beaumont ordered slight luncheon bottle of champagne job kossiter idea of wine be very vague one a habitually drank beer in deference to beaumont wish sent over to duxby obtained few dozen case of champagne whose excellence satisfied even fastidious artist table being laid luncheon brought in beaumont filled two tumbler with champagne one for other placed by nestley plate young doctor being wrapped up in gloomy thought did not perceive when took seat at table have idea that glass at elbow contained wine instead of water tried to eat two three mouthful of food not succeeding took up glass to drink so preoccupied be that be not until have swallowed mouthful that perceived what be replacing glass on table immediately glared angrily at beaumont who feigning not to observe annoyance went on eating luncheon with great enjoyment why did give champagne asked nestley harshly know only drink water know be idiot retorted beaumont coolly know what be good for in present state of health glass of champagne will do harm forget harm drink have done already five year ago said artist mockingly have be teetotaller for five year so think be entitled to little indulgence now go on drink up like man replied nestley resolutely turned head away will not drink very well said beaumont indifferently please unhappy friend looked again at amber coloured wine in glass felt half inclined to yield after have not touched liquor of sort for five long year did not feel a rule inclined to take now night of watching by bedside of old squire have worn out physically disdain of una have made wretched mentally so half determined to take one glass to cheer up good angel however came to aid at critical moment turning head away with shudder went on making pretence of eating beaumont who have watched narrowly time saw struggle be going on in young man mind with true craftiness pretended to take notice satisfied that victim be gradually being lured into snare so artfully laid so love miss challoner said genially well can hardly wonder at to tell truth fell in love with merely in artistic sense assure added astute artist with laugh a saw anger in nestley face have lovely face seems to wear calm of old greek statue must like to paint a artemis inviolate artemis before loved endymion with serene light of chastity on face sweetness of night in eye must be wonderful picture wonder ask to be model growled nestley sulkily hardly worth while for two reason replied beaumont lightly yet with suspicion of regret in tone in first place must refuse in second hand have lost cunning one need to be young enthusiastic to paint classical picture be of too earthy nature to have such hopeless vision well be going to play part of young endymion to moon goddess answered nestley bitterly wo have anything to do with poor endymion be fool talking such classical stuff tell be madly in love with wo have anything to do with everything be against be poor unloved obscure life be worth living under such condition looked again at sparkling wine seemed to invite to try a anodyne for pain everything seemed to distorted imagination to be dull dark wine must at least give few hour respite from torturing thought be master of now must drink one glass more after seeing that everything be lost what did matter if did fall once more have nothing to live for now wild despair took possession of heart with reckless laugh seized glass finished wine to last drop evoh bacchus said beaumont draining glass there be nothing like wine to cure broken heart insidious wine mounted rapidly to excitable brain of young man no longer felt regret at breaking pledge have made five year before humdrum past of struggle respectability be done with wine must solace drink who cared for such thing anacreon be head of glorious band of poet praised wine wise anacreon knew true virtue of grape past be dead future be uncertain live live only in present with wine to make a god evoh bacchus stimulating wine have performed work excellently world hitherto so gloomy now appeared of roseate tint broken heart repeated with gay laugh pish heart break so easily woman mean yes will ask again nothing like perseverance said basil observing with infinite joy flushed face bright eye of young man have more wine rather replied nestley holding out glass beaumont filled be fool to give up for water be sick of total abstainer thin blooded croaker here confusion to drank off second glass beaumont now saw that victim be in obstinate stage of recklessness must not brook contradiction so knew well how to proceed well have finished bottle said brightly suppose go out for walk walk returned nestley with imbecile grin have stood bottle now be turn want more said beaumont indifferently think have have enough also have retorted nestley defiantly be a straight a die suppose wo drink with oh yes will if insist upon do insist cried doctor bringing fist down on table with bang must drink to show there be ill will be once friend basil be so still trust said artist cordially hand said nestley with outburst of maudlin affection give hand beaumont suffered hand to be shaken violently by doctor then that gentleman now in hilarious state of excitement walked to bell ringing with unnecessary violence margery appeared in answer seemed somewhat astonished at nestley state a have always be so reserved quiet in demeanour bottle of champagne said nestley in thick voice coming close to be pretty girl tried to embrace margery who be used to seeing rustic in similar state pushed away with hearty laugh went off to get wine nestley resumed seat at table talking rapidly to beaumont about sort of thing then began to boast about can do anything anything tell said looking at beaumont who be smoking brain worth dozen of other fellow believe oh yes believe replied beaumont a margery returned with bottle of champagne if be 'd take more wine wo said nestley in defiant manner will see margery retreated laughing at maudlin condition of young man filling tumbler up to brim with wine drank off with air of drunken bravado beaumont with sneer on thin lip sat calmly watching grotesque antic of man have brought so low only took little of second bottle dr nestley sang laughed boasted till leg began to get shaky then sat down finished rest of bottle thereby reducing to state of hopeless intoxication finally fell asleep with head on table whereupon beaumont not without difficulty woke up half led half dragged to sofa with noisy protest that be all right unhappy young man lay down in few moment fell into drunken slumber while beaumont feeling compunction at having reduced human being to level of beast stood over with sneer think will give much trouble said serenely have started on downward path once more time expect will never get back again went out calmly smoking cigarette asked margery to let one disturb friend be taken more than be good for said apologetically oh bless sir be nothing returned margery stolidly sleep will put right will said beaumont to when be standing in bright sunshine sleep will never put all right again in life duncan nestley chapter xix jam jam efficaci do manus scientiae use charm ephesian letter philtre spell rune aught of necromantic devilry yet thro ' power of new found science before searching gaze bare soul read secret longing writ thereon owing to nestley skilful treatment squire soon recovered from illness fact of twice being laid upon bed of sickness within few week showed how susceptible constitution have become to slightest ailment how rapidly such ailment might terminate with fatal result to young vigorous frame such slight indisposition must be comparatively unimportant weak body of old man with worn out organization be able to develop disorder in most alarming tanner flame of life be very feeble be only by utmost watchfulness that must be kept alive at in spite of settled conviction regarding incarnation in new body squire seemed remarkably loth to leave old one obeyed doctor order in most slavish manner dreading lest by chance soul must slip away into next world have accumulated large fortune according to delusion hoped to enjoy when soul have become incarnate in new body so have trouble on score great desire be now to get portrait finished to end in spite of ill health insisted upon leaving bed sitting to beaumont according to regular custom basil having once more brought nestley under dominating will determined to proceed at once in hypnotic experiment at final sitting judged admirable time to carry out idea all wanted be opportunity to introduce subject without rousing squire suspicion old man during conversation speedily afforded opportunity of doing so be in drawing room a usual squire looking more wrinkled worn than ever be seated in arm chair while artist dexterously put line here there on painted face before seem well morning mr garsworth said beaumont a old man moved wearily in chair sir retorted squire in harsh voice expect will leave bed again when once go back to oh thing be surely not so bad a be afraid be replied garsworth shaking head be anxious to go into new body leave worn out frame with incessant pain be in pain now asked beaumont sympathetically yes have bad attack of neuralgia east wind always affect more le way think must do good nonsense be not doctor be not rose have lived near dear sir said beaumont equably know something of therapeutic little knowledge be dangerous thing replied old man sneeringly can reply with proverb said basil smiling drowning man will clutch at straw so take a straw see what can do can not cure of neuralgia can give relief in what way by hypnosis bah mesmer charlatanism not at have studied subject assure there be more truth in than imagine mesmer be not altogether charlatan remember be wiser than cagliostro well well what do propose to do hypnotise then well neuralgia will go away after have be in trance time then will wake can retire portrait wo affect portrait in least can go on painting will be free from pain squire hated pain be moreover very curious to test beaumont knowledge so consented to idea go on sir said grimly object beaumont nodded carelessly delighted thus to have gained end producing from pocket facetted piece of glass arose from seat walked over to old man taking up position at one side of chair held glittering object just above squire forehead look steadily at said in quiet tone on garsworth doing so waited silently for result soon took place eye became humid brilliant gaze fixed pupil dilated until old man fell into cataleptic state a glass facet be still held in front of eye soon passed into lethargic condition fell backward in chair with sigh beaumont took glass away with feeling of relief a doubted being able to produce hypnotic sleep so easily have now at command will le automaton who must do what ever be told be not what beaumont desired a be unable to suggest secret to helpless man before without suggestion automaton must not do anything wanted to change lethargic sleep into somnambulistic state so that must have memory intelligence imagination of squire at command achieved by slightly rubbing hand to fro for few minute across top of head in obedience to feeling produced by garsworth rapidly passed into state of active somnambulism arose from chair looked quickly from right to left while beaumont spoke to during conversation followed be in state of perpetual movement beaumont have now to do be to suggest thing to somnambulist must engender train of thought train of thought must be speedily acted upon by volition tall figure in black swayed rapidly to fro while beaumont spoke in clear deliberate manner suggesting question wanted to be answered have secret have secret assented somnambulist in same slow manner have arranged certain affair so that will be able to enjoy present fortune during next incarnation yes think have arranged everything necessary to carry out idea think so state to yourself whole scheme so that can see have forgotten nothing garsworth remained silent for moment then began to talk rapidly have arranged everything in proper manner be sure have forgotten nothing will have be made year in have left property to natural son such natural son doe not exist at present be fictitious person when be re incarnated will become reality will be own natural son property will pas to myself in new body by action of will in present body will be necessary for in new form to prove person mentioned in will do in such new body by producing certain paper seal ring have safely hidden away retaining memory during next incarnation go to hiding place find paper ring produce to lawyer who hold will having proved identity a natural son can become possessed of property yes everything be all right ceased speaking beaumont having listened attentively be much struck with ingenuity of idea expressed in delusion then be way in hoped to carry out scheme be ever madman so whimsical artist did not see much chance of benefiting by discovery so far still if saw paper mentioned by squire there might be something in must prove useful yes must get squire to show hiding place of paper scheme be perfect said slowly one may find hiding place steal paper replied somnambulist in exulting tone chance of have hidden too well go see if be safe safe safe be that paper safe muttered old man with frown must see must see how can go be too weak beaumont instantly exerted power by suggestion be very strong go at once examine paper ordinarily squire used crutch to walk with on hearing remark about strength from hypnotiser at once became imbued with hallucination that be physically vigorous man walked towards door of drawing room with rapid springy step followed by beaumont somnambulist lead way up stair paused for moment on first landing then turning round walked towards front of house on first floor at moment patience allerby came out of one of room seeing squire walking in such rapid manner beaumont following looked at in alarm where be going sir cried a garsworth brushed past putting out hand tried to grasp slight touch gave appeared to cause somnambulist suffering break hypnotic spell for paused at once alarmed lest old man must awake beaumont gripped patience by wrist dragged back quickly be going for paper said to garsworth be going for paper repeated squire slowly then in obedience to impulse engendered went on again patience must have spoken devilish look on beaumont face seemed to freeze blood be silent said in harsh whisper shaking wrist will tell soon now be silent for son sake wrenched free shrank back into shadow with cry while beaumont taking further notice quickly followed squire who be now distance ahead garsworth opened large folding door stood short distance away from stair led into ball room of grange followed by artist went into long bare room stretched nearly whole length of front wing of house being lighted by eight large window looking out on to park room be chill bleak footfall awaking responsive echo leaving mark on grey dust have accumulated on floor for many year wall opposite door be adorned with delicately painted panel representing nine mus female figure being twice life size rising from floor to arched roof between of eight window at one end of room panel represented three grace at other three fate while remaining wall displayed nine goddess of heathen mythology arched roof be painted deep blue silvered with star nowhere appeared male form nothing gracious female figure of hellas be to be seen around squire went straight to extreme corner of room on left hand of door knelt down where there be panel representing clotho spinning thread of life evidently touched spring concealed in gold embossed frame of panel for silently slid back displaying wall of rough stone upper block of stone appeared heavy cumbersome lower one be much smaller a beaumont looked saw garsworth drag from place smallish stone in lower centre of wall displaying only rough place where lay cavity where anything must be hid squire however soon showed how ingenious be hiding place have chosen for on turning round stone have taken out there appeared small hole hollowed out from old man took paper ring laid down for moment to lift stone off lap at moment beaumont exerting hypnotic power said abruptly be looking at paper under influence of hallucination produced squire looked earnestly at stone on lap while beaumont picking up real paper glanced over rapidly examined ring then laid down again by somnambulist must put back suggested distinctly garsworth picked up paper replacing in stone put once more in former position then dragged panel along till clicked on spring thus resuming former appearance one to look at must think that large picture must be moved in way even if secret of panel be discovered beaumont felt sure one must think of examining interior of stone in wall having now ascertained wanted to know beaumont next care be to get squire back to former position wake so that must be unconscious of what have done during hypnotic sleep to end bent forward to kneeling figure on floor mr beaumont be waiting to finish picture yes yes must have picture done said garsworth rising to foot left room followed by beaumont who saw white face of patience peering from shadow frowning at in menacing manner placing finger on lip to enforce silence glided past down wide stair across hall into drawing room where found squire have once more re established in chair well said beaumont to there seems to be chance of making use of secret ca do without help of patience so must see meanwhile will wake squire crossed over to squire touched face with own cold hand upon old man started violently then spoke loudly into ear mr garsworth somnambulist opened eye confused expression appeared on face a looked at beaumont do feel better asked artist gently yes answered

hypnotism usually produce dream aha said garsworth cunningly be dreaming of secret did not speak in sleep did asked in sudden terror be perfectly quiet answered artist going back to seat feel too tired to sit more observed garsworth rising with great effort must lie down hypnotism seems to exhaust body very much doe of course act physically squire with aid of stick moved painfully to door leaving beaumont smiling at picture before chapter xx when in doubt play trump life be game keenest win repute shame life be game give claim for virtue sin life be game keenest win beaumont be perfectly satisfied with result of experiment a have discovered squire secret have yet succeeded in keeping in ignorance of having done so with keen intellect of man accustomed to live by wit have during rapid survey of paper seen chance of turning secret to own advantage to do so required co operation of patience be doubtful of obtaining held studiously aloof from since interview in churchyard have given sign that be aware of existence many men must have be discouraged by contemptuous silence not so beaumont who never saw discourtesy in anyone of whom wanted to make use hitherto patience have be mere cipher in eye now since discovery of existence of son since have learned jealously guarded secret of squire suddenly became important person for be through hoped to secure end end calculated to benefit alone only way by must hope to gain ear be through love for son hence explanation on stair now after putting away painting utensil lighted cigarette strolled easily along to housekeeper room in order to arrange matter with her of result have fear a intended to appeal to motherhood appeal well knew must not be neglected by woman whose whole life be devoted to son mr

what to do must ask counsel of lord arose having lighted candle opened bible chapter xxi good samaritan man be whimsical animal at best for there be life what may day act in discord with theory patience allerby occupied very peculiar position knew that did so much to perplexity ever since lapse from virtue have lived self denying existence a expiation for sin have cause to be satisfied with past twenty year of life seeing that have done nothing wrong time true living in almost monastic existence have temptation to fight against absence of temptation rendered comparatively easy to lead virtuous life not being tempted lived ascetic life being absolutely certain that be strong enough to withstand temptation however powerful vain hope for now devil in person of old betrayer assaulted on weakest side have tried to make rob master return to old life of sin must have failed dismally appeal through motherhood be perilous to strength beaumont knew when used love for reginald a weapon against in spite of prayer tear comforting text knew that if beaumont wished to commit crime to benefit son must do so in defiance of religious belief however strong god alone knew night of anguish woman passed wrestling with subtle temptation placed before in such attractive shape old saint who according to pious legend fought with visible power of evil have such terrible enemy to cope with in contrast to soul racked with doubt fighting against spiritual prompting in vain poor soul who wished to do right closed ear to infernal whispering of evil spirit in vain read with frenzied ardour terrible prophecy of isaiah comforting promise of gospel in vain knelt weeping bitterly before crucifix praying to be guarded from falling into sin be useless spiritual weapon have lost efficacy intense maternal passion blunted sense of religious duty after terrible struggle with invisible enemy left completely prostrate began to calmly consider beaumont scheme from moment be lost for on reviewing whole matter began to pacify conscience with argument concerning rectitude of affair must be doing wrong to anyone nay must be conferring benefit on una seeing that by marriage with reginald must be put in possession of property at once whereas must will be carried out strictly must have to wait everlastingly for appearance of non existing person suppose agreed to beaumont plan said fanny blake squire be parent of son must become rich honoured bearing renowned name longer be unknown waif heavily handicapped in battle of life on other hand must learn shame of birth must cast everlasting shadow on young spirit what wealth what position must compensate in own eye for moral stigma thus cast upon might succeed to property marry una thus do harm to anyone still if became father how deeply must feel for sin of parent being visited on offspring must not place in position better for to remain unknown obscure with full belief in honourable birth than go through life haunted by spectre of intolerable disgrace while thus hesitating between two view of case sudden idea came to inclined to refuse to help beaumont let boy make own life ignorant of stain on name squire in spite of miserly habit have kind heart must ask to give reginald fifty hundred pound to help then lad must go to london make position by vocal talent thus must benefit in way through money unjustly obtained una being in possession of property must marry enjoy just same a if scheme be carried out yes must be best way must at least never know who what be must thus assist in life without committing crime more thought of plan better liked falling on knee in dark thanked god long fervently for solution have shown her of difficulty next morning proceeded to carry idea into effect for after miss cassy una have paid usual morning visit found alone with squire in position to make request garsworth be lying in bed propped up by pillow looked very feeble indeed so patience saw end must not be far off in spite of nestley care attention after recovery from debauch nestley have felt bitter shame at fall having lost self respect by thus reverting to old way tried to drown remorse by drinking alcohol be rapidly regaining old influence over still did not let interfere with attendance on squire if old man saw that nestley hand be shaky eye becoming bleared said nothing unhappy young man performed duty in mechanical way drinking deeply whenever opportunity offered nestley looking haggard unsteady after drinking of previous night have just left room leaving patience alone with squire when old man spoke sharply patience what be matter with doctor drink answered laconically drink repeated squire raising on elbow nonsense woman must be mistaken drink wine spirit never did until week ago answered patience coolly used to be total abstainer now well can see for long connection have existed between strange couple a master servant have developed between certain amount of familiarity remember said garsworth musingly that in last incarnation drank ale very much be in reign of elizabeth drank confusion to king of spain resulted in confusion to myself if have not be drunkard must not have be pauper be pity young man must follow same downward path be own fault replied patience in stony manner ought to stop when find doe harm doubt returned old man acidly did ever know man deny anything if did harm did yes because have object to gain life led in town be very pleasant must have left pauper for next incarnation be use trying to argue old man out of delusion so patience said nothing stood beside in grim silence with folded arm will enjoy when be born again pursued garsworth exultingly will have plenty of money new body will have youth once again oh youth youth how short be golden hour young men never know treasure posse in youth waste in idleness folly there be that child brought up reginald blake did not bring up well well rejoined garsworth testily know what mean be nurse have

muttered garsworth eye gleaming money be necessity still have talent hear what can talent do everything clever brain command world dare say retorted patience ironically if get money to give start master reginald have in to make great name by voice need help help of money who will give help eyed old man keenly a spoke ah who indeed replied carelessly who indeed why not said housekeeper eagerly ejaculated in surprise yes retorted vehemently be a say nurse of boy have loved far more than dead parent ever did left to stood in mother place be dearest wish that must succeed with money can do so have served long faithfully asked favour now that have mentioned name ask first last favour of give money help to succeed do think be mad cried old man shrilly why must help what be to have gathered wealth by year of self denial want to enjoy in next existence not squander in by helping pauper yet talk of golden hour of youth replied bitterly be easy saying hard doing what be hundred pound to drop in ocean what be to everything ca part with money said doggedly turning face away voice took tender tone a pleaded for son have claim upon know think of youth talent wasted in dull village say will remember in next body what have done in for year have never done kind action to human being do one now by helping lad next existence will be none worse for having helped unknown man old man made

station be born influence friendship may be help to will be more precious when know be work woman voice died away in soft manner anxiously watched old man wrinkled face to see if must do what asked

garsworth arm do for own sake not now put letter in desk let see do handed key so taking letter over to desk deposited in place indicated by lean outstretched finger having locked safely up blew out candle brought key back to squire placed under pillow then lay down again with sigh of exhaustion there have done what asked said in dull voice now go away will sleep little patience carefully tucked clothes round then left room with look of triumph on face now basil beaumont said when be outside door think can laugh at threat about son chapter xxii phantasmagoria shadow of what be shadow living

to a great event a ball of season to town belle reginald pumpkin walked over to grange mr larcher be driven over in state by dick pemberton who drove at speed that nearly rattled vicar wife into hysteric consequently on arriving at destination mr larcher be severely under sway of affliction have to be at once comforted with strong tea cecilia have also be invited arrived at grange under guardianship of miss busky who bounced blind girl so rapidly along road that entered park in state of exhaustion party assembled in una private room where be shortly afterwards joined by bluff dr larcher beaumont jellicks having wriggled in with tea cake muffin be dismissed altogether a mr larcher under influence of affliction declared old woman made feel creepy be so twisty dear observed to una like sea serpent know even vicar have noticed qui siccis oculis monstra natantia roared vicar quoting from favourite poet though to be sure speak of in singular of course said dick slily be singular in case so very odd giggled miss cassy who be making tea mean jellicks what say pun know like what be name byron have in burlesque not don juan one know other so odd be not so odd a miss

illness glancing at cecilia saw blind girl be trembling violently hope be not very ill said in low clear voice oh no will be right soon think be overwork said una hastily anxious to avoid discussion of doctor complaint cause of with feminine shrewdness half guessed cecilia will play something blind girl assented be led by una to quaint old spinet stood in corner with true feeling of artist cecilia did not play anything noisy on delicate instrument dainty old gavotte sounded faint clear like sound of silver bell company be charmed with delicacy of music except miss cassy mr larcher who be conversing about dress hope like mine observed miss cassy looking at gown wore be of white muslin dotted with pink bow be afraid 'd make dabby be afraid have made dabby do think so mr larcher eyed production of miss cassy artistic nature with critical eye pronounced opinion that be dabby thus reducing poor miss cassy to verge of tear when cecilia finished gavotte present urged to play something else be like fairy music said beaumont love to hear old air of purcell arne played upon such instrument be so thoroughly in keeping with idea lyric in ' midsummer night dream ' set to old fashioned music played on spinet give one charming idea of court of oberon titania miss mosser play so charmingly said reginald gaily o testudinis aure dulcem qu strepitum pieri tempera ' quoted vicar in rolling bass prefer sweet harmony of spinet to lyre said beaumont smiling dear vicar observed mr larcher angrily wish must be always talking latin one understands be hardly compliment to gentleman present dear said dr larcher in most stately manner a horace say mater pulchra ' beg pardon will refrain from bard now mr blake want to sing something said una crossing over to pumpkin certainly old english melody suppose to match spinet flouts ' mine where be roaming ' let have said beaumont lazily very likely ghost of old elizabethan lyrist will come listen will see real ghost shortly said una mysteriously a pumpkin after whispered consultation moved to door ghost of whom asked reginald who be standing by spinet lady betty modish sophia western ever like town country replied una laughing thereupon vanished with miss what doe mean demanded vicar in astonishment something very odd said miss cassy shaking girlish head yes quite like play school for what be be name sheridan know quite lovely now reginald began to sing quaint old song phyllida flouts while cecilia who knew music off by heart played accompaniment night be beginning to close in room be full of shadow lighted in fantastic manner by red glare of fire flashed on tarnished gilded frame of picture sombre face looking from wall beaumont leaning elbow on mantelpiece listened quietly while opposite to vicar ensconced in great arm chair crossed leg kept time to music with spectacle so gay charming old song sounded nothing of sickly sentimentality of modern drawing room ballad nothing of florid passion of italian school fresh wholesome like gentle wind blowing freely over english meadow white with daisy reginald sang complaint of unhappy lover charmingly ended amid subdued murmur of satisfaction even mr larcher being pleased so simple said nodding head quite soothing like cradle ah there be song now day like old one dear be past age of corydon chloe replied vicar virgil horace must find arcady to sing about now well suppose that imperial rome be more arcadian than london said beaumont lazily be afraid have lost charm of simplicity ah have never heard 'lady bell ' said dick wisely must confess ignorance replied artist who what be lady bell be song simplicity if like reggy found among old music at vicarage did indeed observed vicar placidly doubt belonged to grandfather thought that music be burnt damnosa quid non imminuit dy spared sir at event said reginald gaily miss mosser can play 'lady bell ' yes think so replied cecilia striking chord haunted when first heard sing now mr blake whereupon played prelude of silvery sounding chord reginald sang old ballad of lady bell how despising beau gave heart to plain young country squire left delight of ranelagh for quiet of village so dainty crisp rang music to simple story with arcadian end lady bell in gold brocade looked not so fair trim maid a when in linsey woollen gown left for love noisy town then door opened a reginald ended delightful old song surely on threshold stood lady bell a appeared at ranelagh in powdered hair in shimmer of gold brocade with wide hoop patch on arch looking face with dainty red heeled shoe skilfully manipulated fan be surely lady bell stepped so stately into room in red glare of fire to melodious clearness of gavotte played by cecilia who being whispered to by reginald at once seized spirit of jest perchance one of old garsworth dame have stepped down from gilt frame attracted by familiar tinkle of spinet come to look at what gay company be assembled in oak parlour be to eye lady bell fair dainty a of old who swept into firelight with tapping of high heel sweep of stiff brocade must have light to see cried dick jumping up from chair protest said beaumont lifting up hand will spoil be not miss challoner lady bell ghost from day of powder patch come to visit move in mysterious shadow light will cause to melt away be too substantial for be afraid laughed una waving fan be charming dress found other day thought must give fright think must give one fright whispered reginald whereupon flashed saucy look at out of shadow sweet clear music be still stealing through room

destroyer leaving patience to care of beaumont to whom clung with convulsive terror dr larcher reverently entered a thought chamber of death bent down to form lying so still on floor turned face to light with tender hand be ghastly pale from thin lip there flowed thin stream of blood still vicar saw at glance life yet remained so calling softly to reginald dick three men lifted body up gently placed on bed beaumont have succeeded in somewhat pacifying patience induced woman to go downstairs while sent for doctor to examine sick man re assembled in oak parlour terrified face subdued whisper

by suddenness of event retired early to bed jellicks with help of patience laid corpse out on bed ready for undertaker nestley went to own room solaced with brandy patience remained by side of corpse to watch during night over house there hung shadow of fear dread invested place with awesome terror that once held soul of randal garsworth lay on bed under heavily draped canopy still white faced

first place be afraid from what have seen of son that young man must not consent to be party to swindle in second wished to keep true fact of case to lest reginald must prove difficult to deal with in case by threatening to dispossess of estate must keep firm hand over unconscious victim of scheme thus by little dexterous lying benefited in two way appearing kindly disposed in eye of patience yet keeping own secret a useful weapon in time of need a soon a discovered squire secret foresaw that must have to imitate old man penmanship in order to fill up blank space in document addressed by garsworth to supposed son therefore having obtained specimen of dead man handwriting practised assiduously in order to commit forgery a dexterously a possible be to comparatively easy matter a have pretty talent for imitating handwriting have exercised before though not in fashion likely to bring within reach of law luckily have not to sign name a squire have already attested signature to paper have to do be to fill up blank left in body of letter have evidently not be written very long ink not having faded have to make preparation to imitate colour merely allow word inserted to grow black like rest of content of document therefore intended to fill up blank with necessary detail re seal envelope directed by squire to reginald blake have contained cheque with seal ring in possession then after placing letter ring inside envelope re seal in way a to avert suspicion to end shut up in bedroom on finishing dinner spread out before document have abstracted from hiding place in ball room letter addressed by old man to supposed son be a follows dear son will doubtless be surprised at receiving letter from have strongest claim to write to a be father know that be under impression that have father mother already be not real parent randal garsworth be true father of be mother be born in true parentage be concealed for reason of own now make only reparation in power be to put in possession of property for though be not lawful son be certainly lawful heir take letter seal ring enclosed bearing crest will be found among paper after decease see lawyer messrs binks bolby of glutcher lane in city of london will be sufficient to prove identity a son have made will in favour saying will produce ring letter a proof of identity will be of course in possession of lawyer a above mentioned hope will carry out instruction regarding legacy etc mentioned in said will a have be stranger must be folly for to express regret can say be that hope amount of estate leave will compensate for moral stain on name remain affectionate father randal garsworth after reading extraordinary document beaumont laid down laughed heartily of course garsworth be quite mad therefore folly be excusable that must think to claim property on such flimsy evidence be really strongest proof of insanity luckily observed mr beaumont to can supply missing link by bringing forward patience to prove birth of reginald a fanny blake child in london explain absence of registration baptismal certificate give much more definite birthplace than be likely to give thereupon applied to work after practising name wished to fill in on piece of waste paper inserted in original document clause gave work reading a follows randal garsworth be true father fanny blake of garsworth be mother be born in chelsea london having finished with infinite pain mr beaumont eyed work in very complacent manner when ink be dry said thoughtfully will turn a black a rest of writing will wait till to morrow morning before put into envelope just to see how name look by daylight took letter written by squire to reginald also cheque placed carefully away in one compartment of pocket book then placed envelope seal ring original document wide open in small despatch box so that ink must dry properly having locked box put key in pocket lighted cigarette considered next move must get letter locked up in squire desk said to how very likely nestley have given key to una challoner then there will be chance if ca get key to lock up will slip among loose paper in desk to morrow must look better locked up think will walk over to grange find out if nestley have key still on going down stair however discovered that there be need for to walk to grange a found nestley seated in parlour apparently in very low spirit drinking hot whisky water when saw beaumont face flushed looked away for unhappy man having lost self respect felt moral degradation keenly beaumont however pretended not to notice action advancing towards shook hand warmly asked after health in friendliest manner possible nestley be cold short in reply at first under quiet warmth of beaumont fascinating manner began to talk more amiably excuse drinking hot whisky be so very cold to night said in deprecating tone have have long walk from grange yes will have cold walk back said beaumont in sympathetic manner be not going back replied nestley sadly looking down at table not going back echoed artist why not have finished business at grange be use staying there besides miss challoner dislike so much that be painful for to live in same house with how do know dislike be easily seen manner be quite sufficient besides by persuading to give way to again added vehemently touching glass have caused to lose hope self respect person who look at seems to be pitying downfall well then give up drink what be good said nestley despairingly left off for five year yet such be weak nature yielded to persuasion now have got complete mastery of again seem determined to regard a evil genius said artist deliberately why know suggested little wine on evening in order to cheer up be quite enough too knew in old day when took one glass meant more be not to blame for weakness doubt knowing that weakness might have left alone well well said beaumont impatiently back be broad enough to bear sin a well a own what be going to do now stay here for two three day then go away replied nestley have risked on cast of die lost so be going back to own town live out remainder of life a best can have said good bye to miss challoner intend to know degradation can see in eye in manner in way shrink from have lost best part of self respect beaumont be hard callous a rule must not help feeling pang of pity for abject misery of man whom have brought so low come come nestley said cheerily patting doctor on back be truly sorry ever persuaded to touch wine 'd better leave place at once when be back again in own home will once more take up old life of temperance hard work be too late evil be done rubbish be never too late to mend leave garsworth without delay leave to make love to miss challoner said beaumont with enigmatic smile

possession here be wonderful piece of luck very key be in search of delivered into hand without difficulty whatsoever beaumont did not believe in astrology surely at moment must have thought lucky star be in ascendant with habitual craftiness however suppressed outward manifestation of joy took key from nestley with assenting smile wo forget said calmly slipping into pocket will take advice about leaving village why be so anxious for to go asked nestley suspiciously for own good for own end too have doubt retorted doctor bitterly never did anything in life without motive very well said beaumont strolling to door if choose to take advice stay here drink to death a will surely do please friend please echoed nestley when door closed on beaumont intend to basil beaumont have got plan to carry out must not remain so placidly in dull village so will stay see game out if can thwart will if be only to punish for evil have done to chapter xxvi una make confession may be poor quite unknown in rank there may be men above heart beat for alone ask reason love next morning beaumont examined important document upon hung fate of scheme in order to see by searching light of day if close scrutiny must reveal in palpable degree alteration according to expectation appeared eminently satisfactory for word have inserted have turned quite black assumed ebon tint of rest of handwriting so to ordinary observer entire document appeared to have be written by one person true if be submitted to expert in court of law forgery might be detected beaumont be quite satisfied in own mind that paper must never have to stand test direction in will production of paper seal ring mentioned therein evidence of patience allerby a to birth of reginald must be quite strong enough evidence to put in possession of property even if una must contest affair knew must not do when found that heir who ousted from rightful position be reginald blake being therefore perfectly satisfied mr beaumont took envelope directed by squire to reginald blake at vicarage having placed new wax on closing fold stamped with garsworth arm by mean of seal ring then placing document have so carefully prepared inside together with ring melted under portion of wax till became soft firmly closed letter so that one from appearance must detect fraud being done placed important letter together with key given to by nestley in breast coat pocket set off gaily to grange in order to place where must be easily found have invented trivial explanation to give to una miss cassy must meet before carrying out plan of

everyone be now roused to highest point una asked next question amid breathless silence to whom be letter addressed profound silence ensued during proverbial pin might have be heard to drop a lawyer replied solemnly slowly letter be addressed to ber reginald blake vicarage garsworth ' addressed to cried reginald in astonished voice springing to foot impossible see for replied bolby handing letter reginald took in silence stood holding irresolutely for few moment during time glanced round at astonished face present at last with effort tore open envelope overcome with emotion seemed unable to proceed further crossing room gave opened envelope to vicar dr larcher arose from seat a took letter looked steadily at young man do wish to read asked slowly reginald bowed silently sat down in vicar chair whereupon dr larcher took letter out of envelope leaving ring still inside having opened read content in slow deliberate manner everyone listened in amazement to extraordinary disclosure eye be fixed on reginald who sat in chair with face buried in hand then said vicar folding up letter prof that reginald be son of randal garsworth fanny blake for here be letter here be ring stepped up to lawyer solemnly delivered to then returning to seat laid hand kindly on blake shoulder hear what have read observed sonorously what do say say ' cried young man springing to foot with pale haggard looking face that be lie know sir that be not squire son patience know about birth be honourable honourable be not son of man poor young fellow fairly broke down on hearing reginald be heir to property great joy appeared in una face gave place to look of pity sorrow a saw how keenly felt ignoble circumstance of birth there be only one thing to be done in order to make sure said rising call patience allerby dick pemberton went out of room to fetch during dead silence now prevailed una walked across room to reginald took hand make difference to whispered fondly think that birth will stand in way of marriage love too well for god bless muttered brokenly clasped hand convulsively housekeeper entered room looking pale worn with hard defiant expression on face a if be determined to face affair out to bitter end a indeed be on hearing footstep reginald arose unsteadily to foot looked at anxiously on seeing anguish in face seemed to falter for moment soon recovered veiled agony under stolid composure patience said reginald in broken voice have learned by letter from squire garsworth be son that fanny blake be mother be true bowed head replied slowly perfectly true reginald flung up hand with cry of anguish fell back in chair be true possession of ten thousand year must never cleanse away stain rested on birth why did deceive lad asked dr larcher sternly by order of father replied doggedly if remember sir went to london with fanny blake over twenty two year ago told squire have ruined be why left village six month afterwards child be born died brought baby down to village to squire refused to recognize own offspring said must pay for boy keep so to save good name of child invented story of parent dying in france placed in care have grown up year under name of reginald blake reginald blake be squire son yes hope have done boy justice at last have by will reginald blake be acknowledged a master of garsworth grange patience gave cry of delight with face beaming with tenderness approached young man arose slowly from chair a came near fixing wild eye in horror on face saw look half recoiled offered congratulation timidly be now rich began when interrupted furiously rich rich who care for rich be dishonoured for rest of life have right to name bear have deceived tricked with lie leading to believe that birth at least be without dishonour now now find life have be one long lie do think money will ever repay for stain on birth declare to god must willingly become pauper be if must only regain self respect with poverty look at of be rich young bastard with cry of passionate anger rushed from room with answering cry of anguish patience allerby fell fainting on floor chapter xxviii bitterness of death call death cruel death end strife dishonour turn to gall sweetest life to say that who have assembled in drawing room of grange to hear will read be astonished at extraordinary disclosure have heard must give faint idea of amazement felt that squire must have left large fortune to son of whom one have ever heard be most remarkable that son in question must turn out to be reginald blake be almost beyond belief still after examining evidence of fact mr bolby came to conclusion that there must be no doubt a to identity of young man according to story told by patience allerby who be well known to be nurse of boy have be born at chelsea london six month after fanny blake arrival there have be called by mother name on bringing down to village randal garsworth doubt dreading scandal refused to recognise son agreed to pay for keep patience therefore have done best must under circumstance have placed boy with dr larcher telling that parent be dead thus giving at least fiction of honourable birth have be lie doubt still be lie nobility of there be denying one must hardly be set down by recording angel a to strange discovery have be made everyone saw at once that squire have tried to make tardy reparation for sin by leaving property to unfortunate son evidence of will evidence of letter found in squire desk evidence of seal ring showed plainly that young man be really truly mysterious son alluded to in will besides according to dr squire have mentioned reginald name on death bed pointed towards desk intimating doubt that document must give young man just right be hidden there a indeed be altogether on reviewing whole case through mr bolby declared to be most extraordinary one have ever come under notice there must be doubt that justice have be done reginald be formally recognised by everyone a master of garsworth grange of course absence of registration baptismal certificate must doubtless have proved stumbling block in court of law a beaumont have foreseen there be hesitation upon una part to surrender property to one whom believed to be rightful heir moreover when mr bolby discovered that two claimant be engaged to be married declared that be very neat solution of difficulty although a matter of fact owing to clearness of case on one side refusal to test truth by legal process on other such difficulty have ever arisen beaumont be now extremely satisfied with way in conspiracy have succeeded a have placed son in possession of fine estate worth ten thousand year now next object be to gain control of large income through young man thanks to ingratiating manner completely succeeded in fascinating reginald who admired greatly beaumont only wanted to have young man in company for few month to become indispensable to proposed to become reginald right hand man at fixed salary with authority to look after estate out of foresaw must make nice picking to do however must have to get reginald away from village a patience jealously watched son if thought for one moment beaumont be trying to take advantage of lack of worldly experience be quite capable of exposing whole swindle fate however once more played into hand for mr bolby having recognised reginald a heir insisted upon coming up to london to see partner be put in formal possession of estate beaumont therefore determined also to go to london first so a not to arouse suspicious nature of patience allerby then call on reginald when arrived later on once have interview with in london be quite satisfied that must do what liked with plastic nature of young man on part blake a be now called garsworth be anxious to leave village for time till nine day wonder be over for in spite of consolatory feeling of having ten thousand year felt position bitterly having be brought up in english gentleman household have imbibed rigorous principle life therefore seemed to terrible disgrace to have stigma on name be nobody nameless outcast unrecognized by law of england much a wanted to marry una shrank from giving name to have legal claim dreaded lest there must be child of marriage in case must have to bear stigma attached to father birth spoke seriously to dr larcher about releasing una from engagement restoring to property to felt be justly entitled thus be fruit of beaumont crime placed in jeopardy by honour upright feeling of young man whom such crime have benefited luckily for mr beaumont una came to rescue plainly told reginald that did not care for circumstance of birth must not help in way a to being rightfully entitled to property if married property must be just a much hers a if have be duly left to by squire so after great deal of persuasion from una dr larcher reginald came to accept somewhat improved position with equanimity can not stay here however said bitterly everyone stare at a if be wild beast will go up to town with mr bolby return in few month when get more used to position una fully approved of agreed to stay on at grange with miss cassy until returned then must be married go abroad for year during time old house must be redecorated must then return to live in when circumstance of succession to property have to extent be forgotten beaumont having heard decision determined to go up to town in advance there await reginald arrival so after taking effusive farewell of everyone departed carrying with good wish of with whom have come in contact only patience did not wish god speed surveyed grimly when came to say good bye to be glad to see go said coldly son be now provided for have at least done something towards repairing villainy hope will never set eye upon again if ever hear of meddling with reginald in way will be worse for say worse for of retorted beaumont airily be in same box over affair punishment to mean same for so took departure leaving excellent impression behind everyone hoped must come back again day laughingly promised to do if engagement must permit will see in london reginald said to young man anything can do for there of course may command reginald thanked for kindness little thinking how treacherous that kindness be then addressed to work of preparing for own departure have long interview with patience in informed that story told by to dr larcher have be told with best intention to spare truth on consideration saw for that have acted for best so forgave for falsehood patience stayed on at grange living old life felt quite satisfied now that future of human being loved best on earth be secured reginald asked dr larcher to let take dick to town request worthy vicar granted only admonishing mr bolby to look carefully after pair love a own son said good man gravely dread lest must be led into evil way in great city be young untried let not drink for what say horace 'non ego sanius bacchabor edonis ' wo get bad example from said mr bolby from there be bad example to be got will take to theatre several amusement be so vicar full of anxiety for dear boy allowed to go last to bid reginald farewell be una forget among beauty of london whispered archly will come to town to look for be afraid replied with affectation of lightness be far from feeling will come back to heart whole then if will have will be married so poor lad departed having learned already thus early in life that wealth alone doe not bring happiness chapter xxix from dr nestley point of view so low so low yes be low indeed thy lover tho ' of high estate will fall to tell thee dainty dame devil even now be at ear breathing temptation in most subtle guise soon will lose hold most dear autumn be now nearly over be that bleak chill season just before winter when tree denuded of foliage seemed to wait for snow to cover bare branch shivered complainingly in chill wind under foot ground be dark sodden overhead sky dull lowering while piercingly cold blast blew across lonely marsh whistled shrilly over waste moorland dreary desolate a have looked in summer time garsworth grange appeared even more dreary desolate under sombre coloured damp have discoloured white marble of statue seemed lost amid surrounding desert of bare tree dead leaf be everlastingly raining una looking out of antique window at gloomy landscape seen through driving mist of rain felt dull depressed day long wind whistled through dismal room rain ceaselessly dripped from eaves so be hardly to be wondered that una miss cassy felt anything cheerful be now about two month since reginald have gone up to town una have received frequent letter from about way in everything be being arranged by lawyer of late letter have become feverish in tone a if writer be trying to invest correspondence with kind of fictitious gaiety be far from feeling sudden change of style gave serious uneasiness knew how sensitive reginald be how deeply have felt discovery of real birth so dreaded lest to banish spectre haunted must plunge into dissipation in one of letter also have mentioned that have met beaumont in town a una learned from vicar dick pemberton have gone to folkestone to see uncle felt doubtful a to wisdom of inexperienced youth like reginald being left alone in london with reckless man of world like beaumont have mistrusted beaumont when first met by fascinating manner have succeeded in overcoming repugnance now that be away influence of strong personality died out began to dread power over lover honourable guileless nature wish reginald must come back at once said to miss cassy then must be married must have one to look after be sure will be glad when be married whimpered miss cassy whose spirit lonely life be leading sadly depressed will go melancholy mad if stay here know will be sure be odd be feel like what be name in moated grange know weary weary dead thing mean gloomy flat not so nice a flat have in town if must only go to again feel so shivery so miss cassy rambled on in disconnected fashion one thought suggesting while una sat staring out of window with reginald last letter in hand wondering what be best to be done trust mr beaumont said at length be not good companion for reginald oh dear said miss cassy picking up tea cosy kept by to put on head when felt cold charming man quite lord what be name in manner manner be right have doubt returned una drily what about moral miss cassy gave little girlish scream extinguished with tea cosy what dreadful thing do say una observed in shocked tone so very odd quite like zola so very french dear aunty know be one of people who think that unmarried girl must be absolutely ignorant of such thing agree with there be need of to parade knowledge of evil can not help hearing about however carefully brought up know london be not good place for young man with plenty of money especially when be so inexperienced a reginald besides mr beaumont be man of world whom really believe life by wit if be case of wit against reginald dear aunt be afraid poor reginald will come off worst what be to be done then said miss cassy blankly do think if sent dear reginald tract think must be much use interrupted una laughing will go over to garsworth to see vicar will know what be best to be done will show reginald letter be sure will agree with that will be wise to withdraw from mr beaumont influence why doe mr bolby look after said miss cassy indignantly daresay mr bolby have got own business to look after replied una with faint sigh besides only regard reginald from monetary point of view nothing more will come to vicarage with aunt oh yes dear cried miss cassy with great alacrity walk will do good be so dull will talk to dear mr larcher know be so odd still be better than one own company be dear let get ready at once rain have gone off see then let follow example of rain said una with laugh two lady went away to prepare for walk when sallied forth with heavy cloak thick boot found that for once sun have shown face be looking through watery cloud in somewhat feeble fashion ground under foot be wet spongy still be better than being immured in dreary grange a walked rapidly along spirit rose in spite of depressing influence of weather when arrived at bridge after sharp walk saw man leaning over parapet looking at cold grey water swirling below dear una how very odd exclaimed miss cassy there be dr nestley dr nestley echoed una rather startled thought have gone away last week be going for reason did not answered miss cassy who by mysterious mean heard gossip of village hear be still staying at kossiter drinking dear oh dreadful so very odd by time be directly in centre of bridge hearing footstep nestley turned round showing wan haggard face with dull bleared eye filled with mute misery so ill desolate did young man look that una heart smote a thought change be brought about through refusal to

knowledge beneath whose shade be music hall burlesque theatre so be anxious to go to such like place for amusement when left mr bolby therefore be comfortably established in quiet hotel in jermyn street dick seeing that reginald be absolutely indifferent a to where went what did took whole arrangement of london life into own hand succeeded in going to good many place must have terribly shocked vicar have known not that such forbidden pleasure did much harm for lad be extremely sensible for age still dick finding able through reginald generosity to spend good deal of money took friend to

departure of dick called upon henceforth constituted bear leader a have seen nothing of artist since arrival in town dick have never thought of telling reginald mistrust of fascinating beaumont so young man remembering artist kindness about probable career a singer felt very friendly towards be quite prepared to accept offer of companionship a outcome of kindly disposition not result of carefully calculated scheme more dangerous companion for young man in depressed state of mind than beaumont must hardly be imagined for led reginald to plunge into riotous pleasure for sake of distraction from must have otherwise recoiled having eminently refined mind delight in cultured company have be thoroughly healthy must never have be drawn by modern mephistopheles into vortex of frenzied pleasure in day night be now engulfed being in morbid state of mind brooded eternally over presumed stigma attached to name until became perfect nightmare to thought that everyone knew miserable story despised for anomalous position now occupied so in mad spirit of bravado became quite reckless determined to defy world sensitive spirit imagined to be sneering at a bastard terrible to relate in spite of relationship existing between beaumont who must have prevented young man from falling into unhealthy state of mind rather encouraged gloomy fit than otherwise a thought must give

see if must espy friend very shortly saw man with whom be well acquainted left box with muttered apology while reginald absorbed in ballet took notice of departure veil of pale green gauze be falling like curtain in front of stage be flooded with emerald light away at back must be seen sea palace of lorelei above undulated blue wave of ocean daring young knight in silver armour be standing like

of lorelei be still ringing what fool knight be ah do think so rejoined artist lightly there agree with many man have have life wrecked by listening to music of sea witch legend of lorelei be simply allegory of life so be legend of siren suppose said blake listlessly of course man who be drawn away from nature by alluring voice of world always loses happiness genius think much of world singing retorted trifle cynically must never allure be alluring now thought beaumont although did not say so merely remarked too much of modern sentimentality about perhaps think world voice pipe too vulgar

move even most blas of humanity be step in right direction said beaumont a left music hall with reginald everyone prophesied failure for such experiment see voice of heart can always reach heart there be more culture even among music hall audience than give credit for think be question of culture at replied blake bluntly that simple story declaimed in such way must appeal to lowest audience in whitechapel daresay be right answered beaumont idly touch of nature make whole world akin think be shakespeare who made that remark wonderfully wise man must like to have seen write drama on complex civilization of to day dramatist of to day do best doubt write on such frivolous subject if took up broad question of time placed before in form of play might evolve new style of drama fitted to be handed down to posterity when concern only with drama of little thing idea be a ephemeral a play be only age of scientific discovery not time of poetic imaginings thus talking strolled along crowded street turned into supper room where have comfortable meal beaumont tried to induce reginald to come with to club have game of card young man haunted by subtle melody of lorelei did not feel inclined for green table so bidding artist good night stepped into hansom be driven back to hotel through sleep night shrill music rang in brain dreamed constantly of woman with fatal beauty who sitting on
