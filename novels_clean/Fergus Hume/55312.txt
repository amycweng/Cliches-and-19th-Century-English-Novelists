distrustful of judgment in diagnosing case prescribing drug be wonder have killed few patient have long ago said mr drass who made secret of dislike for doctor day will give someone wrong medicine poison then will be hanged will be judgment on for letting minx of daughter flirt with young lovel truth of speech being that mr drass who be something of toady wanted milly to release lovel from fascination that might marry selina clyde other people shared opinion be only of few patient dr lester must boast being mostly amongst poorer class of agricultural labourer consequently fee be small that lester have few hundred of own might have gone hard with daughter a be lester household be hard up for barest necessity of life iris link who managed domestic affair did best to make end meet to present fairly decent outside to world to purpose world of barnstead knew truth about poverty villa openly pitied trio who lived in be admitted on hand dr lester spent on drink what must have devoted to nourishment clothing of daughter rather daughter stepdaughter milly entered house in full expectation of having trouble with iris in be not disappointed iris met a closed door beckoned into shabby

have not gained one small accomplishment be quite extinguished by brilliance beauty of milly yet iris possessed better nature of two must make better wife in spite of look disposition of two girl be antagonistic disliked one exceedingly only narrowness of circumstance compelled to live under same roof else must have parted long since luckily a thought marriage of milly must bring about wished for separation yet even in there be element of bitterness to iris what that element be may be seen from slightly acidulated conversation ensued really milly said iris with weary sigh do think might stay at home help with house there be such lot to do eliza one servant of lesters be worse than useless then get servant retorted milly throwing down hat be not going to stay in on fine day what must darcy say if knew be wandering about by bother who care what say besides added milly defiantly have not be by milly cried iris with dark shade on face have be again with mr lovel for last hour dear then ought to be ashamed of milly laughed examined critically in mirror over fireplace be used to scolding of iris cared very little for so long a darcy did not hear of flirtation with lovel have fear treated expostulation of iris doctor with cool disdain did not trouble to reply to last remark continued to admire beauty with critical eye while iris continued know mr lovel be almost engaged to miss clyde suppose mean oh dear be have just told that care nothing for good deal for be engaged to mr herne be dear be retorted milly swinging round on tip of toe wish be iris flushed crimson for milly knew well enough that more than admired squire if be said evading question must act in more honourable way towards pooh pooh few word with mr lovel wo hurt few word a call will hurt men ca marry mr

out of room into garden there be something so shameless about milly speech action with regard to lovel that be almost tempted to tell herne prevent match then loved herne intervention must be put down to jealousy can hing nothing thought if mr lovel at moment man passed slowly down road in close conversation with gran jimboy face be quite pale looked a though have received shock a indeed have mr jimboy have revealed something connected with meeting of next night chapter iii sermon by time lovel oddly chosen companion have passed out of sight iris regained composure returned to house said nothing to milly who be now playing waltz on jingling piano did not even re enter drawing room be quite useless to expostulate further with spoilt beauty so iris went back to help eliza in kitchen to see after dinner nevertheless thought great deal about milly flirtation with lovel since must hing with girl wondered if must be wise to inform dr lester of situation must be clearly understood that iris did not wish milly to marry squire of barnstead be in love with must have dearly liked to become wife mysticism of man attracted in small degree sympathised with aspiration religious view be clear to most unobservant that milly must not make good wife nothing must have pleased iris better than that something must occur to interrupt marriage be resolved that obstacle must not be placed in way by lest must be said that be scheming to obtain herne for herself rather than must be accused of such selfishness iris be determined to bring about marriage by mean in power one danger likely to prevent match be flirtation of milly with lovel iris decided to tell dr lester of danger so milly must meet lover more father alone must save daughter from jeopardising future unfortunately dr lester returned from marborough more le intoxicated after pretence of eating retired to bedroom to sleep off potation be quite useless to appeal to philip drunk a iris knew well therefore be obliged to wait till next morning when there might be chance of getting philip sober to take sensible view of matter milly took notice of father condition being well used to debauch spent evening in trimming hat designed to wear to church next day iris sat in same room employed with needlework took opportunity of informing milly what intended to do there be nothing secretive about miss link be open enemy not snake in grass moreover hoped by warning milly of decision to make promise to renounce lovel flirtation milly said a worked rapidly have thought of what said to afternoon about what asked other carelessly about mr lovel will promise to stop flirting with wo said milly flatly amuses intend to meet talk to a much a like if choose can tell darcy know sha do replied iris quietly that be safe in giving permission will tell father pooh what doe matter wo speak to darcy be too anxious for to marry man told that afternoon will be very angry cried iris in despair let be angry returned dutiful daughter ca kill milly milly why ca behave in more honourable manner if love mr lovel break off match with mr herne let have chance sneered milly tossing head thank dear then stop flirting with mr lovel be true to future husband milly laughed shook head busied with threading needle future husband said slowly h be perhaps wo marry after then intend to accept mr lovel intend to hing gran jimboy read hand afternoon prophesied must marry what do mean asked iris sharply have third admirer according to gran have said milly with shiver third admirer be death dear be to be murdered iris rose so quickly that work rolled on to floor looked at milly in scared sort of way be out of mind said nervously be only telling what gran jimboy read in hand believe in palmistry do iris said miss link contemptuously ought to be ashamed of letting gran jimboy play on fear did say must die yes must be murdered ugh milly shivered again believe such rubbish miss lester jumped up threw hat have be trimming on sofa know said pacing to fro sometimes do sometimes wish must not talk of death hate then after pause be going to bed said iris arrested at door milly do be sensible give up wild idea mr lovel suppose yes flirt with more will not tell dr lester can do a please returned milly loftily be doing harm will talk to lucas a much a please lucas call by first name when wish to be nice do replied girl provokingly call by mine milly be ruining life said iris in despair ah well what of be going to be short one according to gran jimboy before sister must make further remark milly ran out of room with nervous laugh iris resumed seat again devoted to work thought be busy with ill disciplined mind of companion whether be milly attitude towards herne conduct with lovel revelation of gipsy prophecy iris did not know felt premonition of evil wondered what must do to prevent occurrence of ill there be thought of self in desire for be genuinely sorry for fool paradise in lovel be living doubtless thought that milly must break with herne to marry iris be assured that sister be too fond of money luxury to do so milly have idea of morality right wrong be quite content to flirt with one man go to altar with other without caring for consequence yet in complication have made there lay element of tragedy iris wondered if gipsy have be clever enough to guess have prophesied death danger merely on possibility of such result be beginning to feel alarmed at entanglement resolved to put matter straight if must failing authority of lester over reckless daughter be merely nominal yet remained that explanation appeal to lovel might induce to withdraw from fascination of milly leave village then marriage with herne might be pressed on under good influence care milly might be sheltered from danger of life be created by love of admiration be only course to pursue iris decided to take will see mr lovel to morrow said when retiring to bed appeal to better nature to go away darcy be so much in love with that must break heart to lose milly must marry do best to make happy can hing le to show love for ah doe not guess how worship if did ala ala here iris broke off meditation extinguished light then in silence darkness wept quietly over unreturned love aching heart truly to woman burden of unrequited affection be heavy to bear early on sunday morning milly received letter from darcy stating that must return next day a have concluded business information gave no pleasure a meant that must have to submit to be bored in company must not be able to see

usual result of weekly visit to marborough iris have not dared to complain about milly lest must raise domestic storm doctor kept to own room milly amused with novel iris went to church to see lovel be not present however a must not call on at herne arm be obliged to return home disappointed decided to delay appeal till next day delay be fatal a usual milly idled through long summer hour in

lovel to leave village pooh wo do while be here if be honorable man will milly shrugged shoulder know be that be very nice fellow said if want honor priggishness go to darcy iris be too disgusted to reply to remark went to room in silence to prepare for evening service fearing lest lovel must speak with milly on way to church insisted that girl must come with assured that appointment must be kept in winding lane milly agreed to readily enough a did not wish to rouse suspicion of iris whom regarded in light of marplot so to church sister a may be called went in most amiable fashion presented affectionate exterior for benefit of barnstead gossip st dunstan be quite full for mr chaskin be preacher sermon be always worth hearing be tall well built man with earnest clean shaven face a walked in at tail of choir boy suspicion of former military vocation must be seen in swing of stride with certain alteration consequent on reformation have exchanged sword for cowl like warrior of mediaeval time be a earnest clergyman a have be soldier have won golden opinion from one since arrival at barnstead during earlier part of service milly according to custom looked round church prayed with lip rather than heart in almost conventual gloom for summer twilight filtered dimly through stained glass of window noted friend acquaintance particularly lover be seated in distant aisle near pillar must see plainly enough several time during service exchanged glance miss clyde be there in company of mr drass being near front of building must not see lucas have be placed so a to observe milly must have be more discreet in glance feeling safe from observation indulged in a many a pleased if iris noted look made sign for looked at prayer book constantly shortly milly glance alighted on strange lady who be staring at steadily be brilliant looking brunette not very tall a milly must see when stood up dressed in height of fashion miss lester wondered who must be why stared at so hard after time returned gaze eye of two met at once strange lady removed eye glanced at lucas then looked back to milly in most meaning manner indignant bewildered by pantomime milly grew crimson tried to keep attention on music whenever looked up lady be glancing in same way from to lucas back again lovel did not see stranger at event milly did not think so mr drass have eye on brunette be doubtless alive with curiosity when mr chaskin gave out text milly forgot strange lady forgot lucas darcy everyone else only person remembered be gran jimboy for text be one will be taken other left be exact expression used by gipsy at time of hand reading on previous day milly face grew pallid with nervous fear heart beat rapidly felt that atmosphere be too close to breathe there seemed to be something ominous in coincidence of gipsy speech text felt that something be wrong also look of strange lady embarrassed so on impulse of moment rose from seat left church with speed chapter iv what happened on sunday night at first iris intended to follow milly thinking that suffered from slight indisposition recollecting up to moment of leaving girl have seemed perfectly well concluded that be merely to escape sermon milly have left so hurriedly for reason kept seat until struck that exit might be designed in order to meet lovel however glance assured that young man be still in seat showed intention of following sister strange lady remained of course iris have not observed a milly have done mr drass in pew little way off gave sniff of significance glanced at miss clyde that lady seeing that lucas be listening attentively to sermon have caught glimpse of have turned round to look paid attention to hint passed unperceived by rest of congregation mr chaskin invariably limited discourse to fifteen

iris emerged from porch found that have disappeared be milly in sight so concluding that have gone home iris prepared to follow shortly however be accosted by mr drass who have left miss clyde in order to discover reason of milly exit to suspicious mind of ex governess everything done by doctor daughter be covert act of insolence against former pupil to extent can prejudice distort naturally liberal nature good evening miss link said mr drass puffing blowing for be very stout have made considerable haste to overtake iris be so glad to see want to walk home with see dear pa be in dare say

friend wish milly to marry herne so will not tell of flirtation there be truth in admitted mr drass although put rudely put plainly mean said lester can go away content madam for will speak to milly poor motherless girl need talking to sighed mr drass prepared to take leave satisfied in way with success of mission before searching for milly who be yet absent iris determined to speak to stepfather ice have be broken be now easier to induce to interfere when mr drass took departure did almost immediately iris entered doctor consulting room at once lester already have got out brandy bottle be

aching with nervous pain heart full of anxiety when arrived in square where st dunstan church be situated paused in utter helplessness for knew not in direction to look for truant for very shame must ask of passer by if have seen girl for moment be completely at loss what to do unexpectedly chime began to ring clock of st dunstan struck nine with slow ponderous stroke a iris counted idly fancied heard sharp sound of distant shot for moment wondered who must be shooting at late hour deep tone of church bell striking hour confused hearing more shot thought that must have be dreaming after pause pursued way turned homeward struck iris that milly might have met lovel by appointment in case meeting to elude observation must undoubtedly take place on outskirt of village iris therefore made detour walked homeward round by common through sparse wood fringed town to purpose not sign of milly of anyone else must see be with sigh that reentered barnstead street on way to villa a passed herne arm saw carriage drive off a whirled past her on road to marborough noted that be occupied by lady however a did not recognize face saw indistinctly in twilight took further note of incident in few

lion be miss when servant withdrew iris sat down tried to eat in vain excitement trouble of evening be too much for must only swallow glass of wine water eliza be informed that might go to bed iris sat up far into night waiting for return of milly ten eleven twelve o'clock struck still girl did not appear iris became terrified such thing have never happened before felt sure that accident have

stared blankly at holding glass of brandy in shaking hand what what did do for asked thickly to prevent making beast of replied young man sharply have sense of shame man daughter be lying dead murdered yet sit drinking here a though nothing have occurred shame dr lester shame drunkard listened vacantly to speech mechanically raised glass held to lip in moment paul have dashed out of hand put on defensive for attack expected creature to make on in place of doing so asserting little manhood doctor bowed shameful face on hand began to weep in maudlin manner oh dear oh dear must be treated like in own house poor milly dead denied comfort wo get much comfort out of brandy bottle said paul contemptuously pull together dr lester aid aid in what asked lester confusedly in

vacant look paul be about to reply with sharpness when felt light touch on arm be iris who have attracted attention have just entered quietly by door face be pallid a of corpse eye be red swollen with weeping looked not at mexton at miserable creature who be step father expression in eye be one of mingled terror repugnance speak to more paul said hurriedly be not in condition to answer question mexton glanced at lester expecting to make defence man be rapidly lapsing into comatose condition without word submitted to pressure on arm be drawn out of room by iris in passage stopped withdrew

beckoned to mexton in peremptory manner be about to examine servant in drawing room said hurriedly can be present if like a please answered mexton with feigned indifference may throw light on subject have miss link done so no saw for few moment only said nothing worth talking about in making statement paul did violence to own opinion for on consideration of last remark made by iris be persuaded that knew more about matter than chose to tell did not want to search for criminal therefore must appear that be aware of identity of guilty person did not want for might be woman arrested why must thus side with murderer of sister paul must find feasible answer to question eliza made appearance in drawing room in state of hardly controlled excitement took seat before mr inspector paul with air of one who considers herself of greatest importance be constant reader of novel now fancied that be heroine of story in real life short red faced fat eliza wore honour thus thrust upon with air of dignity air grace be completely thrown away on drek who spoke to sharply gave latitude in answering there be romance about inspector well eliza said looking up down what do know about murder sir replied servant with dignity know much guess lot be not to point want fact not fancy do know who killed poor girl suspicion mr policeman to whom do suspicion point to master sir to dr lester nonsense

lester have gone out mad with drink angry with dead girl have taken with pistol milly have be murdered by such weapon finally clothes be covered with red mud be most plentiful in neighbourhood where corpse have be found on circumstantial evidence must seem that dr lester have killed own daughter in fit of drunken frenzy discovery added to horror of crime girl said inspector after pause have

explanation of dr lester be too drunk to understand be saw few minute ago be coming round besides knowledge of position will sober do really believe killed own daughter must seem so said drek in perplexed tone what well explained inspector sagely have be mixed up in one two case of sort before always mistrust evidence be too plain speak in riddle h be maybe tell doubt evidence be dead against lester still paul interrupted best thing to do be to question lester said force into confession into defence be most straightforward way assented drek rising let go into consulting room at once look at clothes look for revolver suggested paul significantly inspector nodded sought presence of dr lester wretched creature be recovering sens a entered be drinking long draught from water bottle to clear head at sound of footstep started nervously turned towards white haggard face paul wondered whether look manner be due to drink to guilt certainly to one perhaps to do want to see gentleman said

daughter assassin of milly lester be own father chapter vii at vicarage from poverty villa with guilty occupant paul wandered through village into neighbourhood of herne arm crowd of people more le excited filled tap room of inn space before many be drinking ale at bar others idled outside in street be vigorously discussing tragedy surmising a to who be criminal hinted at lovel known admirer of dead girl others boldly accused nameless tramp of crime declared that robbery be motive for committal one have courage fancy to hint at possible guilt of drunken father such idea owing to relationship be too monstrous to be entertained even by most imaginative paul with unusual caution for ordinarily be impulsive man said nothing wandered from group to group gathering opinion offering none in exchange there be need for to conjecture name of assassin knew that dr lester have committed crime that before twelve hour elapsed must be arraigned on circumstantial evidence perhaps if conscience proved trustworthy on own confession great a have be horror inspired by murder arrest of wretched father of victim must enhance that horror four fold mexton knew out of sheer humanity for miserable criminal held peace crowd babbled on discussed affair over tankard looked up with awe at window drawn curtain of notified that dead body of milly lester be lying within policeman guarded door of room approach to stair so that one must enter paul mexton have little desire to do so did not wish to see still white face have last beheld full of life beauty girlish vanity sick at heart turned away from inn crowd chatter of market place to take way to vicarage on arriving there inquired for mr chaskin so far a journal be concerned paul have collected sufficient copy for long interesting article therefore be with zeal for profession that sought clergyman theory of idler before inn that tramp might have killed milly in order to rob inspired with faint hope that lester might be innocent evidence that of eliza that of mud stained clothes that of pistol pointed to guilt of unhappy father nevertheless man have be hanged before on circumstantial evidence afterwards have proved guiltless of crime for suffered so might be thought paul dr lester be not guilty of monstrous act of criminality if body have be robbed of jewellery purse fact might hint at vulgar murder by tramp chaskin have found corpse of girl therefore chaskin be necessary witness to prove theory of robbery in character of dr lester friend well wisher paul presented at vicarage to question mr chaskin upon result of interview hung question of lester guilt innocence chance be greatly in favour of former at first servant who opened door refused to admit mexton declared that mr chaskin be within stated that be particularly engaged have given order not to be disturbed paul scribbled line on card to effect that business be important with regard to discovery of assassin told girl to ask mr chaskin to afford interview on ground after hesitation servant conveyed message shortly afterwards showed mexton into presence of clergyman mr chaskin be in study comfortable room have somewhat of sacerdotal atmosphere in appointment furnishing there be many book lining wall in bare unpretentious bookshelf small altar in one corner with bronze crucifix thereon several picture of catholic saint here there on desk before window crucifix be standing amid litter of paper beside desk chair be placed hinting to ready mind of paul that mr chaskin have be engaged with visitor when accorded interview evidently visitor have vanished through small door on right wishing to escape unseen paul wondered who unknown person might be why have departed with such unnecessary haste mystery at very door paul felt that uncomfortable uneasy atmosphere pervaded apartment vicar rose to foot with agitated air a paul entered looked at young man with card in hand seemed much moved for lean ascetic face be white drawn breathing quick hurried not till servant have closed door did speak then addressed visitor with tremour in strong voice come at inconvenient time mr mexton said hurriedly be engaged with friend writing here touched card hinted at matter of such importance decided to see be sorry to interrupt replied paul taking chair near desk may be sure must not have done so without good reason be sure of said chaskin still standing hope reason be not connected with duty to journal be connected with friendship for dead girl for father dr lester ah be sorry for in spite of vice of drinking loss of daughter will be great blow to where be now mr mexton in own house said paul slowly under arrest under arrest repeated vicar staring at young man for what for murder of daughter mr mexton clergyman fell back into chair a though have be shot turned even paler impossible groaned impossible unfortunately be true said paul sadly on ground whereupon rapidly detailed evidence upon drek intended to obtain warrant for arrest chaskin listened with clasped hand bead of perspiration bedewing high forehead did not make comment upon intelligence until paul have finished then spoke slowly with effort point to guilt of poor creature said raising head for can not believe that dr lester committed crime so abhorrent to human nature think did knowingly mr chaskin replied paul declares that remembers nothing of event of night might not have killed daughter while under influence of drink not knowingly a say guided mechanically by confused intelligence cried chaskin with negative gesture impossible quite impossible said calm voice behind paul turned head to see who have interrupted conversation at side door beheld darcy herne evidently be visitor with whom chaskin have be talking prior to visit of journalist quite impossible reiterated herne advancing into room agree with friend mr mexton killed poor milly be not miserable father paul said nothing for moment being taken up with examination

brilliant a diamond eye of loyola of torquemada darcy herne be reformer fanatic in earlier time must have be prophet in age lived must always have preserved characteristic of nature frozen narrowed by devouring devotion to religion there be nothing loveable about man be little to be wondered at that dead girl have feared curious thing be that must have brought to accept attention of religious machine did not know be here mr herne said paul without replying to remark made by squire came down to day replied darcy taking chair be not intention to return until evening friend chaskin telegraphed about death of milly so here be spoke with great deliberation calmness so much so that paul stared at in surprise wondered how must be so social in face of such tragedy a murder of future wife paul have known herne for many year having met frequently at lesters have always have unpleasant feeling towards now that man proved to be so devoid of tender feeling towards dead girl mexton felt that latent distaste be developing into positive dislike perhaps showed feeling too plainly for chaskin bent forward touched on knee must not think that friend be heartless because doe not exhibit much sorrow said feel terrible event deeply feel more than mexton can imagine said herne with impressive look on face selected millicent lester to be wife in order to save from snare beauty vanity be laying for designed that must help in life work of succoring poor lowly oppressed with beauty wealth imagined in vain pride that must be powerful instrument in hand of guiding providence ala god have brought down to grave have left without helpmate during speech herne have risen to foot delivered with outstretched hand in oratorical style paul be quite used to vagary of man resented cold way in spoke of poor girl a lost instrument not a human being beautiful woman done to death in violent fashion chaskin seemed to resent also for looked reprovingly at herne look be entirely lost on fanatic not only did disregard warning proceeded to talk of private matter a though be of greater moment than murder do know what have be doing in london mr mexton said in measured tone have be seeing young woman who have cause of oppressed at heart will aid to lighten burden be true that at present be exercising light frivolous profession of musician hope to ween from vanity polish girl must aid downtrodden countryman polish girl cried paul with start musician violinist yes catinka do know little saw month ago in marborough where gave concert rather admired concluded paul blushing be beautiful replied herne quietly look to outward form into mind be concerned to raise up fallen race desire to aid hope to do so who know cried darcy with flash of brilliant eye may be designed by god to replace lost milly rather think be of milly must speak herne said chaskin reprovingly leave off thinking of catinka let see what can do to prove innocence of dr lester be at service said fire dying out of eye be convinced that dr lester did not kill girl then who did demanded paul frankly herne turned looked at steadily lucas lovel said in composed tone impossible said chaskin mexton together think so persisted herne lucas lovel wanted to marry milly to ween from frequently met on common in winding lane be told about meeting by certain person who will be nameless said nothing trusting to milly true heart believed that be true to that for reason lovel killed lovel be not with on sunday night believe be said darcy although have mean of proving intend to see mr lovel force into confession before doing so wish to examine spot where murder took place for what reason asked chaskin hurriedly to search for evidence let go now while daylight last mr mexton will come also willingly said paul rising wish to see spot too indeed came here to ask mr chaskin for particular regarding finding of body why asked clergyman quickly because wish to prove innocence of dr lester black a be evidence against can not think that killed own daughter murder may have be committed by tramp for robbery said herne doggedly lovel killed mr chaskin said paul taking notice of interruption be earring ring bracelet of milly on body when found yes replied chaskin promptly be purse be in pocket also thought murder might be due to robbery examined body carefully nothing have be touched be lying with outspread hand face downwards apparently poor girl have be shot from behind fell prone on face stone dead nothing be touched murmured paul to then that disposes of tramp theory motive of crime be not robbery of course not said darcy quickly be jealousy of dead girl of on part of lovel believe killed must not commit crime for so slight cause protested chaskin why not lovel have gipsy blood in vein told so passion once roused doe not care what say doe face to face with will force into confession then believe that dr lester be innocent a innocent a believe lovel be guilty replied herne with emphasis after direct statement chaskin mexton felt there be more to be said chapter viii in winding lane between common village there extended fairly broad belt of tree sprang from deep red soil apparently volcanic in origin through wood there ran narrow road in many curve purposely made tortuous so a to prolong pleasure of walking under shade of leafy bough in hot day of summer from

be placed for convenience of passer by in long summer twilight youth maiden of barnstead be accustomed to rest thereon exchange love talk most of marriage among peasantry rose from meeting promise in winding lane a yet there have be no tragedy in pleasant pathway be with feeling of consternation that villager heard of lester murder henceforth tradition imagination winter tale must invest spot with ghostly interest already lover of village declared that nothing must induce to seek lane after twilight lest must meet spectre of murdered girl when tragedy have be enacted only few hour think then how such statement must grow into established belief when circumstance of death became sanctified by time chaskin led two companion through wood until paused close beside stile barred lane at end from common several rustic be examining spot with eager interest on seeing squire vicar made speed to leave lane before arrival lest must be reproved for morbid curiosity one heavy ploughman however be slow in going before must hasten out of earshot herne called on to wait yokel did unwillingly enough looked rather afraid when squire addressed directly brent said herne while companion waited in

one soul sweer very good brent can go man pulled rough forelock slouched off heavily herne looked after with frown afterwards turned towards clergyman with sharp look of interrogation do believe what that fellow say chaskin demanded yes see reason why must lie h be reason might be found in pocket what do mean herne asked paul sharply simply that brent have be bribed by whom man by lovel contradict said herne in authoritative tone be certain of what say milly came to lane last night else must not have be found dead by yonder stile must have come to meet someone going on have be told to person came to meet must only have be lovel if walked up lane together must have be seen by brent jane bilway lovel must be unwilling must be told of stolen meeting therefore bribed man to hold tongue herne burst out chaskin who have restrained with difficulty during speech do know what be saying be accusing brent of felony be corrected vicar assuming that belief that lovel killed girl be true if brent saw lovel here must believe same thing must not hold tongue knowing murder have be done depends on amount of bribe said herne grimly will find out later be certain that lovel be here killed milly why not ask lovel suggested paul looking up here come across common want to see scene of crime doubt said squire fiercely herne be unjust protested chaskin wait till speak with lovel then judge friend vicar silently agreed with remark three men watched lovel a walked slowly towards site on catching sight of trio hesitated half stopped almost immediately resumed usual pace came towards jumping over stile made a to pas with hurried nod squire with grim smile placed in path so pointed be movement lovel much against will have alternative to stop looked pale haggard be not dressed with usual care otherwise gave sign of inward perturbation be calm collected when faced herne word with mr lovel said darcy sharply dozen replied lovel a sharply provided be addressed to in term one gentleman usually employ to oh will be a polite a please sneered squire with ugly smile so long a answer question will answer question if can mr herne very good sir then tell why met miss lester in lane on spot last

advise to restrain tongue may not be so patient at next meeting lovel walked away with proud defiant air herne made attempt to follow stood quite still pale motionless with glassy look in eye mouth slightly open paul turned from watching retreating figure of lovel to address recoiled from frozen look with exclamation of alarm chaskin what be matter with clergyman turned round seeing rigidity of friend went forward shook arm be one of trance said composedly will pas in few moment excitement of speaking with lovel have thrown into be often like only when nervous system be wrought up by unusual

a have gone part of way with thus by evidence of gran jimboy alibi in favour of lovel be clearly proved be exonerated from complicity in crime still herne did not believe evidence a mexton must see by mocking smile on lip however made attempt to speak proceeding continued eliza servant of dr lester be next witness told story with shrill volubility for moment be most important person in room a on evidence be based charge be known to be made against dr lester eliza knew that master must be arrested on statement must make against relished situation exceedingly have idea of cruelty of feeling towards man whose bread have eaten eliza stated with many air grace that be domestic servant of dr lester have be in situation for year master be in habit of getting drunk two three time in week when in condition always went about with loaded revolver so that inmate of house be in peril of life dr lester have be delighted by engagement of deceased to mr herne be angry at meeting of miss lester with mr lovel eliza knew that met a be common gossip on night of murder miss lester miss link went to church while doctor remained at home drinking miss milly did not return miss iris did in company of mr drass when mr drass departed eliza heard high word between doctor miss link relative to meeting of deceased with mr lovel afterwards miss iris went out to seek miss milly whom thought be with mr lovel eliza did not know if be so dr lester continued drinking fearing lest must cause trouble witness watched door of consulting room shortly after half past eight dr lester came out holding pistol in hand be mad with drink cried out about daughter lovel then rushed out witness thought intended murder did not come home till seven in morning then have pistol clothes be daubed with red mud such a be found in winding lane began to drink again before doing so changed clothes witness swore that went out with intention of killing daughter did not think did deliberately a be mad with drink dr lester be then called to refute evidence if be able stated that have gone out a eliza described with pistol wished to kill lovel did not know what said did not remember what did where went after leaving house have indistinct recollection of meeting someone man woman must not say pistol be gone when returned home at seven in morning did not know where lost also clothes be covered with red mud so be possible might have wandered into winding lane have fallen in moist clay recollected nothing have intention of harming daughter a loved too much iris link recalled said that dr lester be in habit of carrying about loaded revolver when drunk did not know if took out on sunday night be not in case next day stated also that heard shot fired at nine o'clock when be standing in shadow of st dunstan church have never heard dr lester threaten daughter be certainly very irate at behaviour of mr lovel be evidence have be collected by drek certainly be against lester own testimony rather inculpated than exonerated from face of jury paul saw that inclined to believe lester guilty mexton must not make up mind appearance pointed to perpetration of crime by dr lester when in state of intoxication be possible that might be innocent after still how innocence be to be proved be difficult to say herne might do thought paul a took down evidence for seems to believe lovel guilty although gran jimboy statement go to clear also herne know something in connection with feather picked up wonder what that odd coloured feather have to do with matter whether must prove guilt of person of whom at present know nothing there be answer to question herne made sign of making statement about feather in favour of lester stood quite still listened to summing up of coroner summing up be dead against lester coroner declared that lester must have be in winding lane on night else must not have got red clay on clothes question be whether be there after before nine o'clock hour when according to miss link evidence fatal shot be fired coroner be inclined to think that lester went straight from own house to winding lane knowing be spot in daughter usually met lovel there finding daughter waiting for lovel who be then in tent of gran jimboy have fired killed perhaps must have killed lovel have be present in absence vented rage on deceased crime however be committed while lester be drunk therefore be not responsible for action result of speech be that jury already prejudiced found lester guilty immediately wretched father be arrested by inspector drek chapter x prophecy again when inquest be over dr lester have departed for marborough gaol under escort of inspector drek young journalist remained standing thoughtfully in square before inn nobody be surprised at verdict everyone a paul must hear asserted on side believed that dr lester have murdered own daughter while in state of frenzy induced by intoxication mexton have doubt about matter principally on account of word spoken by iris when wished to cease from searching for assassin wished to question a to what meant implore if knew truth to reveal save unfortunate stepfather while be considering advisability of following iris to poverty villa felt touch on arm be eliza face be grave want to speak t ' sir if y ' mind said quietly with entire absence of former self importance not here want t ' speak alone why be anything wrong think so mr mexton with miss iris miss iris repeated paul glancing round where be be gone home follow sir ask question what kind of question demanded paul startled by hint eliza drew mexton to one side until be out of earshot of scattered group bent forward to whisper in ear ask why went out after brought home corpse of miss milly said before paul must make comment on remark laid finger on mouth walked away at first paul intended to follow demand explanation on consideration deemed best to take advice ask question directly of iris more must be learnt by thus going to fountain head eliza evidently suspected something afraid to question iris directly have hinted suspicion to paul that might do so with usual promptitude mexton sent over note on trial by special messenger to editor of tory time at marborough set forth at brisk walk to poverty villa believed firmly at moment that saving of dr lester from suffering unjustly lay in hand of step daughter a passed along street towards desolate house in poor girl be waiting be surprised to meet with herne still more surprised when herne stopped to speak for man be not over friendly towards what do think of verdict asked squire abruptly seems just enough going by evidence replied mexton cautiously doubt be one of case in circumstantial evidence accumulates to hang innocent man believe dr lester to be innocent do a surely a believe lovel to be guilty dear sir protested journalist lovel proved innocence by alibi doubt on evidence of old witch mother jimboy bah made up plot think so herne why must mother jimboy assist lovel why repeated squire because blood be thicker than water told other day lovel have got gipsy blood in vein who told so lady at whose name blushed when mentioned in winding lane catinka said paul blushing again yes catinka violinist lovel know told that mother be romany perhaps daughter of gran jimboy who know be why old woman lied because lovel be grandson be not sure of because lovel be half gipsy in spite of alibi believe be guilty will prove guilt hang why do hate so herne because led that poor girl to death wished to save soul of milly be lost lovel be cause besides believe be duty to succor afflicted of afflicted dr lester be one innocent man will not die on scaffold if can help god forbid will save lester hang lovel end of tragedy have not yet come mexton if herne waved hand interrupted mexton ca waste more time discussing matter said retreating will see again when have proof to hang lovel after speech walked rapidly away without courtesy of adieu mad said paul to resumed interrupted journey towards poverty villa in own heart young man believed that herne be insane fanaticism in religion be proof of ill balanced mind now furious hatred of lovel just enough in face of lovel attention to milly in wilful disregard of engagement with herne threatened to rob of self control failing to fasten crime on lovel seemed impossible to do so herne be quite capable of shooting man in fit of rage knowing chaskin have most influence over darcy journalist determined to put on guard relative to squire hatred of lovel warning word need not be spoken immediately in meantime paul be anxious to see iris door of poverty villa be wide open untidy house in neglected garden looked more desolate than ever lester be on way to marborough gaol milly be lying in coffin at herne arm eliza have not yet returned therefore paul knew that iris be alone in house with heavy burden of grief to bear slipping lightly into passage glanced through open door of dining room be not there drawing room be also empty so a last resource softly opened door of consulting room beheld poor girl seated at desk with head bowed on folded arm sob be shaking frame looked a though sorrow of past week be crushing to earth iris said softly poor girl with exclamation lifted head on seeing paul rose to foot hastily brushing away tear from face then with little gasp moved forward with outstretched hand to greet only friend who remained to in desolation of life paul said with relief oh dear be glad to see led to seat taking chair beside pressed hand warmly dear iris said at time need service of best friend let be that friend thank paul said faintly oh horrible tragedy will ever get out of head time will bring comfort iris in meantime let ask what intend to do now can not remain here be right there milly be dead father be in gaol on charge of having killed be alone in world have money not one penny last money got from step father went to pay last week bill then can not remain here a said before where be to go asked iris helplessly to marborough to mother told to ask how good kind of paul must like oh burst out how can go to marborough to be pointed out a relative of murderer wait one moment before call dr lester by name iris be sure that be murderer of milly know ca say verdict at inquest never mind verdict at inquest interposed paul quickly want to know what think why do want to know what think because believe can save innocent man from being hanged can hing iris said mexton taking hand asked never to look for assassin of milly did do so to save dr lester at time did not think that must be accused then suspect someone have suspicion said in hesitating tone be to whom do point ca tell be not certain may be deceived paul cried iris in desperation ask answer may condemn innocent person silence act in same way iris dr lester be in danger of death know be innocent be be believe that killed milly how must know name of real assassin because saw on night be not out on night at least after body be brought home iris why will lie to eliza saw leave house after midnight eliza ah wretched girl have brought ruin on not so if can save tell did go out wait wait will answer in moment give time rose to foot with clasped hand walked twice thrice up down room evidently be considering what to say after thought faced round on paul will tell said slowly will use knowledge to hunt down assassin of milly assuredly wish to save dr lester from suffering unjust death so do so do oh struck hand together be ever woman placed in such position if must only speak must said paul determinedly else have step father death at door come iris do know name of assassin suspect suspect whom lucas lovel mexton rose from seat in astonishment do believe guilty a herne doe doe mr herne believe in guilt asked iris quickly so thoroughly that intends to bring lovel to scaffold will never succeed in doing so cried girl involuntarily why not will not be able to obtain evidence be not so sure of said mexton drily herne be fanatic be clever be extremely pertinacious hate lovel like poison for believe will be able to accumulate sufficient evidence to get mr lovel arrested besides have clever foe who will defend mr lovel foe said paul puzzled name of foe mother jimboy what that old fool how can defend lovel did so to day by alibi will do so again may be sure what reason have to believe that mr jimboy be implicated in case iris thought for moment on day before milly be killed said slowly mr lovel met with gran jimboy who prophesied by palmistry milly must die violent death say so go on well milly did perish by violence next night truly believe that met lovel in winding lane that killed why must kill loved did so much that killed rather than mr herne must marry tell paul that mr lucas be man of violent passion believe be egged on by mother jimboy to murder why must mother jimboy desire milly death know more than can guess why provided that lying alibi be sure that lovel shot milly then went across common to mother jimboy tent so a to appear innocent why do believe because of prophecy be fulfilled because of unexplained association of mother jimboy lovel because saw lovel when went out after midnight saw lovel said paul incredulously yes fancied that dr lester might have killed milly to save went to look for must not find on fatal spot there be man there who ran away when heard approach saw face in moonlight be mr lovel chapter xi brent speaks out be mr lovel repeated iris if be not concerned in murder what be doing at midnight on very spot where occurred may have be there after twelve o'clock said paul to inculpate must prove that met milly between eight nine ca prove one can prove be not sure of replied paul with sudden recollection there be man called brent who be in winding lane on night about time will see iris shook head if brent have known anything must have come forward at inquest doubt if have not be bribed what make think that brent have be bribed asked iris in surprise think so herne insists upon mr herne said iris in low voice with flush belief lovel guilty also yes without ground for belief also declares that lovel bribed brent to hold tongue doe mr herne think that brent saw murder committed oh think that brent saw lovel with milly be certain milly poor girl be with lovel on night believe killed there be few minute silence then paul turned quickly towards iris want to ask rather rude question said awkwardly what be wo be angry be long past feeling anger after what have gone through said iris sadly what be wish to know friend asked not to search for assassin of milly now find that believe assassin to be lovel be in love with man that sought to screen in love with mr lovel cried iris indignantly not despise too much man who must act a have done with milly knowing that be engaged to herne be not worthy of woman love no love even respect mr lovel then why do seek to screen iris rose to foot with cold look can not answer that question now have reason for acting a did what do mean asked mexton rising in turn understand if told reason must understand still le said iris bitterly understand ask more question paul have told know said mexton with emphasis eye searching face can tell now at event replied obstinately after last remark mexton be satisfied that iris for reason of own must not guess have not confessed knew yet a be unaware of motif for reserve did not think wise to press question better thought to accept refusal for moment question on future occasion when might be more inclined to take into confidence moreover by examining brent forcing into confession might get at knowledge without necessity of procuring through matter thus settled in own mind paul discarded subject of murder addressed to question of miss link position will accept mother offer suppose said quietly at event will stay with until after trial of stepfather iris winced care about facing marborough gossip said think best to stay with mr mexton a be afraid to remain here alone will go over to marborough by six o'clock coach eliza can stay here in charge of house very good iris will meet at six o'clock at herne arm take over in meantime intend to find out brent force to confess truth arrangement having be come to paul left poverty villa went off in direction of village on way towards market place where expected to find brent for be market day in barnstead town be full of farmer labourer mexton remembered that ploughman have confessed to being with one jane bilway in winding lane if be so woman must have seen a much a man if have not be bribed also be more likely that must be able to extract truth from mexton knew most people high low in barnstead amongst jane bilway who be servant at chequer little public house on outskirt of village thither turned step to see what must learn from woman jane be broad squat wench with healthy red face dull eye have about a much intelligence a cow be only useful in doing rough work common drudgery be at moment of paul arrival cleaning front window of chequer recognised with friendly grin at once mexton began to ask question on subject be uppermost in mind jane said quietly be to marry giles brent say yes mr mexton have bin keepin ' company since christmas see occasionally most ivery day come here lot be inside now havin ' wet said jane pointing to window of tap room be better news than paul expected for gave chance of immediate conversation with brent before entering public house pursued plan of gaining information from jane be walking with on night miss lester be killed be replied miss bilway frankly went to methody chapel together where did meet just by church sir heard shot fired when bell be ringing be with in winding lane jane shook head emphatically be sir denied must git away in time to go there be in lane on night oh paul noted that brent have be telling lie met brent by st dunstan church at nine o'clock went to methodist chapel yes did 'eard shot fired thought be nothin ' though giles wanted to go back did see miss lester on night sir see miss iris sister by church at nine must 'ave heard shot too daresay replied paul with assumed carelessness well jane here be sovereign to buy wedding present thank sir said jane slipping coin into pocket want can git though to be sure giles ai badly off for money oh have money have said mexton recollecting herne idea of bribery few shilling doubt good few shilling sir five pound of 'em be goin ' to spend on weddin giles saved up money from wage be good fellow be giles sir be sure be hope will make good husband will see to replied miss bilway grimly went on cleaning window paul laughed a entered tap room thought of ingenious mr brent device for accounting for possession of money be well known to be thriftless wastrel who spent most of earnings in strong ale be a likely to save five pound a be to do honest day work no one simple jane bilway blinded by love must have believed so improbable story there be now doubt in paul mind that theory of herne be correct lovel milly have met in winding lane between eight nine o'clock on night of murder have be seen by brent a be on way to meet jane near church lest must tell herne of meeting lovel have bribed with five pound though be large sum for man like lovel to give thought paul be not well off must not part with so much money unless be forced to hope five pound be not given to conceal worse affair than simple meeting however will play game of bluff with brent wring truth whatever may be out of brent who be huge bull headed fellow with sulky face sat alone in tap room with mug of ale before touched hat to paul whom recognised looked puzzled for moment at sight of gentleman in low class public house be usually patronised by of class well brent said paul in cheerful voice how be right eh have just come to have few moment of conversation with brent took pipe from lip gave sulky growl what about sir will tell in good time replied paul taking chair selecting cigarette from case in meantime be thirsty wish to drink will have ale with 'd 'ave ale wi ' anyone said brent suspiciously know sir what like o want with like o ' will come to soon said mexton hammered on table two tankard of bitter added to slip slop landlady who entered with deferential smile liquor be soon brought after deep draught paul lighted cigarette looked closely at ploughman brent took drink also tried to appear at ease although be visibly disturbed by scrutiny of visitor having reduced to doubtful frame of mind mexton addressed to matter in hand knew manner of man have to do with that must not be easy matter to extract information from sulky brute threat also must avail little a brent be one of pig headed men who begin by denying go on doing so in face of clearest evidence with incredible obstinacy sole chance of getting at truth be to assume that lovel have confessed bribery to be to paul mexton have sent on errand connected therewith to brent attitude necessitated telling of few lie mexton be quite prepared to tell be cool headed pertinacious not man to stick at trifle for gaining of own end have come to from mr lovel said paul slowly brent jaw dropped what be like of want with like of said little decency in first place replied mexton promised to hold tongue about meeting of mr lovel miss lester on night of murder how d know met asked brent with dogged suspicion mr lovel told do think must know if have not must be aware that paid five pound to hold tongue brent whose brain worked slowly fell into trap at once unless lovel have spoken a mexton declared did not think paul must have come by such exact information more particularly a precise amount of bribe be mentioned never occurred to brent at moment that jane have innocently betrayed well have earned money right ai growled indeed have done such thing replied mexton have be talking about meeting swear ai cried brent bringing down huge fist on table cud talked about when sat on corpse did stayed here shut up never told single soul a seed mr lovel miss milly walking in winding lane on night be quite enough herne have be right lovel have met milly by appointment on fatal night therefore alibi proved by mother jimboy be deception to defeat end of justice lovel be in league with gipsy paul began to believe that might have killed milly after resolved to question brent further before coming to so important conclusion well daresay mr lovel be mistaken said paul genially must be dangerous for be known that met miss lester on night see growled brent do so doe mr lovel be why asked to see if have kept silence if be known that mr lovel be in winding lane on night might be accused of murder let 'em accuse said brent grimly ca prove killed gal know did else 'd not held tongue if be murderer 'd get hanged for five pound then be certain mr lovel be innocent yes be know who be guilty ai sure of replied brent after pause saw creeping after mr lovel gal when shot s be done ' who asked paul much excited why miss clyde o ' clyde farm who else replied brent coolly chapter xii startling piece of evidence miss clyde said paul staring at informant what be doing in winding lane at so late hour watchin ' miss lester of course sir why for what reason brent laughed in coarse manner there be leer on face a replied to question y ' know sir miss clyde sweet on mr lovel 'ated miss lester like pisin be sure sure returned brent with contempt why ai bin ploughman on clyde farm for year ' ai 'eard arl talk o ' maid be well known theer a miss clyde give 'er ear to be missus lovel think killed miss lester out of jealousy be sure did sir wot wos doin ' in th ' lane creepin arter why be 'ome at farm oh sir did for know kin ' of temper 'as mad bull be nothin ' to then dr lester be innocent said paul half to niver thowt be guilty returned brent drily then why did come forward at inquest confess so a to save innocent man from arrest brent reared to giant height laid down pipe on table whoy did thundered 'cause wished t ' be honourable for there money if 'd said seed miss clyde have have to say why wos theer must cud 'ave said be watchin ' mr lovel gal when five pound be given to to 'old tongue be either tell arl shut up concluded brent dropping back into seat so shut up paul nodded be only thing must do said musingly must see miss clyde get truth out of ' y ' mu see mr lovel said brent heavily ai goin ' to let doctor be strung oop let mr lovel git away t ' americy then will tell arl have told about miss clyde mr lovel ' th ' perlice will let t doctor out o ' gaol doubt said mexton rising in meantime brent have better hold tongue until give leave to speak sha speak till mr lovel s can said brent doggedly will see mr lovel about brent in meantime a said before hold tongue if inspector drek knew what have done must get into trouble sha sir if y tell intend to tell rejoined paul coldly will thrash out matter for if miss clyde killed that poor girl must suffer for crime 'ope will string 'er oop said brent vindictively 'ate 'er turned off wi'oot character paul shrugged shoulder at last speech betrayed motive for brent accusation went away from inn be now growing late have to return to duty in marborough there be time to ride out two mile see miss clyde if there have be must paul have sought interview so soon after conversation with brent wished for quiet time to consider have be told to to marshal fact to draw deduction therefrom truth be mexton be becoming bewildered by sudden shifting of blame from one person to at first on face of circumstantial evidence supplied by eliza seemed that dr lester be guilty even after sifting of such evidence by coroner jury have be found strong enough to imprison pending more extended trial then by belief of herne regarding bribery be afterwards admitted by brent by declaration of iris appeared that lovel have committed crime now came ploughman who positively asserted that miss clyde have killed milly one of three witness be to be believed of three accused be to be deemed guilty paul must not say quite admitted that miss clyde in moment of jealousy at seeing lovel with rival might have given way to strong temper be known to posse be incredible that have gone to winding lane with pistol to designedly murder girl question be where have obtained weapon wherewith to commit crime doubt have seen lovel follow milly into lane have come after be clear enough did not account for miss clyde possession of pistol without must not have shot girl on whole paul doubted story of brent be doubtless dictated by feeling of hatred against woman who have dismissed from employment by time reached marborough journalist have come to conclusion that miss clyde must be able to refute accusation determined to give chance of doing so next day at personal interview paul believed that must prove own innocence might also offer from own knowledge solution of mystery on arriving at home paul found that iris have preceded be seated in tiny drawing room with mr mexton widow for paul father have long since departed life be placid motherly looking woman whose mission in life seemed to be task of comforting afflicted in mission be now engaged with iris from more composed look of girl must seem that have succeeded well said iris when made appearance did find brent yes what be more made speak out did give useful information did so useful that hope to prove innocence of dr lester secure arrest of real murderer lucas lovel according to brent that gentleman be innocent told so iris interjected mr mexton mildly be sure mr lovel be too much gentleman to commit so terrible crime think good birth good breeding have much to do with prevention of crime replied iris disdainfully there be criminality amongst upper class a in lower only sin in more refined manner be beside question what wish to know be if mr lovel be not guilty beg leave to doubt who be what must say to miss clyde must laugh said mr mexton energetically must be utterly disinclined to believe that christian gentlewoman must fall to depth of degradation christian gentlewoman like others of sex be amenable to jealousy declared paul grimly jealousy repeated iris miss clyde be jealous so brent say love lucas lovel hated sister doe brent say committed crime on motive yes saw following pair in lane on night then lovel did meet milly did mr lovel bribed to hold tongue precisely assented paul with five pound note then tell said iris coolly mr lovel paid brent also to accuse miss clyde h be be not improbable said mexton pulling moustache be more inclined to believe in guilt of lovel than in of miss clyde will see to morrow ask for explanation wo give in case will tell drek will force to speak oh dear oh dear sighed mr mexton be truly terrible to think of way in have be brought into contact with crime poor dr lester in gaol wo be in goal long said paul with satisfied nod be going to prove innocence cried iris anxiously be intend to leave in prison until do so to morrow will get bail for will be free man at event till trial be very good of paul said iris gratefully mr mexton endorsed statement with nod of head be simple pious old woman not quite company for two young ardent people view on matter of murder be singularly crude point dwelt on most be that lester loss arrest be judgment on for long indulgence in drinking vice knowing a have done most part of life did not believe be guilty stated opinion to iris who be much comforted thereby love dr lester confessed never approved of mother second marriage same must be terribly sorry to see hanged particularly for crime of be guiltless said paul by way iris will have to return to barnstead to morrow for funeral be going over said mr mexton patting head of iris poor milly then fell to talking about milly many good quality also about beauty charm mention be made of fault seeing that be dead that be not well to speak evil of who have gone mr mexton exalted milly into martyr iris endorsed canonisation with tear in midst of glorification paul slipped out went to office of tory time for long night work arrived back in small hour of morning when iris have retired left for barnstead after eight o'clock before be up therefore did not see again till afternoon when met in barnstead cemetery at funeral of unfortunate half sister a usual paul rode over to barnstead independent of journalistic earnings have small income did not cost much to keep horse in country riding be great passion with young man always declared that thought better when in saddle than in study on perfect summer morning however be le occupied with fiction than with real life murder case absorbed thought recognised that mystery of milly case must hardly have be surpassed in detective novel of day be determined to discover who have killed girl passed rapidly through barnstead towards clyde farm in order to see lady ascertain what amount of truth there be in brent story residence of miss clyde be long low house with whitewashed wall thatched roof eminently picturesque not at practical there be homely flower garden before filled with marigold sweet williams southernwood such like old english flower being peculiar care of mr drass who blended gossip with horticulture when paul rode up to gate be pottering about with trowel in hand came to gate to meet keen eyed paul mexton noted that did not seem overpleased at visit be surprise mr mexton said a alighted from horse tied rein to gatepost be rarely that honour with visit especially at so early hour must apologise for hour said paul entering house conducted by ex governess have to see miss clyde on important business about what asked mr drass sharply pardon dear madam replied paul thwarting curiosity with great blandness will explain that to miss clyde mr drass muttered something paul must not hear usually florid face be pale a preceded into dining room where miss clyde sat at breakfast that lady looked cold composed masculine a usual must not suppress start at sight of paul so want to see on business mr mexton said when have explained very good come into study will not be disturbed can come also selina said mr drass who be extremely curious not just now answered miss clyde later on will send for so mr drass went back to flower with unsatisfied curiosity while paul miss clyde repaired to room latter dignified with name of study in truth be more of bachelor den than apartment of spinster lady furnishing be excellent proof of simplicity of owner character miss clyde sat down before desk fronted window pointing out seat to paul waited to hear what have to say knowing direct outspoken way of going about thing paul went directly to point have come to see about murder miss clyde said looking at significantly expected a much replied quietly what can tell about a much a saw in winding lane on night said mexton boldly who saw in lane brent saw following milly mr lovel be yes followed for purpose to kill milly said paul wondering at coolness miss clyde shook head opening drawer produced therefrom pistol followed to obtain that revolver said handed weapon to paul chapter xiii defence of miss clyde be not to be denied that conversation between miss clyde journalist have opened in highly dramatic fashion mexton prompted by recollection of brent revelation accusation have in sufficient plain language accused of murdering milly lester in answer to miss clyde have placed in hand revolver admitted having obtained possession of on fatal night unfortunate girl have be shot paul asked if crime have be consummated by weapon miss clyde have produced in somewhat dazed fashion held in hand said hostess reading thought in face milly be not killed by shot from pistol might have be understand what mean stammered paul be not difficult to understand rejoined miss clyde shrugging fine shoulder took that pistol from must be murderer mr lovel angry red flushed hard face of woman made gesture of contempt for lack of imagination paul displayed mr lovel indeed said contemptuously have a much to do with crime a have took pistol from dr lester lester then be innocent entirely must not have be arrested then why did not prevent arrest by producing revolver at inquest oh have reason for said miss clyde with emphatic nod will tell later in meantime mr mexton please to assure that revolver hold in hand be actually property of dr lester look at silver plate on butt paul did so on small silver oval found name r lester engraved in gothic letter nodding in turn replaced weapon on desk a be loaded deduced from such fact point in favour of lester see there be cartridge in six barrel said quickly yes dr lester did not fire even one barrel so see did not kill daughter then who did dear mr mexton know more than do said miss clyde candidly see that from evidence of brent rascal whom discharged from employment that suspect well laughed in ironical manner can clear not only can do so can prove innocence of dr lester will do so to asked paul eagerly miss clyde looked coolly up down really mr mexton see why must be response represent law not officially inspector drek have accepted assistance have why have offered because wish to save dr lester from being judicially murdered think that lie in province rather than in yours said miss clyde smiling suppose real reason that be acting a amateur detective lie in fact that love miss link paul smiled also ca say that do replied be more like brother sister than anything else deny that be sorry for on account of loss need not be retorted miss clyde with disdain there be love lost between milly iris in fact disliked one oh must not say that protested paul shocked by want of sentiment aye will say milly be going to marry mr herne iris be in love with quite enough motive there for two woman to fight doubt rejoined paul with significance jealousy between woman have caused many crime be that hit at asked miss clyde good humouredly because if be fall short of mark infer be jealous of poor dead girl because lucas lovel made love to report say so report say many thing be untrue retorted miss clyde contemptuously in case gossip be not altogether wrong love mr lovel a know very well a countryside know why must conceal feeling have one to think of can look after very well assure lucas can call so to mr mexton a be confidential conversation be scamp weak minded fool love for queer be paul looked at masculine strength of woman face into shrewd eye at firm set of mouth be queer admitted look sort of woman to be attracted by wastrel like lovel nevertheless be by law of contrary doubt well admit be jealous of preference for milly lester beauty fascination of manner excited envy a have whole neighbourhood at foot grudged that must take ewe lamb whole neighbourhood echoed paul well mr herne mr lovel mr chaskin pick of countryside nonsense mr chaskin did not love milly there be wrong rejoined miss clyde drily adored only crushed down passion because of friendship for herne oh know for fact mr drass found out find out everything said paul tartly just like social detective doe assented miss clyde coolly be not omniscient else must know who killed poor milly find mr drass very useful assure mr mexton quite believe to continue confession oh need not dignify story by so great title be not in dock yet mr mexton assure will prove innocence to very plainly where be be informing that mr chaskin be in love with poor milly ah be side issue mr lovel be also in love with unfortunate girl did not approve of passion a wanted for be jealous said mexton more plainspoken than polite be said miss clyde calmly most unromantic of woman have vein of sentiment passion lucas be passion love dearly be very jealous of preference for milly be angry with for encouraging be engaged to mr herne must have remained true to on night of murder saw milly leave during service mr lovel followed moment be concluded to meet with milly suggested paul yes thought so be determined to put stop to such meeting by giving milly good talking to threatening to tell mr herne need not look at so severely mr mexton continued miss clyde throwing back head milly be behaving badly towards herne even if have not be in love with man be flirting with think a older woman one who have known from childhood have right to point out to how wrongly be acting doubt miss clyde chose bad time for such interference deny said lady tranquilly milly always denied to that met with mr lovel lied in same way only chance of reproving pair properly be to catch together therefore told john groom know to drive on to house of dr lester whither mr drass have gone to consult went in search of two young fool did find asked paul rather foolishly must be confessed what question after what brent told retorted miss clyde yes found not at once lucas gave slip searched for in wrong direction down by river where thought might be wandering under willow be not there however though wasted time in looking for at length struck that might be in winding lane when got there saw sure enough must confess said miss clyde with much disgust wondered must choose place haunted by rustic lover of neighbourhood there be rustic lover on night believe have gone to revival meeting at methodist chapel be half past eight when got to lane saw only brent coming down towards village yes to meet jane bilway in st dunstan square take to methodist chapel hm met apparently following lucas milly said miss clyde wherewith accuses of murder will be even with for that brute a matter of fact did not see two until passed brent then espied walking arm in arm towards stile lead on to common did speak to then confessed miss clyde frankly for to tell truth did not like part be playing be too like that of spy stopped at other end of lane near town waited till must come back when intended to meet a if by accident never saw again that night poor milly sighed miss clyde little thought have looked on pretty face for last time how be did not see again asked paul curiously because did not return to where be stopped to talk at stile doubt waited for ten minute then heard man singing shouting came from town must not get over stile into lane heard saying something about killing lovel noted that held pistol at once went up to found a expected from condition that be dr lester quite drunk senselessly drunk able to stumble along thought that if met lucas in company of daughter might fire at so dismissed idea of seeing young people again devoted to getting rid of dr lester took pistol off being quite incapable of resistance gave up readily enough then wheeled round taking arm led home what cried paul starting up did take back to house attempted to said miss clyde turned restive wanted to go back to lane then coaxed out into country on road to own house only got very little way when suddenly became too drunk to stand so dragged into bush beside road a be fine night left there to recover sens suppose stayed there till dawn then made way home what did do put revolver into pocket walked home next morning heard of murder of dr lester arrest did hear shot suppose be too far on road homeward to hear else be not paying attention at event heard nothing why did not tell all to drek prevent arrest of lester friend said miss clyde gravely be determined to give dr lester lesson lesson that in future might restrain from indulging in drink thought when heard that be arrested that thought that have killed own child might induce to take pledge if lesson doe not teach temperance nothing will for if have not taken pistol off might have killed if not milly at least lucas intended to go to drek to morrow tell truth get lester bailed out of gaol lesson be rather severe one said paul thoughtfully perhaps be needed if anything can make sober man of lester imprisonment on awful charge will change remember now that confessed at inquest that met someone be too confused to say whether be man woman must have be yes be mr mexton while be leading away from winding lane did not see soul a to red mud on clothes remember told how fell while trying to get over stile see can clear lester said paul with emphasis what about lovel well said miss clyde interrogatively suspect of crime know left with milly daresay at twenty five minute to nine doubt left before nine o'clock when murder be committed ca prove that have have chance of doing so retorted miss clyde visibly disturbed pardon have at inquest lied well wo discus said miss clyde rising be sure mr lovel be innocent can prove innocence if needful have told know mr mexton will tell drek to morrow suppose will see at funeral afternoon yes said paul gravely will be at funeral then two parted chapter xiv dust to dust when paul returned to barnstead felt satisfied that have done wisely in seeking confidence of miss clyde without doubt statement have simplified matter in connection with crime although have not altogether solved mystery shrouded death of milly instead of suspecting three people a have done prior to visit paul now directed energy to discovery of guilt of one one a may be guessed be lucas lovel miss clyde have exonerated have proved innocence of lester so obtainable evidence now pointed to guilt of lovel herne iris believed that have committed crime brent miss clyde insisted that be innocent gran jimboy for reason of own have provided lying alibi to extricate suspected man from dangerous position paul reflecting on situation did not know what view to take there be doubt that lovel recognised danger have induced old gipsy to aid in averting by perjuring at inquest also have bribed ploughman brent into concealing presence in winding lane on fatal night at fatal hour one thing be certain that lovel be last person who have seen murdered girl alive be proved by evidence of brent miss clyde friendly witness to lovel of whom stated distinctly that have be with milly lester within hour of death be therefore impossible a paul thought that must not know something about murder if indeed have not committed yet if be guilty must have sought safety in flight a yet still lingered at herne arm will see if come to funeral said paul to a sat at luncheon will go far to mind to prove if be innocent guilty if milly be really dead by hand think will have hardihood to see body placed in grave if on other hand did not kill will come to burial can tell from demeanour what thought be even most reticent man must reveal feeling at moment if lovel be guilty will be wise enough to keep away going by theory suspected man be innocence for when paul joined throng of curious sightseer be crowding into cemetery one of first person saw be lucas lovel nay more young man did not lurk in background thrust forward so a to compose one of group stood immediately round grave be dressed in black pale composed exhibited none of agitation guilty man must have found difficult to conceal tested thus tested by own free will lovel be innocent despite evidence to contrary openly stated belief of iris herne journalist be inclined to believe that lovel have not killed girl naturally under circumstance there be great concourse of people at funeral of dead girl iris mr mexton be there paul lovel miss clyde mr drass also herne who have be engaged to deceased francis chaskin who read service over untimely grave person attended because be kinsfolk friend of person whom be burying majority of crowd be attracted to spot by morbid curiosity have be rumoured that dr lester who be suspected of murder must be allowed to attend funeral of unfortunate child crowd be determined to give warm reception for insolence in attending successful outcome of iniquity fortunately however for decency of funeral lester remained locked up in marborough gaol multitude rather mob of over zealous person be disappointed there be one at whom to gaze a genuine criminal one to shoot to throw stone at when earth be heaped over coffin of milly lester throng melted away with conviction that have be swindled out of sensation burial have proved le interesting than expected chaskin be overcome with emotion several time a read service paul wondered if what miss clyde have asserted be true if vicar have also be conquered by triumphant beauty of milly seemed likely paul have heard rumour in confirmation of report from face of chaskin looked to of herne saw that latter be scowling at lovel who with bent head dejected mien stood on other side of grave lucas took notice of herne stern gaze stared with tearful eye into hole at bottom of lay coffin of milly lester so sad did look so overcome with sorrow far removed from remorse terror that mexton unhesitatingly acquitted of complicity in crime whosoever have cut short thread of young existence be not lucas lovel later on paul caught glimpse of gran jimboy red cloak flaming on outskirt of crowd when service be over went to look for in hope of discovering why lied at inquest old dame have guessed intention did not want to be spoken to by anyone for before must reach spot where have seen standing have vanished must not determine in direction have gone while be wondering how must find be greeted by darcy herne who looked haggard worn in black clothes mr mexton said leading paul to one side for confidential discourse know from iris that be looking for assassin of milly well wish to hing further in matter till return till return repeated paul with swift glance at pallid face of companion be going away yes be going to london on one of mission connected with religious work on mission connected with murder of poor milly really paul looked sceptical ca conceive how commission of crime in barnstead can take to london may ask for reason not at present replied herne quietly later on may explain at least tell why wish to hing in matter until return said darcy decisively explanation have too much to do with reason have found out something go to prove that be right in suspecting lovel suspect lovel be herne strange answer paul be bewildered said know what said mexton be wrong think lovel killed milly then who did dr lester be innocent have discovered that much know be innocent rejoined squire so be lovel a to guilty person journey to london be concerned with have suspicion have may go for nothing when did find clue be following to london on day chaskin examined spot where murder be committed oh paul thought flew back to herne trance subsequent behaviour so think that rainbow feather be clue what do know about rainbow feather questioned herne sharply nothing save that picked up parti coloured feather called by name be clue think so be not sure replied darcy doubtfully will tell on return when do return in three day have promise not to pursue investigation against lovel till come back oh yes said paul yielding readily enough more easily a at moment did not know how to act in matter will hing till come back explain rainbow feather good day mexton be in hurry said herne cutting short speech in three day will know a much a do about feather hurried away paul stood looking after wondering how discovery of dyed feather must affect case have blood thirsty person come down from london especially to murder milly have rainbow feather be left a sign manual of work after fashion of secret society paul smiled at fantasy of idea milly did not know anyone in london rather have not known since poor girl must now be spoken of in past tense fame of beauty must not have spread beyond environs of barnstead marborough tragedy of death have given fame much wider after meditation paul found unable to explain herne conversation for time being put matter of squire departure to london out of mind attention be further distracted by approach of miss clyde companion iris trio paused before iris began to talk paul said lifting veil miss clyde be exceedingly kind intends to offer a bail for step father with mr mexton of course said miss clyde in hearty voice can go to marborough tomorrow after due formality have dr lester released then can come back here alone said mexton thinking of lester weakness ah cried mr drass penetrating thought be just what say if dr lester come back will take to brandy bottle again think so said iris shaking head miss clyde lesson have be very severe oh so know that dr lester be innocent iris of course doe interposed miss clyde cheerfully told about before funeral well said mr drass with doubtful look only hope that lesson will do doctor good mark word will drink again when alone in own house wo be alone said iris quietly will come back with leave mother iris said paul yes mr mexton think must be with stepfather think so also have lost poor milly must do best to comfort saw talking to mr herne said mr drass to paul what have to say to death mr mexton be very much concerned mr drass wish to hunt down assassin lucas lov began iris quickly then stopped a recollected how miss clyde loved suspected man go on said miss clyde with calmness know mr lovel be innocent so mind how much mr herne suspect beg pardon said paul mr herne doe not suspect lovel now why not asked iris astonished paul shook head ca tell said mr herne asked to hing further in matter touching mr lovel what have done ' asked miss clyde sharply have found out that be with milly twenty minute before murder be not cried mr drass eagerly be in mother jimboy tent swore that be know replied paul quietly swore lie miss clyde know know that lucas went into winding lane with milly said miss clyde in rather troubled voice doubt left at stile went straight on to gypsy tent swore at inquest that be not in lane on night said iris know know dear be miss clyde reply did that to save from being unjustly suspected believe killed milly hear what mr mexton say that mr herne be of same opinion opinion have changed then remarked iris must like to ask why ca at present iris mr herne have just gone to london to london echoed miss clyde in surprise what bad taste to go away so soon after funeral why have gone know miss clyde do said mr drass with sniff have gone to see minx what minx asked paul astonished catinka violinist replied mr drass coolly oh mr lovel told about hussy mr herne did not love milly love catinka love be why mr herne went up to town so often why have gone now impossible said mexton growing pale a thought of own passion for violinist tell be so rejoined mr drass wrathfully if doe love why did come down here to marborough to barnstead be in church on night milly be murdered what cried iris sharply be strange lady saw leaving church be said mr drass triumphantly saw too made business to find out about there be marborough friend of mine in church who saw catinka when gave concert tell to day have just parted from that strange lady who be in church on night be catinka now what do say mr mexton paul have nothing to say did not even open lip wondered if catinka have anything to do with rainbow feather finding of have disturbed herne so greatly chapter xv dr lester tell story with discovery that catinka have visited barnstead on night of murder new element entered into case paul be satisfied that dr lester miss clyde be innocent of crime that lovel although appearance be against might possibly be guiltless also failing three individual there remained one who might have interest in getting rid of girl now that catinka presence in barnstead have be proved by gossip of mr drass friend from marborough be not impossible that might have something to do with matter might even have shot milly for here quality of jealousy might come into play herne a be stated by lovel mr drass knew violinist have paid several visit to in london what then more likely than be in love with with that discovery of engagement near marriage to milly might have prompted catinka to remove possible rival from path a paul admitted to be theory fact supporting have yet to be proved in meantime according to promise to absent herne journalist took immediate step towards prosecuting inquiry relative to proving guilt of lovel be determined to hing further until squire return possible explanation pending result paul betook to marborough in company of miss clyde for purpose of releasing dr lester from gaol proceeding in furtherance of object included interview with drek found inspector at police office in very tranquil frame of mind have quite overcome early doubt about eliza evidence be now quite convinced that lester be guilty also congratulated on own cleverness in capturing criminal so speedily quite ignoring fact that discovery of guilty person a deemed lester to be have be thrust upon a to mexton dealing with case drek have not given thought be surprised when journalist miss clyde called to see well said drek when formality of reception be ended what do wish to see about mr mexton about bail of lester drek shook head be afraid will find that difficult said sapiently why miss clyde be willing to give bond for lester due appearance at trial know can pay that be good for thousand pound suppose magistrate will ask for larger amount think will ask for amount replied drek drily because think will grant bail what exclaimed miss clyde do mean to say that intend to keep lester in gaol until trial yes miss clyde be exactly what do mean evidence be so clear against prisoner that will find hard to escape gallows if be released must certainly make bolt of think so mr drek for simple reason dr lester be innocent innocent repeated drek in surprise why man doe even attempt to defend be aware of retorted miss clyde why because dr lester doe not recollect event of night if did must know that did not shoot daughter have reason for believing in innocence asked drek puzzled by speech best of reason mr inspector took pistol from before shot be fired at nine o'clock drek started taking weapon miss clyde presented to examined carefully yes said after pause see name lester be engraved on piece of silver so have doubt be pistol of dr lester may ask how came into possession miss clyde replied to question by telling in detail story have related to paul on previous occasion drek listened without interruption eye fastened on face to judge by expression if be telling truth apparently be satisfied for when tale ended said after short meditation think be right miss clyde lester be innocent if tell story to magistrate will have difficulty in having bail accepted must own be rather disappointed made so certain that man be guilty well mr drek see be not h be wonder who did kill girl said drek musingly be impossible to say at present said paul on whom gaze of inspector rested at present whole matter be enveloped in mystery will be seen that paul said nothing about suspicion regarding lovel mentioned fact of catinka visit to barnstead fact be after impetuous act of drek in arresting lester journalist did not think advisable to speak too plainly lest inspector must put lovel in gaol be best thought paul to first secure absolute proof against man before calling in aid of law knowing a much a did mexton determined when herne returned to follow up clue regarding lovel a to catinka connection with matter be so vague at present that paul said nothing about until a in case of lovel have proof of guilt well said drek seeing that must obtain aid from miss clyde mexton seems have be too hasty although against lester evidence be clear enough must go with to get released for time being begin again in attempt to discover mystery be opinion that will discover nothing said miss clyde a left police office mystery of milly death will remain one there be difficulty about release of lester inspector took visitor before magistrate repeated with correction from miss clyde tale about pistol much impressed by story magistrate accepted bail for lester at thousand pound on bond of miss clyde mexton at same time reproved miss clyde for not having told story at inquest dr lester be innocent said must not have be put in gaol dr lester be drunkard retorted miss clyde fright of being prisoner on charge of murder may reform doubt doubt greatly be magistrate said granted order of release three went off to gaol where saw lester speedily brought out of cell man be haggard worn with anxiety remorse for be not quite clear in mind a to innocence so paul took to mother house gave meal even insisted that must have whisky soda though lester protested did not want will never touch alcohol again said piteously made mad on night for know may have killed milly that did not rejoined miss clyde told story for third time lester listened in silence tear rolled down cheek when heard how mercifully have be preserved from committing terrible crime be thankful to god for having preserved by hand said when finished be grateful to for having given lesson sadly needed hope lesson be learnt said miss clyde drily may be sure be replied dr lester eagerly will never touch strong drink again will go back to barnstead work hard to redeem character iris will come with of course father said iris who be present will return evening begin new life poor milly poor child sighed lester must be that lovel killed no did not replied miss clyde sharply mr lovel be quite innocent if have done service dr lester repay by accusing man love of crime will say nothing nothing answered lester who be quite broken down then paul led away into own particular den for confidential talk wished to learn what must about relation of herne with catinka thought that lester might inform be merest chance that anything might come of conversation yet paul determined to try in present perplexity be like drowning man clutched at straw wish to put few question to doctor said when lester be comfortably established with full pipe must answer honestly will do so paul may command replied man submissively very good doctor know that milly be engaged to darcy herne yes know that everyone knew that lucas lovel admired milly so much that wished to marry know that also said lester with clouded face be poor child meeting with man indirectly brought about death will talk of later replied paul want to know if lovel ever saw with reference to passion yes did about week before milly death came told that loved what did do told that be scoundrel to speak so seeing that daughter be engaged to squire herne then showed door did take hint no said that have come to inform that herne be not fit husband for milly oh said paul recalling accusation of lovel in presence of chaskin when on spot where murder have taken place said that herne led double life did yes replied lester in surprise how did know heard something of before from lovel tell exactly what be said lester thought for moment said that herne be in love with violinist called catinka know catinka said paul be polish woman gave concert in city saw once twice did not have much conversation with be beautiful be very beautiful replied mexton blushing admired very much indeed fancied at one time be in love with see now be mistaken how long be since saw about year tell doctor what else did lovel say nothing much replied lester with shrug declared that herne went to visit catinka in bloomsbury square oh be that address said paul taking out note book be number one thousand bloomsbury square said lester why do make note of will tell later on what did say to lovel told must ask herne a to truth of accusation did do so did very next time that called at house saw told what lovel said did defend be lester unexpected reply said that knew catinka well that often visited in london that friendship with be nothing to milly a milly father must object how did explain friendship on ground that catinka be fellow worker with to help afflicted from what can gather lady seems to be kind of socialist who us profession to mask real business be intriguing against russia wish so herne said to free country enlisted in society oh have society then oh yes be called a herne told 'the society of rainbow feather ' what cried paul jumping up rainbow feather be excited said lester excited echoed paul walking hurriedly to fro have reason to be so do know that rainbow feather be found by herne on very spot where milly lay dead what of asked lester whose slow brain must not follow paul idea ca see catinka must have dropped that feather there be in london be in barnstead on night of murder replied paul sharply by evidence of feather must have be in winding lane on night of murder ca see reason can heard herne be engaged to milly came down to see followed to winding lane for know shot why must shoot milly cried lester rising know ca say must find out lester not word of to anyone return to barnstead with iris will go up to london to morrow to see catinka yes herne what know have gone up to london also about feather be sure of have proof will call at bloomsbury square find out truth about catinka also will know why came to barnstead what be doing in winding lane how can get to speak how by mean of rainbow feather of course chapter xvi catinka before iris departed for barnstead with stepfather contrived to have short talk with paul girl be touched by kindly way in old playfellow have behaved to dr lester in trouble wished to thank for disinterested zeal seizing opportunity when step father be conversing with miss clyde took mexton by hand how can ever thank for have done said face be flushed with rosy hue eye sparkled like star at moment stirred by generous emotion iris link be beautiful woman paul have never noted fact before perhaps from long familiarity with face unavoidable comparison of with brilliant beauty of dead milly revelation of soul rendered beautiful came on with unexpected force wondered how must have be so blind a not to have admired before in moment love germinated with unexpected suddenness in soul pressed girl hand warmly thank at dear said in low voice be only too glad to help yours will come to barnstead evening paul iris have great deal of work to get through before going to london be going to london to morrow morning fancy have clue to identity of person who killed milly doe clue guide to london yes have ascertained that third person be in winding lane on night when milly lovel met who be person catinka polish violinist replied paul forthwith told iris that have learned regarding rainbow feather from dr lester certainly look a though have be there said iris thoughtfully be impossible that must have killed sister why from account be in love with herne believe be insisted miss link mr herne explanation to father be far more likely fancy association with be founded on patriotic ground know that be rich enthusiastic wish to secure a member of ridiculous society with money must do great deal towards object of inciting revolt against russia be very probable on ground see why came to barnstead on night of murder must ask that paul added iris suddenly be not lady love paul blushed in turn be catinka whom admired replied with emphasis on last word love at least not now fancy for have passed away heart be free far more so than yours iris what do mean asked companion trifle coldly why said paul in surprise surely know do not love darcy herne paul fancy for have died away like yours for catinka for what reason one satisfies said iris resolutely one can not tell paul looked searchingly at cold look on face baffled scrutiny understand said turning away eye understand replied iris bitterly day may do so at present dear paul may be sure that heart be a free a own heart may not always remain in such forlorn condition said paul suggestively iris looked at suddenly saw something in expression of face made blush with evasive instinct of woman turned hastily away see papa be going said hurriedly must follow good bye paul good bye iris be reply when two went away from house with miss clyde who have to return to barnstead also paul stood looking after with smile on lip strange if iris must turn out to be fate after said to then went off to office of tory time presence there be much needed have to discard speculation about iris possible wedding in order to plunge into journalistic work connected mostly with dry subject of politics next morning having finished work obtained necessary leave from editor paul went up to london by express train be noon when arrived at victoria have luncheon in strand restaurant before calling on catinka here fate served well for brought into contact with rising musician who might be supposed to know that there be to be known about polish violinist signor baldini be young man of italian blood on maternal side have taken maiden name of mother a more likely to look well on music paper have written one two song have be more le successful now contemplated composing music of comic opera be in own estimation to place on level with sir arthur sullivan paul be hailed cheerily by individual be soon in confidential discourse after chat about comic opera people to whom be known paul ventured to ask companion concerning catinka at question signor baldini shrugged shoulder have not seen lately said candidly doe not play so frequently a once did see name rarely on st james hall programme now have public got tired of then not that know of rather fancy be who have grown tired of public fact be mexton that charming young lady have bee in bonnet what sort of bee political bee be intended to sting autocrat of russia catinka be pole know of late have be mixed up in politics of socialistic sort never take up paper without expecting to see name figuring a heroine who have thrown bomb at czar be known to be socialist well be in paper know be pretty generally talked about catinka have kind of society of be leader rainbow feather society yes see have heard of even in native wild did ever hear so absurd name imagined so ridiculous symbol feather plucked from goose dyed in bar of red blue yellow green symbolical doubt one outside society know meaning thereof who belongs to association long haired pole russian exile sort replied signor in tone of disgust most respectable member be fellow called darcy herne do know yes met once at musical party given by lady at least be called so said baldini correcting daresay be gathering of conspirator herne be there seemed cracked kind of creature full of whim belief in equality looking after oppressed sort of rubbish religious too have bible at finger end do know asked musician in turn do be squire of barnstead near village live then why doe look after preserve instead of mixing up in catinka mad scheme will get into trouble met once said paul thoughtfully have not much opportunity of reading character what kind of young woman be oh one of charlotte corday sort life in bloomsbury square believe yes number one thousand said baldini rising if intend to call on warn friend wo be well received care for nothing anarchist herne oh be nonsense only care for because want money to work up plot against czar then there be love in matter love echoed signor contemptuously if knew catinka well must ask so absurd question be got more heart than one of bomb friend manufacture well good day mexton glad to see sorry to go awfully busy signor baldini rattled out of door a though life depended on speedy movement left alone paul finished luncheon thoughtfully explanation given by baldini seemed to put guilt of catinka out of question at event removed sole motive must have for such wicked act that of jealousy if be not in love with herne must not be jealous at hearing a must have heard of engagement to milly if be not jealous have reason to commit so preposterous crime yet have be in barnstead church on night of crime a be proved by marborough friend of mr drass have be on fatal spot also a be confirmed by evidence of rainbow feather picked up by herne what be badge of political society doing in winding lane why have herne seemed so startled when picked up be question paul wished to ask of catinka in answering of hoped to find clue to assassin be convinced that solution of mystery be connected with rainbow feather catinka a found occupied first floor of gloomy old mansion in bloomsbury square when paul ascended wide staircase have borne tread of georgian belle beau found before massive door bore brass plate upon name catinka be inscribed one knew be polish girl surname a preferred to be known by have made famous in world of music perhaps intended to reveal who be when heading intended revolt against russia in artistic london be known only by first name then a everybody stated catinka by looked well on bill sallow maidservant with rather foreign air opened door conveyed card of paul to mistress speedily returned led into cosy sitting room with two window looked out on to grimy tree in centre of square did not appear like den of conspirator for paper be of cheerful pattern chair sofa be covered with rose sprigged chintz on wall be portrait signed by leading musician singer of day judging from number of catinka be favourite with fellow artiste there be also grand piano covered with loose sheet of music violin lying carelessly on top what attracted paul most be fan of stained feather be spread out in front of mirror over mantelpiece four colour mentioned by baldini stretched in bar across fan paul became aware that be looking at symbol of anarchist society of have lately heard so much dyed feather innocent looking fan yet sign of hatred borne by crushed country against conqueror paul be struck by incongruity of symbol meaning good day to sir said voice behind with slight foreign accent wish for to ah broke off catinka a paul turned be nice critic of english town how do do mr mexton have not forgotten said paul in rather faltering voice oh dear never forget who speak well of sit down good young critic let talk of what wish violinist be pretty sparkling brunette of great height with olive hued face handsome calm be dressed to perfection in tea gown of amber coloured silk trimmed with black lace back hair be gathered into kind of coronet through be thrust tortoise shell silver headed pin be vivacity charm sympathy yet baldini have assured that have heart that be dangerous conspirator paul must believe statement in presence of dainty little lady now mr mexton cried catinka when be seated why come for visit eh want to ask question oh yes assuredly what will dear sir have to do with barnstead said paul in hesitating manner catinka charming face hardened shot keen look at paul ah said after pause be place near to city where be giving concert quite so oh yes what say about barnstead want to know why be in barnstead church three week ago eh said catinka attempting denial see there know that be there also that be in winding lane on night young lady be killed catinka leaned cheek on hand looked at curiously be police asked wish to know why be there oh most certainly dear sir will said violinist calmly be in barnstead to watch on mr herne darcy herne who be there on night also chapter xvii society of rainbow feather statement made by catinka be so incredible improbable that paul must only stare repeat came to barnstead to watch mr herne said slowly quite understand mr herne be in london on night ah pardon replied catinka vivaciously mr herne good man be at barnstead doe not require one to speak of so request have seen herne cried mexton recalling fact that squire be in town at moment eh why not see yesterday see morning ask to say nothing of veesit to barnstead on night promise have good reason to promise what reason asked journalist bewildered by manner before replying catinka sprang lightly from seat caught up fan of rainbow feather from off mantelpiece reason dear mr critic behold ah then reason have to do with society oh yes have to do with said catinka shutting fan composedly will to explain if wish of course wish mademoiselle wish to find out who killed that poor girl catinka shook head gravely resumed seat that thing

adopting grammatical error in bewilderment on breast oh on back of dead lady saw corpse yes saw then know who killed girl know not did mr herne shoot miss lester asked paul determined to get direct answer can not say truly did not see did fire shot catinka flashed fiery glance at questioner what be must say did nothing to lady killed not swear be so by saint know so much that what know will be told interrupted catinka be good sir if moment will be silent wait be quite at disposal mademoiselle said paul composed to listen to what must not fail to be interesting strange story good be so right said catinka resumed seat light of sun poured in through high window enveloped violinist in haze of golden glory so that have to spread out particoloured fan in order to shade eye from glare did not move out of pool of heat light for seemed to please greatly basked in ardent ray like cat paul never forgot that scene cheerful room bright sunshine pretty woman who glowed sparkled with southern vivacity in radiance told strange story truly told in calmest of voice so that long before finished paul concluded that baldini be right when declared catinka have heart here will be best to set forth tale in other word than own since phraseology be foreign not always correct substance of what related be a follows for to understand what tell began slowly must learn who be be aim have reason to keep

ashamed of descendant must think not indeed mademoiselle cried paul have overcome difficulty in noble manner added doe not touch on society be coming to said catinka with nod a told be necessary for understanding must begin from beginning well mr mexton when found at ease in london determined to do what must to aid unhappy country to be free a child of poluski be bound to revenge parent free poland then in brain there arose idea of society of rainbow feather be name symbolical asked paul glancing at fan still held yes catinka spread out fan before be made of feather sign that will rise since bird fly wear plumage feather be dyed red blue green yellow be symbolic colour red for war must wage to free land blue be sign of peace will follow war green colour of hope need to inspire yellow for wealth require to further plan see said paul coolly yellow stand for darcy herne whose wealth need precisely replied catinka calmly be very clever dear mr mexton to guess so well a do think be in love with mr herne by mean sir be money bag want have one heart be for man love fill be love of poland of crushed fallen country saint grant that may be hand to raise from dust not easy task

harm tyrant czar call tyrant recruit have money without money must not hope to forward cause then god who be against oppression sent in way mr herne met well never mind how became acquainted with came to meeting of society in very room found out that have sympathy with oppressed so be willing to aid to lift foreign yoke from neck of countryman looked on a own a man vowed to service until learnt from mr lovel that be engaged to be married do know mr lovel very well replied catinka quietly have known for two year feigned to be in love with be only passing fancy left london to fall in love with milly lester herne be engaged to lady out of jealousy lovel told of engagement be angry for thought that must lead mr herne away from that money enthusiasm must be lost to cause later on mr herne received letter from barnstead assured that miss lester be flirting making play a may say with mr lovel grew jealous day before murder when received letter stating that miss lester be to meet mr lovel determined to go down for see if be faithless who wrote letter asked paul eagerly can not tell replied pole shaking head be scribbled on very dirty paper in illegible hand at least almost illegible saw only two did mr herne know who wrote told have idea said catinka cautiously know not be sent to town address in berkeley square yes know have house there said paul in thoughtful tone how came to see letter catinka mr herne showed last two to when reproached with leaving london instead of attending to meeting of society said that must go down on sunday night assure that report be false did believe think did said catinka promptly said that miss lester be young thoughtless might be led astray by evil mind of mr lovel wanted to save from destruction talked in quite religious way about know said paul quietly herne be fanatic so went down on sunday night by train at four o'clock in afternoon followed why did follow because desired to see girl replied catinka coolly see mr mexton did not wish to lose mr herne because wanted money for society so thought must see what girl be like if be a lovely a declared to be again wished to see mr lovel get to marry girl so must have dear herne to myself be not in love with herne to secure money to cause must have married quite intended to do so went to barnstead might behold rival to see understand if have much to fear from did go down by same train oh yes at four o'clock be in third class carriage mr herne in first did not see got to marborough little after five then lost a knew be going to barnstead be matter hired carriage drove over to barnstead where have dinner in hotel called after mr herne herne arm yes gave bad dinner said catinka making face after went to church where thought might see girl did see how did know be pointed out to when asked lady who sat near saw lovel look at also be beautiful foolish saw leave church waited till end of service then went out after mr lovel a desired to speak with did must not find when went out a did not know village be not aware where to go wandered about quite lost for long time when be on wide plain heard shot ran forward into wood to see what be matter took time to find place where shot have be fired when did find living person be there dead body be yes assented catinka body of miss lester whom have seen in church be alarmed thought might get into trouble if be found with dead body know law so ran away before went said pole with emphasis placed on body be lying face downward symbol of society rainbow feather chapter xviii iris confesses paul received confession in silence then said may ask why placed rainbow feather on body for reason particular mr critic replied catinka calmly wished good herne to join society give of money if not joining freely willed that must be forced to for safety see gave rainbow feather one be found by dead then conceive must swear never put on body mr herne alone must have done since one must have feather like in barnstead so see catinka shrugged shoulder must be called murderer if spoke when came to tell vow to speak if give not money kind of blackmailing said paul wondering at shameless way in spoke what did mr herne say to oh will give reply when trial of caught man be done dr lester yes father of dead lady know lester be innocent eh may be so replied catinka with shrug how be must know because must be aware who fired shot mr mexton tell hear shot run forward see one not mr lovel not good herne one person do see put feather on body run away in case say kill lady get into carriage at inn go back to marborough then to london in railway did see mr herne at barnstead at saw at marborough at railway then never again do think killed girl know not say not 'd say anything to save own neck rejoined paul scornfully be in disguise when went to barnstead not that know have long coat for rain there be rain also white scarf on neck not like dress of gentleman see disguise did not want to be known in barnstead catinka made gesture of indifference know nothing of said have told all have said paul slowly very fully what be to prevent telling pretty plot about rainbow feather care not if good herne be free will give money since lady be dead if speak be killed by law well make will get money be so if have be afraid mr mexton must have said not one word see be right will get money to help country paul rose took up hat cane be so disgusted with way in spoke that wished to leave a speedily a possible bid good day mademoiselle said marching towards door allow to tell that consider wicked woman ah catinka shrugged shoulder now know call bad name be ungrateful what care not that snapped finger be shameless bah bah bah go away pig of englishman paul felt that there be nothing for to accept advice without further word walked out of room pursued by scornful laughter of catinka love might have felt for beauty be killed by confession cruel mirth when mexton left bloomsbury square be quite cured of passion on way back to marborough paul have carriage to have time solitude to consider what use must make of catinka statement must seem from what have told that herne be implicated in murder perhaps have committed deed paul be well aware of herne temperament be that of fanatic who regarded body le than soul who must slay one to save other be of same nature a torquemada of spain if herne fancied that milly be likely to go astray with too fascinating lovel journalist be quite sure that must have have hesitation in killing girl must glorify for deed catinka have said that anonymous letter have made herne jealous with view paul did not agree if herne have shot milly lester have done deed with pitiless zeal of fanatic only wonder that did not proclaim doings to barnstead mused paul if fancied in fanaticism that be justified in killing girl must certainly not hesitate to acknowledge guilt must not let innocent man suffer for crime though to be sure if killed milly did not regard deed a crime silence be sole argument in favour of innocence indeed if herne be not guilty how must explain stealthy visit to barnstead going thither in disguise silence regarding presence in village on night of murder doubt have come by stealth lest milly hearing that be back must have refused to meet lovel so have hidden flirtation from eye of future husband there be doubt again that herne have be in village on night of murder since after receipt of anonymous letter must hardly have remained ignorant at marborough on other hand there be proof that have be in winding lane brent have seen miss clyde not herne iris on going to spot after crime have beheld lovel not herne in way have fact of herne presence at barnstead come out in evidence collected by drek for evidence of catinka seemed genuine enough must be impossible in way to implicate darcy herne in crime after considerable thought paul determined to seek out question lovel that young man on evidence of miss clyde brent have be with milly almost at hour of murder be more probable a terrified lest must be accused lovel have induced gran jimboy to tell lie on behalf mexton considered absolved from promise have made to herne since catinka statement have implicated squire in crime therefore arranged in own mind to force confession from lovel threaten with arrest must prove obdurate paul knew very well that if told knew to drek there must not be much difficulty in having lovel arrested on suspicion very fact of lying alibi must be exposed by brent miss clyde must be sufficient to get into trouble since if be innocent there must have be need for to resort to such extreme measure for safety on considering that have be told by various people paul concluded that lovel herne be guilty person one of two have shot hapless girl be hard to say only discovery of new evidence must confirm guilt of one innocence of other be with discovery of such evidence that paul charged from thought of crime mexton drifted into considering disillusion with regard to polish violinist at one time have loved for brilliant beauty have thought kind hearted sympathetic conversation have taken part in shameless way in confessed to blackmailing herne absolute disregard of honour even common honesty showed what sort of woman be if herne be religious fanatic catinka be frenzied on point of patriotism for mission be willing to sacrifice who stood in way of fulfilment paul quite believed that have not killed milly short of murder fancied that be capable of other crime in order to accomplish dream of free poland how must have loved woman groaned paul then be ideal loved not kind of viperish clay catinka have proved to be dreamt of goddess find hard woman of world love may have felt for have vanished be now much more attracted by plain good sense kindly heart of iris than by beauty of impossible pole after added mexton trying to comfort even if catinka have proved reality of dream must never have surrendered great scheme to marry iris ah if must only induce to love then indeed in union with might hope for happiness be six o'clock when mexton arrived at marborough after dining at home returned to work in office time be compiling political article chronicling small beer of provincial town thought be with iris link with enthusiasm of youth be rapidly raising altar to goddess catinka have be rosalind told iris be juliet modern romeo be falling in love a quickly a prototype of verona longed for company of iris a thirsty traveller for cooling spring after restless night haunted by dream of iris memory of poor dead milly rode next morning to barnstead here put up horse at herne arm promised long day with new goddess of affection on side iris have be thinking great deal about paul glance have given at parting have turned thought in direction began to look on in more amiable light than have hitherto done love for herne have completely died away since death of milly now began to compare mexton to disadvantage of squire conduct of latter in regard to discovery of assassin of milly have not prepossessed in favour contrasted lukewarm pursuit with fiery zeal of paul friend of youth seemed noble in comparison to herne iris reproached for having overlooked for so long many good quality in fact thought of paul a much a dreamt of when saw at front door of poverty villa went out to meet with becoming blush paul on part blushed also met like lover after long separation thus out of evil have come good happy marriage between two young people eminently suited to one be likely to be outcome of poor milly lester untimely decease so strange unexpected be decree of fate be glad to see again iris said paul taking hand looking into eye how be step father very well be cheerful hopeful replied iris miss clyde have told story to everyone now barnstead know that be innocent there be quite revulsion in favour yesterday be being congratulated must not be surprised if false accusation brought more patient out of evil come good quoth mexton following into house where be dr lester now have gone out to see patient sober hope paul iris turned round indignantly may be sure be sober have not touched alcohol since came back miss clyde lesson be cruel efficacious think will ever indulge in strong drink again can talk of reform later added iris a sat down in drawing room be anxious to know how got on with catinka well found out great deal did said iris then added with blush did find a charming a expected indeed did not found that idol have foot of clay have tumbled off pedestal forever hard cruel woman iris not at woman of dream be glad found out mistake before be too late said iris in contented tone be sure must never have made happy be sure also rejoined mexton laughing must look for happiness nearer home said with significant look that colour again flushed face of iris not deeming moment propitious one for love making since be not yet sure of own heart hurriedly turned conversation what did catinka tell paul many thing replied mexton then after pause added iris remember asked not to search for assassin be that because wished to save father be not reason said iris in hesitating tone told so before then did not want lovel to be arrested did not care if be arrested not be not sure if be guilty although did see in winding lane when went out after poor milly body be brought home did see anyone else near spot said iris frankly did not why do ask because be sure suspect someone of having be there do can not tell whom suspect need not know catinka told that darcy herne be in barnstead on night of murder be there then cried iris rising with expression of horror where in winding lane know why do say so wait iris left room while paul be still wondering at emotion returned with handkerchief spotted with blood handed to paul mr herne handkerchief said found on spot where milly body be discovered chapter xix who mr lovel be then herne must be guilty cried paul looking at name on handkerchief be not sure replied iris if be guilty must not accuse mr lovel be forced into position rejoined journalist quickly accused lovel until discovery of rainbow feather led to believe that catinka have be on spot might have seen commit crime then changed tune asked to seek further evidence against lovel until returned from seeing catinka know now that violinist saw nothing reassured on point be certain that herne will return here tomorrow go on accusing lovel paul urged iris might have seen lovel kill milly if have done so must have have lovel arrested iris handkerchief show that herne be in winding lane on night at time of murder came to barnstead in disguise see handkerchief be spotted with blood with milly blood feel sure that herne be guilty man iris covered face with hand shuddered oh moaned have tried to put frightful suspicion out of mind because loved man fancied that might have killed milly in fit of rage be because be sorry for asked not to search for assassin thought must find herne yes must not believe guilty when heard of mr lovel false alibi at inquest truly believed that have killed milly iris expostulated paul handkerchief be spotted with blood know perhaps mr herne let fall when found body if so found body why did not call in police why did sneak away to london in disguise let chaskin bring home corpse iris believe that herne killed milly only one man can tell truth truth must tell to save own neck will see lovel do think will accuse mr herne faltered iris dear know replied paul rising own conduct be quite a mysterious a of herne do know be that of be lurking about spot at time shot be fired that one of two must have fired suspect herne will hing against at present say anything to drek until see mr herne will not promised paul herne doe not return till to morrow in meantime will interview lovel evidence may either clear inculpate herne ca believe mr herne be guilty cried iris in despair ah said paul looking at with frown be because love did love now care for save a friend for such friendship sake must be sorry to see convicted of crime may not have committed well will say nothing against until see lovel very moment will go to herne arm question do do come back to tell if can prove innocence of mr herne suspect will have enough to do to prove own said paul grimly forthwith left house on errand with carried incriminating handkerchief iris have forgotten to ask for back again on way to inn paul wondered why have not adopted before very obvious course of questioning lovel must have gone to after brent confession of false alibi have forced young man to explain why old gipsy have perjured at inquest on further reflection paul recollected that circumstance have intervened have made impossible to seek interview with lovell now obstacle have be removed have accumulated from brent miss clyde catinka others mass of circumstantial evidence at coming conversation be fully prepared to encounter further deception lovel might employ to evade discovery paul did not believe that lovel be guilty a even passion of jealousy must hardly have incited to slay girl who loved trusted be certain that lovel knew name of assassin be equally certain that such name must be darcy herne at inn mexton learnt that lovel be in sitting room at once sent up card with request for interview have fancy lovel for obvious reason must refuse to see rather to surprise be requested to walk upstairs when servant closed door behind paul found in comfortable apartment alone with man who a believed held in hand sole clue to mysterious death of milly lucas looked worn ill there be dark circle under eye appeared listless indifferent a though vitality be exhausted without offering hand to mexton bowed pushed forward chair hast thou found out o enemy said softly mexton stared a well might for biblical quotation be strange one for lovel to use paul thought rather theatrical be not enemy mr lovel said taking seat think know very well how must know when brent tell that go to to worm out secret a to replied paul coldly have right to discover secret be likely to lead to detection of milly assassin think be man questioned lovel looking fixedly at visitor think killed poor girl will give credit that loved too well to take young life think also said paul with energy that know who fired shot no be a doubtful of a be decline to believe that herne killed girl know so far a do know herne did not kill girl replied lovel emphatically then if be innocent also who be murderer know can not say said lucas wearily have asked that question fifty time day to can find answer police might find answer lovel laughed police might arrest find answer by getting hanged said coolly well drek may arrest yet said paul raising eyebrow must be aware mr lovel that action be very suspicious because told lie to screen from possible danger yes because induced gran jimboy to lie also though how induced to perjure ca guess will explain if like said lovel coldly see must tell truth sooner later must rather make father confessor than drek run le risk of arrest see know lovel if think guilty will certainly have arrested good sir cried lovel with irony if be guilty of murder must have left neighbourhood long ago staying here prof innocence will wait to hear story before agreeing to very good mexton will hear story in addition will tell took place in winding lane on night poor dear milly be killed then added lovel with emphasis will be a puzzled a be puzzled by what by mystery of case who killed milly ca tell if can not one else can understand began paul when lovel cut short let waste more time said impatiently hear confession a may call judge for paused passed hand across forehead in moment so continued name be lucas lovel a know came down here eight ten month ago to sketch paint who be knew more than until three week ago about time of murder interjected mexton yes assented lovel bending head there be mystery about birth did not know where be born who be father mother be brought up by old maiden aunt in london resolutely refused to tell about parentage be educated at excellent school a wished to be artist be sent to studio of celebrated painter to study afterwards went abroad to paris rome whence be recalled two year ago by death of guardian by will inherited house in clapham two hundred pound year enough to keep from starving not enough to give luxury of life about year ago became acquainted with catinka mad scheme for freeing poland at house met herne met herne echoed paul much interested did thought be a mad in own way a catinka be in hers however became friend asked down to barnstead a be aware stayed with for time quarrelled because admired miss lester too much left house to take up abode in room where have be since be love for milly kept here in dull neighbourhood know must have be more honourable have gone said mexton reprovingly why because girl loved be engaged to religious lunatic cried lovel pale face growing red with anger be for very reason stayed be determined that beautiful milly must not be sacrificed to cold blooded fanatic besides loved for attraction of herne money must have become wife met often a know wretch sent tale of meeting to herne do know who wrote herne letter asked paul eagerly if did 'd kick person who sent said lovel viciously have idea who be so cruel well mexton while paying court to milly urging to break off engagement with herne met with old mother jimboy gipsy positively haunted step never saw without speaking to found great nuisance perhaps wrote anonymous letter suggested mexton thinking of dirty paper illegible handwriting a described by catinka lovel shook head very decidedly friend said gravely mother jimboy did not write letter for reason will hear must hing to injure on contrary must protect a apple of eye for sake told lie at inquest so that must not be suspected of crime did not commit must have strong reason for guardianship said mexton surprised strong one assented lovel nodding reason of kinship mr mexton paused to give effect to word old gipsy be grandmother grandmother echoed paul curiously be then gipsy on father side be romany half gorgio look be of gipsy race can not see for said turning face to light be a stated for on looking at keenly paul beheld unmistakable trace of romany blood oval face swart oriental thin nose full red lip above peaked eye with glazed look reveals true gipsy lovel looked like arab astray in west must have suited rich robe of oriental rather than plain garb of english gentleman paul instinctively felt that young man spoke truth be englishman be not even kin to dark spaniard swart italian be of gentle romany undeniably gipsy when did discover that be of gipsy blood asked paul have told said lovel quietly about three week ago on day before fatal sunday night met milly on common promised to meet in winding lane next night after service shortly before gran jimboy have read milly hand prophesied that must come by violent death be angry with old woman when milly left went in search of mother jimboy to reprove how did take reproof by telling that be grandmother appeared that son father who be pureblooded gipsy have be fine singer left romany tent for stage sang also at private house in london in one of met with mother who be heiress in small way fell in love with gipsy tenor ran off with be married when be born mother died asked husband to take back to sister father died also be by aunt old maid spoke of be brought up before be six year of age father be drowned while going to america a have squandered money wife brought be left penniless aunt who be angered by sister marriage decided to tell nothing gave father name lovel be gipsy name know left little money so see mr mexton be gipsy see said paul rather bored what have family history to do with murder chapter xx gran jimboy lovel flushed angrily at ironical tone in visitor made last remark kept temper in way wonderful for so passionate man replied with calmness a told before mr mexton few personal detail about be necessary to make understand position otherwise will never comprehend how mother jimboy consented to perjure for sake at inquest beg pardon said paul feeling ashamed of rude speech must not have spoken a did pray continue when gran have related family history resumed lovel quietly told that have come to barnstead specially to watch over knew be not rich having discovered how know not that miss clyde be in love with implored to marry lady refused because of milly yes assented lovel because of milly told gran cause of refusal in plain word be angry with what termed folly said that if met milly again consequence might be fatal oh said that did yes only to insist upon foolish prophecy earlier in day a told declared that milly must meet with violent death urged that such death might take place at next meeting so a to induce not to see girl again in word mexton artful old woman be trying to frighten with false fire replied to warning by telling be to meet milly next evening in winding lane mother jimboy warned once more that evil might come of might come must come questioned paul might come replied lovel think anticipated evil simply tried to put off meeting with word of warning well mexton of course did not believe in nonsense talked laughed at whereat left in anger swore must have reason to remember prophecy god know have now added young man bitterly h be said paul thoughtfully do believe in palmistry lovel said other promptly in spite of gipsy blood be believer in influence of star card line on palm yet in milly case be very strange that gran jimboy prognostication of evil must come to pas bah in opinion contributed to fulfillment of own prophecy mexton surely believe that feeble old woman like gran killed milly replied paul decisively believe that brought about death by art tell when be saw about three o'clock in afternoon very good then told of intended meeting with milly one else knew of said lovel thoughtfully told only gran jimboy milly might have informed sister be improbable said paul drily milly knew well enough that sister iris did not approve of flirtation with assuredly must have stopped meeting have known of must have formed inconvenient third at meeting concluded paul well well cried lovel impatiently assuming that grandmother be only person who knew be to meet milly on sunday night what then simply firmly believe gran jimboy wrote letter brought herne down to witness meeting lovel started from seat in surprise how do know herne be there did not tell that know be aware that saw meeting yes saw saw repeated paul slowly confuse said lovel impatiently striding up down room will tell how where saw herne later just now inform why think gran jimboy wrote letter because learnt from catinka have seen catinka interrupted lovel stopping yes yes allow to proceed told that letter be written on dirty scrap of paper by uneducated person grandmother must hing to harm dear lovel said paul coolly doubt by informing herne of meeting thought that be acting in interest remember wanted to marry miss clyde well if must have got herne to stop meeting with milly doubt fancied must cease loving poor girl consent to make miss clyde wife admitting that what about prophecy oh knowing that milly be deceiving old gipsy fancied might take law into own hand kill hence prophecy about violent death dear mexton be pure theory true be waiting to hear state fact of case will said lovel resuming seat pray attention please may be able to make more out of matter than on night met milly in winding lane about quarter past eight walked up to stile at end where lane go out into common while walking saw brent bribed to say nothing paid well interjected paul five pound did not pay at on night replied lovel gloomily next day after murder told be innocent in peril gave five pound with promise of more when wanted bribed lest must inculpate in murder be about confessed lovel if brent have thought innocent must not have taken money will do that justice think do too much justice said paul coolly brent be scamp must accept money even though be blood stained go on please mr lovel be talking to milly standing by stile continued young man there be telling about herne flirtation with catinka of course knew that there be flirtation wanted to make milly jealous so that must break off match with herne marry well while be talking clock in st dunstan church began to strike nine milly saying must go home stepped away short distance at moment shot be fired with cry poor girl fell if only knew what felt when saw fall cried lovel clasping hand did not see from what direction shot came bent over milly moved little then died asked mexton who be following narrative with intense interest rose from knee when be dead rushed into bush to see who have killed must see one at first heard sound a if one be retreating followed quickly in shadow of tree distance away saw darcy herne have killed cried paul rising denied lovel with vehemence be in one of trance expect have seen kissing milly when parted that sight have excited nervous system to degree that went into cataleptic state touched shook spoke in ear to purpose be quite senseless blind to external thing then became aware of own peril be afraid lest must be accused of killing milly have met be in love with saw that on side be in danger of being accused of crime mexton cried lovel be not master of felt like madman rushed away where went know when grew calmer found on high road then thought must protect by alibi swear have not met milly went to mother jimboy tent told said must help made lie down be know of crime mexton did not kill girl swear swear also herne be innocent be so sure of said paul doubtfully sure of course be man be in trance have pistol in hand might have fallen suggested paul looked before went why did return after midnight who told that returned asked lovel curiously iris link thought that step father have committed crime to save went to spot to look for pistol fancied might have dropped know now that miss clyde took away pistol before crime be committed heard story said lovel thoughtfully of course never thought that dr lester be guilty did iris see yes ran away did said lovel flushing went to see if herne be still there hearing footstep of iris doubt went away lest must be implicated in murder what else must do in position well mexton have told know what do make of story paul rose come with lovel see mother jimboy said putting on hat will see what know of matter know nothing be not out of tent be not so certain of said mexton quickly if wrote letter a suspect be certain must go to see if herne be

vanity love of admiration have so played off three men one against other that not one of three knew that be flirting with rival yet a paul considered vicar must have occupied different position for be aware that milly be engaged to herne must have known what country gossip knew that be playing fast loose with lovel when future husband back be turned truly village beauty have be torch of destruction in small way local helen undeniably foolish wicked vain creature with only beauty to recommend cruel a thought may seem mexton fancied that be just a well be dead done with have lived must have

with old woman began to whimper expostulate with feeble energy grandson must listen to excuse with angry look at crawled out of tent walked hastily across common trying to get rid of wrath by violent exercise be easily seen a considered that gran have hoped for death of milly at hand of herne that squire have not killed her be due to trance into have fallen while witnessing fickleness trance have rendered incapable of inflicting punishment on fair woman who have deceived without doubt judging from evidence of pistol chaskin have committed crime finding herne in trance have probably taken handkerchief dipped into blood with idea of saving inculpating friend lovel must not conceive how chaskin must have known of meeting unless gran jimboy again cried stopping short a idea struck told chaskin excited jealousy guided to spot failing herne be determined that parson must kill milly so fulfil evil word see have be puppet infernal hag have pulled string to make dance while be thus talking to paul came running up expostulated with lovel for having left tent so hurriedly gran be wicked old woman said admit that have acted ill be for sake lovel that have done thing know know wish

fellow forget herne brought down by letter did not kill milly chaskin did replied lucas wrathfully believe that gran told of meeting induced to come to place however put mexton that old wretch be responsible for tragedy well said paul a resumed walk that point will bear arguing now that know truth what be to be done must tell drek have chaskin arrested well think be wise to do let call at vicarage give man opportunity of defending can make defence seeing that hold pistol with name on dear fellow remonstrated paul remember herne handkerchief for evidence that be in trance must have believed guilty chaskin doe not fall into trance know that may have other defence at event be only just to give chance before making affair public a please said lovel suddenly let go to vicarage at once chaskin will only lie deny guilt chance have taken lovel step across common for in anger at gran jimboy revelation have not perceived where be going paul have followed while talking have unconsciously drawn near to stile divided common from winding lane only when halted at stile did realise where be in silence looked at one will return said paul in low voice lovel shook head with frown on face climbed over stile paul followed walked on towards scene of tragedy on very spot where milly dead body have man be standing with folded arm looked up a young men drew near saw face of darcy herne be sad downcast appeared to have be meditating on tragic death of promised wife herne cried paul halting in amazement thought be in london so be replied squire carelessly came down to day instead of waiting till to morrow business be finished so there be need for to idle in town how be lovel added abruptly turning eye towards lucas be a well a can be expected under circumstance replied lovel gloomily why do pay compliment of asking after health mr herne do not regard a murderer of miss lester replied herne quietly did so once have changed mind since seeing catinka questioned paul sharply what do know about catinka asked herne just a sharply know that must tell about rainbow feather visit to barnstead told about rainbow feather repeated herne how did trace connection with rainbow feather be too long story to tell rejoined mexton coolly got clue on day found rainbow feather on very spot catinka placed on body catinka did not commit murder know that did lovel here h be said herne looking at pair perhaps suspect of crime what make think that asked lovel because if mexton saw catinka doubt told of visit here on night murder be committed yes did tell admitted paul then a know so much may a well tell said herne received letter by last post on saturday night telling that mr lovel be to meet milly here on sunday night letter be not signed know who wrote so do herne said lovel gran jimboy gipsy wrote learnt from at three o'clock about meeting wrote at once so a to catch london post why did trouble to betray for reason will explain hereafter replied lovel what of secret visit be jealousy made come down doubt replied herne coldly light coming into eye be desire to save milly from snare set by thank for good opinion oh may sneer said herne with energy know be not child of god fought against for soul of milly a angel fight against devil of pit have rather died than lived to be wife lose soul in worldly pleasure be beside question sneered lovel want to know about visit came down to marborough in kind of disguise said herne dropping religious tone for of man of world be muffled up so that face must not be recognised from stable on outskirt of marborough hired horse rode over to barnstead horse at chequer where be not known came to lane where watched hidden behind yonder tree saw lovel come up with milly saw kiss such be rage that before must advance fell into one of trance to be subject when came to myself be alone on ground be dead body of milly be then lovel that thought have killed poor girl must not prove guilt because of trance again a have come by stealth to barnstead be afraid lest under circumstance must be accused of crime therefore held tongue about presence here on night accused said lovel bitterly accuse now replied herne coldly why retorted young man because know chaskin be assassin chapter xxii denial squire herne stared blankly at lovel burst out laughing frank chaskin said old friend murderer of promised wife be mad to say so be not mad a know very well mr herne daresay came out of trance on night quickly enough to see chaskin steal away from scene of crime swear by hold most sacred that saw nothing of friend on night rode back to marborough caught night express to london without speaking to anyone with whom be acquainted have told that came hither in disguise be likely ask mr lovel must nullify that disguise by speaking to dearest friend not only second self mark added herne haughtily priest of english church to whom must not without shame reveal secret visit acted for good object doubt mean be forced to adopt be none le distasteful deny that in way know that frank chaskin be guilty what be more gentleman must be prepared to stake existence that be innocent must like to agree with mr herne said paul sadly unfortunately have here proof of guilt proof what proof pistol said paul producing weapon handing to herne be found by mother jimboy on spot on night of murder shortly after committal of crime will see that vicar name be engraved on butt herne glanced carelessly at pistol returned to mexton have need to see said sternly recognise pistol well enough be one of pair chaskin have when be in army be found on spot say what of simply broke in lovel that chaskin must have dropped after killing milly doe not argue that chaskin be here at retorted herne pistol be doubt stolen from study where kept jimboy say gipsy thief why added struck by sudden thought be in chaskin study week before murder remember quite well doubt stole pistol killed milly why add sneered lovel because accuse of so purposeless crime doubt gave pistol to murderer admitting that did cried paul whom do suspect one replied herne though might suspect lovel oh said lucas shrugging shoulder be going over old ground again be not replied herne say again that suspect ask again why have changed mind said lovel be with milly when fell into trance be absent when came out of so far a knew one else be in lane awoke from senseless state to see milly dead body on ground can suspect only state very good case against sneered evidently wish to be hanged wish to hang villain who killed milly can defend if needful can defend chaskin must do so with life be innocent will have to hear that from own lip replied lovel be on way to see will come also chaskin can defend have just left said nothing lead to doubt pistol doubt can explain pistol go ask for must bid good day have engagement one moment cried paul catching by arm a be moving off do intend to abandon search for miss lester assassin no replied herne coldly will find assassin without help because know be chaskin cried lovel scornfully know be chaskin retorted herne disdainfully person whom suspect whom know killed milly be one must never dream of accusing mine will be hand to bring person to justice till then waved hand have nothing to say with final word moved away paul stood looking after with look of doubt on face whom do think suspect asked journalist know ca be dr lester miss clyde for have evidence that be innocent said paul perplexed because denies that be guilty chaskin for same reason so believe denial of chaskin guilt cried lovel with frown nothing will make believe that did not kill milly perhaps herne suspect catinka impossible cleared in eye well said lovel dismissing subject with shrug let see how rev mr chaskin intends to clear will find hard to deny evidence of pistol paul thought so also a companion seemed indisposed for further conversation held peace two young men walked slowly through winding lane intent on own thought mexton wondered on how many more people blame of tragic death be likely to fall lester miss clyde lovel catinka herne have be suspected on sufficiently strong evidence on evidence equally strong innocence of one have be clearly proved now circumstantial evidence of pistol be against chaskin must appear that have killed girl for paul be not inclined to be certain of guilt others have cleared by reasonable explanation so why must not chaskin do same mexton quite expected that vicar must be able to explain loss of pistol account in plausible way for meeting on common with mother jimboy if proved to be guiltless must be quite impossible so far a paul saw to discover assassin of milly fate must remain tragic mystery person who have wrought such ill must live on in defiance of law though for might be woman thought paul escape law of man there be yet law of god to be reckoned with come might dastard who have fired fatal shot must not escape punishment in next world on way to square of st dunstan where vicarage be situated young men met with dr lester who at once stopped to give news have just heard from drek that trial take place next week said eagerly must surrender to bail will be glad to get thing over a notwithstanding innocence feel uneasy until be pronounced guiltless need not trouble said paul assuredly will go free know now who committed murder who be who be assassin will tell later on be drek here yes be at herne arm then tell to meet lovel there in hour have something to tell be of greatest importance be name of assassin yes broke in lovel fiercely be name of assassin hope will see in gaol to night where be going now doctor asked abruptly to see mother jimboy be ill know yes know assented lovel gloomily will die hope not be old must fever intervene inflammation be set up be afraid will die may be well if doe muttered lovel to good bye doctor will know who killed milly very night when lester took departure did very unwillingly a be anxious to know truth paul companion went to vicarage without much difficulty be shown into presence of chaskin vicar happened to be at home at moment saw with apparent willingness lovel with jealous eye perceived that changed colour when entered also voice shook when asked to be seated from sign of emotion in absence of apparent cause paul augured ill for innocent man chaskin be strangely moved have come to see on very important matter sir said paul yes responded chaskin trying to preserve calmness about what let answer question said lovel before paul must speak about murder of miss lester what about murder mr lovel why do come to on such errand because think can best answer question chaskin rose suddenly from chair commanded voice with powerful effort of will perspiration beaded brow a spoke what be to understand by speech mr lovel that be assassin of milly lester gasped vicar sitting down again le by will than because must no longer stand upright dare to accuse of terrible crime mr mexton be friend mad mr chaskin replied paul in sad tone believe same a doe that killed miss lester who read service over coffin yes exclaimed men together chaskin passed hand across brow groaned be horrible dream said in agitated voice can not be serious be serious said mexton agitated also must willingly believe guiltless sir what can say what can lovel say in face of such evidence a pistol chaskin took weapon from paul hand looked at in startled way yes be mine name be on mr lovel mr mexton how did come by received from gran jimboy said paul gran jimboy picked up on very spot where milly body be lying added lovel shortly after shot be fired how did come there by time chaskin be colour of paper there be certain dignity in answer can not tell gentleman replied did not lose in winding lane be pistol said lovel with scowl be lost over month ago thought must try get out of in way scoffed weak defence truly need make defence said chaskin haughtily be innocent then how can explain presence on common before nine o'clock of night how do know be on common mother jimboy say met true chaskin again passed hand across face did meet be going to see sick man on other side of common away from village yes went there saw man immediately after evening service be on return about midnight found body of poor girl gave alarm stated at inquest remember said paul with nod mr jimboy declares that before nine o'clock be going towards winding lane be making mistake interrupted vicar hurriedly be going in other direction denies that said lovel sharply be shortly after saw go into wood about winding lane that heard shot did not fire said chaskin emphatically let ask mr lovel if be with miss lester on night at hour be admitted lovel mind saying so a can prove innocence then must know who killed miss lester shot be fired out of darkness of tree be standing by stile yes with miss lester then if came towards that stile must have seen did see admit replied lucas somewhat disconcerted if be not guilty mr chaskin know who be can say one thing other said vicar if think guilty must do so chapter xxiii drek opinion there be silence after declaration of chaskin for neither of young men knew what reply to make vicar did not affirm innocence a have done earlier in interview did accuse anyone else of committing crime with be charged took up purely negative attitude by doing so threw on paul lovel onus of proving accusation nothing in way of defence must have be more unsatisfactory on seeing hesitation chaskin reiterated speech repeat be innocent asserted if think that killed unhappy girl must continue to do so added vicar with irony fail to see what motive can ascribe to for act motive of jealousy said lovel sullenly be in love with milly oh need not deny mr chaskin know for fact friend said chaskin coldly intend to deny question right to make such statement be true that loved miss lester never knew of passion be promised wife of friend a such did not think justified in revealing feeling mr lovel be le scrupulous admit replied lovel attempting weak defence loved village knew a much call love debases object if have said nothing to miss lester might have refused to meet have not met added chaskin emphatically tragedy must not have taken place a to that know best sneered younger man a please sir rejoined vicar refuse to defend to can defend at questioned mexton suddenly will answer question when be asked by duly constituted authority at least tell how lost that pistol vicar rose from chair walking across to side table lifted therefrom oblong box of mahogany opened placed before visitor be remnant of soldiering day said once contained two pistol now a see there be only one other admit freely be weapon showed to mr mexton weapon with milly be murdered said lovel viciously doubt a told lost four week ago how did lose asked paul for seemed to that chaskin be evading point can not tell replied vicar box stood always on table see many people in room one of might have taken mother jimboy for instance for simple reason that mother jimboy never came to vicarage herne say did cried lovel that saw in room before murder chaskin drew long breath seemed to consider reply mr herne be mistaken said at length gipsy be never in room then somebody be telling lie said lovel looking sharply at chaskin doubt answered coolly be not bound to find liar for perhaps know where be to be found without aid vicar shut down lid of box with snap once more rose to foot conversation have lasted long enough said with dignity have replied to question very patiently refuse to answer more say be innocent asked paul say nothing know who be guilty insisted lovel know nothing be answer must obtain from chaskin so seeing that be useless to prolong interview with so obstinate man paul friend departed visit have be productive of good if chaskin be guilty have only succeeding in putting on guard be guilty two young men took different view of question paul be inclined to side with vicar while lovel be equally bent on insisting that vicar be assassin if have not killed milly must declare that be innocent said did so when first spoke to be point in favour see at said lovel obstinately did not know what evidence must bring against when knew took refuge in silence well objected paul more just than prejudiced companion if remember denied that mother jimboy have stolen pistol if be guilty be probable that must seize on chance to exculpate inculpate others suggestion made by herne must have be good opportunity of shifting blame from own shoulder on to of gipsy a heard for lovel declined to take advantage of opening bah be cunning daresay have defence ready if so did not entrust with rejoined trifle drily be not such fool a to show hand unless forced to do so must drek arrest must have lie in plenty to prove innocence think there be sufficient evidence to arrest drek may think otherwise replied lovel looking at watch come to herne arm mexton for expect inspector will be waiting for there will tell of interview with vicar see what opinion be about matter must not be surprised if mr chaskin be in gaol by evening must be very much surprised said paul emphatically a lester be already accused of crime be to stand trial next week drek can not arrest chaskin a yet however guilty may think ca have two people legally accused of same crime one must be proved innocent before other can be imprisoned a suspected of guilt a to point of law know nothing about replied lovel impatiently know be that to mind chaskin be guilty person evidence of gran jimboy production of pistol be sufficient to hang however will see there be nothing more said at moment a conversation threatened to become disagreeable two men walked to herne arm here found inspector drek who informed that lester have delivered message must not be present at interview a have be called out to see patient mile away did not expect to be back before six o'clock however be at disposal very anxious be to know why have sought interview come up to room will tell said lucas led way to sanctum here ordered cigar whisky having made friend comfortable related to drek story of connection with mr jimboy knowledge of what have taken place in lane on fatal night of have be already set forth think wise that must know mr drek said concluding a someone else may relate history in more le distorted fashion be a can see plainly in too dangerous position to trifle with law now friend mexton here can tell of visit to london visit to mr jimboy chaskin mr chaskin vicar cried drek who in interest have let cigar go out what have to do with matter let explain said paul in turn told inspector of interview with catinka discovery of pistol in gipsy tent finally interview with lovel have taken part in at vicarage drek being thus in possession of evidence gathered by pair be in position to deliver judgment however found difficult to do a be not particularly clever man multiplicity of fact with have now to deal somewhat bewildered brain however saw what be expected of in official capacity rising to occasion did best to grapple with situation if will permit gentleman said taking drink of whisky to freshen up faculty will recapitulate that have discovered severally discovered since crime be committed then can see against whom evidence be strongest perhaps learn thereby who killed girl confess added drek with downcast air be not very sanguine why not exclaimed lucas hotly there be plenty of evidence be whole point sir there be too much evidence against chaskin mean against herne also observed paul if pistol found by gran jimboy incriminates chaskin le doe blood stained handkerchief point to guilt of herne herne ca be guilty protested lucas angrily tell be in trance when shot be fired after shot be fired corrected mexton remember did not see until girl be dead must have fired shot then have fallen into trance why not very act might excite nerve to such degree a to cause trance know that cataleptic state of herne be caused by violent emotion if have fired shot must have found pistol in hand might have dropped searched for said lucas obstinately did find in agitation might have overlooked replied paul a obstinately gentleman gentleman cried drek intervening in matter discussion be unprofitable may be right wrong will not arrive at conclusion by such loose argument let begin at beginning state case what case asked lovel abruptly case against connected with matter said drek dr lester miss clyde polish violinist mr herne finally mr chaskin there be strong evidence against daresay retorted lucas tartly ill pleased at name being in list such evidence have proved most of innocent dr lester for instance well sir dr lester look at case against be very poor wished daughter to marry mr herne learnt that marriage important to a mean of securing rich son in law to pay debt be likely to be broken off by young lady flirtation with doctor becomes mad with drink taking pistol start out to kill remains away night can not account for action in interval daughter be killed so may assume that intending to shoot mr lovel shot quite so said paul drily evidence be nullified by miss clyde statement know that replied drek with coolness failing miss clyde statement evidence be strong against dr lester be innocent so be out of case now miss clyde be in love with mr lovel be jealous of miss lester take loaded pistol off doctor be lurking in lane to see meeting of man love with woman hate here then may say that out of jealousy to get rid of rival miss clyde killed girl evidence be rebutted by fact that miss clyde must not have arrived home in time if have killed milly hour of arrival at farm can be proved by mr drass also if miss clyde be guilty must not have produced that pistol very good assented drek still imperturbable then will strike out miss clyde also now then for catinka want mr herne money think will lose if marries miss lester to remove obstacle come down to barnstead kill girl bosh said lovel rudely if have killed milly must not have left clue of rainbow feather whereby must be traced can strike catinka out of list also mr inspector certainly replied drek obligingly catinka be innocent although a see evidence against be very strong now come to mr lovel oh said that young man ironically how do intend to prove guilt be not presuming guilt said inspector merely intend to state evidence against be attention said lovel well sir to put briefly love girl be with at hour of murder set up false alibi do everything to bring suspicion of guilt on be innocent will presume so for moment replied inspector coolly must know mr lovel beyond bare word have proof that did not kill girl drek lovel jumped to foot with almost shriek say that killed milly going by evidence hang evidence be stronger against herne chaskin did find handkerchief bloodstained did discover pistol with name on lawyer might say that stole pistol out of chaskin room to inculpate in projected crime also that took herne handkerchief out of pocket when be in trance dropped into blood to get evidence against oh say that be guilty mr lovel must admit that evidence be strong think that mr chaskin killed girl mexton here incline to think that mr herne be guilty evidence against two be stronger than against lawyer must build up powerful stop stop cried lovel sitting down stop will make believe that killed poor girl after chapter xxiv trial see said drek complacently that be quite easy to get up case against mr lovel yet feel convinced from late action that be innocent therefore will understand that be inclined to doubt even strong evidence have obtained against mr chaskin may be a guiltless a be evidence against herne be a strong yet think hand be clean of blood why then must suspect chaskin so much refused to explain loss of pistol so far a go refused because did not think mexton have right to examine if person like having authority go see drek find out if will confess to said paul eagerly will take step in matter until trial of dr lester be concluded in meantime chaskin will run away said lovel bitterly think so rejoined inspector nettled by sneering tone of young man cast reflection on judgment conduct of mr chaskin doe not augur that intends to fly if did must take mean to prevent flight will have watched will have herne watched what about mother jimboy who be so important witness in case said paul suddenly be seriously ill being so old be not improbable that may die at moment true said drek thoughtfully think of everything mexton will have deposition taken a soon a learn that be in danger at present moment dr lester who be in attendance on assures that chance of recovery be in favour oh may trust concluded inspector rising will do best to bring assassin of miss lester to justice chaskin cried lucas emphatically herne retorted drek putting on hat forget argument about evidence mr lovel take advice keep quiet until lester be discharged then will see what be to be done arrest suppose sir cried drek with indignation be much of arab did intend to be enemy act so traitorous part must not have broken bread with in other word must have declined whisky soda very excellent cigar have just smoked beg pardon drek take back word good day good day mr lovel good day mr mexton at present know not what be before inspector drek left room with air of great dignity when door be closed after lovel turned towards friend what do think of position now asked think that have better wait see outcome of lester trial bah know outcome will be acquitted well said paul who be tired of discussion let wait till be acquitted then renew search for assassin say chaskin be assassin say herne time opportunity will be needed to prove of be in right said paul after conversation concluded of young men went different way with opinion so diametrically opposed to one felt that continued companionship might result in quarrel at present stage of acquaintance seeing that be mutually interested in bringing to justice assassin of milly lester be unwilling that rupture must take place hence very wisely parted during following week there be great excitement in marborough assize be being held barnstead crime occupied most prominent place in list of case have be set down for trial be rumored that lester be innocent at marborough precise way in innocence be to be proved be not known in barnstead thanks to miss clyde indefatigable mr drass inhabitant be better informed looked upon coming trial a mere farce for discharging of dr lester there be new source of excitement in village a be reported that mr inspector drek have found assassin must have condemned on most irrefutable evidence name of accused be not given many be surmise a to who criminal might prove to be thanks to discretion of paul lovel drek not word be breathed hinting that mr chaskin have anything to do with matter in meantime illness of mother jimboy took bad turn be evident that day be numbered drek visited held to story of chaskin guilt point blank refused to make sworn deposition to effect obstinacy on point led inspector to believe that old woman be lying for what purpose must not conceive drek did must to force to sign confession in vain day for lester trial arrived without accomplishment of object nevertheless paul mexton haunted tent of gipsy loudly declared that must not leave until be dead have signed confession so obstinate be on point that not even trial must seduce into marborough tory time have to employ reporter in place for kindness on part of editor mexton promised that confession of mother jimboy must be published in paper when country must be astonished paul did not know at time how truly spoke on second day of assize trial of dr lester came on court be crowded iris dressed in mourning with heavy veil over face be present under charge of mr mexton must rather have stayed away having be subpoenaed a witness on behalf of crown be obliged to attend miss clyde be also present with mr drass indeed court be full principally of barnstead folk who thought that have right to best seat on account of murder having taken place in village lovel came in shortly before trial began while standing in crowd for did not wish to make prominent felt light touch on arm be surprised on turning to find face to face with polish violinist looked paler than usual more than trifle anxious lovel be quite unable to account for sign of emotion catinka said in surprise what be doing here came down to see trial replied saw body of poor girl desire to behold wicked murder man wo see here then one know who killed miss lester doctor be innocent interrupted lovel trial be mere farce when dr lester be discharged must look for real assassin can help dear catinka shrugged shoulder told to good mexton know where be at barnstead on business good friend mr herne yonder be standing beside clergyman priest who be that priest mr chaskin vicar of barnstead be ver handsome man said catinka calmly hush mistar lovel will listen to what say lester be in place lawyer talk be counsel for crown ah friend be matter no matter at to speech lovel made reply a be listening intently to opening speech of counsel for crown barrister eminent man in profession set forth circumstance of crime detailing supposed movement of prisoner on night of murder ended with allusion to witness proposed to call in order to prove guilt then one by one who have appeared at inquest including lovel iris gave evidence a may be guessed incriminated lester in very decided fashion to majority of spectator ignorant of what have be discovered since inquest seemed probable that lester be guilty that must be convicted sentenced ultimately hanged thinking thus present in court be astonished to see how serene be demeanour of prisoner dr lester dressed in mourning for child fact female portion of audience resented a hypocrisy stood quite composed in dock paid greatest attention to accusation be leveled against only once did wince be when allusion be made to drunken habit frequent state of dangerous frenzy induced by intoxication otherwise be unmoved say one not wicked whispered catinka to lovel who have returned to seat after giving evidence think say kill that poor daughter wait till hear side of question replied lovel in same low tone doctor have yet to make defence counsel for accused made very short speech stated that prisoner have be drunk on night at time of murder that have taken loaded pistol have gone out in search of mr lovel at half past eight o'clock after leaving house recollected more until returned home at dawn crown relied on state of forgetfulness caused by intoxication to prove prisoner guilt under circumstance indeed be hard to tell if prisoner have not shot deceased in mistake for mr lovel fortunately in interest of justice counsel for accused must produce intended to produce lady of well known veracity who must prove that man in dock be entirely innocent have not committed crime alleged against counsel stated also that have only one witness lady that lady miss clyde that must be able to refute evidence brought against prisoner by prosecution a jury now understood what proposed to do counsel for defense must call selina clyde miss clyde at once stepped into witness box be duly sworn gave in detail evidence of taking pistol off lester related almost in same word story have told to mexton counsel for crown cross examined severely nothing must shake testimony when left witness box tide have turned in favour of lester present believed to be guiltless summing up of judge inclined towards view jury without leaving box so great be impression produced by miss clyde evidence pronounced prisoner innocent verdict of not guilty be given judge discharged doctor lester stepped down from box free man amid applause of court so did not kill after said catinka who looked rather disappointed with verdict replied lovel coldly have heard evidence lester be innocent who be guilty know catinka laughed in scoffing manner thought must have known by time observed with shrug do know demanded lovel sharply do be told by man man who be wait will hear in few minute in court yes see catinka stretched out arm mr herne know who killed poor lady see dear rise to tell name indeed herne in spite of attempt on part of chaskin to prevent be on foot demanding permission to speak before judge must retire before lawyer must rise from table before jury must leave box single person court herne without waiting for permission have asked for be making speech face be flushed with excitement eye flashed spoke rapidly clearly to point word solved problem of milly death be few lord cried gentleman of jury have liberated one man a guiltless of death of promised wife now require to order arrest of man of man who came by stealth killed to save soul from ill wish to know who killed millicent lester here be man herne struck on breast killed saved soul chapter xxv truth at last after extraordinary outbreak of herne in accused of milly murder chaskin led away court be adjourned till next day situation of man accusing thus be so utterly without precedent that presiding judge did not know how to act without sifting matter finding why herne accused so publicly did not want to take upon responsibility of ordering arrest moreover judge who knew somewhat of herne eccentricity be privately of opinion that man be not quite right in mind tragic death of future wife have evidently disturbed balance of brain have led in frenzy of horror humiliation to accuse publicly of crime have not committed on ground reasonable enough herne be permitted to go free until truth of extraordinary confession must be proved nevertheless judge while thus cautious lenient intimated that be opinion that police must personally see after herne if be guilty must be arrested forthwith if insane be not fit to be at large acting upon advice inspector drek followed herne chaskin to hotel requested interview in response to inquiry vicar presented can not see mr herne at present said gravely be much excited have persuaded to lie down be intention to arrest mr drek if see reason to adopt so extreme course replied drek what be opinion of confession sir believe one word of think then that mr herne be innocent most decidedly returned chaskin be a guiltless a be be that good example said drek with dryness know that mr jimboy accuses a author of crime on evidence of pistol wonder at belief answered chaskin quietly pistol be mine have name on butt be found on spot where poor girl body be discovered by men have be hanged on le evidence mr drek doubt have made attempt to defend retorted inspector sir a understand from messrs lovel mexton decline to say if be innocent guilty did decline be vicar reply for sake of poor friend ah cried drek sharply then be afraid lest must be arrested refused to speak so a to screen did said chaskin simply must remember sir that mr herne be dearest friend must do much to save from consequence of own folly what folly public confession yes public confession be false if be false why must mr herne make man doe not put neck in danger for nothing be so sure of mr drek have heard of many men giving up for crime of be guiltless uneducated men yes men of education also tell mr drek that friend did not fire that shot then who did be innocent a can say now freely refused to speak because thought that speaking might get herne into trouble now that have made public statement not confession mind accusing of crime did not commit think duty to tell know sit down please mr drek listen to what have to say drek did so in perplexity for did not know what vicar must tell likely to nullify herne statement only knowledge of name of real assassin must prove herne innocence vicar confessed that be ignorant of such name however case have become so complicated that drek be thankful for story confession statement declaration likely to throw light on darkness therefore forebore to speak with keen eye fixed upon chaskin waited patiently to hear what vicar have to say at present moment drek mind be in state of confusion when messrs mexton lovel came to see last week explained chaskin have just parted from friend have lately returned from london where have seen lady called catinka poluski know said drek with nod violinist mexton told about well appears that be in lane on night of murder know that also mr chaskin saw corpse to inculpate mr herne so a to get hold on for money left rainbow feather on spot herne knew by of presence went up to see well sir what did say stated that saw herne watching miss lester lovel also that fired pistol killed girl then fled do believe that mr chaskin replied vicar decidedly because
