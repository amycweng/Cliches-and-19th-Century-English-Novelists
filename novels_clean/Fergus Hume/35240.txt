must stand fair chance of happiness a rich one own master stand none so have determined to offer at one same time ruin salvation now do begin to understand still miriam knew not what to say whole scheme be to so fantastic so abominable at same time so extraordinary that genesis seemed hardly human be impossible to believe man be sane decided must have nothing to do with be afraid said coldly

with difficulty hear what said enough heard to make colour come go when have finished bead of perspiration stood out upon forehead who told gasped who told man who left just now tell wish to know what be name have name for call 'the shadow if will will serve a well a other name now do go stay leaned against writing table breathing heavily for more than minute stood thus battling with then slowly turned looked at will stay said then fell helplessly into chair sobbed bitterly barton looked at with sneer went to side board for decanter glass a in dream be conscious of holding wine to lip a in dream drank heard speak to remember said on implicit obedience depends future thwart hush hush cried looking round in fear lest already someone must have overheard will do can very good now if feel better will return to drawing room at door laid hand upon shoulder one moment mr barton will keep man shadow a call from doing harm will be a much slave a be miriam although shuddered did not dare to contradict be indeed slave whispered communication have given choice again from moment poor miriam have taken up burden for long after that impression left by extraordinary interview be deep upon circumstance altogether beyond control compelled to obey barton must by mean understand puzzled completely must not reconcile man wish to ruin gerald with apparently co existent desire to give chance of escape from trap prepared for be so utterly inconsistent to mind must only surmise that man have conscience in way strove to quieten desire for vicarious punishment seemed to have taken possession of be to thinking a childish a be reprehensible must not reconcile with normal sense of morality with sanity be doubt specie of mania besides in many other way barton action be such a to cast gravest doubt a to mental state behaviour became more more perplexing action almost invariably baseless inconsequent be not until long after when skein of various life with own have become entangled began to unravel that understood what be now perfectly inexplicable to then knowing what knew be no longer surprised have be miss crane demanded mr darrow with asperity a squire entered oh have be talking to on little matter of business interrupted barton before miriam must reply be right julia there be nothing for to disturb about really mind in least said mr darrow seeing have made faux pa now that miss crane have returned to perhaps will be so good a to sing something miriam first impulse be to decline for interview with barton have shaken nerve good deal saw sinister look of curiosity on mr darrow face determined must give that lady further ground for suspicion will sing with pleasure said moving towards piano be afraid have brought music oh saw to said mr darrow producing roll be quite sure uncle barton must like to hear voice so brought few of song for few of song repeated miriam where pray did get oh be dicky who found in room dear child brought down to show picture on title page of one of seemed to have attracted indeed perhaps will give music mr darrow rose to fetch parcel then proceeded to open read out title of song on hilda face there be blandest of smile masking if truth have be known keenest of interest knew that mr darrow bombshell be now about to explode to a to wily widow be incident of evening in fact whole raison d'etre of hear voice be contralto miss crane said major admiring contour of head be so glad be favourite voice really major observed hilda must have thought must like something more lively to contralto matter how beautiful be always rather doleful there ca agree with put in gerald to thinking contralto be always full of pathos be voice go straight to heart now too surprise mr arkel replied hilda smiling ever so amiably did not think be so susceptible in what be doctor call cardiac region think of people must know better than murmured gerald bending towards nonsense admit such superiority hush let hear what be miss crane be going to sing to ever suspicious at kindness however trifling on part of julia squire have moved up close to piano be keeping pretty close watch upon mr darrow be unconscious of scrutiny being too deeply absorbed in effective lodgment of bombshell to pay much attention to anything else sand of dee ' clang of wooden shoon 'down long avenue ' rattled off mr darrow then with prettiest air of surprise oh here be comic song think must be mistaken said miriam coldly sing comic song now now miss crane know be hiding light under bushel cried mr darrow with horribly artificial mirth what be more expect sing delightfully come now confess miriam seated there at piano might in truth have be carved out of marble so cold so perfectly calm be be sorry to disappoint sing song of kind at oh really mr darrow be smoothing out folio of music ca say that in face of surely must be yours 'it funny little way have got ' m crane frivolity music hall handed sheet over to miriam barton bit lip began to see at last what be after mr darrow proceeded really miss crane think deserved to be so deceived at hand might at least have told that be singer at class of entertainment there be dead silence barton looked dagger be in truth somewhat fearful that more of miriam past life than liked be on verge of discovery major dundas raised eyebrow gerald to conceal surprise hastily turned away with faint smile miriam took music looked coldly at mr darrow never sang song in public in life said most certainly have nothing to do with frivolity music hall name be yours think handwriting too how do explain that handwriting a say be mine name be not if must know song belonged to brother michael crane be very fond of frivolity music hall heard song there bought to sing be quite absurd in liking for class of thing really sang song of kind remarkably well so much so often used to say must end by becoming music hall singer happened to write name upon song added 'the frivolity music hall ' simply by way of joke little thought when did so that must be mean of placing in present position can only say that be one appreciate in least thus did mr darrow bombshell burst with little real result so little that lady must with difficulty conceal disappointment be ready to discredit miriam explanation altogether barton delighted at discomfiture put end to knew michael crane very well said indeed have often heard sing comic song though can not say have heard particular one so think owe miss crane very deep apology julia for most unpleasant way chose of putting thing miriam gave squire glance full of gratitude oh not at said be very natural mistake to make mean about name a for other thing hardly matter doe after have done in past can concern one now that be settled that be still respectable member of society if really wish to hear will sing without taking notice of effect of word miriam turned to key board commenced prelude of song have chosen a noble voice rolled through room hilda mr darrow exchanged glance of extreme significance little plot have failed have be ignominiously beaten knew mr darrow rapidly surveyed position in own mind decided to make best of very bad job so when miriam have finished song approached be afraid be very wrong miss crane tittered must admit be wholly excusable mistake have already said so mr darrow replied miriam coldly very excusable please think more about when party broke up gerald managed to get close to miriam to whisper something in ear knew face be familiar to said be at 'frivolity saw fear nothing from will keep secret chapter vii in wood having thus ignominiously failed in attempt to bring about miriam downfall mr darrow judged wise for time being at least to desist from further attempt in same direction in fact left governess severely alone realised that abortive experiment have resulted not only in failure of object that have utterly destroyed chance of obtaining from uncle barton little cheque be looming up so distinctly pleasantly on mental horizon when conceived little plan for undoing of miriam crane worse still realised that uncle barton now knew reason for proposed hospitality be long in taxing with administering in series of expressive period verbal chastisement a severe a mr darrow have have to swallow from for long past in vain tried to excuse be in interest of dear child protested plaintively surely must not have dicky entrusted to care of common music hall singer be so horribly low vulgar not to say worse miss crane be music hall singer what told be perfectly true for know brother well indeed be through heard of be young ne'er do well happens to be in employ of own solicitor hearing that sister be seeking employment a governess through agency of institute in kensington went there saw engaged think wisdom of choice be evident oh yes so far a teaching go certainly doe very well so must seeing be well paid for far too well paid in opinion happens to be one of many point upon opinion be not of vital importance julia pay lady what consider be due to for service fact of matter be cordially dislike miss crane be not true replied mr darrow say be that there be something queer about very queer for one thing dress absurdly above position doe seems to dress very plainly oh yes to eye doubt must excuse if in own word reply that 'cut ' of lady dress be not one of point upon opinion be of vital importance may take from that dress 'plain a think come from first class dressmaker cost large sum of money what want to know be how did pay for now of course barton knew very well seeing that have written cheque for said be if miss crane chooses to pay extravagant price for clothes be business either of yours of mine doe duty excellently well leaf absolutely cause for complaint unfortunately be one of people who need cause fault finding capacity be endless illimitable now accept miss crane a very satisfactory person consider to be in position send away without further ado can attend to dicky be not at to mr darrow mind in such circumstance must be forced to get governess chance be a knew well one vastly inferior to miriam not that boy educational welfare weighed with so much a fact that must have to pay for out of own pocket proceeding with extremely finite income must entail personal sacrifice for be in way inclined therefore did readily promise vow that must not again dig delve into past of miriam crane while declaring that be altogether satisfactory a teacher hazarded hope that if in time to come suspicion must prove to have be well founded uncle barton must not forget that have warned squire took for what considered be worth left without effort to disguise contempt felt for so far a be concerned thought miriam be safe for time being at event self interest be securest of possible dam to verbal torrent of irrepressible julia that widow lady still nurtured feeling of enmity for miriam be evident from hundred one petty way in contrived to show spite while miriam on part be altogether above taking notice of such trifle felt sting of nevertheless so day week month went by without open rupture of kind though with much silent fortitude on part of unhappy governess by time have doubt a to strength of feeling for gerald arkel saw continually sometimes in company of hilda marsh often alone of latter young lady further opportunity seemed only to confirm opinion be selfish willow altogether without heart with sharp swift instinct of woman in position hilda saw real state of affair despite miriam endeavour to avoid existence of spirit of rivalry between position being to undignified wholly detestable found being more le forced into young man must not see how thing be seemed in way to object on contrary although did not lessen attention to hilda continued to spend considerable amount of time with miriam just a pleased to phrase to to keep pot boiling have so wished miss marsh must probably have brought to open declaration at moment did not that for very excellent weighty reason that be not at certain in mind of two nephew uncle barton have determined upon making heir so for same reason when major dundas visited lesser thorpe indeed did rarely be kept thoroughly well in hand by young lady who have made up mind to be future mistress of very desirable property in truth gallant major be rapidly succumbing to charm of miriam crane feeling be only fanned more to vigour by absence of encouragement on part so daily wheel revolved in sight of whole parish not little to diversion to uncle barton most of convolution afforded greatest satisfaction not to say amusement pending time when must come full circle position a in gerald arkel found be tenable neither with dignity with degree of nobility then young man be not endowed even in minor degree with of estimable quality be in truth most material nonchalant of mortal rejoicing in possession of comely person invariably imperturbable disposition not infrequently miscalled sunny by many who knew have greatest aversion to work of kind in enjoyment of liberal income from uncle gave over to life wholly useless purposeless by mean above reproach once week on average ran down from town to manor house usually at barton expressed desire remained for two three day dividing favour between hilda miriam so weak invertebrate be character so horribly pronounced vanity that in heart hilda owned to active dislike of tolerated attention solely because ambition coupled with desire to free from present poverty stricken existence be with for time being paramount feeling on other hand miriam so far a young man be concerned appeared to have lost utterly noble woman a be with highest aim ever dominating life saw bad in man be in eye unfortunate weak misguided by virtue of very failing seemed only more to appeal to strength with how sure felt of must rise to highest thing longed unutterably for right to guide step turn in right direction with woman a hilda marsh squire be right be doomed for for reason only allowed gradually to be drawn into rivalry with other woman end to thinking justified mean conviction grew upon so became so absorbed in that be heedless completely of sense of degradation in own eye in other circumstance must have be first to feel a well a of fact that in parish have come to be looked upon a impudent adventuress aiming by fair mean by foul at capture of squire barton heir be very bitter time for friendless miriam since gerald whispered intimation that knew a woman have seen at frivolity music hall there have be no reference to matter between day after dinner party have left for town although have met almost immediately on return week later subject have be avoided by tacit mutual consent miriam knew that explanation must have to come without must never feel sure of respect that felt must have before else opportunity came three week later absolutely free unfettered statement made be only characteristic of on warm august afternoon have taken dicky into wood around manor house for one of reading from nature book there must be ample time knew for indoor teaching when short day long night of winter came upon so for present despite mother grumbling that boy be always idle miriam strove to keep out of door a much a possible that might acquire that bodily health vigour without must not hope for to thrive mentally of barton approved most highly more than ever did congratulate on success of miriam a governess indeed began to come upon very strongly that be altogether too good to be thrown away on wastrel such a gerald must allow nothing to interfere with design be obliged to confess to that miriam impressed more favourably than other member of sex with whom have come in contact hitherto in truth have thing be otherwise than be be quite possible that must have come to offer shrivelled body not particularly spotless soul for acceptance piece of glass picked up on waterloo bridge that night have proved to be diamond of first water too late though be to set in crown on dry grass under pine tree where ground be strewn with needle cone sat miriam whilst dicky scampered frolicked about climbed tree behaved generally after manner of kind day boy seemed full of vitality very joy of life strong sun drew out resinous odour of pine whole wood be filled with spicy fragrance through green branch miriam caught sight of blue sky overhead watched strong shaft of sun god smite into twilight heart of wood sat with book on lap drinking in pure air revelling in gambol of sunlight through tree though ever with watchful eye upon dicky a played be fairy wood miss crane be knight who seek lovely princess enchanted by magician have gone to sleep for hundred year so must shut eye please miriam laughed too now be fighting way through wood whist whist oh how strong branch be here be palace walk upstairs find room where beautiful princess be sleeping on purple bed kiss wake cried miriam catching boy in arm repaying kiss with dozen oh dicky how wish must sleep for hundred year replied boy seriously must not be with then think of long holiday must have dear want holiday without there must be jolly game like have now come on miss crane be going to be samson now slay philistine right dick boy here be one of come on be gerald arkel who spoke instant did so miriam noticed that voice be quite unlike there be always upon look of hereditary delicacy now there be dark circle under eye wore haggard weary expression unmistakably betokened sleepless night when saw who be dicky threw into arm with shout oh be so glad be cousin gerald come on can play at horse now dicky ca be not on for game morning go on being samson find more philistine to slaughter how be miss crane oh be very well thank mr arkel be not looking quite be ill flung on grass beside picked up fir cone began to pull to piece feel nearly dead said irritably suppose must expect to be playing pretty well through night worse luck dropped good deal too never can get on without sleep lately nerve have be playing old harry with then why in name of goodness do go on like be ruining health oh fellow must live enjoy somehow do call playing card into small hour shattering nerve not to speak of losing money enjoyment really be surprised mr arkel that man like especially when know constitution wo stand much must behave so foolishly be a if have sufficient mean gerald shook head sufficient mean that be just know nothing about mean for present yes uncle allows well suppose really must call sufficiency in future be in dark may make heir on other hand may not know how eccentric be may leave without penny be quite capable of be really why gamble so can put by something be independent of whim must be independent of anyone whim certainly hardly by gambling in case must know be fool game waiting for dead men shoe mr arkel why work make own fortune have great deal in favour oh come now interrupted gerald be pretty rough on have never be brought up to work soul must know how to go about besides why must when there be absolute need for one very good reason if for other must not be offended with what be going to say be one of men who be not fitted to be own master whilst be idle be bound to get into mischief work right down hard work must be salvation of well upon word suppose must have grub away in beastly office day well better honest grub than yes will say than dishonest butterfly know quite well what mean flushed sat up faced miss crane thought liked be be turn to flush now be very crimson face that looked at do like mr arkel said otherwise must not be speaking to like want to be able to think well of think well of then see how can expect to how can think well of man who be content to occupy position such a yours accept money from indeed be content to be wholly dependent upon man whom know dislike tolerate whim simply that may step into shoe be waiting for to vacate can not hold that be honourable employment mr arkel now mr gerald be wholly unaccustomed to order of treatment more especially at hand of comely young lady from have come from experience to expect treatment vastly more solicitous sympathetic be quite inclined to resent change from tactic upon have be reared so to speak more especially seeing that ill luck shattered nerve must of have be sufficient to enlist condolence of anyone certainly of one who pretended to liking for a miss miriam crane have just done such method of exhibiting liking spoiled child did not understand did not quite know what to say so deemed best to maintain for moment dignified silence might take what liked from that saw attitude felt hurt at undaunted went on will get plenty of people know to flatter to spoil mr arkel suppose think very objectionable person for speaking to like be doing have have bitter hard cruel life be deep down from experience that speak if knew there can say be that matter how difficult have be for have always stuck to tried to do duty know want to preach have not always be teaching hazarded gerald in hope of changing subject know have not did not tell that have seen at 'frivolity yes did mind have not breathed word of to soul be in chorus be in one of musical sketch be replied miriam calmly felt obliged in present position to deny point blank to mr darrow not for own sake altogether for sake of others besides although know well sort of capital mr darrow friend must make out of such incident be doing nothing to be ashamed of be earning honest living when must do so by other mean though be only ten shilling week however did manage to get into such strait may ask miss crane will tell father be captain in merchant marine be lost at sea leaving mother penniless thought that a have received good education if came to london must be able to find employment a governess found quite impossible a have one to speak for little by little fund dwindled away until in sheer desperation applied at music hall for work of description voice helped there managed to get engagement at 'frivolity be not there long for shortly after met old friend school teacher through whom obtained introduction to agency in kensington so came to be engaged by mr barton for dicky what have come through have suffered well be because have so suffered that speak to a do because somehow such acute trouble seems to impel one to warn anyone be interested in have be very plucky miss crane because have put honour first mr arkel one can not be plucky without in very depth of despair have always clung to though a say have suffered yes even to starvation thank god there be nothing to can look back with shame concealed from mr darrow what did because know kind of woman be because knew be justified in doing so for sake of others for sake of dear little fellow here who need whose little life be thought to care for to guide do think if be otherwise must stay beside mr arkel still even now if think right can tell mr darrow everything will gerald protested hotly be not quite black crow paint miss crane most heartily approve of course took must have done nothing harm round if have taken other one will ever hear word of from be be not man to think lightly of woman because have have to come through rough tumble of life bit have have hard fight for have won although have told pretty plainly that think precious little of present mode of life opinion of be if care to have that be very fine noble woman worth hundred julias day of week be sweet music to miriam ear believed in withal be in mind on equality with best on equality with hilda fenced off a have be by protective pale of home influence from harsh bitter reality of world how good be to know that have cut to quick to think that perhaps stood in mind on lower plane thus reassured from own lip felt must bear anything almost to lose indeed indeed care to have mr arkel said be not because urge to take up own fight in life that value good opinion le know be capable of good thing want to see achieve start handicapped a did have not sin of others to hamper stopped for with word came thought of barton diabolic scheme have one enemy worth counting who be that be weak love of pleasure dwarf else with at least can strive to put check on desire to indulge le then gradually rest will come if will only try will there be whole world of meaning in tone expression upon face be very beautiful eye met hers took hand will try miss crane said one have ever spoken to before a have done know that what say be true be brave woman a good kind a be brave will try deserve interest take in will succeed said miriam must ask of be to be worthy of chapter viii shorty in community family there be generally one person who be strong enough to play part of cuckoo in nest relative with temper who always get way bully of tribe despot of nation type be well known if not appreciated dominate with whom come in contact storm down opposition rule by sheer force of terror mr darrow have instinct will to be one of sort be brain of sufficient capacity will sufficiently dogged to permit attaining to such eminence parish have despot that in person of mr parsley vicar wife be domestic elizabeth crossed with zantippe sway be absolute mr parsley reverend augustine be tall imposing looking man who must surely have be bishop if look went to making of one be learned in dry a dust sort of way be at present engaged in writing book on hebrew syntax though of what use must be to world when be finished if ever did reach finite stage one knew least of however a mr parsley said labour served to keep out of mischief therefore encouraged in digging for jewish root for forty year have rev augustine be vicar of lesser thorpe so by right of possession wife have title to social throne in contrast to imposing husband be dry chip of woman tall marvellously lean with clacking tongue wonderful comprehensive vocabulary thoracic resonance almost a deep a vicar to hear two of discoursing be to listen to bell of st paul discoursing with big ben a rule on such occasion mr parsley part be closely analagous to of confidant to stage heroine be a much a to say threw out remark provocative of argument recollection scolding scandal mr parsley be notable gossip have history of parish for last forty year at tip of tongue memory be renowned tongue be dreaded not excepting mr barton bowed to sway not for considerable time after have become member of mr darrow household did miriam meet formidable lady for taking into head that be threatened with pulmonary disease mr parsley have insisted on starting for davos platz at moment notice on remaining there until felt quite sure dreaded visitor have given up claim to very imposing person for wonder left rev augustine behind enjoyed holiday prodigiously wrestling with letter jod while curate have two of meekest of kind attended to church service to other spiritual requirement of parish when shortly before christmas mr parsley returned immediately called at pine cottage to see new governess of whom have already heard most conflicting account then most wonderful thing happened took fancy to miriam more than mr parsley told miriam so forthwith enrolled under aegis of own tongue so that gossip suddenly ceased miriam be a much praised a formerly have be blamed for mr parsley approved of way in dicky education be being conducted congratulated mr darrow on having one sensible woman under roof first time there have be sense there to knowledge sniffed to expression of opinion widow did not dare to object lest worse must befall have too many weak spot in armour to allow of defying mr parsley one consequence of be that miriam visited vicarage frequently became a great favourite of rev augustine a be of wife told in characteristic dreamy way that in hebrew miriam meant strong one that be eminently suited to since be strong of body brain will dicky sometimes went with miriam played in mr parsley study where found many thing grateful to imaginative faculty for vicar be something of antiquarian have store of ancient coin still more ancient image wonderful reproduction of assyrian babylonian sculpture of child delighted in be always happiness for dicky to visit that wonder room week before christmas weather turned cold raw there have be slight fall of snow owing to absence of sunshine much of still lay on ground bitter wind swept inland from sea whistled through bare branch of tree so that wood around reverberated like harp string night be drawing in in vicarage parlour be snug cosy vicar be buried in book in study so mr parsley visitor have drawing room to be drinking tea before bright cheerful fire a listened to never failing verbal flow miriam threw in word occasionally because knew be expected of in order to show appreciation of word of wisdom showered upon with such reckless prodigality conversation to be more correct homily turned upon personality of mr barton be bad man said mr parsley shaking head at fire free thinker walker in darkness must not be too hard on indeed who must be hard upon lunatic do really call mr barton insane asked miriam why not think have ever be sane since have brain fever never knew that have have brain fever yes indeed thirty year ago be about woman rather woman believe wonder have heard about miriam judged best to assume entire ignorance of mr barton past do tell about mr parsley entreated well be not very complimentary story to sex dear there never did think much of woman who must exclaimed with sudden gusto when there be such fool a mr darrow minx like hilda marsh to be found in parish 'd give ducking stool if must hilda there be smiling cat for a deceitful a a weasel never help wretched mother think of nothing dressing up in frippery be never paid for think to secure idiot of gerald arkel by mincing sha will put stop to that have got more than enough with two of without letting marry produce more fool about mr barton asked miriam bringing good lady back to subject in hand be very curious to hear story of can soon tell to barton be younger son gay light hearted young fellow not unlike gerald arkel of course with ten time brain be engaged to marry pretty strange to say sensible girl who must doubt have made excellent wife one of sister arkel mother took upon to interfere so like with result that girl married somebody else well barton who be always nervous highly strung sort of creature went off head altogether be seriously bad for year while lived elder brother looked after unfortunately brother died barton came in for property then have to go own way pretty mess made of what reason have sister for interfering surely be very wrong mr parsley rubbed nose a be wont to do when puzzled of course be wrong dear never did get at exact truth there be great deal of talk about at time said one thing barton mr arkel be flora barton then held tongue may be sure have own opinion still have concluded mr parsley frowning at fire what be said miriam perhaps must not ask oh yes may dear be very discreet know mind telling well flora be very much in love with man named farren penniless scamp though of good family ended by eloping with barton friend followed brought back man went off to india be bribed to go be never be right in head since believe flora never forgave brother out of revenge made up disgraceful story about went straight with to girl with whom be in love miss cotton who without giving benefit of doubt sent back ring of course broke off engagement tried to see mother who be also prejudiced by flora story took away at once eventually girl married other man thing so preyed upon barton mind that got brain fever a told flora married be forced think to marry arkel have one son died barton never forgave added mr parsley with great emphasis be part never must make out what do mean asked miriam much interested why when arkel father died barton took nephew have educated in fact have allowed income ever since from account intends to make heir now said mr parsley looking directly at miriam why ask must vindictive creature like be so kind to son of sister whom detested miriam must have answered that question very quickly felt have right to betray squire confidence therefore contented with asking mr parsley in what particular way considered barton queer oh dear good lady lifted up hand have seen book in library of criminal literature 'd burn whole lot if must man have perfect mania for reading about murder robbery sort of

must never do to give way now must have to meet jabez yes fight otherwise must betray must sink back again into horrible life hoped have left for ever be with heavy heart tread that regained road began to make way home walked along lonely figure on lonely road for evening be so cold that labourer wife be not inclined to loiter out of door more than once have mind to turn back to vicarage tell whole truth to mr parsley seemed kindly disposed to indeed fond of perhaps must help then again mr parsley be at best hard woman reared upon relentless dogma of old testament be quite possible might spurn when came to hear story miriam have never confessed whole truth not even to mr barton although in early weak moment have said enough to enable to trace rest through strange creature have called shadow though barton knew still remained friend after what have learned from shorty concerning mother mandarin connection with squire felt must no longer trust might be best to risk confiding in mr parsley who be above suspicion possessed of much social power must not make up mind what be best what be right paused hesitated looked up for guidance to windy sky star be there moon across whose face flying cloud be driving in sweeping east wind there be guidance hint of what course must take thrown back on miriam wavered be lost walked on on on did not go back to mr parsley ala have turned back on fatal night how different must future have be have come to cross road although knew not have taken wrong one henceforth path be difficult tortuous weary a battling with conflicting thought miriam pressed on to pine cottage in face of wind seemed a if must drive back to vicarage mr parsley shadow a seemed emerged from out other shadow came towards then saw that be human tall gaunt figure clothed in black instantly instinctively knew be strange person whom barton called shadow nerve be so shaken by late interview at unexpected encounter must not withhold sharp cry who be what do want with panted then for first time heard voice deep sad thrilling voice once have be beautiful have be robbed of beauty who be doe not matter said slowly what want will know tell said miriam recovering from first alarm know then that overheard that lad need not fear secret lie safe in keeping know know of be who found out about jabez be be of jabez must speak with come here soon to see so shorty say then warn while there be yet time that doe not come for there be danger from whom asked miriam with white face from who life in yonder manor threatens to arrest jabez miriam drew closer to laid hand upon arm be in frightened whisper spoke for what for yes indeed for know will surely use knowledge dare not do miriam twisted hand together a if in pain will not not while obey put not hope in such false reasoning child be man relentless of devilish persistency why must seek to harm jabez know not give reason threatens be warned if must save jabez act while there be time farewell tell who be what know of mr barton what do know of barton man laughed fiercely there be that in laugh caused miriam to shiver what do know of more child than dare reveal more than for own sake dare to tell why not because hold in hollow of hand be nameless man must ever be slave in warning night even have run great risk must save soul from such fate a mine oh miriam shrank back be like jabez nameless man looked at through darkness seemed to miriam a though eye be luminous peering into face saw stamped upon look of abject misery look of soul damned past redemption past hope for moment looked at one then man stole quietly away melted a be into surrounding blackness miriam made attempt to stay read in eye look that have read in jabez knew what be why obeyed barton for quite moment after have left stood still clutching at heart a though there lurked cruel pain then with sigh turned homeward to only home knew before have taken many step rain began to fall in torrent in few minute high street of lesser thorpe be flooded with water furious wind wailing angry drove slanting spear of rain against form splashed ankle deep through water so quickly have flood risen miriam did not care there be that in heart made callous to surroundings impervious utterly to physical inconvenience when arrived at pine cottage mr darrow having heard gate clash came to door be aghast at change in governess good heaven miss crane what be matter nothing replied miriam tartly what must be matter have just come from vicarage have be caught in storm be mr darrow did not think be be convinced something serious be matter a inquiry direct indirect proved fruitless be forced to return to drawing room with curiosity only more keen because unsatisfied miriam ran up to room locking door sat down to write letter be letter of one page contained substance of shadow advice to jabez that must remain in london directed to care of mother mandarin sago lane lambeth having stamped sealed be about to take to post with hand upon key of door paused then sat down thought came upon overwhelmingly that longer must bear burden alone felt must confide in somebody must have sympathy of friendly soul again thought turned to mr parsley be inclined to go tell everything a have be before together barton nameless spy be working for end of jabez felt convinced of anything to save from indeed must suffer with downfall be hers too then yes must go unlocked door with letter under cloak ran downstairs in hall be confronted by mr darrow there be angry glitter in widow eye where be going miss crane to post letter can not servant post replied miriam curtly left house mr darrow peered after go out in fearful rain to post letter thought more mystery wo stand longer dicky dicky money money go day month when miriam returned mr darrow gave notice chapter x squire secret be not to be supposed that during time miriam have lost sight of gerald conversation in wood have have effect of drawing much more closely together so much so that there have grown upon arkel habit not only of going with trouble to miriam of taking rebuke ever so meekly whenever choose to mete out to so far only have thing progressed be at time in danger of falling in love with being a much a ever slave of hilda physical charm that young lady did not seem to be in least in hurry to bring matter to more definite conclusion between see can not yet be sure that gerald will really inherit mr barton money explained to mother once be certain of will find will propose quick enough 'd have done so dozen time already if have stopped what about major dundas thought never mind major dundas assure although of course like be quite crazy about mr darrow governess be welcome to for care solemn long nosed thing that be hilda suppose after mr barton must leave money to not to gerald then miss crane must have to take back seat be must have to put up with long nosed a be might not find so easy to get dear oh yes must tell mother that miss miriam with goodness be awfully in love with gerald know so even if major dundas did propose to must have a be know gerald be devoted to a be almost certain to inherit old b property be a must be a soon a be satisfied that there be longer about why then little affair will settle quite quickly nicely will see believe dear mother know what be doing mr marsh weary untidy a ever looked at guileless offspring of hers with something like surprise really hilda said feeling be delightfully adaptable be not often mr marsh indulged in sarcasm in fact be something of effort for daughter utter callousness brought out of can not understand that gerald major dundas must in capacity of future squire be equally able to take out of pig sty give something like decent life can not understand that man who can do be man for pretend to sentimental feeling at well be candid to at event hilda at time of life confess must like to see little more romance be terrible to hear such purely mercenary sentiment from girl of year be so like mother actually blame for doing credit to own teaching be what call so ridiculous unfair who have told for year face be fortune who have always drummed into that be duty to help family by making good match think know be true hilda be so poor wailed mr marsh be sure always wished that might marry someone loved only said must not do for to love poor man else what must become of can tell lie awake at night thinking of what must happen to if father died must have to go to workhouse for have saved penny life be not even insured then be that not more reason why on occasion at event must forego luxury of sentiment may thank star be a be married for love wept poor mr marsh with flush at recollection of what have be be very happy for time hilda cast eloquent glance at slatternly room at prematurely aged parent well must forgive mother if be result of marrying for love trust heart will continue to be governed by head after be a if did like gerald do very much be sure must be perfectly happy a wife then hope will marry hilda must like to know that have feeling for husband at same time well be able to help hope too may be soon dear for butcher bill have be running three month past know how be to pay meat very bad too a for grocer bill seems endless be sure never spare cut down expense to very lowest yet father be always grumbling say now ca do with one candle must have two number seem to get through be appalling be never contented job must grumble in house retorted hilda leaving mr marsh in lowest of spirit went upstairs to dress for gerald be due to take for walk recently that young man have shared time pretty equally between london lesser thorpe for one thing be deeply in love with hilda for found greatest possible comfort in miriam company so far be obliged to confess to that notwithstanding promise to miss crane have achieved nothing very definite even negatively speaking life in town continued pretty much a have be now then must put mild restraint upon such time be few far between result fleeting there be backbone in man entire absence of power of resolve at lesser thorpe be always repentant prodigal hilda be venus miriam minerva like paris did not hesitate to bestow apple on beauty rather than on wisdom choice be wholly characteristic of nature in life there be one path for path of dalliance of ease notwithstanding circumstance did not take hilda long to dress on occasion within ten minute be downstairs greeting gerald with smile a looked at thought how young good looking altogether desirable be be sure liked a well a must like man hilda marsh be willow girl vain girl on whole not bad girl with judicious bringing up might have turned out very respectable specimen of sex vain always since vanity be essence of being still woman of good instinct sense of duty in world a be have not be thus blessed position of beauty to family to be sold to highest bidder have done rest have be taught that mission in life be three fold to be careful of beauty a stock in trade to catch rich man with to help family when rich man have be caught in misguided slovenly household sordid commonplace existence there be nothing to appeal to in least degree to stimulate of other finer feeling might have lain dormant in what saw around gradually became reflected in nature a saw others do so did until came to look upon material satisfaction securing of a whole object of life even so a have be said be not wholly without redeeming quality after first burst of spite against miriam came to like even to appreciate high principle wholesale disdain of petty vanity of everyday existence personality be something altogether new to hilda something larger by far in human kind than have ever met before said little for girl that acknowledged to herself allowed better nature to have say even to point of dissociating from mr darrow in persecution of governess so be that mr darrow deprived of ally felt incumbent upon to carry on war with double energy have so quickly resulted in dismissal of miriam have hilda attitude continued a have be in beginning be probable that lady tactic must have be based more upon linked business long drawn out wherefrom not only must have obtained enjoyment must have saved much personal inconvenience be looking very sprightly to day mr arkel said hilda a walked down village have have good news best of news before tell let ask why always call mr arkel be name be yes surely might call gerald must be equally correct ever so much nicer know if must be quite correct replied cautious hilda still a make such point of mind if can remember well gerald what be joyful news uncle barton have decided to make heir hilda stopped although have more than half suspected to hear now that news have come felt something like shock sensation be by mean unpleasant on contrary brought with welcome sense of relief for now longer need keep young gentleman at arm length must accept with clear conscience unless power of foresight be very much at fault must be a affianced wife that must return from walk be very glad said have most heartfelt congratulation have mr barton actually made will not yet intends to make week will start new year thank god with mind at peace very much so must think suppose wo be long now before have to congratulate on happy event be glad for miss crane sake have have very bad time miss crane what on earth do mean simply that a mr gerald arkel miriam crane will at last say good bye to rough tumble of life of up to now seems to have have good deal hilda how can talk like know what feeling be for miss crane respect like sincerely have given cause to think anything else hilda know be true really mean know that for there be other woman in world must have guessed long ago guessed dear how must quite thought be devoted to miss crane to besides know be very wrong of to to care for be sure mr barton must disapprove most highly if knew what have got to do with very great deal imagine seeing that if like can revoke will day leave without penny uncle barton must be such beast be not so sure about have considerable capacity for being beast know how dislike if really do care gerald hilda know do be everything to tell that care for little that will be wife be quite quite sure mean what be saying that really thousand time yes love with whole soul be quite willing to take risk anything everything so long a have then will confess do care for gerald dropped eye very essence of humility acting be beyond praise calculated to deceive man very much le simple than gerald arkel dearest clasped in arm will be wife gerald must besides someone might see well let care do released sat down on stile same by gerald have met miriam for first time now do sit down do be sensible really must not behave like if engage to must be on certain condition make condition like darling so long a say 'yes very well then make two first be that be to keep engagement absolute secret until give leave to announce second be well second be must be just same before people well naturally if agree to first must agree to second confess dear like sort of thing besides ca see necessity for be ashamed of hope oh gerald dear goose what nonsense have told that uncle b will make awful fuss about that of must be enough for be quite capable of altering will in case must marry suppose indeed yes must hate to think have spoilt chance have be cause of losing five thousand year must allow that what say be common sense suppose be then hate common sense detest secret business at least dear when be alone will gerald proceeded to demonstrate how must be when be alone miss hilda be not inclined for such endearment be to mind trifle premature have own little game to play for present at event did not form part of hush said someone be coming listened light step fell upon frosty air be miriam face be flushed eye seemed unusually bright be walking very quickly saw corydon daphne on stile be quick to divine from expression on corydon face what have be happening waved hand smiled passed on hurriedly watched graceful figure dwindle in distance returned to discussion of with result that miss marsh went home a have fully intended to do under tacit engagement to future squire of lesser thorpe well content with afternoon work be engaged thought to herself be sure of be dismissed life here be at end for can not will not lend more to mr barton scheme must go back to jabez there be help for back to old life oh how horrible be how hard must swear to spare poor jabez will if refuse must force to walked on swiftly until reached house squire be at home in library sent in message be received at once looked more wrinkled if possible more evil than ever thought a croaked out welcome placed chair for anxious to get over came to point at once be surprised to see said barton eyebrow went up at once indeed be so very strange that must visit old man who have tried to show interest in perhaps will allow to say be delighted oh miriam waved hand think can dispense with compliment mr barton have better say at once have come here for definite reason to ask question by mean please hesitate well then be true that want to have jabez arrested let answer with who told did man call shadow barton frowned did indeed thought be more discreet must speak to well suppose do wish to have jabez arrested what then forbid to must scarcely believe ear forbid well really sneered so far can not congratulate on object of visit pray may ask how do intend to enforce prohibition for take be prepared rather think be to enforce by exposing to parish to world know mother mandarin sir therefore know be opium smoker worse said then waited chapter xi unmasked miriam accusation came on barton like bolt from blue for moment seemed utterly incapable of speech while of emotion showed not trace casting terrible look on woman who at once defied threatened rapidly counted chance against very brief survey of existing circumstance sufficed to assure that power to coerce be then ironical smile broke over withered face glanced at door window to assure that be closed subject under discussion be too dangerous one for to run risk in direction when spoke be with calmness irrelevance wo sit down dear said can talk a easily sitting a standing more easily perhaps a composed a miriam took chair prepared for encounter wo have jabez harmed repeated especially by who be wit a bad if not worse than be in moment of weakness extorted from real name thereby learned more about than intended must learn why must desire to have arrested man who whatever sin have never harmed know understand will stand between jabez will protect know too much about mr barton for to treat with impunity think know be gratitude said barton casting up eye drag from gutter feed clothe introduce to respectable society turn on what did did for own end retorted miriam coldly know well that be not from gutter there can be question of philanthropy on part of gratitude on mine do think counted on gratitude jade if did be wrong know that like rest of sex must turn on first time uneasy virtue touched conscience however enough of a say gave sufficient information to enable to obtain more did so may a well realise be in position to talk of force not not if harm jabez for be only through have hold over barton stroked chin looked at strangely be unpleasantly concise for woman changed tone miriam miriam be child after believe be told why man must have informed meant to harm jabez can not say unless be to make bad blood between to thwart scheme in be concerned will find out reason make pay a can make pay for interference may set mind at rest silly child have intention of molesting jabez if only because by doing so a say must lose hold over so long a do bidding jabez be safe of course if well wo talk about for present a to threatening to disclose secret vice be not afraid of threat to tell one here about must do good certainly must not do much harm if be to do anything so spiteful may tell must have jabez under lock key in week so long a harm will be a have be hitherto replied woman wearily be only from what shadow man gave to understand spoke a did will do can to meet wish marry gerald then miriam shook head said be prepared to do what must observed so far a mr arkel be concerned can hing may a well tell at once that be engaged to hilda marsh damn said barton without moving muscle how do know saw sitting together on stile near farmer bell one glance at be quite sufficient for be engaged mr barton will find that be right barton mused be not surprised said after pause have doubt be right fancy know too what have brought about last night told gerald intended to make heir have of course gone straight to hussy with by heaven what fool men be well be lost time in bringing to point well barton chuckled be not too late to remedy little mistake will just contrive to let miss marsh know have changed mind that for gerald intend to substitute john dundas fancy will see that will change hers pretty quickly too even if doe can make difference so far a be concerned a told before tell again there be chance of marrying mr arkel thought said feeling yes know that to cost doe not love will never never ask to be wife respect admires be sure like very much must have more than mr barton le let go please have tried to win gerald be not for think of must not see boy ruined with hilda for wife fortune ruin will be very complete a wife must save know must have three time brain of minx surely must manage enough mr barton will not hear what be going to say must save yes know must cried miriam tear rose in eye much a love god alone know how much be can not lower in eye in own can not do more mr barton salvation of gerald be in hand not in mine if hated mother who wronged be reason must ruin young man who have done harm be villainous mad horrible thing to do think so well must suffice for know what be doing if gerald after kindness care have shown love for if have be even ordinarily grateful might have spared be brainless selfish cold hearted fop who abuse even while eats meat be useless to man ruinous to woman so sooner drink debauch into early grave better will be for humanity in general brought down here thinking to give chance have thrown that away have pity for let will in favour of major dundas stand urged miriam gerald will not lose chance hilda be mere fortune hunter will throw over a soon a ever hears that be poor will hing of sort replied barton coldly will have money since be so blind can marry hilda since refuse to save can stand aside watch downfall tell be beyond power to marry even if wished to can not achieve impossible gerald future can not depend upon then if be to depend upon cruel future will be for by new will be leaving everything to mr barton be incarnate devil nothing of kind only very much man

if not to crime at least into contact with crime woman loved must have saved from sister stepped in to prevent salvation hated for hate son knowledge that will go headlong to ruin after death will be sweetest of dying thought miriam looked at old man with amazement a shook with fury impotent rage face became positively brutish eye glittered with insane light shook from head to foot a though seized with palsy say that be opium eater continued wrathfully be be for year be possessed of seven devil tore at in despair took to drug mother mandarin know well know many time have crept down foul lane in

by what have heard here be man with awful instinct of murder in blood possessed of hideous love of crime within lurked monster ravenous a tiger source of danger to around although knew not miriam wondered whether in truth might not already have followed prompting of mania whether hand be not even now stained with blood perchance have watched others do devil work at bidding while have stood aside thus kept within limit of law must not say must not guess silent aghast looked at sobbing man filled with instinct of terrible crime what life must have led what torture must have experienced be really sane insane must be allowed to go free not must not decide must only sit there fascinated a be by sight of human being abject impotent from abandonment to vile instinct have clamoured for

find in quiet country village even here seemed be to be pursued crushed by same ubiquitous fate mr darrow on reasonable ground hated gerald one man whose love now craved withheld that love from barton have in toil jabez be coming out of darkness to haunt trouble on side be surrounded with difficulty since mr darrow have given notice have almost in despair resolved to take what money be due to disappear to break off with past try once again to begin life afresh unhampered by sin of others very brief reflection showed that must not even do be too keenly conscious of duty to shirk responsibility to do must be with only to carry remorse in addition to other burden so resolved to abide where be face worst spirit be broken power of resistance to evil fortune well nigh gone mr darrow still held to intention of dismissing governess at same time have fancy that uncle barton must know anything about for present must inevitably mean direct conflict in be sure to be worsted must be well thought to put thing to miss crane from point of view there be need because be going to part that must do so in anger miss crane said frigidly for part be quite willing that thing must be just a be until go be necessary really that mr barton know anything about must only upset lead to unpleasantness round indeed might even hasten departure so think if be understand perfectly mr darrow interrupted miriam will say nothing to mr barton for present be quite willing to go must understand miss crane pursued widow egotistic tactless a ever must be mistress in own house approve of in many way admit that have fulfilled duty with discretion at same time confess like mystery with choose to surround there be mystery about mr darrow mr barton made such inquiry a thought necessary presume before engaged then what satisfies mr barton doe not satisfy find impossible to reconcile very mysterious behaviour with absence of mystery in life lock bedroom door write letter to mysterious people of whom know nothing be intimate far too intimate with mr barton for matter speak only for good if a suggest be to remain friendly until go think have better not speak at replied miriam coldly miss crane insolence have better come to end so think will observe mr darrow that hitherto have treated with scrupulous politeness demand same in return whether go stay be matter of complete indifference to decline absolutely to put up with impertinence from further interference with private affair complain to mr barton that behave properly to remain till end of month a wish think that leaf much room for misunderstanding mr darrow at least there be need to continue very undignified wrangling miriam with head in air walked out of room miss crane come back insist command screeched mr darrow like angry parrot miriam paid heed worsted one be constrained to take refuge in tear to be treated so in own house wept by one of lower order too bad woman red haired minx that be mr darrow expletive must not alter situation if turned out of house a must have dearly loved to do there must be trouble with uncle if on other hand kept for month must have to treat civilly since miss crane did not a put know place word place being construed by mr darrow to mean capacity for swallowing meekly a much of bullying bad temper a might choose to indulge in a for miriam showed kind of aptitude perforce have to make up mind to inevitable so went to bed dosed with wondrous mixture of combined bromide brooded over wrong be spiteful malicious woman with element of hysteria thrown in must freely have given year of life to do miriam injury for next few day kept cat like watch on possessed of trifle more brain power might have be dangerous a be inclined more to peculiar class of cantankerous neurotic female for whom ducking stool be surely designed meanwhile miriam anxiously awaited reply from jabez two day before christmas received dirty envelope containing even more dirty half sheet of paper be thrust into hand by mr darrow who noting particularly soiled appearance of immediately became suspicious on paper be scribbled curt announcement from writer that must be at lesser thorpe on christmas eve at ten o'clock miriam be to meet in churchyard at time a put will be worse for there be help for appointment must be kept though how be to manage to get out at hour did not know when night came be fine frosty although snow have be falling heavily during day decided to put bold face on about nine o'clock presented to mr darrow in hat cloak with permission said briefly be just going to run over see mr parsley why on earth must want to see mr parsley at hour well truth be have received very important letter from london want to consult felt half inclined to refuse remembering that mr parsley

thorpe on part have at finger end be worth knowing about everybody of account in not very extensive neighbourhood although be by manner of mean vidocq genial officer be intelligent highly so to present position have risen deservedly if not with rapidity brilliance in appearance be of ample figure of fresh complexion eye be miriam thought lightest blue eye have ever seen whole bearing be nothing if not military like most men who have very soft side to woman be apt to convey that much when first coming into contact with miriam therefore did not take long making up mind that with course must be one of complete frankness confessed weakness combined with such weapon must be confessed knew well how to use have hope of achieving success with mr inspector prince well miss crane what be can do for asked when door be closed upon have come to see about mr barton murder mr prince pleasant smile vanished from face gave place to expression of extreme officialdom indeed yes have something to tell perhaps will say must have told before mr barton niece mr darrow accuses of having inspired uncle murder miss crane surprise said inspector must mean that be accessory before fact very serious charge very serious exactly be why be here mr prince place unreservedly in hand be need hardly say a false charge a be malicious against such malice feel must protect felt that be proper person to come to mr darrow must tell hate have be for time a daresay be aware in house a governess to little boy not long since contrived to overhear conversation between friend of mine who came down from london to apply to for help actually followed to place where be to meet in hiding listened to what passed between so happened that friend spoke of mr barton in term must not have used be upon have made charge against may ask name of friend jabez miriam gave cursory glance round room jabez tracey added after pause now if inspector prince have be a clever a cleverest of kind must not have failed to notice glance of miriam having noticed to remark that name tracey be there in largeness of print upon list of voter hanging on wall a be noticed nothing of kind jabez tracey repeated well let hear of conversation please miss crane miriam complied readily suppressing nothing not even fact that jabez have threatened to knife barton must molest to do so must have be to make false move knew since mr darrow be sure to make feature of who be man asked inspector have never told to anyone will tell now said miriam in such tone that good inspector protective shell of professionalism be so far pierced a to permit of relaxing of facial muscle visibly be old playfellow of mine went on must tell be daughter of sea captain be brought up in little fishing village of brixham in devonshire jabez

help to go to america make fresh start there by appointment met a have told near church one evening gave money have twenty pound took gladly went saying that be leaving for america at once via liverpool since then have not seen heard of heard of replied miriam coolly at be not in least surprised for be most selfish ungrateful of men there be thing too mr darrow not content with accusation of murder say that induced man to steal mr barton will have heard of course that made will almost immediately before death that be nowhere to be found certainly be so miss crane excuse did mr barton know man think ever saw will be good enough to describe appearance be small slight very dark clean shaven eye be jet black be very shabbily dressed in suit of blue serge said be going to america by meant united state suppose yes on night saw left with expressed intention of joining steamer at liverpool next day rather strange be that did go by southampton since be so near ca say never struck have told everything mr prince exactly a happened because feel can trust look with accompanied word be altogether too convincing for very human inspector see how absolutely baseless spiteful accusation be went on what interest must possibly have in theft of poor mr barton will on contrary if only knew have very strong interest in opposite direction since believe contained legacy in favour what be miss crane mr barton be always very good to in fact well here miriam cast down eye in fact wished to marry 'gad wonder at miss may make so bold a to ask why refused be eccentric know did have lot of money age alone made quite impossible replied miriam be obliged to tell must not marry man did not love believe be in first instance that made think of in will told be only woman have ever

released boy submitted instead to fire of cross examination from look of relief on shorty face be quick to appreciate change not for one moment did major believe there be truth in accusation brought against cousin have high opinion of to be sure felt quite certain that must never stoop to act of kind besides even granting that sense of moral rectitude be sufficiently flexible to allow of such

parsley believe be really saw in southampton be true oh know what to say what will do do there be nothing for to do only if jabez be wise will clear out be see dear if be truth know ca condone must be got away be only chance in affair of kind past life must handicap greatly must forget must to god must well well must keep calm miriam dear be best must tell will hing hastily will see major dundas first only see position if boy persists in what say will have to be taken to police there be help for see seemed completely stunned by fresh blow mr parsley rose to go now miriam dear just turn thing quietly over in own mind must go before get later have lot of thing to do want very much to catch five o'clock there be nothing to worry about for moment only must act rightly circumspectly be know dear must not be one to bring more trouble upon want to lighten what exists now be silly there be dear girl then kissed hurried away from window miriam watched slopping through rain with vigorous stride skirt half way up to knee thought what good creature be almost only friend have in world almost because there be one other whom felt must trust with life must surely help now a have always be ready to help in past sick at heart returned to chair by fire meditated on new trouble threatened more thought more bewildered seemed to become knock at door roused must that girl ever learn to answer bell within five minute of being rung at last mind be put at rest for major looking very much be shown into room have come to see if will take pity on mr arkel said so far a to give morsel of dinner have taken what scotch call becunner at club of course will though fear will be little more than morsel replied miriam put hat coat in hall be so glad have come be sweet music to major ear noticed seemed nervous not quite nothing wrong hope said yes indeed very little right sighed miriam must tempt to begin pouring trouble into ear directly enter door trouble be mine mir oh know how good be be why hate to worry now come along sit down tell about not till after dinner will keep just that may know why look worried may tell that jabez have be here again afternoon oh same old errand suppose yes wanted money gave what must well that ended matter did dear mr arkel do wish 'd let deal with scamp of brother of yours see know about must all be afraid not even know about yes said dundas emphatically even to fact that be at moment wanted on charge of murder chapter x major point of view although for long miriam have felt convinced that major dundas knew considerably more about brother life than have intention of acquainting with force with drove home last word completely terrorised coming a did immediately on top of what mr parsley have told to mind conveyed only one meaning that brother be known now a murderer of mr barton a such must assuredly have to pay penalty of crime must not conceal alarm felt a leaned back in chair pale to lip throat seemed almost to close heart to stop with nervous dread with quick indrawn breath waited for next word be word of comfort mr arkel said fear have alarmed believe can trust in have just told knew year ago if did not have brother arrested then need not fear that will do so now be safe from for sake be puzzled must not have be then to murder of mr barton have referred after must not have known about year ago must have meant that other that terrible crime have so overshadowed life during year of consequence of to jabez have lived in daily dread took for granted that be so know know said can never thank for forbearance indeed charge against unfortunate brother be not one of murder be manslaughter dundas paused before replying be afraid said trifle drily that will find verdict of coroner jury leaf room for misunderstanding on point still there be of course chance that after time be six year ago remember may be mistaken do know fact of case major surely affair made great stir in regiment at time see brother have shown very soon after enlisting that be man of ungovernable temper amount of discipline seemed to have effect upon be punished again again for insubordination at last after punishment more than usually severe deserted for long time in spite of most careful search eluded capture when in end did find be in london be arrested by four men sergeant surrendered so quietly that sergeant foolishly omitted to handcuff hour be late street ill lighted attempted sergeant snatched bayonet from musket of one of men a did so crane closed with stabbed to heart then managed to get clean away whole affair suppose be work of few second chased a far a river be seen to throw in then appear to have abandoned have not since be heard of think be fact exactly be not mr arkel from one point of view yes jabez have always declared that sergeant tried to stab that snatched bayonet from in self defence only in struggle ensued sergeant be stabbed true act be defensive on jabez ' part not aggressive that really believe be truth in case of course must be manslaughter not murder brother naturally make out best possible case for evidence of men went to prove conclusively that act be deliberate at event funked trial coroner verdict be one of wilful murder yes know did be marvellous how escaped afterwards be afraid to give up how managed good swimmer a be to keep afloat in surging stream be always inexplicable to sheer force of despair suppose however did manage eventually found shelter at mother mandarin who be mother mandarin be old woman who keep opium den in lambeth name came to through having be orange seller at one time jabez have among other vice contracted that of opium smoking be good customer of hers consequently when rushed in soaking wet night told be in danger took in concealed for month remained there not even immediate neighbour knowing of presence be assumed be drowned district be supposed to have be thoroughly searched absolutely trace of be found be of same opinion until day saw here how did recognise by colour of eye hair more particularly by scar on forehead for while must not place though be positive knew man then suddenly flashed across identity of name with yours struck remember how startled be concluded of course from name that must be connection never dawned upon be brother can hardly describe to what felt when told can imagine what be to to have to tell know think of now have be very terrible very horrible worst of be fear there be more to come paled again looked up quickly be there something be keeping from if so must be kinder to tell can bear anything now think major appeared nervous ill at ease well mr arkel feel in one way ought to yet subject be so very painful for of for of surely know how feel yes yes tell what have in mind well then be very much inclined to think that brother killed uncle miriam remained perfectly calm have fully expected felt secure from what have said that for sake must take action what reason have for thinking perhaps be safer to call suspicion have really direct evidence only feel that between even on terrible topic absolute frankness be best admit that for long past have not be able to dissociate in mind fact of brother having be in lesser thorpe on christmas eve having be heard to threaten uncle from fact of old man having be murdered following night may say be pure coincidence that be mere conjecture on part based on most fallible of circumstantial evidence tell candidly that if have not be for must have sifted that thing to bottom long ago a be preferred to leave in hand of police what say be perfectly true too must rather spoke quite freely on subject horrible a be tell that from bottom of heart believe that jabez be guilty of crime there be thing must also tell mr parsley told before left to day that boy shorty have recently made certain confession in connection with mr barton murder amongst that saw jabez in library night in fact accuses jabez directly of murder even in face of that believe innocent dear mr arkel confess can not requires only least bit of evidence to confirm suspicion be glad told for be serious wo allow to alter for sake wo for sake must do almost anything say almost because there be just one thing can not do what do mean why see position if evidence get to police will mean immediate action on part of of smartest detective in london in fact everywhere additional particular of brother crime will be sent within month may be caught within month have to stand trial what happens then why in probability will transpire out of sheer spite at for bear love can tell will say how met at house how knowing well who be failed to give notice to authority a must have done for sake think then of position be in in fact of position be in god cried must not be must run risk must not consider oh if anything be to happen to through through if necessary must act at once must give up before fresh charge come first of think have better inquire little more closely into value of boy evidence be unscrupulous young liar a have already proved then will act accordingly meanwhile there be not least need for to alarm can safely leave whole affair in hand there be something else must like to tell if will be how in first instance came into contact with uncle know partly be through governess agency somehow have often thought there be something more something that must tell of own accord perhaps day yes answered simply be right there be have fully intended to tell friendship deserves friendship miriam let call that be best so before can tell exactly how came to meet with mr barton must tell of life before time will not be pleasant hearing for be terrible to even now to go back to for be time of darkness of deprivation of absolute want of most acute suffering physical mental looked at with whole world of pity in eye if pain so said yes be right must know replied simply will begin at beginning will judge of for father be a think once told sailor for many year be in command of ship trading between london china lived at deal then in own house with mother who be most sweet gentle woman devoted to ala

respective disposition be concerned there be good deal of similarity between major mr parsley be big in way of looking at more serious issue of life be inclined to ignore smaller one be generous steadfast strong consequently free confession of what past have be miriam have made to of in turn be attended with much same result in case strengthening rather than otherwise of belief in of love for

letter have made horribly uneasy have have little sleep night thinking about must only comfort with thought a further news have come by morning post probability be that jabez have got clear away while be thus thinking major made appearance have never be to see at hour of morning before must not repress exclamation of surprise on greeting directly saw face knew that something be wrong miriam came at once thought must rather hated idea of being alone god what be have happened know nothing tell know nothing have not seen paper what snatched up from side table where be lying still unfolded jabez be dead jabez dead poor jabez said must not be taken alive well be true to word something more took shorty with took shorty with major how horrible tell killed major took paper from read whole account

said producing got from poor boy last night be inexplicable now major read know that be inexplicable said of course be impossible to act upon why for two reason first because boy shorty be drowned consequently evidence must not be forthcoming even if be worth anything probably be secondly miriam because terrible a be for to attempt to clear brother must only be to make worse for let die let whole affair remain in oblivion a be will soon be forgotten see major be right poor jabez did not kill mr barton did not reply must not bear to hurt even in face of what have happened found difficult to remove suspicion have for long past occupied mind miriam take word for will never know truth personally speaking one desire be to keep whole matter in abeyance now that jabez be dead be more able to do that fact of absolute guilt innocence of uncle death need not weigh with a for man farren there be need for to charge if in ordinary course of thing prosecution come about suppose of necessity will be brought into failing that feel very unwilling to stir thing atmosphere of have become repellent to guilty not guilty may go scot free so far a be concerned think have better destroy that
