prettier than be ever must be since be impossible to learn anything definite from durban master beatrice be striving to posse soul in peace until seven o'clock at hour intended to meet vivian by witch oak there ask bluntly what have said done to make stepfather so furious having settled in own mind lay back in deep chair sipping coffee allowing thought to wander took back over five twenty year into life barren uneventful enough beatrice must have be happy for like oft quoted nation have history life beatrice have never known mother love according to alpenny who supplied information grudgingly enough mr hedge with one year old baby have married only to die within three month after ceremony then durban have taken charge of child since miser for monetary other reason must not engage nurse for two year old servant have tenderly cared for orphan be great pain to when alpenny placed little beatrice in charge of brighton lady called miss willow spinster be in reduced circumstance apparently under alpenny thumb a regard money matter received child unwillingly enough although feared to disobey tyrant who must make thing disagreeable for later grew to love charge behaved towards orphan with

regarded a encumbrance visited miss willow more rarely even when did took scant notice of tall beautiful girl who have be instructed to call father did unwillingly enough a there be always antagonism between cold nature of one warm humanity of other when miss willow died girl be ill pleased to take up abode at camp in close association with man mistrusted disliked although must assign tangible reason for feeling of abhorrence possessed how well beatrice remembered first sight of place be then neglected wilderness recoiled at sight of such uncivilised surroundings alpenny slept in one carriage durban in two other carriage be used a counting house kitchen while remaining three be in rusty ruinous state almost buried in rank grass coarse vegetation be wet day too when girl grieving for dear friend came to view future home so that everything be dripping with moisture outlook be infinitely dreary must have cried at idea of living amidst such desolation courage be too high pride too great to admit of indulging in such futile lamentation before cold eyed usurer durban always sympathetic watchful be quick to see grief although tried to conceal at once began to suggest interesting work so that must have le time to eat heart out in wilderness deftly pointed out how must make place paradise how nature must solace sorrow of girl for loss of guardian having obtained unwilling consent from alpenny kind hearted servant painted repaired ruined carriage turning one into dainty bedroom made remaining two into parlour dining room in way sufficient money be extorted from alpenny to admit of cheap furnishing beatrice more contented came to take up abode in strange locality be now twenty five for three year have dwelt in hermitage garden afforded endless delight

planned paradise with aid smooth lawn bed of brilliant blossom pond with magnificent water lily many winding path mossy nook afforded cool retreat on hot day be work of durban millionaire must have created more delightful spot than have two by indefatigable industry eye for picturesque portion of wood beatrice left to nature so that uncultured look might enhance civilised appearance of blossom contrast be really charming that jarvis alpenny jealously kept gate closed camp must have become show place a everyone in neighbourhood have heard of rare floral beauty not few young men have heard of beauty still more rare desirable be at point beatrice began to think of vivian sister who be only friend possessed jerry certainly might be included seeing that be constant visitor at convent grange future husband of dinah paslow there be one else in parish of hurstable with whom cared to exchange friendly word have met mr mr snow once twice although vicar be willing enough to speak with so

never said kind word yet mr snow called religious woman like many self styled christian read own meaning into gospel commandment declined to obey when clashed with own snobbish sordid nature beatrice hedge according to mr snow be beyond social pale seeing that father be money lender so paid attention to many of parishioner followed example be to be feared that lady follower quite forgot that one of apostle be tax gatherer publican beatrice cared very little for boycotting be accustomed to lonely life indeed preferred for found conversation of mr snow friend extremely wearisome a be bound to be from aggressive egotism self laudation have book to read garden to tend vivian to think of sometimes must indulge in visit to convent grange home of paslows dinah liked vivian loved be certain in own mind that vivian loved of strange to say must not be sure by reason of attitude be dubious attitude at time must pay marked attention frequently seemed to be on verge of proposal then must draw back shun society turn a chilly a arctic winter for known reason beatrice fancied that might be relationship to alpenny caused young gentleman of old descent to draw back then again felt sure that be above mean spirit moreover might be excuse vivian be impoverished country squire might hesitate to conduct wife to half ruinous grange have only known how gladly beatrice must have shared bread cheese when sweetened by kiss surely a often thought must have proposed something kept silent seeing how changed from hot to cold in wooing if must be called so have too much pride to inveigle into making plain statement such a heart ear longed to hear position be odd uncomfortable man woman must not mistake other feeling yet man who must have arranged matter on reasonable basis refused to open mouth be not woman right to usurp privilege of stronger sex by breaking ice appointed meeting for night puzzled more than ever never before have met save at grange at camp more often than not in presence of dinah now asked to talk with in lonely spot under ill omened tree where be locally reported witch of old day have held satanic revel in answer to request have nodded being taken by surprise now began to question propriety of proposed action be modest girl occupied difficult position so be scarcely thing to meet young gentleman on romantic summer night under romantic tree curiosity be extremely strong wished to know why alpenny have grown so white have appeared so terrified when paslow pronounced four mysterious word be black patch why did produce such effect on usurer who a rule feared nothing loss of money vivian must explain since have brought about miser terror therefore did beatrice make up mind to keep appointment smiled to think what mr snow must say did that severe lady know of bold step be taking more coffee said voice at door looked up to see smiling servant thank durban replied absently setting down empty cup then seeing that be about to withdraw recalled scattered thought made pause with question what be black patch asked beatrice facing round to observe man dark face durban spread out hand in quite foreign way banished emotion from dark feature know father appeared to be startled by word did missy did do know reason be not in father confidence missy be strange seeing that have be with for over twenty year durban for twenty four year missy never told

after pause there be nothing to know missy married master died be then about year old yes missy be twenty five now have be with mr alpenny for four twenty year so seems durban that first came here

be to know missy be very little have never asked about before why do question now beatrice mused hardly know confessed suppose mr paslow remark about black patch may be made ask now mr alpenny be afraid when mr paslow spoke so said before missy a replied know reason at be simply servant friend said beatrice extending hand durban face lighted up with passionate devotion dark eye blazed with light falling on one knee imprinted reverential kiss on small white hand love with heart missy love a father a mother a great god do love dear mistress then will help have to ask obey said durban simply rose to foot with light bound strangely out of keeping with stout person what must have key of little gate durban stared for beatrice be making very serious request there be two gate to camp large one opening on to lane smaller one hidden in corner of wall through admittance must be gained to narrow woodland path arrived after devious winding at cross road alpenny client usually entered from lane be always dismissed through so to speak secret path miser kept key of small gate indeed of larger one also so that if one have to go out come in alpenny have to be applied to be therefore easy matter for durban to oblige young mistress why do want key missy beatrice did not answer at once suddenly crossed mind that if acknowledged bow intended to question vivian about black patch that durban must make difficulty over obtaining key after admission that knew nothing have reason to think that must raise objection thought came uninvited obeyed wishing to tell truth yet keep durban in dark a to real errand determined to go to grange see dinah then must meet vivian there must question at leisure miss paslow be engaged said suddenly durban nodded grinned to young mr snow replied saw well want to go to convent grange evening at six to see miss paslow talk over matter durban shook head master be angry with mr paslow for reason will not let go besides at night durban shook head

coloured think so be not sure be faint reply a cast down eye durban came step nearer doe love one else asked beatrice raised head sharply sent flaming glance towards questioner what do mean if doe love doe love one else persisted durban beatrice twisted hand be sure love one else cried passionately can see in eye can read in face yet yet oh broke off unwilling to remark upon paslow strange wavering wooing to servant even though servant be one who must readily have died to save moment pain do think love one else asked evasively durban eye be fixed on face have reason to think so if love missy can never be fond of other woman if play false missy durban face grew grim darker than ever have dog who can bite said beatrice alarmed since durban must make unpleasant on occasion from look on face feared for vivian love only be sure of that man face cleared then will go to grange evening can see if stepfather hate durban will place obstacle in way must mr paslow ask to marry if asks to be wife will marry missy father will say nothing be sure when mr alpenny take idea into head will take idea of stopping marriage missy will be happy promised that promised who real father said durban

be evidently lie so glibly did slip out because must be sorry to leave to starve will not starve be well educated can teach at worst can become nursery governess be companion better marry major ruck be foolish of to ask if marry will be ruined will be killed broke off suddenly mean that who must kill poor old man such a be voice leaped octave must marry husband chose for chose for ah miser be shaking with rage be vivian paslow denial can see be man penniless scoundrel who be at mercy dare to speak of like flamed out beatrice a to marrying have not asked yet never will if can stop know how to do so oh yes do will not dare to go against can ruin at moment there came sharp rap at door made alpenny face turn white lip turn blue who be there telegram said voice of durban alpenny with smothered ejaculation of pleasure went to open door a did so beatrice noticed on wall near desk two key one large one small little one knew to be key of postern gate without hesitation took down slipped into pocket a alpenny turned round with telegram very pleasant expression of countenance felt that must at least be able to see vivian paslow on evening without arousing suspicion of stepfather be unlikely that one must come that night must not miss key must get durban to replace next day a thought flashed into mind saw face of servant at door looked puzzled probably be because beheld in sanctum of master hitherto forbidden ground to to next moment alpenny have closed door durban went away telegram be from major ruck said alpenny be coming down on saturday so be ready to receive will leave place if come wo will wait see accept also if will make thing hot for vivian paslow be a beatrice conceived game of bluff so replied boldly enough mr paslow be able to look after decline to speak to major ruck whosoever may be even to see saturday saturday said alpenny coldly opened door now can go if leave camp if refuse ruck a husband vivian paslow will reap reward of crime pushed out locking door after with sharp click crime beatrice stood in sunlight stunned dazed what did alpenny mean what crime must man loved have committed almost before must collect thought felt light touch on shoulder turned to behold durban be master in counting house afternoon asked servant must know missy a parlour be opposite yes be replied with effort never saw come out durban wrinkled dark brow then how did send telegram to have just now have answer demanded how do know that wire be answer durban reply be prepaid missy how did master do beatrice be equally puzzled alpenny have not be away from camp afternoon yet have contrived to send telegram prepay reply chapter iv seen in lightning be truly mystery so far a beatrice knew there be two way of getting out of camp by large gate smaller one yet in parlour carriage facing alpenny counting house have not seen emerge have durban busy in kitchen door of commanded view of postern beheld master depart telegraph office be at railway station three mile away there be one in camp save durban young mistress to send with wire yet wire have be sent reply have be received beatrice ventured explanation perhaps father sent telegram yesterday missy took none master did not leave place telegram have be sent from here for last month be there third way out durban not that know of missy yet what durban must have said in way of explanation be impossible to say for at moment querulous voice of alpenny be heard calling snappishly durban hastened to door of counting house be opened so that must speak with master be not admitted within beatrice retired to bedroom carriage be near parlour have only be there few minute when durban came over with crest fallen face must put off going to convent grange missy said rapidly master wish to go to town be writing letter have to take up at once will catch six train very well durban can wait servant looked hesitated before must speak again mr alpenny interrupted appearing at door of dungeon waved letter come at once cried lose time what do mean by chattering there durban gave beatrice significant look hastened away in ten minute have left camp by great gate be on way to railway station alpenny saw off premise then crossed over to stepdaughter what be saying to durban asked suspiciously mean what be durban saying to replied quietly can surely guess be saying that wished to go to town there be need of to tell business grumbled miser looking ill tempered what be doing evening have suspicion of intention beatrice thought not question be put in snarling way simply a judged to show authority intend to read answered simply perhaps will take walk in ground ostensibly meant better not warned usurer looking up cloud be gathering be sure there will be storm very well be indifferent reply although wondered if have missed key of smaller gate will come say good night to a usual at ten alpenny nodded in absent way walked into counting house with hand behind form more bent than usual beatrice watched cross smooth sward then went to sit down in parlour meditate in way must scarcely define scented mystery episode of telegram hasty departure of durban proposal of marriage thing hinted a thought at scheme against peace of mind then again word of vivian paslow be indeed mysterious be anxious to know what meant finally hint alpenny have given a to vivian having committed crime alarmed girl felt that alpenny be trying to inveigle paslow into trap from word be plain that must stop at nothing to prevent young man declaring passion felt for girl also from hint must seem that miser held a indeed have plainly stated vivian in hollow of hand thought made beatrice very uncomfortable more so a never before have mystery come into life hitherto have be serene uneventful one day being exactly same a with visit of vivian on afternoon everything have changed for since have heard mysterious word alpenny have not be in queer way have forwarded telegram in hurry have sent durban to london have not done for month past undoubtedly something sinister be in wind beatrice shivered with vague apprehension of dread certainly might have be weather made feel so ill at ease for hot day have ended in even hotter evening air be close sky be clouded there be not breath of wind to stir leaf of surrounding tree ever again flicker of lightning must leap across sky summer lightning portended storm rain beatrice trying to breathe freely in suffocating air wished that storm must come to clear atmosphere there be electricity in dry air felt a uncomfortable a cat have hair smoothed wrong way on such night a must lady macbeth have received duncan nature hinted at repetition of storm took place when guileless king be done to death in shamble beatrice must not rest within door put on hat draped long black cloak over white dress attired thus walked up down on dry grass trying to compose around gloomed girdle of tree without even leaf stirring colour of flower be vague in hot twilight white form of seven railway carriage stood here there like tomb in cemetery a lingered near sundial cast look upward at down rose vast shadowy to be defined clearly against clear sky foot of be stone throw away from camp almost be in mind to climb height in order to get breath of fresh air here in hollow embosomed in wood felt stifling up there surely sweet fresh wind must be blowing full of moisture from channel then thought of possible walk recalled to remembrance of appointment intended to keep even though durban have gone away key be in pocket must slip out of small gate for hour get back again without alpenny being wiser already light gleamed from solitary window of dungeon a have gleamed ever since must remember when darkness came on behind discoloured blind miser laboured at book counted gain so far a knew money be banked invested kept gold in dungeon perhaps feared robbery really be remarkable that seeing be supposed to be millionaire camp have never be marked by fraternity of london thief visit there must surely have proved successful if tale of alpenny be to be believed perhaps thief have heard a miser have vaguely hinted of cleverness in keeping specie in retirement be a may alpenny year have never hinted at possible burglary after glance at down at alpenny lighted window behind must sit until midnight beatrice entered one of winding path in little wood took way to gate large gate be locked alpenny alone possessed key must open smaller gate now proceeded to do so lock be freshly oiled postern swung open noiselessly standing on threshold within camp beatrice paused for moment feeling seemed to hold back into mind flashed sudden thought that if went out must leave behind not only camp old serene life be like crossing rubicon with impatient ejaculation at own weakness shook passed out leaving gate locked behind then stole through glimmering wood fully committed to adventure a did so distant growl of thunder seemed to agitated mind like voice of angel thrusting out of paradise truly have never before felt in strange mood by narrow path gained lane here light be trifle stronger although be rapidly dying out of hot close sky be close upon half past six so beatrice knew that if walked quickly must arrive at witch oak almost at time appointed owing to late hour of starting have quite given up idea of going to convent grange be two mile away must meet vivian a now arranged in own mind at witch oak must ask for explanation when gave must return rapidly to camp escorted by then slipping in must be able to say good night to alpenny at ten o'clock go to bed for moment wondered if durban must return that night stop in town if came back must be angry if found that have left camp unattended in twilight must be in bed even if durban did return then must decide whether to tell not also chance be that a have gone to town so late must remain there till next morning to execute alpenny business whatever might be passing along lane beatrice have to run by great gate be locked securely in twilight thought saw small figure crouching before in semi darkness must not be certain however sight of figure if figure be troubled very little probably be that of tramp a there be many in weald of sussex if tramp be waiting at gate in hope of getting crust penny from miser must be woefully disappointed beatrice passing swiftly hardly gave matter thought sped rapidly along under deep shadow of tree along white dusty lane between wilted hedge dry with summer heat quarter of mile brought to side path down went calmly congratulating that have met neither tramp neighbour on road path wound deviously through ancient tree at length emerged into rather large glade in centre of be pond green with duckweed over spread branch of witch oak old old tree must have be growing in time of druid have probably played part in mystic rite fitful moonlight gleamed occasionally on a planet showed haggard face under tree beatrice saw tall figure waiting patiently crossed glade in moonlight cloud swept over face of orb a beatrice paused under oak then again came growl of distant thunder a if in warning knew must come said paslow stepping forward for moment seemed a though must take in arm in darkness cheek of girl flushed stepped lightly aside evading clasp heart told to throw into strong arm be protected for ever from coming storm of life sense of modesty prevented such speedy surrender when spoke voice be steady cool there be time to be lost began hurriedly in middle of thing yes have come said quickly because want to know meaning of word used to father to day know what mean confessed paslow calmly then why did use received hint to do so from whom ca tell that miss hedge beatrice asked to meet here so that one must interrupt conversation if came to grange dinah must have prevented speaking now that mr alpenny be angry with can not come to camp must forgive for having asked to meet here at hour in so ill omened spot have something to say to must be said at once what be heart beat rapidly a spoke for although must not see face in darkness guessed from tone of voice that be about to say desired to hear ca guess came step nearer spoke softly beatrice feeling strange a be natural considering circumstance laughed in embarrassed manner how can guess because must have seen what meant in eye beatrice want to be wife heart beat loudly a though must give vivian answer without speech understand said abruptly surely must have seen oh yes saw interrupted rapidly saw that loved also saw that held back from asking to marry have reason said after pause that reason be now removed can ask a do with heart soul to be wife dearest love can believe that swear breathed passionately reason paslow hesitated be connected with money confessed at last father rather stepfather have mortgage on nearly whole of property have lately inherited small sum of money went to day to ask mr alpenny to arrange about paying off part of mortgage accused of wishing to rob why when desired to pay off mortgage ca say think vivian hesitated think that wish to get possession of grange reason ca tell moment offered to pay money burst out into rage said that wanted to rob then warned a to something have heard against in london what be that asked in startled tone dare not tell just now be connected with black patch not that know of what do know of black patch know nothing heard mentioned whatever be for first time to day by effect on mr alpenny be so strange that wish to know what black patch mean know said vivian earnestly listen dear girl other night found on desk scrap of paper on be written rather must say printed for person who wrote printed letter alpenny object say remember black patch beatrice listened bewildered what doe mean ca say when driven into corner by language used very word on scrap of paper saw effect be strange said beatrice then remembering what miser have said to grasped lover arm vivian told that have committed crime what liar have committed crime save have indulged in usual folly of young man whose parent died before must guide properly what doe mean ca say think wished to make mistrust can guess for asked to day if must marry refused raged worse than ever be then that turned out of counting house well saw what happened suppose want to marry someone else yes told so to day major ruck who be demanded paslow in tone of anger know major simon ruck retired army officer with fine fortune who be fifty year of age here there came flash of blue lightning then loud crash of thunder afterwards strong wind hurtled towards bearing on wing drenching rain vivian be startled caught beatrice to breast in darkness darling will marry asked although be scarcely mistress yet of emotion in storm gloom before must answer pent up feeling of day found relief in burst of hysterical tear pulling out handkerchief pressed to eye at moment felt key entangled in handkerchief fall out oh gasped key have fallen out of pocket will find paslow dropped on to grass now wet while rain came down in torrent have said wondering at queer disconnected wooing rose with key in hand dear let stand further under tree then can talk beatrice be quite unstrung by time must go home at once be late father ah who be that flash after flash of lightning blue vivid illuminated haunted tree a though once again witch be holding demoniac revel short distance away stood small man of lover must see feature in fitful illumination vivian with cry of anger ran straight towards figure disappeared tale of spectre said to haunt tree occurred to mind of beatrice unstrung not mistress of left oak hurried across glade lightning be flashing incessantly thunder roared like artillery while steady rain spattered through tree top trying to find path led to lane beatrice ran on fancied heard voice of paslow shouting again pealed thunder to drown what said losing head small wonder so terrific be storm beatrice scrambled on through many path finally when there came unusually vivid flash sank with cry of terror under bush fainted on streaming ground how long remained unconscious did not know when did regain sens mighty wind be blowing through wood bending stoutest tree like sapling through swaying bough girl must see flicker of lightning racing across sky now then boomed sullen thunder loud menacing with effort gathered aching limb together staggered forward blindly through wood must not tell what hour be guess where be going by miracle managed to arrive at lane even then did not recognise where be ran blindly along in hope of finding camp there be sign of vivian of man who have be watching under witch oak around be roaring darkness laced with vivid lightning alive with furious rain wind like demented creature beatrice sped along in mud slush kilting up petticoat to run faster ever overhead screamed storm while wild wind tore buffeted tormented tree bitterly regretted having kept appointment have learned little save vivian loved have known long ago now have lost key paslow possessed since have not given back to before ran after watcher so how be to re enter jealously guarded camp alpenny must know that have be out that have met vivian there must be great trouble thought made head of girl reel a ran along blind breathless then came several flash before unexpectedly beheld gate of camp be wide open without thinking ran in at once only too thankful to arrive home a passed post sprang unseeingly into arm of man with cry tore away stared in flash of lightning saw that be tall lean clothed in black sight made shriek over left eye wore black patch then darkness closed down heard brush past into gloom running swiftly out of gate closed after heard click in way managed to scramble across wet lawn to own bedroom carriage a dropped on threshold saw that light in counting house be extinguished what did mean asked who be tall man with dark patch over left eye chapter v mr snow discovery after few minute lying on threshold of carriage bedroom with rain beating upon soaking dress beatrice rose with effort opened door be never locked a one must be likely to enter match candle be on table by bed where have left soon have light beside candlestick lay folded piece of paper opening read line two in alpenny crabbed handwriting find have gone out be going also will not be back for three day durban will return to morrow look after there be signature of course recognised calligraphy easily a have distinctive character of own content of note rather surprised girl in first place alpenny made remark a to having taken key in second be strange that must depart thus unexpectedly leaving camp absolutely unguarded even by dog beatrice knew well enough that stepfather frequently went away on business at time very unexpectedly have never known to take so hasty departure however after glance at note determined to go to bed being too weary to think of anything too weary even to reflect that be alone in lonely camp that gate have be open when arrived memory of stranger with black patch over eye certainly made lock door see that window be well fastened when have accomplished for own safety have only sufficient strength remaining to throw off wet clothes get into bed there speedily fell into deep dreamless sleep while storm raged louder than ever last thought be hope that vivian have reached grange in safety when awoke next morning be ten a tiny cuckoo clock on wall told sun be streaming in through chink of window shutter still felt weary limb ached trifle for moment so must not think how came to be so tired then memory of have happened rushed in on brain sprang from bed to open door window in minute sunlight be pouring cheerfully into bedroom beatrice be rapidly dressed feeling hungry yet at same time anxious much need have to be stepfather knew that have gone out must have known that have taken key of smaller gate for must immediately look must certainly make most unpleasant anticipated bad quarter of hour when returned also vivian might have got into trouble with man who have watched meet under witch oak then again gate of camp have be open when returned stranger have left place hurriedly thing be very strange disquieting beatrice ardently wished that durban be back so that might speak to be reassured be probable that vivian must come to camp that morning in order to learn if have arrived safely then must renew interrupted conversation come to understanding interview with paslow perplexed beatrice when thought over vivian talk have be disjointed have given satisfaction answering question in vague manner that must have proposed at so awkward moment in so awkward manner also puzzled girl from what must recall of scrappy conversation have be like one in nightmare indeed whole episode be far removed from commonplace meeting place under ill omened tree few hurried word rush of vivian towards strange man then own headlong flight through damp dark wood thought made very uncomfortable be more like romance than real life beatrice did not care for such sensational event when dressed said prayer felt more composed then stepped out into broad bright sunshine after storm everything looked fresh vividly green world have newly washed look air seemed to be filled with vital energy a though be indeed breath of life beatrice soon saw evidence of storm fury huge bough be stripped from tree round camp flower bed presented draggled appearance sundial have be blown down for rest everything looked same at usual when glanced at dungeon saw that door be closed blind be down although latter be trifle askew beatrice must have gratified curiosity by looking into counting house through twisted blind have seen sufficient of on previous day felt more inclined to eat than to waste time peering into alpenny sanctum with idea of getting breakfast went to kitchen speedily have fire alight durban never locked door of kitchen carriage so there be difficulty in entering beatrice found plenty of food in cupboard made strong coffee appetising dish of bacon egg be too much trouble to take food to dining car so spread cloth on kitchen table made very good meal when have finished washed dish put away then went out again feeling much better sign of fatigue disappeared from young elastic frame for evidence of storm must have thought past event of night of dream to pas time beatrice swept out bedroom made bed then attended to garden now then must glance at gate expecting vivian paslow must enter by twelve o'clock have not come felt very disappointed then began to feel alarmed what if have met man have fought with what if man have hurt asked question half determined to go over to convent grange in order to get answer did not wish to leave camp until durban came back since alpenny be absent still desire to hear see paslow be overwhelming be just about to yield to curiosity leave camp to look after when heard rapid vibration of electric bell knew that someone be at gate in moment be flying across lawn heart beating colour rising vivian vivian sang heart threw open gate be still unlocked to surprise beheld outside le person than mr snow vicar wife looked more amiable than usual le grim be not very tall be dressed in dull slate coloured garment very ugly inexpensive likely to wear well straw hat trimmed with ribbon of same sad hue surmounted sharp thin face be that of miser specie hard sour mr snow have never be pretty woman never agreeable one a faced beatrice with what be meant to be smile looked like disappointed spinster yet be wife of vicar mother of jerry so certainly must have looked more pleasant mr snow be woman who took life hard made hard for others also if must not enjoy be determined that one else must whatever sin vicar have committed if poor man be bitterly punished by having household fairy at fireside mr snow gasped beatrice who be immensely astonished a well might be seeing that vicaress have never before deigned to pay camp visit yes dear miss hedge said lady with suavity be far from feeling a girl fresh beauty annoyed be doubt surprised to see have come to see mr alpenny a husband richest parishioner last night storm have damaged spire of church so have started out at once to collect subscription for repair there be nothing like taking time by forelock miss hedge father be out said beatrice coldly will not be back for few day then can ask mr snow may not put down for trifle have money replied beatrice annoyed by greed persistence of visitor will come in did not wish to invite lady in mr snow showed so very plainly that intended to enter beatrice must do le in silence led way to snow parlour vicar wife be presently seated on linen covered sofa glancing with sharp eye round pretty place need hardly be said that glanced with inward disapproval outward praise wanted money for spire therefore have to be polite did not withhold from inwardly finding fault must most charming place said mr snow still trying to make agreeable be glad think so replied beatrice wondering why unexpected visitor be so very polite mindful of mr snow past behaviour girl must not think that vicaress be making thus pleasant in order to get money for spire besides spire have only be damaged on previous night seemed strange that woman must begin to hunt for subscription for restoration already beatrice came to conclusion very rightly that mr snow have motive in paying attention to girl have so severely snubbed have intended to call ever so many time went on mr snow not to be daunted by frosty manner of hostess husband poor man be not very well have to attend to great deal of parish work there be need to apologise mr snow see very few people see be really charming gushed vicaress of course allude to mr miss paslow be friend of mine of mine also miss hedge though will say that engagement of son to miss paslow doe not please really thought here mr snow cast searching look on girl face that son admired oh have always be devoted to miss paslow devotion be misplaced snapped mr snow of veneer of gracious manner wearing away will never consent to marriage must tell that to miss paslow to son said beatrice coldly have nothing to do with well mr snow hesitated thought that being friend of miss paslow might point out how foolish conduct be be not place to interfere said miss hedge in frosty manner beginning to gain inkling a to why vicaress have paid unforeseen visit of course not must never ask to do anything disagreeable miss hedge hope will come see at vicarage now have found out really must see more of be very kind of mr snow never go out father doe not wish to so eccentric dear mr alpenny be murmured vicaress be in town only two week ago lady watson mentioned how strange be know lady watson of course never set eye on even know name be strange mr snow really did look puzzled knew about beatrice started what be there to know about oh nothing really truly nothing only that mr alpenny married mother adopted when died be not here when mr alpenny died believe be buried in churchyard have seen tombstone said beatrice coldly how doe lady watson come to know about be school friend of mother so said oh beatrice felt face flush here be chance of learning something that durban alpenny must tell must like to meet lady watson will dear miss hedge be coming in few week to stop at vicarage will be happy to see beatrice have to swallow pride before must say a mr snow have really treated very badly be anxious to learn something of mother to find out if have relative a be determined not to marry ruck knew that if did not alpenny be quite capable of turning out of door of course durban must always look after beatrice wished to be independent even of durban at moment never thought of vivian hasty proposal came back to memory when mr snow introduced name hear that mr paslow be thinking of moving from place said mr snow pity so old family paslows have be in grange since reign of henry viii be originally convent know paslow of day be presented with by king so shocking be turned out nun lived in place be why be called convent grange so miss paslow told responded beatrice rather weary of small talk wondering why be being manufactured mr paslow be poor pursued mr snow ca keep place up expect will go to colony such place so can easily see why want son to marry sister beatrice felt very much inclined to tell garrulous visitor vivian have inherited money must probably clear off mortgage live in style of forefather restrained inclination a be none of business rose to intimate that interview be at end mr snow still sat on really lovely place convent grange chattered although sadly out of repair haunted too say although believe in ghost hear indian colonel be murdered there twenty four year ago ghost be said to haunt room be killed in never heard said beatrice wondering why dinah have never imparted so comparatively modern tragedy to dare say not said mr snow tartly paslows like talking about matter heard about from old shepherd who keep sheep on down orchard be name be butler of mr paslow father who be alive when colonel hall be murdered never heard of shepherd being butler mean that never heard of butler turning shepherd said mr snow did understand that poor man nerve be so wrecked by sight of dead body that doctor of day ordered to take open air cure so became shepherd most superior man who murdered colonel hall one ever found out throat be cut be discovered dead in bed believe casket of jewel be stolen at time be never found even if paslows did tell about wonder father did not dear miss hedge a be here at time visitor at grange stepfather never tell anything how dull must be really be so eccentric lady watson knew year year ago say that be quite gentleman be at rugby with husband sir reginald who be dead took up money lending business really be not respectable besides be quite forbidden by mosaic law well must be going mr snow rose still smiling really must come over to vicarage let make life more gay will also try induce father stepfather to come over think will be able to manage said beatrice dryly wondering what alarming sweetness meant stepfather never go out did over twenty year ago ask about visit to convent grange about colonel hall murder caused great sensation although criminal be never found who be mr snow stepped out into sunshine a spoke pointed slate coloured parasol towards durban who be standing near must have approached very softly must have heard word vicaress said for last few minute dark face looked unnaturally white cast nervous glance at visitor beatrice noticed nothing however ran to at once oh durban be so pleased to see have gone away see left note will take leave so a not to interrupt said mr snow graciously then can talk to man what charming place looked round severely walked from one carriage to bedroom dining room bedroom then stopped at dungeon tried door oh bluebeard chamber must not look in here be master counting house lady said durban who be close at heel seemed anxious for to go how delightful counting house in dark wood just like 'alice in wonderland ' may look in at window mr alpenny be from home so ca object before one must stop be peeping through window where blind be askew then gave cry of alarm miss hedge father be within be lying on floor stood on tiptoe oh be dead see blood impossible cried beatrice rushing forward pushing meddling woman aside yes durban oh great heaven servant came running up also glanced in then with exclamation of horror ran into kitchen came out with bunch of skeleton key woman pale terrified stood beside while fitted into lock none must open door flung away with smothered oath for moment paused then ran into wood mr snow turned to beatrice father have be murdered will tell police yes do said beatrice clasping hand never knew when came home last night left note saying that must go away for few day here be man with log interrupted mr snow indeed be durban who came dragging after large beam with strength of beatrice have never thought so stout man be capable caught in middle retiring for few pace made run at door burst open with shock dropping beam durban went inside mr snow drew beatrice back be not for to see said sharply how dare stop said girl angry at liberty pushing mr snow away ran forward durban tried to keep out managed to gain glimpse of stiff figure lying on floor under mahogany desk oh good heaven shrieked girl throat have be cut so be colonel hall muttered mr snow stole glance at durban made man turn even greyer than already be chapter vi inquest after eighty year halting nemesis have at last caught up with jarvis alpenny have buried in seclusion have surrounded with bolt bar other precaution order that sordid career must end have come from power deal with evil doer be a dead a door nail very unpleasantly have died too for wrinkled throat have be cut from ear to ear who have done one seemed to know beatrice might have supplied clue for reason connected with paslow family held tongue feigned ignorance when rural police came on scene did very speedily owing to zeal of mr snow sergeant of district questioned cross questioned miss hedge with very little success told that on previous evening have gone for walk in wood round camp did not mention with what object there a stated very truly have be caught in storm at unknown time have stumbled home wet weary so tired that have at once slipped into bed note from stepfather be produced confiscated by sergeant detail of mr snow curiosity leading to discovery of crime be given then beatrice professed that must tell more bucolic constable believed readily enough informed inspector who came that miss hedge have told truth nothing truth might have be so certainly have not told whole truth else might sergeant have added to note left by dead man certain gentleman handkerchief marked with three initial vrp piece of evidence beatrice have picked up so near body that corner of handkerchief be soaked in life blood of miser quick eye have seen almost moment have entered dungeon at durban heel when falling on knee by dead have mechanically picked up without lynx eyed mr snow seeing action durban must only allow woman to remain for two minute in place of death then drove out insisted that beatrice must retire to parlour did so while reclosed door of counting house while mr snow almost too excited to speak ran for nearest constable who in turn summoned sergeant alone in parlour beatrice still mechanically grasping handkerchief suddenly remembered how have found at once examined corner be with gasp of terror that realised to whom belonged vrp must only stand for vivian robert paslow a knew only too well be enemy of deceased must be that vivian have killed miser to settle question of marriage secure threatened property from getting into cruel clutch of victim in first moment of horror beatrice be inclined to think so then with revulsion of feeling recoiled with horror from so base idea man loved be not midnight assassin however much may have hated alpenny certainly must not have put old man to death in so barbarous fashion finally have be with under witch oak last night must not possibly be guilty then again on further thought occurred to that alibi must scarcely serve in case meeting at haunted tree have taken place about seven o'clock have lasted so far a must reckon from confused recollection for quarter of hour then have come episode of pursuit of watcher by paslow own flight through wood breaking of storm fainting fit might have be hour unconscious might have be hour getting home for have very little recollection of mad passage through furious wind rain only remembered reaching camp between gate blindly falling into arm of lean tall man with black patch over left eye have that man be vivian be truly lover who in intervening time have stolen to deserted camp using key of small gate knew possessed have gained access to dungeon there to commit crime be impossible if must only remember time when came back be hard to do yet be done for chance came to aid besides cuckoo clock have awakened beatrice possessed old silver watch given to on far distant birthday by durban stood on small stand beside bed remembered that in slipping between sheet weary half asleep have knocked down between table stood on wall instinct must have directed to look for at moment thrust incriminating handkerchief into pocket ran to bedroom carriage there found watch found also that have stopped at hour of nine o'clock be just possible that stoppage have occurred when have knocked over certainly have wound up a usual on previous night twice before when knocked off stand have stopped dead yes thought girl inspecting yellow dial must have be stopped by fall unless shook vigorously unless have run down steady ticking told that main spring be not yet fully unwound replaced watch on stand with firm conviction that have entered bedroom at nine on previous evening vivian have left to follow spy at quarter past seven so must easily have committed crime so far a time opportunity went a one hour three quarter have be taken up by in getting home alibi therefore be little good in case on evidence of handkerchief must assuredly be hanged murmured beatrice with rising inflection speaking aloud in agitation be untrue vivian must never commit so cowardly deed a to kill old man of eighty however much may have hated will hide handkerchief where police be sure to search place sudden thought struck will keep in pocket decided thrust neatly folded up to very bottom of receptacle later intended to cautiously question paslow learn if have be to camp on night conversation must be between two self must tell one else of handkerchief have picked up not even durban faithful servant though be be at moment a though in response to mental mention of name that durban appeared looked much shaken by tragedy be green with scarcely concealed fright beatrice eyed with astonishment a have never deemed to be much attached to old tyrant who have gone so violently to long rest durban evaded searching glance be perhaps fortunate a girl did not wish own countenance to be too closely scrutinised have shut up in counting house said durban eye on ground jerking thumb over shoulder police will be here soon mr snow will tell will be glad of chance why did know late mr alpenny be right missy durban raised eye with approval dropped again never call father be stepfather beatrice reminded ah hum yes gurgled durban yes missy mr snow knew master before be born at convent grange heard say that colonel hall throat have also be cut durban shuddered leaned against door yes whispered faintly be so missy mr alpenny throat have be cut in same way durban half smiled expression be wry twisted there be only one way to cut throat missy ugh beatrice turned pale threw up hand be nasty subject missy be sorry for master yet added half to if ever man deserved what got master be that man what do mean asked beatrice taking step towards master have many enemy went on durban again casting eye on ground money lender always have then know know nothing snapped man angrily wiping swarthy face with duster master sent to london last night a knew only came down by morning train walked here in time to find with mr snow what did want beatrice smiled faintly in turn subscription for church spire be blown down last night oh be excuse excuse for what durban to see missy learn there durban turned away came here to make mischief between master thank heaven be dead will get money mr snow ca harm now why must wish to harm durban be long story missy now that master be dead can tell to first must learn who killed know interrupted beatrice quickly tall man with black patch over left eye durban turned greener than ever how do know missy asked in strangled voice saw when gate be open about nine o'clock last night durban looked at sharply then did go for walk missy yes have to mr paslow wished to see durban made step forward clutched arm tightly will tell intend to tell one else without giving man time to make observation related whole story of adventure suppressing only episode of handkerchief did so a to avert possible suspicion from vivian since durban knowing that paslow have be with must not connect with crime be if be stupid enough not to

opened eye looked at tall slim young lady with approval a went past thought be trifle too pale have black circle under eye otherwise approved smiled graciously beatrice took notice of went to parlour to think over strange conduct of vivian paslow dinah be right certainly have something on mind did not seem to be free agent something hampered in way have long desired to propose to yet have only done so when cause declined to explain have be removed again have gone up to town on hearing of alpenny murder without ascertaining whether have reached home not on fearful night have not even left message then in pocket be handkerchief dyed with life blood of miser thing be strange disquieting beatrice resolved that before reaffirming decision to marry must have to explain what underhand cause be at work to make behave so mysteriously time be lost in holding inquest on body of jarvis alpenny weather be hot be just a well to place remains underground a speedily a possible doctor be summoned from hurstable to examine body pronounce if possible hour when murder have taken place then corpse be conveyed to solitary inn of hurstable few mile away there jury looked over afterwards coroner summoned into inn parlour inspector grove related have be discovered by police be not much threw light on authorship of crime deceased so ran official narrative be money lender of great repute that none of best possessed small office in london trunk street cheapside seldom went there a preferred quiet of country probably on account of age be considerable nevertheless from habit apparently mr jarvis continued to do business up to very hour of death died in harness a might be said for on table whereunder lay be letter from people who need not be mentioned asking for loan of money be apparently considering when be struck down understood have seen said coroner emphatically that deceased throat be cut inspector jones assented pointed out that old man be first felled by blow from behind a be apparent from wound at back of head assassin have evidently entered stealthily have taken victim by surprise murder be very deliberate a criminal have first stunned old man then have cut throat in most brutal thorough fashion therefore a inspector suggested motive of crime be more than mere robbery robber having stunned victim must have taken what desired escaped before mr jarvis regained consciousness death have taken place from throat cutting not from blow on head have anything be taken from room asked juryman mean railway carriage corrected inspector who be pedantic in speech particular a to fact safe be opened with key of deceased probably taken by assassin from dead body paper have be taken away what do mean exactly asked coroner inspector jones held up right hand mean declared emphatically that safe be a bare a palm of hand paper be removed drawer be emptied nothing be left absolutely nothing assassin must have carried quite load a safe be large one probably be fairly filled be extremely likely replied inspector then went on to state that fact of death be discovered next morning by mr snow vicar wife who be paying visit to miss police be called in everything have be done to discover whereabouts of assassin in vain villager labourer railway official chance folk travelling in cart motor car on bicycle have be questioned suspicious character have be observed assassin have stolen in upon old man out of night when detestable task have be executed have again vanished into night with plunder leaving not footprint behind by must be traced yet night be rainy said coroner sapiently grassy sward retorted jones run right up to railway carriage wherein crime be executed have inquired at trunk street office can not learn from confidential clerk there that mr alpenny be threatened in way feared for life property affair be mystery be likely to remain so with such as a at head of affair murmured coroner a inspector severely official stepped down to give place to rosy little man well doctor asked aloud what do know about sad business dr herman knew very little save from medical standing point lived in hurstable mile distant from scene of crime drove round surrounding district to see patient constable stopped on day after crime have be committed have be asked to examine corpse found that be that of old man body be badly nourished healthy enough for man who certainly be over eighty blow on head must not have killed man with such vitality old a be death have ensued from cutting of throat be neatly done said doctor with professional approval must think very sharp instrument be used very dexterous hand have used bungling about affair concluded dr herman humph said coroner doubtfully what doe mean do insinuate that doctor cut throat used surgical instrument to do so insinuate nothing of sort said herman hotly for did not like sneer of coroner might have be butcher who be quite a dexterous with knife a medical man although not quite in same way pooh pooh be animal doctor laughed coroner be butcher whether be called so not come now at what time did mr jarvis alpenny meet death can not be sure of can not commit to exact opinion said little doctor doubtfully must say crime be committed between eight nine of previous night a say can not be quite certain between eight nine of previous night wrote coroner called next witness be mr snow who gave evidence with much volubility have called on miss hedge to ask for money in order to get spire of hurstable church mended miss hedge have stated that stepfather be from home witness have glanced into railway carriage be called counting house of mr alpenny there have seen deceased dead lying in pool of blood at once gave alarm durban servant burst open door with beam door of carriage be locked then oh yes assented mr snow tried expect assassin killed poor mr alpenny after robbing safe went out with plunder locked door after have key one moment said durban rising in body of room master carried key key including that of counting house on single ring key be in safe will hear later said coroner sharply go on mr snow have nothing further to say said vicar wife trying to convey sympathetic look in eye save that be sorry for miss hedge may add continued after moment of hesitation that colonel hall be murdered at convent grange twenty five year ago in same way remember case said coroner who be old resident of neighbourhood what do infer that assassin of colonel hall assassin of mr alpenny be one same said mr snow promptly why must connect two asked coroner coldly very much puzzled colonel hall mr alpenny have much to do with one said mr snow did business together that two throat must be cut be coincidence only nothing more mr snow can not see what old crime have to do with new one be sure there be connection snapped sour woman then stepped down from witness box with triumphant glance in direction of beatrice why glance one of nature be sent beatrice must not guess then conduct of mr snow be perplexing more more durban evidence be to effect that have be absent when crime took place mr alpenny have sent to town with letter have returned next morning to find old man dead mr snow have first informed of fact have burst open door with beam a be locked then have discovered that mr alpenny throat be slit from ear to ear saw added witness quickly that key of deceased including key of counting house be on ring dangled from key used to open safe then think that assassin must have locked door after certainly not seeing that key be left behind be there not key master have only key of counting house be one of most peculiar make there be duplicate mr alpenny be always careful to lock up paper to keep door of counting house locked then there must be way of getting into counting house inspector jones rose to assure coroner that place have be thoroughly examined there be way of entering railway carriage be called counting house save by door if door be locked key inside assassin must have got out by way what about window be so small so barred that child must not get through coroner scratched head looked at durban be confidential servant of deceased said helplessly perhaps can explain can explain nothing said durban promptly quite at ease certainly be mr alpenny servant made confidant of took letter to london office what be in never knew be cook general servant be be often in counting house be never in counting house in life sir mr alpenny must not allow miss hedge to enter humph said coroner again whole mystery seems to centre round counting house have mr alpenny enemy usual sort money lender be bound to have said durban with shrug people sometimes came called name told that many borrower objected to high interest charged did deceased ever give to understand that life be in danger never appeared quite happy in own way be expecting one on night be murdered can not say sent to town with letter be to come back next morning added witness pointedly did mr alpenny did not expect to be killed must have taken precaution have thought that a feared death after several juryman asked question coroner cross examined half caste must tell nothing likely to lead to discovery of assassin simply declared that be not in late master confidence knew nothing that have gone to town on night of murder have only learned of through mr snow coroner incidentally inspector jones be annoyed have quite counted on solution of mystery when durban be examined must tell nothing saw reason to doubt evidence beatrice be called a final witness told very much same story a have related to sergeant only on occasion stated time when have returned coroner asked how knew that have entered at nine whereupon detailed episode of fallen watch be sure that when knocked down stopped at nine said at hour returned why did not go in see mr alpenny in first place be worn out said witness in second there be light in window of counting house in third found note left by mr alpenny handed to sergeant in fourth place added beatrice before coroner must make observation seemed inclined to do saw assassin everyone be startled confused murmur filled room saw assassin said coroner aghast when entered gate of camp at nine o'clock be tall man with black patch over left eye black patch cried mr snow rising much excited colonel hall be also murdered by man with black patch swear chapter viii will word rang piercingly through dead silence beatrice startled by persistent introduction of bygone crime stared at lean faced woman who made outcry coroner blinked furiously nursed chin in hand considering what to say what to do finally made up mind to rebuke mr snow have given evidence said frowning trifle now must be silent must note what have told said mr snow calmly bosom heaved impatiently one crime may help other a how asked coroner politely because may strike down two bird with one stone must rather put if what say be true mr snow that may strike down one bird with two stone understand that say man who murdered colonel hall remember well also murdered mr alpenny heard what miss hedge said about black patch dr arne know that colonel hall throat be also cut there be stealing also said dr arne musingly make parallel more complete there be diamond necklace stolen said mr snow quietly at least remember be not married then mr hall be dear friend never saw said coroner coldly trifle rudely be not to point miss hedge will go on must have tell asked witness who have be listening eagerly to mr snow account of earlier crime how must see man seeing that night be dark very stormy saw face in flash of lightning explained beatrice then related momentary meeting suppressed fact that on same night have met vivian under witch oak be not pertinent to case thought moreover with knowledge of whose handkerchief be in pocket thought best to keep paslow name out of matter gate be open asked coroner when ended wide open mr alpenny have key believe yes that key be not on ring to others be attached hung on wall along with key of smaller gate put in durban then inspector jones spoke key of large gate said found in lock next morning where have be left man with black patch closed large gate after a ran out said beatrice ah then probably opened gate from inside when met be too startled to take out of lock smaller key belonging to little gate mr inspector be hanging on wall of counting house now beatrice started grasped chair near stood to keep from falling vivian have picked up key when dropped under witch oak must have replaced in counting house when be inside have also left handkerchief have in pocket surely be guilty yet yet oh be too terrible word from coroner recalled look pale miss hedge remarked suspiciously wonder said girl faintly whole affair be so very terrible well well said arne relenting believing excuse be feasible enough sha keep much longer why did not see mr alpenny on night have told note ah yes be about to remark on when spoke last mr inspector why have not note be put in evidence inspector jones with profuse apology laid note on table quite forgot said looking ashamed here be a will see mr alpenny say that be going away for three day where did find note miss hedge beside bed on night naturally thought that a light be out in counting house note explained that mr alpenny have gone away a intended quite right very natural hum hum when found body spoke to durban what clothes be dressed in mr alpenny always wore one suit durban explained old fashioned dress when found body be clothed in loose cloak used to wear in rough weather hat hat be on desk sir humph said dr arne thoughtfully then must seem that be struck down just a be going up to town must mr alpenny have caught train so late yes sir if left camp at nine o'clock there be train at half past ten to brighton must have caught late one on main line must have stopped at brighton night sometimes did be nearly three mile to local station said dr arne must old man like mr alpenny walk that distance often did declared durban emphatically have wonderful constitution have master marvellous vitality cried dr herman from seat be rebuked by enemy coroner arne asked few more question then addressed jury pointed out that on evidence before must not arrive at conclusion a to who be actual murderer man who murdered colonel hall cried mr snow quite so said coroner smoothly that man escaped be never discovered if be same man certainly mr snow seems a though surmise be right may escape again mr alpenny apparently be about to start on journey after leaving note for miss hedge probably be turning over necessary paper when be struck down regarding locked door can offer explanation have police be able to find masked man who assuredly must be assassin case be full of mystery see what can be done save that jury must return open verdict made few more observation what said be not very much to point jury what else must be done returned verdict of murder against person person unknown with observation to effect that police must hunt down man with black patch last remark be rather irregular to say truth everyone be so puzzled over aspect of case that one have very clear idea of what to say do however verdict such a be resolved into term above stated jury betook severally to home there to puzzle over matter beatrice went back to camp with durban felt glad that corpse be still left in outhouse of hotel wished that gruesome relic of mortality to remain in camp be right missy said durban when two be walking along lane towards camp master will be buried to morrow wo think of more will never get sight of body out of head said beatrice with shudder durban who must have killed can not say missy said half caste stolidly heard what evidence gave yes did speak truly spoke what spoke said durban sullenly least said soonest mended beatrice felt qualm of terror at memory of replaced key handkerchief in pocket then have idea who killed mr alpenny have not missy that be can not lay finger on man then be man might have be two men three missy master have dealing with very strange dangerous people wonder be killed cried half caste stopping to emphasise word if knew who killed must shake man hand durban why in heaven name because because missy broke off abruptly let past alone dear young lady mr alpenny be bad man came to deserved end did not kill did not kill so have better think more of when be buried will have money then can marry mr paslow be happy will never marry mr paslow never never cried beatrice bitterly lifted wan face to mocking blue sky love love same durban broke off in turn want to hear know about mr paslow know nothing missy said durban looking profoundly surprised be poor good hearted like think that must commit crime asked miss hedge faintly clinging to servant cried durban with great assurance what make think that mr alpenny said durban did not give time to finish master must accuse one of anything to gain end said quietly did not wish to marry mr paslow because be to interest that must marry major ruck so said do know major yes said durban with hesitation wicked man be if come to marry missy tell mr paslow will settle expect that will see major ruck know muttered servant doubtfully major wo let slip through finger if can help durban seem to know much that will not tell do know lot be useless to tell missy not even about colonel hall death durban half caste turned green winced not even about missy said coldly get money marry mr paslow go away from place do think mr snow be right persisted beatrice wondering at nervous look did man who killed colonel hall kill mr know ca say interrupted durban gloomily might have be one of be there then two men who wear black patch over durban clenched long nervous hand will drive mad with question said fiercely with le of usual respect tell missy know much yet know nothing must do good for to hear have watched over in past will watch over in future have be surrounded by devil master be worst now that be dead danger be at end have money can go away speak in riddle let remain riddle if have love for said durban moodily beatrice although anxious to hear more held peace after have own cross to bear in way vivian be mixed up with horrible crime must not possibly be guilty of in spite of evidence moreover mr snow said that assassin be same a who have killed colonel hall must put vivian innocence beyond doubt in spite of desire to obey durban to whom owed so much beatrice have to insist on answer to question wo ask anything more said to sullen man be sullen only be assassin of colonel hall assassin of mr alpenny think so muttered man can not be sure must be sure for peace of mind durban peace of mind missy asked surprised yes must tell a know will hold tongue think believe fancy be durban caught man shoulder shook in roadway did vivian paslow murder mr alpenny missy durban looked startled eye sparkled one thousand time what make think that handkerchief key beatrice producing handkerchief told durban whole of what have happened be thankful that mr snow did not see pick up finished wait till get to camp missy said old servant kindly led along short distance intervened between where have stopped camp once there durban took to parlour carriage went away

reason of fidelity will know day went on good reason be must ask more question until voluntarily tell that be needful must know with regard to mr paslow can set mind at rest be quite innocent handkerchief found be left behind by on day have that quarrel with mr alpenny be sure be absolutely certain saw on master desk when went in to get that letter be to take to town a to key got from mr

small gate have dropped gave to replaced on nail in counting house where inspector found mr paslow went to london whenever heard of crime at request why durban asked beatrice relieved to find vivian have not be so callous neglectful a have thought wanted to see mr alpenny lawyer look after will said durban steadily wanted to see must not allow that a be quite worried enough sight of vivian must have done good protested poor girl faintly for be quite worn out can see now said durban regretfully thought at time that be wiser to keep quiet if have thought that suspected must have spoken before never mentioned name so deemed best to be silent be perfectly innocent when come back will be able to tell where went after left on night meanwhile be seeing after will be there need need tell missy that even though mr alpenny be dead be surrounded by scoundrel if get money master swore to that must leave fortune will be absolutely safe from what durban from wicked scheme of people major ruck here durban checked spoke softly soothingly there there missy ask more question day foolish old silly durban will make thing plain just now think only that will be rich that will marry mr paslow everything will go well with beatrice raised arm dropped with helpless air seemed to be more than ever surrounded by mystery durban who be able to explain insisted upon holding tongue at event mind be set at rest regarding honesty of vivian thought best to take old servant advice posse soul in patience until such time a chose to tell truth might be be very puzzling head ached with effort to think matter out after time durban persuaded to lie down did very willingly being quite prostrate after terror of past few day fell into uneasy doze be awakened by sound of much loved voice at once put on dressing gown opened door vivian looking weary dispirited be talking to durban near at hand where must overhear plainly yes be saying beatrice get nothing money quite twenty thousand year have be left by alpenny to lady watson lady watson cried beatrice opening door mother friend vivian turned away durban changed to usual green pallor seemed deeply agitated yes said durban mother friend paused then spat on ground curse said durban fiercely chapter ix lady watson beatrice stared at vivian grey drawn face bereft of youth at durban savage green countenance looked spell bound pause ensued beatrice did not know what to make of men paslow averted look worn paleness durban curse for lady watson must fact that did not inherit money account for such emotion thought not so requested information what be asked looking from one to other looked longest at vivian have heard missy said durban recovering somewhat have lost money can bear that if lose nothing else said beatrice eye still on paslow grey face that must get cried durban shaking impotent fist in air after have done can hing to force to be fair who must have thought foul old thief must have squandered gold on silly face must here caught sight of frightened look of beatrice let hand fall a walked past vivian towards kitchen breathed sentence in young man ear may know much said durban imperatively not great heaven must tell do think groaned man beatrice caught drift if not exact word of whisper came towards vivian durban be already within kitchen have shut door two be alone eager to know worst silent tortured with much that must not explain vivian vivian continued laid hand on arm shook off with shudder dear said beatrice shrinking back oh dear stared with fast locked hand not that whispered man with dry lip might have called so when stood under witch oak now made despairing gesture be at end do take back proposal of marriage asked girl colouring do because must vivian looked at hungrily a though must have given life to take in arm a be indeed case if did not love so much said hoarsely must lie loving a do must speak truth whole of asked bitterly so much a may tell miss hedge miss hedge have right to call otherwise now said paslow sadly told of bar prevented asking to be wife yes said that have be removed be wrong be not removed have right to speak what be bar can not tell beatrice caught suddenly at hand if must lie down die at dear foot must for heart be sick within have sinned bitterly be paying for sin when spoke to under oak be then able to be true lover hoped to be loving husband now flung away hand that barrier thought removed be still between be not free agent dare not ask to be wife have asked have consented panted red with shame anger why be playing with like why be god playing with of mean said with mirthless laugh be on other side of world might be happy yet even then must be impossible love have right to hate understand one word be talking about said beatrice sharply tried to resolve sense out of wild word be that committed crime started back amazed beatrice may be bad be not so evil a hated alpenny have reason to hate never laid finger on poor wretch did not kill can tell who killed ah went on half to durban said something of about key of small gate explained be what said true perfectly true be innocent be not murder be bar to divide must face that out there be other thing prevent being free agent have master then have about who know too much said vivian fiercely if anything must make stain hand with blood must be knowledge be sport of thief vagabond how will end know for be for best dearest made step forward evaded for know end must come to convent grange go to grange after what have said flamed out will not trouble will go to town can stay with dinah with mr lilly for time then durban will see if can not get money from mr be from lady watson why must give to asked beatrice shrugging because began then ended abruptly can not tell vivian beatrice moved swiftly forward laid firm hand on shoulder understand mr alpenny poor wretch hinted at crime on part do believe asked vivian turning haggard young face towards said firmly love too well for god bless tear dropped on hand kissed drew away be not open with be not honest with if have trouble have right to share tell of barrier said vivian firmly can not dare not can say be that barrier may be removed in time only trust have barrier to do with crime in way with death of colonel hall what do know of asked paslow amazed very little mr snow hinted that woman will make mischief if can trust hate beatrice why must hardly know know be know of to explain what mean must be to tell much must rather did not know that must never know be not child be woman love therefore will not allow mind to be tainted with with with what must tell ended rather weakly beatrice reflected for few minute apparently vivian be in trouble connected with other people possibly a guessed with scoundrel who surrounded alpenny of whom durban have talked for reason must not guess be trying to keep from thing be vile evil must not think how young country squire must be involved in alpenny roguery seemed be then gave up trying to solve problem on such evidence a be before only remained that must use own eye own intelligence maybe sooner later must arrive at understanding of thing then perhaps must be enabled to remove barrier stood between strange though paslow conduct be open to dire suspicion still loved knew in heart of heart that must love until died being case made up mind with swiftness of woman who be fighting for what love best looked at searchingly be watching with anxious eye shifted gaze to ground when looked at will answer few question asked quietly if can replied hesitating lip curled in spite of herself need not be afraid will respect secret whatever be for present be meanwhile perhaps will tell if know who killed mr alpenny told before did not know have suspicion not even suspicion answered frankly looked at a spoke so serenely that believed will tell about colonel hall murder know very little about be child at time mr lilly can tell anything wish to know why do ask because from what mr snow said believe that first murder of colonel hall be connected with second murder of mr alpenny believe that muttered vivian uneasily do murder of be committed by man with black patch what do know of nothing save used word to frighten alpenny found on paper laid on desk do know who laid that paper there have not least idea desk be near window be open one must have passed paper through window asked dinah mr lilly one of knew how paper came to be there if remember continued beatrice slowly mr alpenny muttered something about being third time well then truly believe that word used unconsciously be warning twice be warned on third warning expected to be killed be why believe arranged to go up to town when be struck down be used by someone a unconscious instrument to give warning might have be be added coming so close to that felt breath on cheek if really truly be ignorant of meaning of word swear that be stammered vivian turning red then secret have nothing to do with black patch be a puzzled a be over well well said beatrice looking over shoulder have moved towards door of bedroom a spoke intend to go to grange care whether stop there not worst be over now know that

evening for present good day went in shut door paslow stood where be for moment then flung forward to kiss wood of door oh love love heart murmured what dreary weary way have marked out for will follow along path of shadow perhaps two will emerge at length into sunshine turned away passing kitchen carriage knocked at door sharply durban appeared heard everything said servant who be now more composed what do say knowing what do know say let missy go on may be that god intends to learn truth right matter lady watson have money vivian reminded have everything said durban bitterly always did have everything then with afterthought what really wanted never got mr paslow what be never mind least said soonest mended will tell missy nothing must hold tongue also only let guard from danger think there be danger for durban ah hum one never know there be matter let go way may be that may learn truth put thing straight can never put straight for said vivian bitterly can do said durban let missy go to grange go to london will have news from paslow caught arm a turned to go will not be too fond of neck for said durban went into kitchen while vivian full of sore thought yet with certain glimmer of hope now that beatrice be to take hand in game went home to dinah beatrice packed box got ready to go by five o'clock be hatted cloaked trap be waiting at gate to take to convent grange along with luggage alpenny be to be buried on morrow be just a well that miss hedge must leave camp to night be not to go yet for hour for scarcely have reached open gate when small lady fashionably dressed entered came straight towards when durban saw frowned lady watson breathed in ear of young mistress seems anxious to take possession of property said girl bitterly looked carefully at woman who have supplanted in race for alpenny wealth lady watson looked in distance like child so small delicate slender did appear when came close did with engaging smile beatrice saw that face be covered with innumerable fine wrinkle that be painted powdered made up a saying be to within inch of life hair be dyed golden colour wore veil to hide too obvious make up of face only young thing about be pair of sparkling eye of bright brown at one time have be without aid of art extremely pretty woman even now with aid of art looked attractive youthful providing be looked at from safe distance like oil painting dress be ultra fashionable wore with air of woman accustomed to spend end of money in draper shop teeth be good probably be false a be smile beatrice straightforward person took instinctive dislike to gushing little mass of affectation came mincing towards have wish to cultivate acquaintance lady watson gave time to express dislike by look in word dear child sweet beatrice cried in rather shrill voice sailing forward with eager outstretched hand how glad be to see at last that dreadful mr alpenny never must allow to come see although be mother dearest very dearest closest friend then poor creature be dead really be nice person when be said done mr snow told that be mother friend replied beatrice gravely surrendering hand to eager grasp be glad to see a wish to

durban know dear old durban turned smiling glance at half caste who looked gloomily at ground be a young a ever be long since met durban very long madam said durban coldly eye still on ground beatrice saw hand opening shutting a though must scarcely keep from lady watson throat well well wo talk of past just yet be unpleasant dear durban gave pretty little shudder durban made reply in word raising

of thought there conversation ended for time being same beatrice have idea of going away even thought that must not marry vivian paslow until thing be made clear so to speak knew where stood what with vivian marriage to maud elli late mr alpenny hint that young man have committed crime there be much in paslow life did not understand have loved le must have have nothing more to do with did love with heart soul consequently believed that be more sinned against than sinning be nothing out of common that young man in london must be entrapped into such marriage after be not unusual that vivian must strive to hide from woman really loved folly of have be guilty eight year ago that must forgive did forgive be ready to marry lover a soon a wished must not rid herself of vague fear that if did marry must only be beginning of fresh misery durban desire that young couple must go away seemed to ominous vivian although under stress of circumstance have confessed marriage did not seem to be communicative regarding other mystery what if at back of thing lurked terrible scandal might ruin happiness that of paslow while thinking thus occurred to beatrice that have never learned what vivian have done on night when left under witch oak be together walking in garden after dinner when considered question asked vivian at once to explain removed cigar looked at searchingly what woman be to ask question said with forced laugh want answered said beatrice rather imperiously vivian shrugged shoulder be not averse to doing so said in weary manner well on night left ran to see who be watching be red headed little beast called waterloo employed a spy by mr alpenny know have seen seen vivian started looked uneasy when where in very garden beatrice related how tramp have suddenly appeared to mar beauty of scene wanted to see concluded durban sent away have seen brute must have horsewhipped cried young man angrily be spy of alpenny on on on alpenny knew loved did not want to meet told waterloo who be hanging round camp to keep eye on on waterloo confessed did catch yes did nearly broke neck confessed that have be set to watch by mr alpenny have be lurking outside great gate of camp saw said beatrice recalling vague shadow have seen crouching in shade on fatal night saw go past went on paslow followed to witch oak like shadow when caught told so gave kicking let go dog be not worth fouling hand with then went back to oak to find have gone so fancied that have gone home did not follow a thought might run up against alpenny that there must be more trouble went home to grange then be coming along next morning to see give key when met durban be then that heard of murder yes afterwards went up to town to see alpenny lawyer about chance of getting money see beatrice major ruck other creature employed by alpenny be quite capable of destroying will so a to get money how must do by bribing blackmailing lawyer of man be not above reproach a did much dirty work for alpenny ruck know of many of underhanded dealing on hearing of alpenny death struck that ruck might try to force lawyer tuft be name to destroy will might be made in favour by threatening to communicate with police however saw tuft produced will be genuine enough a know alpenny handwriting very well money be left a know to lady watson believe that year ago alpenny admired although see why must leave such large fortune cut out hated said beatrice sadly always did before died told to expect nothing be pauper a know vivian said suddenly let put off marriage for time can go out a governess can wait why must wait asked quickly arm went round in firm embrace be sure murmured beatrice that if marry trouble will be at end quite sure first wife be dead so can take second ruck other beast can not harm now beatrice will marry in week a promised have wedding dress doe not matter marry not clothes if postpone marriage may never take place why not because there be who must stop from marrying not ruck can hing beatrice caught hand looked deep into eye own to have be fool marriage with adventuress introduced into strange company will not tell now what strait have be in what trouble have undergone only trust marry will then tell whole of life history believe there be nothing in for will cease to love worst sin be having kept first marriage from will trust whispered beatrice who be much perplexed be not possible to clear up mystery may clear up said vivian after moment hesitation can not help dare not ended abruptly left what did mean beatrice asked that question again again without receiving answer for overwhelming love must have hesitated to step forward in dark a really be doing when consenting to marriage felt that vivian needed aid that only when be man wife must aid be of real service made attempt to continue conversation when met again in drawing room did seek out old servant to ask question since vivian hinted that by own unaided effort might arrive at truth whatever might be determined to search on in one way be resolved with force of strong nature to put end to provoking mystery be for reason that next morning found climbing down vivian have gone with dinah into brighton beatrice alleging death of stepfather a reason for retirement have remained at home in reality wanted to trace out orchard ex butler who have turned shepherd whom mr lilly have told of from elderly dame beatrice obtained information orchard lived on down in little wooden hut like savage maid in popular song having gained fair notion of whereabouts set out to seek man have be in house at time of colonel hall murder apparently have seen something have not done so nerve certainly must not have be so shattered a to make give up comfortable profession of butler for hard life of shepherd certainly might refuse to speak out a assuredly have not told police anything likely to lead to discovery of colonel hall assassin beatrice have great faith in woman wile in power of tongue to get what wanted be sole way in must do so a have money wherewith to tempt old man then so patriarchal person might be above bribery corruption be divine day breeze be blowing freshly across spacious down from distant channel beatrice loved to look on wide space of green to watch sheep moving across close shorn turf kept in such good order mile walk brought into vicinity where mr lilly have informed orchard watched flock speedily saw hut tiny box of house roofed with turf standing on down without railing fence garden round just like house have lost way fate favoured took a good omen when saw old man seated at door eating midday meal be bent white headed have long white beard in fact might have passed for father christmas have be appropriately dressed eye be faded blue mild seemed in wise disturbed when approached good day miss said ex butler good day responded beatrice will let sit down have be walking for time certainly miss said orchard with deference of former indoor servant air will do good suppose miss be one of gentry from brighton often come up here to breathe air get appetite sit down miss by time have brought out stool beatrice sat down with weary air for really be tired come from weald said waving hand towards luxurious verdure of valley below live there very nice place miss lived there once at convent grange said beatrice glad to see orchard be disposed to be communicative turned mild look of surprise on considered face attentively why yes miss replied although know how come to know mr lilly told orchard let glimmering smile rest on pale lip sarah lilly said musingly ah have not seen since be fellow servant together be long ago might have married miss a liked one be married be married so must come together must think not said beatrice smiling at grave way in old shepherd spoke mr lilly be great friend of mine be miss doubt considered still more attentively mr lilly told how came to be shepherd yes told that did for nerve said orchard looking away at treeless green expanse be shattered by terrible calamity happened in house air here cured do know who killed colonel hall be first person who have asked that question for many year miss time be when many did so colonel have be buried five twenty year terrible death be quite forgotten know who killed for certain be miss have suspicion oh yes said orchard calmly believe that mr alpenny murdered colonel hall to get certain necklace can not be true said beatrice aghast major ruck know interpolated orchard well say that colonel hall gave necklace to mother who be mother miss mr hedge who married mr alpenny cried orchard rising suddenly to foot really startled out of mildness yes mr alpenny be now dead know know said orchard waving hand met with due reward of wickedness can talk of later will tell why suspect mr hedge daughter colonel child what cried beatrice springing to foot mr alpenny never told suppose said orchard coolly married mr hall who took name of mr hedge because be suspected of being concerned in crime be miss hall miss beatrice hall chapter xiv mr snow past beatrice waited to hear no more a sensible woman must have remained where be to question old shepherd learn why stated so firmly that be daughter of colonel hall who have be murdered so cruelly at grange mere fact of announcement startled without pausing rushed away a though to escape from thought orchard looked after in mild surprise did not call back although action must have puzzled ex butler seemed to have outlived curiosity else down have cured nerve so thoroughly that did not feel startled however be a may returned to dinner sat watching slowly moving sheep without giving thought to young lady who have called upon how beatrice descended slope of down into valley never knew brain be filled with information have so strangely gained be not beatrice hedge beatrice daughter of dead man who have owned necklace ruck asserted that colonel have given necklace to wife before murder a mr alpenny who called mr hedge who really be mr hall have be wife of colonel be not unlikely alpenny finding that possessed necklace might have married to gain possession of same what beatrice must not understand be why mother must have married usurer be true that have always be admirer a durban have stated from accepting attention to marrying man who paid be long step mr hall have taken under name of mr hedge again beatrice wondered what reason must be durban must have known truth have be faithful servant of colonel hall have always spoken of with love admiration if beatrice be colonel child adoration of durban for must be explained loved because have loved dead father why have durban held tongue over marriage have allowed everyone to think that alpenny have married mr hedge durban a beatrice well knew have love for alpenny yet have said nothing likely to prevent such match certainly durban might not have have power there appeared reason why must have concealed truth from dead master child beatrice be beginning to see light there be mystery concerning have to do with father murder with missing necklace probably with murder of alpenny durban now might tell truth explain matter seeing that already knew so much then again might refuse to speak out must be a much in dark a ever major ruck doubtless knew truth from alpenny although have declared that mr hedge be cousin of colonel hall beatrice remembering hesitation in making statement be certain that ruck be cognisant of real state of affair be vivian paslow likewise enlightened must not be certain of vivian might might not know assuredly have secret on mind refused to impart to until marriage took place have that secret to do with real parentage have be revealed to by orchard beatrice be minded then there to ask vivian for truth must not do so on spur of moment much a wished to since vivian be at brighton with dinah must not be back for hour durban certainly be at camp beatrice very naturally considering attitude be doubtful if must speak out at foot of down when on road leading to hurstable village paused to think what be best to be done half regretted that have not stopped with orchard to learn more must be just a well thought to go back glance at steep wall of down led to change mind must not face that weary climb again a nerve be shattered by communication have changed life then occurred to that mr snow knew mother mr snow then miss duncan have be at convent grange when colonel hall be murdered must have known that so called mr hedge be really mr hall must have known also reason why mr hall under feigned name have married jarvis alpenny mr snow declared to be dear friend of mr hall why then did hate beatrice who be daughter of same dear friend mr snow hated beatrice be convinced a have pointedly neglected throughout five twenty year yes mr snow must be best person to question having made up mind rapidly girl took way to vicarage of hurstable mr snow looking more sour elderly than ever be in garden engaged in arcadian pastime of gathering rose for decorative purpose be good housekeeper liked to see dainty dinner table notwithstanding disagreeable nature made vicar son comfortable enough really loved in sour way jerry indeed be apple of eye be for reason that resented engagement to dinah paslow with other girl must have be same be not individual maiden mr snow hated girl who took son to be husband for sake of own selfishness miscalled maternal love must have liked jerry to remain bachelor life just to please bestow affection on dear mother young man have not found that affection although really existed strong enough to fill life therefore have asked dinah to marry so strongly have held own on subject that mr snow have be won over so far a to receive dinah a future daughter in law mr snow said beatrice when entered pretty ground of vicarage wish to speak to particularly vicar wife looked sourly at visitor hated beatrice because of beauty amongst other thing when saw that same beauty be somewhat worn haggard that girl looked ill have lost vivacity felt pleased quite washed out said mr snow to herself thus became more amiable laying down scissors with have be clipping flower advanced with what be meant to be ingratiating smile dear miss hedge be so pleased to see be first time that have called come inside please thank prefer to remain in garden take up a little of time a possible mr snow stiffened what extraordinary tone to take with said with offended air of thorough egotist can wonder at know so little of one be a may be snapped mr snow wondering what visitor have come to see about may know more of than think for reason come to see said beatrice calmly hostess started speedily recovered calmness really know what mean miss hedge said composedly think know much that be not miss hedge oh said mr snow sallow face flushing uneasy red will not be seated thank beatrice moved towards garden seat at far end of lawn mr snow touched arm pointed to side path have very secluded arbour there said significantly where can not be overheard led way down path whole world may hear what have to say declared beatrice boldly resolved to be party to mystery whole world said mr snow stopped with disagreeable smile may not hear what may have to say be if press want to hear everything said girl sharply for reason have come to fear will go away le easy in mind than came beatrice shrugged shoulder mind have be uneasy ever since death of stepfather retorted be place be place assented vicaress be a mr snow have stated very secret place path ended in kind of semicircular enclosure surrounded by high hedge of arbour faced path so that one seated therein must see intruder advancing along path haven of rest be of light trellis work overgrown with rose have comfortable wooden seat at back two basket chair in front of with small green painted table between beatrice sank into one of chair mr snow subsided into other table be between two glanced at one when seated mr snow looked a sour a ever there lurked watchful look in eye more discerning person than visitor must have seen at once beatrice on part having nothing to conceal be perfectly open caring very little for what mr snow have to say resolved that might be must bind to secrecy scene being set actress spoke beatrice politely waited to give mr snow chance of opening conversation while mr snow be equally determined that visitor must speak first under circumstance silence ensued lasted for quite two minute mr snow being most impatient yielded first to desire to use tongue spoke very strangely just now miss hedge said purposely uttered name to evoke frank speech from beatrice miss hall if please said girl falling into trap oh miss hall replied other flushing never knew that mother be called hall a be dearest friend told a much fancy must have have idea perhaps said mr snow looking down uneasily then raised face with frown who told man called orchard may know of mr snow have reason to deny know of be late mr paslow butler became shepherd on down because doctor said must have to live in open air why did not tell nerve be so shattered by horrid murder took place at grange twenty five year ago allude to murder of father to murder of colonel hall corrected mr snow snappishly father be colonel hall so man orchard say sneered other face flushing hand opening shutting so believe come now mr snow must tell what know of matter know nothing perhaps miss duncan may be able to tell ah vicar wife laughed carelessly know maiden name perhaps occupation before married husband heard that be governess who said so durban in case since have be so frank wonder that did not tell how mr mother killed colonel beatrice started to foot dare to say that yes do cried mr snow venomously killed father to gain possession of diamond necklace married alpenny because must have accused of murder be not true said beatrice closing eye with horror be true can prove why did not do so twenty five year ago because mother be friend mr snow beatrice opened eye leaned across table be never mother friend woman moved uneasily hand be restless have not be so mother must have stood in dock ah have own reason for keeping quiet do mean to accuse of being accomplice said mr snow rising scowling sit down please beatrice pushed back into chair how dare gasped mr snow be never treated before so in whole course of life made to rise again again beatrice pushed back be stronger than mr snow said scornfully will sit down will tell everything know if will go at once to police mr snow turned white to police yes listen believe that man with black patch who murdered father colonel hall also murdered mr alpenny mother be entirely innocent be alive must say so mr snow laughed at remark in hollow manner yes may laugh mr snow what say be true resumed beatrice firmly if tell know will tell police that accuse mother say that can substantiate accusation when arrested may be forced to speak out arrested how dare mr snow be furious how can be arrested when murder of father took place twenty five year ago be ridiculous oh no second murder have to do with first so will bring death of father up to date speak out go at once to brighton then will not dare gasped vicaress in cowed tone give three minute to make up mind mr snow want one minute will tell know believe to be true mother be guilty be guilty since be dead corrected beatrice quietly believe one word hated in spite of fact that be a say dearest friend be right cried mr snow with hysterical vehemence did hate always always took from man loved yes may look look loved george hall father with heart be only governess poor plain mother be planter daughter rich beautiful be at school together be companion afterwards always detested now now detest daughter finished beatrice have mother beauty said mr snow cast venomous look on girl pale face so be reason kept away from camp spoke of to others so bitterly a did yes may a well know truth hate have beauty of mother who stole george hall away from have not money saw to how must prevent inheriting money suppose allude to mr alpenny fortune because told mr alpenny if left money to must accuse of being accomplice of mr hall in murder of colonel miss hedge miss hall like to call hate so much must like to put rope round neck yet be daughter of man loved said beatrice wondering at bitterness more reason must hate daughter yes daughter of amy hall whom loathed with soul if so why did not accuse of murder gave chance of repentance mr snow be not reason did not tell police because must not prove accusation for know for police know may have murdered father mr snow laughed scornfully murder george hall why loved very ground trod on can prove nothing against can prove anything against mother can not mr snow rose flung arm about exultingly be stopping at grange be lying awake on night wondering when misery must end what misery misery of loving father of seeing with mother sowed dissension between be never happy wicked woman be woman that answer said mr snow sullenly mind telling a can not accuse of anything if did say that told what be now telling must deny who must believe against respectable woman like be wicked woman said beatrice again go on with what have to say want to get away from a soon a possible may not be in such hurry to leave on future occasion retorted mr snow have not done with one yet know much that must like to know what be will tell later meanwhile tell be lying awake heard noise stole out saw mr hall ready dressed to go out into passage be at head of stair with be old alpenny for be old even then stopped talking for time a saw apparently be persuading to do something then went along towards wing where colonel hall slept went back to bed wondering what mr hall meant by keeping midnight appointment with old alpenny never suspected truth next morning necklace be gone george hall murdered did shouted mr snow savagely mother alpenny be accomplice wished to get necklace be afraid to kill george made woman do then got necklace after cut poor george throat alpenny made marry under threat of denouncing a what be murderess murderess daughter of one jeered mr snow pointing mocking finger at pale girl lie said beatrice shaken not convinced black patch be found under window of father room be open now that man with black patch killed mr alpenny for necklace for know believe also killed father admit that mr alpenny have necklace how did get orchard said that alpenny killed father mother did alpenny be merely accomplice wait major ruck declared that colonel hall gave necklace before death to mr hedge now know that mr hedge be really mr hall believe father gave mother necklace doubtless what else say be true mother be forced to marry alpenny because threatened to denounce must have be suspected of crime can see that plainly else must not have changed name to hedge wonder be not recognised one knew here said mr snow gloomily be only one night at convent grange on night husband be murdered pshaw be guilty believe insisted beatrice rising defiantly will prove truth of what say durban must speak out now will accuse mother a accuse why did durban go to serve alpenny for nothing because alpenny wishing to get faithful servant for nothing said must denounce mr hall unless married brought durban with durban know truth have kept silent year because dared not speak out without hanging mr hall be dead now so nothing can be done said beatrice sadly at least memory can be cleared will clear if delve into mother past will find more thing than murder in said mr snow sneeringly loved major ruck what loved major ruck tell also be at convent grange on night crime be committed believe that mother be about to elope with when saw dressed at midnight with alpenny talking to oh said beatrice coldly thought that be there a say to murder father intended to do so then elope with ruck alpenny caught in toil for know may have seen talking after murder alpenny may have gone with to get necklace make out very pretty case mr snow said beatrice heart beating loudly quickly for weight of evidence did seem to be against hall however will see durban then come again to see good day moved away while mr snow laughed chapter xv curious coincidence be very strange thought beatrice a walked towards convent grange have learned much from orchard from mr snow yet apparently there be more to learn who have killed colonel hall who have murdered jarvis alpenny be assassin one same if found assassin must learn who possessed necklace seemed to account for crime finally did discover identity of assassin necklace must be able to learn mystery lurked in background of vivian life be question beatrice asked on way home in spite of mr snow assertion significant tale of midnight meeting with girl must not bring to believe that mother be guilty woman must never think of cutting man throat probably when frail little woman such a mr hall be reported to have be must not have power then again alpenny be murdered in same way mr hall have be lying in hurstable churchyard for year also if mr hall be guilty what have black patch have reappeared in second crime to do with first one seemed impossible that riddle must be answered on arriving at grange beatrice found dinah jerry snow walking down avenue apparently have be quarrelling for did not walk arm in arm a usual jerry be a sulky a dinah be tearful be matter asked beatrice stopping be jerry cruelty mourned dinah whose sorrow made look even plainer than usual be dinah foolishness retorted jerry walked on come back cried girl will never never never speak to again do wish to break heart be breaking grumbled young man same returned to where two girl be standing after have put up with from mother complained dinah oh leave mother alone wish must leave alone be always highly disagreeable to believe be family failing concluded dinah spitefully marry then intend to bear beatrice listened to with covert amusement knew that two loved one too well to think of parting might be ground of quarrel come come said soothingly prepared to play part of peacemaker what be matter be jerry jealous snapped dinah be very jealous pointed to jerry who still looked sulky have be flirting with girl be in village hour ago there be jerry a bold a brass talking to red haired minx who squinted doe squint growled jerry there see defends dinah cried jerry in desperation how can be so silly love only love that horrid girl saw looking at cat may look at king certainly be cat though be not king well said beatrice preparing to move on be going back to house two can settle yourselves dinah clung to friend wo be left alone with jerry well then explain said beatrice impatiently for have too many worry of own to take profound interest in frivolous one of milk water lover will explain said mr snow defiantly there be young lady know in london young cried dinah be thirty five painted well then came down here to inn met outside exchanged few word with said that wanted to know nearest way to down seems that father be shepherd on down man called orchard what cried beatrice disengaging from dinah too fond embrace must scarcely believe ear that must come from seeing ex butler for first time to stumble so to speak across daughter be indeed extraordinary coincidence jerry looked at amazed a must not understand tone why do look so astonished asked have only lately come down from seeing orchard said oh by way dinah added turning to girl vivian came back with from brighton said dinah crossly have to see someone will not be back until late came home myself passed through village to see jerry making love to horrid girl jerry have coolness to follow only to explain urged jerry come dinah be silly know lady only little be on one of paper belonging to editorial firm doe fashion column might dress better then retorted dinah crossly determined not to be appeased saw cheapness in line of dress ah said jerry artfully can not set off dress like be silly cried miss paslow smiled for what be lady name asked beatrice lady dinah tossed head when father be shepherd dare say very bad one miss maud carr be name said mr snow ignoring dinah much to wrath maud beatrice remembered that be also name of vivian dead wife again wondered at long arm of coincidence know very little about said jerry in injured tone save that writes about woman fashion have met at journalistic club in london of course when saw passed time of day with passed hour snapped dinah very pleasantly be sure be not bit ashamed of birth continued jerry still ignoring dinah a punishment never knew father be shepherd in london confessed to here quite easily that be artfulness commented dinah why be so curious about woman asked beatrice girl shrugged shoulder be not curious denied a have just seen old orchard be strange that daughter must have be speaking to jerry not at beatrice jerry be always fond of painted horrid woman who never pay for dress because write for fashion paper must be ashamed to earn living in way well faced round to impenitent mr snow what have to say nothing said jerry crossly be always nagging dinah after cried miss paslow looking up to see why heaven did not fall well be be word failed turned back be going home be at end sped up avenue glancing back meanwhile on occasion to see if jerry followed jerry did nothing of sort explained to beatrice why stood ground dinah need lesson said gravely have idea how nag at ca speak to one without getting into pelting rage show how love said beatrice soothingly want to be loved in selfish way be just like mother want one affection nag whole time saying be for good have have quite enough of in mother without taking on in wife want woman who will cheer up look upon a something to be looked up to will punish said jerry wrathfully expects to run after wo will stay here talk to be busy said beatrice taking step two away have to go to camp to see durban need be at convent grange looking for oh then will go to at once better wait to hear what have to say urged jerry be about murder of mr alpenny beatrice stopped short wondering what be about to hear have discovered anything asked breathlessly ca say if what have discovered be of use explained mr snow might put police on track of assassin what have found out well be down whitechapel other night said jerry making inquiry into robbery have taken place there be detective with saw manner of queer thing also heard manner of queer talk in one way picked up information about black patch gang black patch gang echoed beatrice yes yes be gang of rogue thief vagabond went on mr snow police have never be able to lay hand on head of gang break up gang go about committing burglary stealing thing picking pocket must have kind of academy like fagin mused jerry know one by black patch worn over left eye just like man saw yes thought of when story said jerry detective thought same be going to hunt out gang learn whereabouts of headquarters beatrice moved forward to place cautious hand on arm struck know if struck detective struck that alpenny who be precious scoundrel beg pardon go on said impatiently know be stepfather always thought wicked man believe be fence said jerry solemnly what be that chap who disposes of stolen good yes really believe be why alpenny lived in country black patch gang brought stolen good down here got rid of in way expect police will come down make thorough search throughout camp there may be manner of secret hiding place jerry protested beatrice who be very pale a various thought rushed through mind never saw london thief in camp indeed one disreputable did ever see client asked jerry impressively mr alpenny kept business very quiet have need to if be fence beatrice remember how key be in counting house where man be murdered how assassin must not have got out unless used key believe there be entrance to railway carriage assassin came in by way along with rest of alpenny precious client be quite sure old man be head of gang there be waterloo know said jerry quickly dinah told about mr lilly told waterloo be blackguard detective in whitechapel explained what scoundrel be one of worst why did come down here know murmured beatrice then flashed across mind that tramp have come to see vivian coupling desire with speech of late jarvis alpenny regarding vivian crime vivian secret trouble be so anxious to find out girl suddenly turned pale wondered if paslow be one of black patch gang be impossible said beatrice with gasp leaned against tree to support what be impossible asked jerry here hold up be right said recovering with violent effort little weariness be have be on down remember see how can connect gang with mr alpenny remember be murdered by man with black patch over eye yes girl broke off hope police wo come down here said with pale lip wondering if vivian conduct must bear investigation just will said jerry bluntly hope so will be able to make lot out of matter if loot be found why editor may raise salary be worth cried indignant voice near at hand dinah appeared from amongst tree how dare treat in way jerry snow why did come after why did dinah asked beatrice hurriedly have be listening long heard be that jerry wanted salary raised what have be talking about eyed two suspiciously be jealous of beatrice demanded mr snow scornfully what nonsense when know be going to marry vivian really think will marry take back ring beatrice waited to hear more leaving dinah pouring out voluble wrath on devoted head of lover ran up avenue wondering what further revelation must hear be day of wonder have learned that be daughter of colonel hall have heard dead mother accused of murder by mr snow now discovered alpenny a be probably case have be connected with gang of rogue what must be end of terrible thing must not tell ran on anxious to reach own room in order to think matter over quite forgot that jerry have told durban be waiting to see old servant be on watch hardly have set foot on terrace when issued from house came towards with smile died away however when saw pale face be matter missy asked anxiously beatrice looked at calmly wasted time in explaining have learned at last what must not tell missy cried durban swarthy face grew green a always did when be startled be daughter of colonel hall who be murdered here mother be really mr hall who called mr hedge married alpenny durban gasped who told orchard who be butler here now be shepherd on down be true said durban flinging wide hand knew must find out be glad have found out why did not tell be prevented by whom first by alpenny then by major ruck man with whom mother be about to elope durban looked at swiftly orchard never told that mr snow told have seen then know know that accuses mother of crime of murder of father colonel hall be lie said durban between teeth must not stick at lie to harm mother how can harm dead might harm memory of dead said durban evasively what else have heard from mr jerry snow have just heard that there be gang of thief in london called black patch gang augh groaned durban casting down eye go on mr alpenny be connected with mr snow say that be fence who disposed of stolen good where did mr snow hear story from various people in whitechapel rumour only said durban striving to appear calm there be not word of truth in mr alpenny be wicked not so bad a missy swear believe that mr snow have spoken truth said beatrice sharply be still trying to keep in dark for good missy for good for mr paslow safety know what mean gasped durban hoarsely know exactly since will not be candid said girl wearily have found out much will find more when discover necklace obi necklace have never found that be looking for missy implore there be curse on necklace caused death of father disgrace of mother murder of mr alpenny how do know have mr alpenny necklace yes mother gave to alpenny for then where be know can not tell if did know must never tell missy enough sorrow trouble have come about over necklace accursed thing durban broke down with groan fairly ran away leaving amazed beatrice mistress of field chapter xvi interruption there be certainly enough to think about beatrice retreated to room proceeded to reason out meaning of have heard be evident that vivian durban be in way connected with criminality in connection with mr alpenny vocation of fence since refused to speak waterloo apparently be member of black patch gang have come down other day to see vivian beatrice remembered now how vivian have hinted that be connected with rogue vagabond how appeared to be fearful a to what major ruck might say ruck probably be member of criminal association in case a durban have confessed be decoy duck to lure unwary into late mr alpenny net question now presented to puzzled girl be whether alpenny being dead organisation must end old usurer have be extremely clever wanting brain association might disband for want of competent head ruck certainly a appeared to have authority might become moving spirit from what beatrice have seen of did not think be capable of handling such difficult matter did not much care desired be to learn what paslow have to do with rascality if durban be implicated in roguery if so to rescue must not believe that of kind men whom loved so dearly must act in blackguardly way in manner two have become entangled in alpenny net knowing ruck be making capital out of knowledge be conclusion beatrice arrived at determined to force vivian to explain love dearly assured a stared at pale drawn face in looking glass can not marry until know exactly what part have taken in terrible doings with resolve went down to dinner found vivian there in very happy state of mind lately cloud have passed away from brow seemed more like old self of day when have never guessed what abyss there be under foot under foot indeed a must not separate even in thought from vivian paslow dear beatrice said coming towards with smile then when saw face stopped short just a durban have done why darling what have be doing with nothing replied beatrice quietly after dinner will tell then there be something said paslow seeing how contradicted trying to make speak out yes answered with effort there be thing have learned much to day about what from whom paslow gasped out question heart beat violently felt sick with apprehension what have heard why did look at in way will tell after dinner want to tell now said beatrice very directly be spared further speech for at moment dinah came into room followed by jerry in evening dress have made up with jerry have asked pardon said in cheerful voice so invited to dinner a reward hope be good dinner said jerry blandly deserve big reward for having given in to be always man duty to give in to woman said miss paslow hope think be wife duty to bully husband on occasion little storm clear air further argument be cut short by sound of gong vivian who have be watching beatrice time gave arm led way into dining room while lover wrangled behind table looked dainty neat a be brilliant with flower glittered with old silver cut crystal in spite of difficulty paslow have always kept up certain
