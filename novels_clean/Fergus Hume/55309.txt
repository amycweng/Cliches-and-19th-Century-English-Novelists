'em see doctor lifted right hand of corpse elli looked eagerly saw that forefinger of hand be black with dried blood chapter iii open verdict next day body of unfortunate man be removed to dukesfield morgue twenty four hour later coroner held inquiry in coffee room of lancaster hotel public interest be greatly roused over matter ubiquitous reporter of great daily amongst harry ca attended note book in hand to supply reader with sensational detail rumour first set afloat by babbling tongue of mr basket be prevalent that mr moxton have killed husband with carving knife be known from same source that have lived lonely life since taking up abode in myrtle villa that moxton have neglected shamefully that have left nightly by herself have even denied comfort company of servant hence be openly declared that cruel treatment contemptuous desertion have driven mr moxton to commit crime theory found favour in sight of dr elli avowed champion of pretty widow if be guilty must not have announced crime a did argued with ca must have be easy for to let corpse lie on path night pretend ignorance when be discovered by milkman also if struck blow have whole night at disposal to vanish into unknown flight must have proved guilt bob besides must have be tracked down on tacit confession of crime agree with nothing be known of moxtons a kept very much to hardly anyone saw knew by sight must have disappeared like drop of water into ocean of london without leaving trace for most cunning detective to follow instead of doing wisest plan if killed husband stay face matter out in innocence ca produced newspaper from pocket can suggest theory for remaining here pointed to paragraph in death column three day ago edgar allan moxton great picture dealer of bond street died leaving large fortune behind now dead man a judge from similarity of christian surname be probably son of moxton if so have lived must doubt inherit money a be dead mr moxton widow may do so fortune be worth running risk for bob faith of elli be not to be shaken similarity of name may be mere coincidence such a occurs more frequently in real life than in fiction also even if can prove relationship doe not show that mr moxton be waiting for fortune that be even aware of death give benefit of doubt harry give much more than jury will do elli public opinion be against bah what do tinker tailor candlestick maker know of matter may not know much now will soon be primed with sufficient evidence to give verdict jury be chosen from class mention so contemptuously dr elli knew very well knew moreover that rumour spoke ill of widow therefore be with doubt whether must have fair hearing that attended inquest by time arrived hotel be so crowded that people overflowed into road young man pushed way into public room found that proceeding have already commenced glanced round for mr moxton saw seated near coroner clothed in black closely veiled listening attentively to drake evidence inspector testimony be brief meagre for police have a yet discovered nothing described finding of body futile search for weapon with murder have be committed failure of attempt to learn where deceased have so regularly spent night nevertheless identity of dead man have be established for be son of bond street picture dealer edgar allan moxton strange to say father son have died within few hour of one former in morning from natural cause latter shortly before midnight by violence finally drake stated that hitherto police have found no clue likely to lead to identification capture of murderer show that police suspect mr moxton murmured elli to ca doctor be next witness deposed a to summons by mr moxton examination of corpse deceased have died from stab of broad bladed knife have pierced left lung blow must have be struck by strong arm averred since blade have penetrated through overcoat inside coat waistcoat shirt must woman have struck blow asked one of jury exceptionally strong woman might have done so responded elli eye be turned on trim slight figure of mr moxton there be general feeling that doctor answer exonerated from having personally committed murder be of too frail delicate physique to have struck home knife with so sure deadly aim yet might have put weapon into hand for seemed incredible that must be ignorant of tragedy took place within few yard of when mr moxton name be called out stood up to give evidence present drew long breath waited eagerly for to speak hitherto public curiosity have be languid now appearance of principal witness stimulated to fever heat from dead man widow if from anyone truth of strange tragedy must come mr moxton threw back veil when took oath revealed pretty face somewhat marred by sleeplessness weeping be colourless red eyed low voiced

no name did nothing moan died in few moment examination lasted considerable time concluded available evidence for time being on meagre intelligence to be gleaned from jury framed verdict stated that deceased edgar moxton have be murdered by person person unknown chapter iv reading of blood sign in progressive time duration of proverbial wonderment have be reduced from nine day to nine hour dukesfield murder case be mysterious dramatic yet even with element of popularity became stale out of date within week attention of mass class be more le concentrated on visit of eastern potentate whose amazing jewel still more amazing barbarism appealed to popular humour moxton death strange circumstance attendant thereon ceased to be commented upon by newspaper faded out of public mind continued to be talked about only in neighbourhood wherein tragedy occurred yet even in dukesfield after fortnight of discussion interest grew languid be just a well for mr moxton circumstance stood thus for in defiance of public opinion still continued to inhabit myrtle villa husband maltreated body be quietly buried in dukesfield cemetery so quietly indeed that save necessary undertaker men not single person followed unfortunate victim to untimely grave be only justice to say that mr moxton must have done so for earnest advice of elli knowing unpopularity cause warned against thrusting forward like wise woman widow took hint passionately resented reason for be given when ceremony be at end elli came to tell about defended to after fashion of woman with many word much indignation a soon a must obtain hearing doctor assured that in case such argument be needle be firm believer in innocence mr moxton declared in earnestness must not trouble about idle gossip of neighbourhood people will talk be just chance that did not call martyr instead of criminal be shameful that friendless woman must be so abused be not altogether friendless mr moxton if will accept a champion will be proud to occupy position widow looked steadfastly at elli something perceptible to woman only saw in eye caused to lower own replied indirectly with true feminine evasion will always be glad to have for friend doctor have be be very good to after speech mr moxton became reserved hesitating finally silent so elli aware that eye have revealed too much took leave in few minute by time be conscious that have fallen in love with pretty widow marvelled that must lose heart after three week acquaintance in opinion of love at first sight be fallacy at one time elli have be of wiseacre now personal experience proved truth of saying mr moxton be not supremely beautiful woman have young comely face extraordinarily fascinating manner be to last that elli succumbed made scarcely effort to resist influence yet mr moxton be woman with humble if not doubtful past there be slur on reputation a widow of murdered man elli must not help admitting to that be wife for struggling doctor yet in spite of such admission be bent upon marrying must opportunity offer in meantime kept own counsel told one not even ca of new element in life same evening elli friend sat down after supper to discus

injustice of terrestrial treatment bob announced gleefully have be made theatrical critic for early bird story of mine have be accepted by piccadilly magazine good news old boy congratulate be reason for sudden discovery of merit moxton murder think editor be pleased with blood thunder report gave of hence set to criticise drama said elli drily suppose so perhaps think that if can describe murder of human being can deal with slaughter of drama comedy by incompetent actor profession must be flattered by preconceived idea of capability harry nonsense be thinking of extreme case only now have better salary can help bob will be like auvergnat carrier in balzac story aid great physician to reach rightful position for benefit of humanity thank harry fear be not sufficiently gifted to deserve denial besides have be discovered also what have patient yes morbid lady with nerve saw name in connection with discovery of poor devil body came to see about own trouble nerve murder see connection did however said elli with shrug asked to save life be in danger a may guess be nothing excitable female with too much money employment wrote prescription humoured hypochondria so pleased that

degenerate into humbug old man dear fellow in dealing with woman one must be humbug more le like be true in case woman always prefer graceful humbug of world to genuine honest creature be why have not be snapped up by rich heiress elli laughed absently being more taken up with own thought than with humour of friend yes believe patient will send others sooner later will scrape together practice in dukesfield in year to come may even be able to set up a eye specialist in harley street bob in harley street in street so long a can make good income when become known a authority on disease of eye be

harry to have name with for be public who pay well well that will come believe in future bob will have wish for income name wife wife elli turned restlessly in comfortable old arm chair laughed in somewhat embarrassed fashion wife repeated doubtfully of course intend to remain single day do must marry bob for doctor without wife tactful wife mind be like coach without wheel hope however here harry tone became serious that will not marry widow widow quite understand continued ca inattentive to interpolation wife of man who have met with violent death harry what make think that mr moxton so far elli proceeded violently then stopped with conviction that have betrayed secret cap fit see remarked ca pointedly shut up in turn for next few minute there be embarrassed silence man being willing to speak lest word must act like spark in powder magazine elli threw down pipe a be fashion when annoyed took to rapid walking in limited space of sitting room ca eased position on sofa waited development yes be true said doctor in loud voice so a to drown opposition be in love with mr moxton now what do say only be hard enough for to make career without seeking for clog will prevent rising in profession how do know mr moxton must prove such clog know surmise only be ignorant of lady personality save from what have learnt in chance moment be in like position know better than do possibly

in vexed tone not yet maybe will do so when time come after harry be charming woman charming pretty doubt be wife for before can answer question must know past whitewash present dr elli sat down aghast good heaven ca surely think guilty know enough about case to say said ca meditatively mr moxton puzzle confess for instance tell lie tell lie repeated widow champion with great indignation yes in most unblushing manner at inquest said that took husband body in arm felt blood flowing from wound in back now be impression that never touched body how can prove very simply when came into room wore plain black dress with cuff of white linen now if have handled body have touched wound be only natural to suppose that cuff must be stained with blood noticed however that be not be stronger proof that be innocent of actual murder maybe bob doe not prove that be ignorant of who killed man told lie about handling of body a said seems to added ca reflectively that mr moxton be shielding assassin why must shield murderer ah that must learn from woman if be completely in dark about matter why doe tell falsehood then that cypher blood sign on arm dying man wrote to indicate to wife name of murderer ca prove cried elli much excited only by deduction why must man write in cypher if wife did not know cypher information whatever be might have be intended for someone else think so moxton knew that wife must be first to discover dead body wrote message in cypher for information be only reasonable to think so mr moxton say doe not know what cypher mean precisely be telling lie shielding true criminal how do know that cypher contains name of criminal harry because can read cypher be ca unexpected reply found out key yesterday look here bob jumped up from sofa crossing to writing table

arter whereupon gossip waddled away with breakfast tray may appear strange that cultured man like elli must listen to coarse babbling of uneducated woman have reason for doing so for sake of protecting mr moxton be needful that must know gossip of neighbourhood none must so well enlighten on point a mr basket several time openly expressed conviction of mr moxton guilt made elli wince for above reason must have ordered out of room however self control gained two piece of information firstly that mr moxton have received no masculine visitor since arrival in dukesfield secondly that carving knife with murder from nature of wound might have be committed have disappeared elli be now satisfied that widow have lover be disturbed over concealment loss did not know to call of carving knife if one mr moxton be have be in house must know whereabouts of knife for enlightenment on point in order to satisfy doubt elli made up mind to call on widow acting on impulse of moment did so strangely enough mr moxton not only welcomed eagerly informed that arrival be opportune if have not come must have sent for said conducted into cheerful little sitting room white paint chinese matting furniture covered with bright hued chintz what be matter mr moxton there be nothing wrong hope oh want advice be only friend be proud of position mr moxton hope will permit a friend to ask few plain question little woman resolute face grew pale about death murmured yes know that there be slur on name in connection with a friend wish to remove that slur by assisting to hunt down murderer be odd true thing mr moxton have same habit a elli of walking up down room when annoyed at conclusion of doctor last speech rose suddenly took turn to compose mind be very good of to think of helping said abruptly why must because wish to be friend know that be in danger be in danger if allude to preposterous accusation killed husband if need be can protect must occasion arise by denouncing someone else mr moxton turned on elli with frown what do mean rumour say that if did not murder moxton know who did that be shielding oh be shielding man said widow catching at final word set mind at rest doctor be shielding man mr moxton why not be candid tell told knew at inquest replied sullenly can swear that know who killed husband be on oath at inquest tell cried woman passionately will not swear again to very good said elli coldly see that doubt doubt trust more than think doctor elli in spite of what said to before be surrounded on side by difficulty danger one false step heaven know what may happen ca tell dare not be friend must help how can when wo confess truth if only dare mr moxton took turn up room came back to elli with more determined expression on face listen doctor will tell can afterwards can ask what question will will reply to best of ability thus will understand one elli looked at trim little figure in black dress at widow cap on fair hair at candid face beneath a have be before stated mr moxton be comely rather than pretty have firmly moulded chin resolute expression on lip in grey eye be on whole woman of courage resource how one so sensible must have tied to brute like moxton must have submitted to neglect cruelty for long month be more than elli must understand perhaps be one of unanswerable problem of feminine nature woman can not explain elli be puzzled in hope of gaining insight into apparently contradictory nature waited eagerly for promised explanation on day after murder in morning be said mr moxton have visitor card with name richard busham be brought to by charwoman engaged owing to event of previous night refused to see went away saying must call again up to present have not done so who be richard busham do know not personally never saw have never met be cousin of late husband nephew of moxton of bond street now believe that came to see about will be vexed at not having admitted why not call on have address heard from edgar mr busham be solicitor have office in lane near temple late mr moxton of bond street be mean shabby man who employed cheapest labour must get believe nephew did legal business for now edgar mr busham hated one when husband be disinherited mr busham be declared heir by old moxton if will held good must not waste time coming to see from very fact of visit believe that edgar father repented at last moment made new will leaving property to can make certain of by seeing busham mr moxton looked troubled be afraid said faintly be terribly afraid see why must be mr busham called on morning after murder must have learnt then of loss yet have never repeated visit have never written line ca conceive reason for acting in way unless here hesitated belief that murdered edgar must not be so foolish a to believe that without evidence even if did inquest must have disabused mind of idea for be afraid to call have heard edgar talk of mr busham be dangerous man dr elli for know may be laying trap for tell truth will prevent falling into trap mr moxton hesitated then burst out defiantly what be wish to know firstly if know meaning of blood sign on husband arm no then be wiser than for do mr moxton bit lip what do know that sign stand for letter r u z what lizard a think be mean know mr moxton what be meaning of three letter r u z know really have husband friend with name beginning ruz with initial r u z not that ever heard of what about lizard can not understand meaning comprehend letter cypher no triple denial be so emphatic that elli be forced to believe appeared strange that must be so ignorant of matter virtually concerned death of husband looked keenly at for sign of confusion brow of mr moxton be a open a day if lied be wonderful actress elli did not believe that lied being too much in love to consider so deliberately base well said making attempt in direction to fathom mystery landlady mr basket called to see other day to spy out land oh saw through pretended kindness at once wished to find proof of guilt a have nothing to conceal gave opportunity of convincing be innocent very proof gave convinced of guilt said elli warmly mr basket be dangerous woman mr moxton one of well meaning people who do so much harm have special grudge against have got into mind that killed husband with carving knife did not be nonsense talking like then where be carving knife mr basket searched must not find now belief that have hidden what rubbish said mr moxton with contempt edgar threw away threw away why because knew that kept by to protect against tramp burglar so out of sheer devilry week before died threw into garden behind bush be there now searched everywhere for after murder must not find why do ask because broad bladed knife be used to kill husband might have be carving knife murderer must have picked up made use of woman appeared uneasy interrupted elli how must murderer know that knife be in garden only two people knew where be thrown one be edgar other must not advise to say that in public mr moxton a people might count a good circumstantial evidence that killed oh cried widow clenching fist do believe guilty be there need to ask that question why why have plenty of evidence against have placed in hand by confessing about carving knife why do not denounce a guilty how can ask cried elli carried out of usual equable self by vehemence know ca see love love be why believe guiltless chapter vi fresh discovery in placing in dock so to speak mr moxton have be defiant loud voiced reckless daring elli to denounce for crime of knew innocent refusal cause gave for such refusal took by surprise long since have guessed that doctor loved did not count on proclaiming fact so soon must have done so have not be thrown off guard by appeal demand answer to produced on side stupefied calm elli frightened at own boldness remained silent after uttering fatal word mr moxton on other hand felt wrath die away in sheer surprise then cheek flushed from unexplained emotion light beamed from eye love murmured softly looked at elli something in regard tone in whole attitude seemed to melt frozen silence of man sprang forward touched hand be not angry asked with eagerness touch recalled mr moxton to sense of what owed to herself woke in feeling of wrath at audacity of man who must speak word to woman lately widowed in so terrible manner how dare cried angrily retreating what must think of to talk like think world of replied elli doggedly have said truth deceive what take for truth be fantasy can not love one whom have known only three week love can be born of glance in romance grant not in real life paused burst out laughing oh be too absurd elli be piqued fail to see absurdity speak a feel for moment mr moxton appeared to meditate answer to plain statement suddenly bit lip drew back shook head speak folly think madness said consider be three week widow husband died by violence death be not avenged name be smirched be time for such talk let forget word have uttered can not forget then must lose friend said mr moxton determinedly really can not meet on term be newly made widow not possible wife for in future let future look after cried petulantly what have to do be to attend to present wish to help do so by leaving crime to be punished by heaven smirched name can bear have borne worse thing oh look so astonished dr elli have have queer up down topsy turvy sort of life day may tell to know other well enough for yet if find that deserve confidence broke off sentence abruptly never mind that now have work to do yes will take advice about calling on mr busham very day will call ask about will must meet here at three o'clock doctor elli felt breath taken away by boldness of demand if wish to come of course wish must

please a must dress for visit mind will expect at three o'clock to tell result of interview at three o'clock repeated elli earnestly so parted when doctor found in broad cheerful sunshine of jubilee road be not quite certain if be asleep awake to mr moxton be more of enigma than murder must not understand attitude must guess what motive have in acting thus strangely be apparently pleased that loved be angry at abrupt declaration must not gain confidence yet requested to meet at three o'clock to ask advice about visit what be to understand from such medley of contradiction sought in own mind for possible explanation must find none so concluding that be more sensible course to posse soul in patience until sphinx explained own riddle returned home here to surprise found friend of morbid lady come to consult about heart in joy of such promise of increasing practice forgot mr moxton eccentricity in similar situation woman must not have forgotten byron line give reason for man love be of man life thing apart 't be woman whole existence nevertheless when mind be le occupied with material thing feeling about mr moxton revived waited impatiently for hour of three must seem that circumstance be about to involve in drama might be tragedy of woman life felt eager for call to step on stage what part must be assigned to must not guess be to be husband of heroine merely friend must pose a foil to shadowy lover in whose existence guilt ca believed altogether elli be in dark afraid to venture forward for fear of unknown waited for hand to draw on to doom in plain english for hand guidance of mr moxton strange thought passing through doctor mind made fear that usually accurate balance be disturbed shortly after three o'clock struck from bran new brick tower of bran new dukesfield church saw walking briskly down road even in pre occupation noted trim figure decided way in set down lifted foot general air of alert resolution stamped whole being here be woman

searching glance at amazed face of elli look for will said abruptly left room by time doctor capacity for astonishment be completely exhausted mr moxton conduct became more extraordinary at interview

sharp wit to work harry tell what mean told before replied ca coolly flew in rage with saying that have ground for statement now have learned ground repeat belief zirknitz be lover of mr moxton be shielding from consequence of having killed husband doubt at request ca wo believe of poor woman harry fact be stubborn thing bob case be a clear a noonday to elli still believing in innocence of woman loved must have replied somewhat violently to declaration that mr basket entered with supper be now seven o'clock for since ca have be appointed critic to early bird have altered meal from nine to seven in few minute mr basket not being encouraged to chatter on particular night left room wondering what must be matter with gentleman elli trifled with food feeling too worried to enjoy le nervous ca did full justice to mr basket idea of irish stew between mouthful talked answered doctor objection be nonsense mr basket saying that mr moxton have visitor husband from what tell must be shady people poor devil be dead so let say ill of mr moxton daresay received visitor at night when mr basket tradesman spy be not about have ground for making such accusation fumed elli keep calm bob be speaking without prejudice ground well if have not why did mr moxton faint at mention of name why did lie about sign why did feign ignorance of place where husband went night must have known tell bob that mr moxton be fighting inch daresay be angry at persistence in following up case come now own up did not ask to leave matter alone well did admitted doctor with reluctance confess that understand mr moxton act be doubtful word be strange agree with that know more about matter than chooses to confess same harry be not absolute fool even where woman be concerned there be something in mr moxton look manner satisfies that be true good pure brave woman h be conduct doe not justify use of single adjective of sort know know same believe in because be in love love be blind rubbish believe in worn out saying can see mr moxton imperfection a plainly a can be not saint by manner of mean sinner harry can not believe be what make out if inspired murder why doe not run away because be fighting for fortune old boy be not even certain that will be in existence so say replied ca pouring out beer beg leave to doubt that artless pose be firm conviction that knew of old moxton repentance eleventh hour testament that got husband to make will in favour that induced lover zirknitz to put out of way so that might enjoy money together be to reap fruit of crime that stay on here bob be theory so be earlier statement yet have be proved true by daresay m zirknitz came to see mr moxton in evening when husband be at merryman music hall never heard of place harry perhaps not have be in existence only for two year usual variety entertainment know man called otto schwartz keep german typical lager beer german not at bad fellow dr elli slowly lighted pipe wonder why moxton went so regularly to place said reflectively well might have gone there to make love to one of lady who do turn rather think said ca significantly that object be to gamble from wife say about monte carlo other place man be confirmed card sharper gambling be not allowed in london doubt good many vice be not allowed in most immaculate of city in tartuffe of capital exist same know for certain nobody doe be rumoured that there be secret gambling hell connected with apparently innocent music hall of herr schwartz elli glanced at watch be getting on for eight o'clock remarked let go to soho to night if like have particular engagement reason want to learn can about moxton if went there to gamble herr schwartz will know of also might learn something of zirknitz a book prof autograph also be friend of moxton so be not unlikely went with to secret hell talk of very good let go at once said ca rising a seem to have become amateur detective let conduct case with due discretion there be one piece of evidence have overlooked what be that cab stand cab stand have to do with murder bob bob can write about eye disease can not make use of own optic be probable that murderer of moxton zirknitz wished to get away a speedily a possible from scene of crime so be equally probable that made for cab stand railway station be much further away cab stand be comparatively near jubilee road cabman came forward at inquest daresay cabman have right to suspect fare of murder will question on rank before go to soho let find out if mr zirknitz took cab between quarter past half past eleven elli shrugged shoulder a please seems to futile to waste time in asking question can not be answered have yet to learn if time be being wasted retorted ca ending conversation for time being young men left house by time ca have become quite eager to solve mystery willingly placed quick wit indomitable perseverance at service of friend admired greatly there be quite david jonathan feeling between two annoyed ca to think that doctor might throw away life on woman a believed mr moxton to be undertook case in hope of proving unworthiness at present moment appearance be decidedly against yet in face of such black evidence elli still clung to belief in instinctive feeling based on reasonable foundation be so insisted upon by elli that friend became quite angry be most sensible men who become greatest fool on occasion said with rough speech of intimate friendship have known woman only three week be absolutely ignorant of past life save what have chosen to tell circumstantial actual evidence point to not only a shady person a positive criminal yet in face of look upon a saint told so before feel sure be good woman can give reason be satisfied without one a to evidence harry know most innocent person can be wrongly accused can be even hanged on evidence false a be appears sufficient there be lesurques case for oh courier of lyon know can quote at least dozen others same believe in mr moxton well do for know may be protecting sister ca stopped short have sister asked believe so at least in book told about thomas gordon have written name of daughter laura janet gordon first be of course mr moxton second name must be that of sister perhaps sister may be dead may be absent from england in event see how can connect at with murder doctor have reply to pertinent observation a after remark about sister have be made vaguely without ulterior meaning turn of street brought to cab stand at ca a journalist be well known immediately began to question men in chaffing popular way be ready enough to answer question more so a be concerning murder one declared that particular man have hired cab between eleven twelve on night of august th old ike be one to know though said red faced cabman

mr moxton yet description fair hair trim figure might pas for wonder who be know harry be right after woman who cried fled like guilty person be janet gordon sister of mr moxton chapter viii music hall star must seem then from fresh discovery that third person be implicated in matter that person woman ca elli argued matter at great length in train continued argument a drove from st james station to soho doctor be convinced from old ike description that woman must be no other than mr moxton sister ca be more than doubtful might be general resemblance said besides if janet gordon came to see mr moxton on night why doe not sister say so be shielding tell insisted elli account for way in keep silent even to whom know a friend why must mr moxton shield sister bob suspect janet of crime oh from blood sign be plain that zirknitz murdered know what to think be plain that janet be at house night perhaps fled in terror on seeing crime committed however will ask mr moxton about matter will tell nothing now have found out so much think will if only to exonerate sister retorted elli if refuse will go to geneva square in pimlico interview miss gordon may have seen zirknitz kill poor devil then have fled to avoid being mixed up in matter well said ca a cab drew up before brilliantly lighted portal seems to that zirknitz be man to catch question may hear about here a appears

steady hand clear brain nerve of steel a spoke schwartz alone strolled past nodded to austrian frowned slightly when saw with elli then pausing by table tapped ca on shoulder with plump beringed hand mr ca mine goot frend vill with gome haf pisness with that gannot wait be there money in schwartz german cast look at zirknitz who be trifling with cigarette took out of handsome silver case dink zo said pointedly in case will come wait for here elli m zirknitz wish good evening ca went off in high spirit with fat schwartz so elli austrian be left alone table at be seated be placed at comparatively secluded corner out of crush of people glare of light yet quiet though be zirknitz after glance round appeared to be annoyed by position will come to box monsieur said rising fancy be more comfortable there friend ca will instruct waiter to bring to box when return here come doctor added zirknitz in whisper wish to speak with about murder thrill ran though elli a followed austrian up stair be man about to confess to crime be hardly probable perhaps intended to explain cypher yet that also be doubtful by time elli have seated in shady corner of box be thoroughly puzzled must conceive of reason why zirknitz must seek interview young man closed door removed coat hat offered elli cigarette doctor refused on plea that have smoked enough for must not bring to accept anything from hand of m zirknitz be of card sharper swindler murderer in belief elli decided to let austrian do most of talking hoping to trap if not into confession at least into damaging admission own rle be to say nothing to know nothing to give m zirknitz sufficiency of rope to weave halter situation be uncomfortable elli felt a though be dealing with graceful dangerous tiger required dexterous diplomatic handling be glad to meet doctor said zirknitz in quiet voice indeed have not done so here by chance must have called on with reference to murder say with reference to mr moxton husband will also monsieur with reference to husband cousin ah sclrat busham ah yes be name mr richard busham advocate do know moi monsieur non hope to know if doe not behave well to sister dr elli leant back in chair with gasp of astonishment sister mr moxton rather must say half sister did not know quel dommage how must know muttered elli not yet recovered from amazement because sister mr moxton told that be best friend hope be friend confess that be astonished to hear that be brother be not foreigner yes to speak truly there be blood relationship mr gordon mother of sister married father adolph zirknitz who be widower marriage of parent be bond between see have two sister oui mr moxton who be laura miss janet gordon who told polly miss horley ah muttered zirknitz with look of displeasure talk so much oh so very much here be discovery mythical lover of mr moxton murderer of husband if blood sign must be believed turned out to be brother by marriage queer sort of relationship truly elli have not met with before still one sufficiently close to put question of love out of case if so what be zirknitz motive for committing crime elli felt that be floundering in deep water why do tell asked suspiciously because laura say that be friend will help through with matter of murder partly of will busham be not easy man to deal with be annoyed that old moxton money must go to laura how do know will go to laura told thought there be will leaving to m zirknitz said elli after few moment of reflection will answer few question oh yes most certainly have much confidence in dr elli other did not reciprocate sentiment have sense enough to keep doubt to knew moxton very well presume oui da zirknitz shrugged shoulder be not friend be always drinking quarrelling like such men disliked dislike person be troublesome to do did visit at dukesfield did not hated understand sometimes at night went to see sister when be quiet elli reflected that visit must have be conducted with considerable secrecy seeing that mr basket be ignorant of to be sure took place after dark be at myrtle villa on night of murder answered zirknitz coolly promptly thought of going for sister janet changed mind moxton be drunk so fancied might make trouble then saw moxton on night oh most certainly be be zirknitz hesitated be in secret gambling room of schwartz finished elli guessing thought austrian face became a blank a sheet of white paper understand said with shrug oh well a please returned doctor coolly know nothing about matter to continue where left off where did see moxton last on night be killed oh at bar in there zirknitz be clever enough to take cue be drunk not very bad noisy troublesome drove away in cab right down to dukesfield know went home to bed be lie a elli shrewdly guessed austrian carried off with air showed that be adept at falsehood when did hear of murder saw next day in paper then why did not go to dukesfield to help mr moxton why must said zirknitz with charming smile murder be not pleasant like such thing might have got into trouble mind saying doctor mine have be life of adventure care not for police be afraid said elli wondering at selfishness brutal candour of confession certainement be afraid oh think badly of if like be so bad that can be worse will help sister over money because hope to get eh why not be extravagant elli felt strong desire to kick handsome smiling rascal doubted if even kick must rouse shame in man seemed to have moral sense just soulless brainless being who must commit crime doctor began to look upon a psychological curiosity felt more convinced than ever that have killed moxton want of money supplied motive who do think murdered moxton asked resolved to startle man into confession who do think murdered moxton repeated zirknitz blandly why dear monsieur think mr busham did elli jumped up on what ground do make such accusation ah will not tell now replied zirknitz coolly yet know well if mr moxton agrees may do so if will oh tell nothing see performance be over must go while austrian be reassuming coat hat elli felt sorely tempted to tell about blood sign accuse of killing moxton a yet have not sufficient evidence be unwise to put zirknitz on guard until must get into corner before must decide austrian nodded still smiling slipped out of box elli stooped to pick up stick followed almost immediately only to find that zirknitz have vanished into crowd what attitude be towards doctor must not quite determine will question mr moxton about brother reflected a went in search of ca journalist be in office of schwartz came out when heard inquiring for how did get on with zirknitz asked a hailed hansom oh pretty well talked great deal declared that busham killed deuce how can prove know refused to give proof cleared out before must question further what did schwartz want to see about to warn against cultivating zirknitz be bad egg worst in nest from account believe killed moxton on own hook denies that be at dukesfield on night denies like brass why left hall to take moxton home who say so schwartz do believe schwartz ca drew long long breath know what to believe said men form part of gang of rogue there be more devilry in case than know of bob chapter x strange denial on arriving at lodging men be too excited over case to feel inclined for sleep instead of going to bed made up fire lighted pipe continued discussion commenced in hansom be then that elli repeated statement of zirknitz anent connection with mr moxton sister so see man be mr moxton brother half brother not lover be really relation at retorted ca rather amazed by what heard mr moxton mother married father of zirknitz did make young man brother by marriage so far a parentage blood go must marry moxton to morrow tell man be lover possibly not after what zirknitz have told be if be true may be murderer for oh agree with there said doctor creature be one of selfish soulless being without moral feeling so long a must do so without risking neck quite believe must go so far a murder then be spendthrift sybarite so to get money be just possible killed moxton if be guilty mr moxton doe not know of wickedness then why did faint when name be mentioned because doubt be aware of dangerous nature perhaps may think guilty what mean be that up to moment mentioned name did not suspect zirknitz humph said ca looking at fire might be so what do intend to do now situation be complicated will see mr moxton tell have met zirknitz will tell also that accuses busham yes because from what said mr moxton may know ground upon base accusation then must be inculpated in crime cried ca decisively see said elli much annoyed come what may believe that poor little woman be innocent because be in love may be so assented doctor gloomily love warp mind perhaps whole case be so extraordinary mysterious that be difficult to say who be who be not concerned in in opinion whole lot be concerned in said ca desire for money be cause of crime by way asked schwartz about gordon sister know suppose yes praise only one janet gordon mr moxton appears to think very little of may be because doe not know so well janet be in employment of schwartz a programme seller attendant mr moxton being typewriting girl only occasionally visited hall in case admit that gordon girl appear to be shady yet think of marrying one will not do so if find out anything wrong said elli be true that be in love with mr moxton must past be bad one be sufficiently reasonable to crush down feeling still believe that be more sinned against than sinning will be task to solve mystery of murder to prove that belief be true one be with there bob will help with heart tell plainly that schwartz have very good opinion of mr moxton declares that be frivolous vain foolish be none of three harry believe janet janet be staunch honest clever honourable schwartz respect highly be not man to bestow praise unduly must like to see girl said elli thoughtfully particularly a may throw light on murder from description of old ike believe woman drove to pimlico be janet gordon must know something must not have be cry on night must have given up situation at merryman music hall so suddenly perhaps consider guilty on authority of sign on arm of dead man believe zirknitz killed elli rose stretched have terrible tangle to unravel harry said after pause see why need trouble ourselves to do bob do mr moxton must be proved guiltless ca shook head even if be innocent of murder past be shady said be not wife for bob when crooked be made straight will see about harry with confident assertion elli retired to bed not to sleep in spite of love must not see that mr moxton reputation be in peril so much a have gleaned of past from herself other source be to say least of shady people with whom have associated be scarcely reputable husband have be dissolute scoundrel zirknitz so called brother be idle vagabond devoid of self respect moral then sister schwartz praised schwartz be not overclean in character employment of girl at second rate music hall be not style of thing to recommend to respectable people then again mr moxton conduct be shifty underhand declined to tell truth yet from surrounding circumstance be plain that knew taking thing into consideration many man must have cut off root branch from widow instinct told elli that be not so evil a appeared to be made anxious to sift matter to bottom therefore got up in morning still bent upon dealing with mr moxton doubtful past after might prove in end worthy of honest man love shortly after breakfast mr basket waddled in with announcement mr moxton be at door elli be surprised be first time have come to house since terrible night of murder first meeting since fainting at name of zirknitz doctor hailed unexpected visit a good omen if be guilty must scarcely take such step might be that weary of fencing have come to confess truth be with juda like affability that mr basket introduced widow into room believed in mr moxton guilt wished to see that guilt made clear desired that must be punished yet smiled gabbled be ostentatiously friendly until dismissed by elli mr moxton breathed sigh of relief a door closed on treacherous creature looked pale be a pretty a ever elli felt charm of manner sap doubt entertained of honesty at first thought that have come to explain about zirknitz at outset of conversation mr moxton did away with idea opening remark revealed reason of call have found doctor said producing legal looking blue envelope will of edgar be in packet where be hidden mr moxton will never guess under matting of sitting room expect concealed there in one of magpie fit when be drunk forgot whereabouts when got sober be will doctor leaf property real personal to so be rich woman mr moxton said elli eyeing gravely congratulate be in too great hurry to do that rejoined coolly have yet to reckon with mr busham suspicion can disprove can not know can not say must first learn what suspicion be will be easy enough have only to show mr busham will will come out with accusation whether can refute remains to be seen be for reason that wish to visit lawyer with visit mr busham said elli considerably astonished at unusual proof of confidence what can do two thing firstly can be witness to charge feel certain mr busham will bring against then trust so far a to let hear charge do because in face of circumstantial evidence to contrary believe that be innocent for reason regard a friend for reason ask to stand by in time of trouble elli looked at doubtfully not knowing what to make of speech indeed be puzzling enough honourable woman entangled in net of villain scheming adventuress bent upon arriving at own end mr moxton be one other love elli have for inclined to believe be honourable still there must have be shadow of doubt on face for mr moxton became bitter angry unmeasured in speech be mistaken in demanded sharply have repented of what said to other day be with a with other men word word word if so tell go go never to trouble see again must trust in not at doctor be astonished at sudden outburst hastened to assure mr moxton that did injustice firmly believe in innocence feel certain that can explain away charge against have yet to be made doctor replied widow cooling down when be wish to be present that desire will show whether can answer not reason why desire to visit mr busham in company be that be anxious for to protect from violence confound fellow cried elli firing up will dare to lay hand on not on on will if defy mr busham be quite capable of taking will from by force destroying will see about said elli after moment thought however guess from what say that busham be tricky shifty scoundrel certainly will come with mr moxton when be going to morrow morning can take underground railway to esher lane very good will see in morning in meantime will leave will for to look over elli made demand with intention of seeing how far mr moxton must trust a be scarcely fair that confidence must be on one side to secret astonishment openly expressed pleasure agreed at once to request a trust will said mr moxton keep will by mean till to morrow morning take care of a be original document will put away now elli locked document up in despatch box stood near desk thank for proof of confidence mr moxton will not find misplaced be quite sure of doctor trust thoroughly in way yes in others for instance why will not tell about zirknitz mr moxton turned pale can not tell about yet elli be vexed well there be need said trifle crossly know about man about rudolph about yes about brother by marriage widow who in excitement have half risen from chair fell back into again thunderstruck where did meet stammered at merryman music hall do know place shrieked mr moxton much agitated be there last night there met zirknitz told of relationship to also here elli grew grave informed who murdered husband mr moxton capacity for amazement be exhausted by repeated shock sat limply in chair last remark however seemed to brace up for moment who doe say killed edgar asked with anxiety strove vainly to conceal none other than busham man who mr moxton interrupted with burst of hysterical laughter dr elli said in choking voice know be false mr busham did not kill husband chapter xi half confession mr moxton made statement regarding busham innocence with so much decision that elli looked at in surprise be strange that must defend man disliked how be that think guiltless asked anxiously because be coward too timid to kill man husband be stabbed in back in darkness look like coward deed same feel sure be innocent persisted widow can see reason for killing

of dukesfield there be one cab there just a turned corner woman came running down road jumped into be cry trembling wringing hand saw face in light be mr moxton one moment said widow a elli be about to contradict preposterous statement never saw until after death of husband never saw how then did recognise oh be easy edgar gave picture must not have thought that edgar be sufficiently friendly with to do that be when lent money said busham quietly why did lend money because several time called on threatened to see father did not want to do lest must be forgiven so lent money on condition that did not go uncertain of what reception must be took bribe stayed away on one of occasion showed photograph mr moxton edgar be forgiven after said widow ignoring last remark yes forgiveness did not do much good mr burst out elli who must no longer be restrained did not see mr moxton enter cab on night lady be sister know about sister said twin sister zirknitz told be friendly with zirknitz

will have not only handed over to enemy have advised to destroy have exchanged so to speak for knife with moxton have be killed in addition have secured lawyer silence by yielding up property silence about what be question elli asked put to ca when reporting extraordinary scene have taken place in esher lane office think can guess what busham hinted at said reporter accuses janet gordon of crime why must have motive to kill moxton so far a can see precisely so far a can see bob depend upon busham be certain that janet gordon be guilty mr moxton know that such be case else must not give up property so freely mean that allowed will to be destroyed so busham must not accuse sister yes along said that mr moxton be shielding person now know who person be might be so said elli reflectively janet gordon may have rushed out of house with knife have killed moxton afterwards may have ran weeping to take cab from so perilous place why did stab man why why elli according to custom began to

esher lane office what do think that busham be guilty be too clever to risk neck zirknitz austrian be coward then what do mean hardly know how to explain said ca fancy old moxton money be at bottom of business busham be moving spirit watch bob be clue to mystery h be know be too crafty for to tackle directly might get at secret through other people person to question harry be janet gordon mr moxton

ago in germany knew on hearing of penniless condition gave first engagement a attendant afterwards made private secretary offered to take on laura also a attendant knew how frivolous be so got situation in typewriting office instead might have saved trouble of protecting from harm sighed janet wearily for look what have come to why did marry be tired of poverty work moxton be heir to wealth

beside laura revived very soon said have not killed edgar dragged into house picking up carving knife said be cause of threw behind laurel have time to look for a sole object be to get laura away made put on hat cloak take purse telling to go to mr amber remain in bedroom must impersonate see matter through laura be beside with terror saying that be innocent have wit enough to see danger if stayed therefore braced up went away to take cab to pimlico got one arrived at geneva square safely yes remained in bedroom a told mr amber informed of miss gordon said janet simply assumed sister character ran round to call to see corpse know rest chapter xviii what really happened after janet have finished history there ensued short silence elli be lost in admiration at wonderful pluck resolution of girl have enabled to face carry through difficult matter for sake of weaker sister now that worst be over since have rescued laura moxton from ordeal of public accusation janet seemed to be in danger of breaking down after tension of nerve will came inevitable relaxation impulse of elli be to take in arm comfort with assurance of love protection time be not yet ripe for to speak of personal feeling there be much to do much to be learnt before crooked must be made straight therefore elli sacrificing self began to question janet on point did not seem quite clear to at first remark braced gave immediate attention if thought that sister have killed moxton why did not hide carving knife how must threw away before must stop there be time for to search when sent laura off have to call in police so must not go out to look for in darkness next morning when must evade policeman in charge slipped out to search by time knife be gone busham took said elli with nod wonder how found there be need for to search look a though knew beforehand that with weapon moxton have be stabbed came here to secure janet mused have doubt of mr busham said at last know more about matter than say indeed must not be at surprised to hear that be guilty person impossible declares that can prove alibi at time of crime be talking to policeman afterwards followed sister to pimlico have seen policeman intend to see a soon a learn name number from busham wo tell to can try at event to do away with suspicion may speak out miss gordon have yet to learn how edgar moxton be killed laura can tell said janet rising now that have heard story must listen to what have to say then doctor will see how to save be forced into position took up will be glad to hear mr moxton story will come with laura be not so ill a that be merely lying down in next room will bring in shortly left elli alone for few minute employed in considering possibility of busham being implicated in crime indeed might be actual criminal zirknitz have seen following moxton from dukesfield station subsequent act be related by a harmless story of conversation with policeman following of mr moxton to pimlico might be invented to hide truth there be nothing to show that busham have not murdered edgar for at time be ignorant that moxton will be in existence by getting rid of cousin might hope to clutch portion of uncle money elli made up mind to do two thing first to see busham learn with whom have be engaged at time of crime second to interview policeman hinted at discover if busham be speaking truth while be arguing necessity of course in own mind janet returned with mr moxton leaning on arm resemblance between sister be striking be of same height figure be moulded to same contour in face feature colouring be remarkably alike difference between lay in expression in character of eye laura glance be soft wandering that of janet steady calm face of mr moxton be weak countenance of miss gordon firm janet indeed seemed to be masculine counterpart of sister have strength of will resolution of purpose other lacked be being of flesh blood laura shadow feather blown by wind at first sight of face elli no longer wondered that have married brute like moxton must have married man have necessary force of will be exerted when elli beheld frail creature when recalled evil scampish nature of rudolph zirknitz admired janet more than ever for wonderful manner in have controlled pair be female prospero who ruled at once weakly flighty ariel refined caliban must be admitted however that latter part of above illustration be too severe on zirknitz a be rather lazun duc de richelieu count d'orsay than son of sycorax however be certainly scamp dangerous mr moxton who looked ill weary bowed in silence to elli sank exhausted into chair vacated by sister janet took seat beside motioned with head that doctor must do same elli obeyed looked at mr moxton with curiosity more eagerness for from lip hoped to learn sufficient to indicate mysterious assassin of moxton widow with eye fixed on fire seemed in hurry to begin laura dear said janet in coaxing tone such a nurse must use to fractious child be best friend dr elli be only one who can help out of difficulty want to tell remember about edgar death mr moxton uttered low wail with shudder covered face when did speak be in so low tone elli must with difficulty catch what be saying will ever forget horrible night murmured tell dr elli about dear urged janet after pause mr moxton did a be requested at first voice be low nervous a proceeded in recital grew powerful nerve responded to demand made upon gave surprising strength of speech in comparison with frail body from physiological standpoint elli be a much interested in a in story told edgar quarrelled on night about polly horley began for rudolph told that be paying attention to horrid woman edgar swore that be not true wanted to go to music hall to see for refused to take flung out of door in great rage then janet came company conversation calmed when went be left alone grew frightened got out carving knife heard edgar come in at gate not thinking ran to open door with knife in hand when met be on step seeing knife knowing how furious must be suppose grew frightened at rate ran back to gate followed calling out 'edgar edgar what be matter when came up to must have thought meant to strike for be half drunk at time face be white terrified a saw in moonlight although a night be cloudy be not very strong remember night interpolated elli be windy rainy with fitful moonlight showing through flying cloud well mr moxton what did husband do when came up to seized by throat said widow hysterically believe that being half intoxicated wished to kill struggled to get away held tightly so must not cry out be pressed right against gate held knife above head a be afraid of hurting with why did not drop asked elli know never thought of dropping more edgar fought with tighter held be strangling must not cry out then saw at once man on other side of gate must describe look asked elli eagerly mr moxton shook head remember be darkish night with only occasional gleam of moonlight be struggling with edgar holding by throat have half strangled a said held up knife out of way man on other side of gate wore tall hat great coat with fur collar tried to call out to edgar did not see man suddenly stranger snatched knife out of hand struck at edgar back edgar gave yell wonder be not heard over dukesfield so loud be fell forward on crushed by weight worn with struggle terrified by murder fainted clean away last thing remember be that edgar lay over struggling moaning be man still at gate after struck blow know when came to myself janet be bending over be so frightened that must explain nothing after picked up knife be lying by edgar body flung over bush against fence then janet hurried away told must take place deny everything be so dazed that did not know what be doing ran down to cab rank told cabman to drive to pimlico did so recovered sufficiently in cab to pay to slip into house with latchkey janet have pushed into hand knew that still have old room so ran up to without seeing anyone locked in mr amber told that isolated for week did so by janet advice lest mr amber must recognise janet came to see few day afterwards told about inquest did call at geneva square asked elli turning to miss gordon be strange for mr amber particularly explained that until few day ago one called save schwartz paid visit one night when mr amber be at theatre explained janet bribed sarah servant most venal creature to say nothing about be necessary must tell laura what have taken place hear story now know doctor why fenced with refused to tell truth be afraid lest sister must be brought into matter mr moxton be innocent knew protested elli yes be innocent wailed mr moxton what must do in face of have told can not hold tongue like janet foresee thing a doe in one way must have betrayed perhaps have be arrested janet be right janet be wise to advise to stay at pimlico feigned ill health must not let mr amber into room lest must get to know too much only sarah knew a have to confide in to get food held tongue nearly betrayed though mr moxton by taking cuff to mr amber be mistake said widow in touching edgar body got blood on cuff threw aside in bedroom never thought of hiding sarah took downstairs without consulting how did manage to keep up concealment of identity to end managed said janet in firm clear voice called when knew that mr be absent told laura that on account of busham intended to take away when mr amber came back of course thought have be in bedroom time that laura have called for be so deceived added janet smiling that told how ill looked after lying so long in bed be afraid did look ill with worry wonder at said elli sympathetically can not imagine how have borne up through trouble have have few woman must have taken burden so bravely on shoulder a have done miss gordon indeed have be best of sister exclaimed mr moxton with tear in eye never will forget what janet have done for at cost to dear laura said janet patting sister hand after defence of have cost fortune mind in least janet let mr busham take so long a hold tongue fancy busham will keep silent for own sake remarked elli drily for feel certain that have more to do with murder than think believe that killed edgar might even go so far a must collect sufficient evidence to justify such belief however can talk of later with reference to destruction of will miss gordon need not worry about oh do laura will lose father in law money not by destruction of will because original document be in possession what busham burnt be copy carefully prepared by friend mr ca chapter xix red pocket book do mean to say that paper mr busham destroyed be not edgar will asked janet while sister uttered exclamation of joy do mean reported conversation about mutual friend to ca agreed that be not to be trusted with original will ca who be clever at imitating handwriting procured sheet of paper similar to upon will be written copied out signature be afraid be specie of forgery a have to be done if wished to checkmate busham contrived crime be just a well did so miss gordon a busham have compunction in destroying will wonder be that clever pettifogger such a be must not see that document be forged singular obtuseness on part if have remained longer in possession doubt must have discovered truth replied janet if remember merely glanced at not crediting with so clever idea a substituting copy for original took for genuine will can never thank sufficiently doctor for what have done chimed in laura who seeing that there be prospect of recovering husband money plucked up spirit now mr busham will not be able to rob h be said janet with frown putting will out of question dear be still in same dangerous position a formerly if find out trick dr elli have played may denounce will do so at own risk cried elli promptly may be sure will never learn truth from until can be told with safety to mr moxton leave busham to will know how to deal with in way must clear up mystery exonerate mr moxton if there be only clue janet laura looked meaningly at one there be clue although be only slight one said miss gordon hesitatingly to identity of murderer clue may lead to discovery when laura be lying in faint man who stabbed edgar robbed of pocket book how must do without moxton recognising asked elli know that moxton did not die at once lived long enough to scrawl blood sign on arm denouncing zirknitz now know that brother be innocent a have established alibi with assistance of landlady mr pastor can not explain that doctor undoubtedly edgar thought that rudolph stabbed so wrote on arm to let laura know can read cryptogram presume mr moxton oh yes know sign very well janet taught to showed to edgar for amusement doubt wished to know rudolph have stabbed why used sign can not say hated rudolph always must have got into trouble if must well said elli after pause can conceive reason why acted a did suppose truth will ever be revealed about pocket book mr moxton how do know that murderer took only think so be red morocco pocket book with edgar initial on in gold have when went out that night saw put into breast pocket when janet came to pimlico asked if have seen a thought that there might be bank note in needed money badly did carry money in yes when have on night be there note in pocket book can not say rudolph declares that won twenty pound from edgar on night edgar must not pay save with iou so think there must have be money in book then why must assassin steal why indeed echoed janet who have be silent for time be what wish to find out a edgar jewellery be untouched robbery must not have be motive of crime believe that pocket book must have contained paper of value to murderer person must have taken for examined very carefully clothes edgar wore when be killed must not find pocket book dr elli said janet earnestly seems to that if can find book will be able to lay hand on criminal possibly miss gordon in what direction be to look in autumn many men wear fur lined overcoat so be not strong clue moreover pocket book must long since have be destroyed if murderer valued neck on whole think will be best to see busham a said before movement will depend upon sort of information supply will tell nothing not of own free will perhaps maybe in position to force confidence be now late a conversation between three have lasted considerable time laura looked so fatigued ill elli in capacity of medical man insisted that must retire take a much rest sleep a can mr moxton worry will help can in matter have doubt will be able to clear of suspicion good night elli be accompanied to door by janet who be hopeful of success will be certain to solve mystery mr ca said think how much have discovered already by observation if do solve right sister what then miss gordon janet laughed in kindly darkness blushed can talk of when time come said answering thought after manner of woman with assurance doctor be fain to be content departed without gaining kiss of have dreamt needle to say be more in love than ever thanked heaven that have be brought into contact with so noble earnest woman a janet gordon anxious to hear result of friend visit ca be waiting up for into astonished ear elli poured whole story exonerated cleansed janet ca admitted that have be wrong in estimate of character how be one to read properly under circumstance said testily must not believe in woman without proof did said elli smiling because be in love yours be not legitimate belief on same mad principle must have trusted lucrezia borgia still experience be sufficiently strange be glad that instinct have be justified miss gordon on face of have proved singularly able may say noble woman must see more of learn to know better before can rescind former opinion that be not wife for to know be to love said elli with deep emotion ah see know therefore can not love if did might object however main question at present be how to extricate mr moxton from equivocal position until assassin be found be made plain mr moxton dare not explain trick to busham claim property if did might be dangerous can be dangerous so far a inclination go must say so whether have power be question one not so easily answered however for satisfaction bob can tell that busham be liar while be at myrtle villa went round to drake at police office tried to find out if busham have spoken to policeman on night if remember declared that held long conversation with one at near station trust to for alibi drake doe not know busham must tell nothing harry quite so must tell who be on duty on night did not inform of reason save be curious on own account to learn who killed moxton so found out name of police on duty night queerly enough term of service have come round again for night duty so went out questioned at least dozen about busham well asked elli impatiently well busham be liar spoke to none of none spoke to never saw gentleman of description about on night so judged that dodged after moxton in shadow to avoid recognition now bob best plan be to see busham accuse then will see if can bring forward in defence supposititious policeman good will call on mutual friend to morrow will see zirknitz first what for to ask how busham be dressed on night a police must not recognise busham by face might by dress in way can learn if anyone of saw following moxton after left railway station having decided upon course under circumstance be most sensible men retired to bed next morning after further discussion with ca doctor set out for bloomsbury a yet have not many patient so must afford time practice be increasing foresaw that unless must bring matter of murder to speedy conclusion must be obliged to throw over altogether on janet account be unwilling to do a usual m zirknitz be still in bed elli waited for time in gorgeous sitting room owner apparently have created out of nothing when austrian made appearance be a lively a ever greeted elli in most genial manner ah elli mon ami mon cher so have arrived once more be to take to prison to join at djeuner latter hope friendship be so much more charming than enmity have come only to ask few question zirknitz also to tell something may astonish astonish c'est une mauvaise plaisanterie mon cher be never astonished at anything in best of possible world have not read candide in that saying occurs ah must voltaire be most witty of race eh bien what be astonishing news know history that of sister have learnt how miss gordon took place of mr moxton to fight battle know that ah well janet must have told if did be right janet can do wrong be dearest most excellent sister in world be best brother to mon ami be scamp have good in if have must not be so creditable to janet that be fond of so have told intrigue what can do inform about busham saw on night oui da followed that poor edgar from station how be dressed zirknitz reflected be cold that night said musingly put on fur coat eh ah yes busham have coat of same tall hat can say no more than that fur lined coat tall hat be precisely scanty description given by laura of momentary glimpse of assassin what if lawyer after must be guilty person full of excitement elli detailed to zirknitz suspicion cited fact of red pocket book austrian uttered exclamation of astonishment on hearing that be missing edgar excellent edgar have in pocket at music hall eh yes quite remember took out book to show bill bill kind of bill bill of exchange promissory note now speak mon cher ami come back to edgar showed name of father on bill declared that be forged forged bill said elli in pocket book be stolen ah then may be motive for crime zirknitz did moxton say who have forged bill eh said bey rudolph see what got from busham night ' busham busham must have forged bill eh think not must not give to edgar still forged bill obtained from busham followed out of station wore tall hat fur coat a assassin be dressed same might be by heaven zirknitz believe that busham be guilty person after zirknitz shrugged shoulder did not offer opinion a doctor did not think that there be anything further to be learnt from rose to go at door however paused made chance remark gained greater result than of previous question forgot to tell said elli have tricked busham think that have claim to portion of mr moxton property because destroyed will what destroyed m zirknitz be copy made by original be in possession rudolph eye sparkled then laura will inherit moxton wealth undoubtedly a soon a can claim without risking danger from busham know too much not a much a know listen mon ami can tell great deal about busham will help to save laura eh yes will see that get money of poor edgar so that may get share of suppose said elli drily zirknitz laughed shrugged shoulder certainly why not be brother need money if help must help listen mon cher with exordium zirknitz poured forth into elli ear story about lawyer about own treachery at once pleased horrified elli did not know whether most to hate admire scamp in end decided that must be diplomatic to hide feeling so ended visit chapter xx busham at bay be in state of subdued excitement elli left room of zirknitz now seemed to be nearer solving mystery than have ever be before there be doubt that moxton have be murdered in order to obtain forged bill elli be uncertain in own mind whether busham have actually struck blow silk hat fur lined coat be not distinctive dress on cold evening for man dozen might wear still coincidence of dress be striking busham might be criminal after elli drove directly to esher lane for purpose of satisfying on point what doctor particularly wished to know be who have forged elder moxton name if busham have done so must scarcely have given bill to edgar who have great love for to hand over incriminating document then murder to get back again must have be height of folly if therefore busham be innocent of forgery must scarcely risk life in endeavouring to recover bill thus if anyone have reason to desire death of edgar must have be forger having committed one crime certainly must not hesitate to commit second if only to conceal first theory be excellent elli wished to prove truth to do so be necessary that must learn name of man who have forged bill busham have given document to edgar moxton a be asserted by zirknitz therefore busham must inform of what wished to know must do so elli for want of experience of man must not answer question arrived at lane in state of perplexity however head be clear will determined most necessary frame of mind for anyone who have to deal with so crafty creature a busham office be a dingy dirty a ever lean clerk still scribbled interminable folio strained eye in uncertain light from inner room came rasping cough of busham showed that be alive plotting elli sent in card be received by lawyer with anything pleasure however did not think wise to betray fear of visitor so gave order that be to be admitted at once more than that threw into greeting a much cordiality a be possible with one of detestable nature be glad to see doctor said pointing to one of two chair seems strange doe not have tiff last time met here eh quite so never bear malice not how be mr moxton true mr moxton be quite well busham naturally pale face became of greenish hue what do mean with 'true mr moxton ' demanded narrowing eye until looked like of cat what say what know janet gordon to fight sister battle took that sister place be well informed sneered busham on whose authority have best authority miss gordon told how dare say that knew of plot cried lawyer savagely ridiculous know nothing about sister be lie replied coolly know everything about for month have be watching for opportunity to get into toil who say rudolph zirknitz bah silly fool what doe know more than think retorted elli zirknitz be scamp fool told about question have asked even mentioned sum of money have paid for information what information said busham fighting inch be necessary for to inform questioned elli with icy contempt what information repeated lawyer told that supposed mr moxton be really janet gordon betrayed sister for money like contemptible creature be in turn have betrayed understand hint of betrayal think do if wish to be more explicit can inform that zirknitz saw following moxton on night busham sneered brow cleared so said when mr moxton beg pardon miss gordon be here then admitted be at dukesfield on night gave reason for being there also gave account of action know did mr busham very pretty account did justice to imagination told truth cried busham gnawing lip did not told what suited purpose spoke to policeman on night for who be on duty then have be closely questioned never followed mr moxton to pimlico called there later bribed servant sarah to tell truth who say did zirknitz be afraid be trifle overconfident of silence mr busham zirknitz be liar oh only traitor who change side when see chance of making money wo make out of sister growled busham have burnt will moxton property will come to elli smiled when thought on how slight foundation belief rested well will say nothing about will even though have destroyed mr moxton take great portion of husband property a widow sha' have one penny snarled jade adventuress murderess be what be if refuse to give whole of moxton property will denounce then will be hanged doubt busham there be prejudice against hanging woman in country a to saying that killed moxton be lie know man who murdered cousin wore silk hat fur coat who say so mr moxton saw man strike blow must not recognise oh be invention to save neck scoffed man in silk hat fur coat bosh who be man well be not quite clear on point replied elli speaking very slowly fancied might be busham started from seat with kind of screech hardly human gasped dare to accuse of crime on what ground wore similar dress on night followed moxton who say did dear friend m zirknitz busham ground teeth said something not precisely complimentary to austrian after time recovered calmness not colour accuse of murdering moxton said oh accuse merely state that such might be case bah accusation be not worth considering what motive must have for killing cousin be true that father altered will at last moment left everything to edgar what then have sufficient influence with to finger money certainly intended to do so why must risk neck to upset plan might have hoped to get money after moxton death at least share of deceive snapped lawyer hoped for none of edgar told that after marriage have made will leaving to wife what motive then have to commit so purposeless crime must manage edgar because knew never met never saw mr moxton must hope to gain influence over especially with infernal sister in way if speak more respectfully of miss gordon interrupted doctor angrily be friend will not permit word against say that mr moxton killed husband prove be always quarrelling with replied busham sullenly know that for fact because edgar told so said that be afraid of wife that frequently threatened with carving knife when heard of murder next morning went down to see mr moxton a be certain have killed edgar a walked up garden saw flash of steel in laurel bush on going to found knife stuck in one of branch be carving knife there be blood on blade handle be certain then that mr moxton be guilty having own end to gain did not denounce then simply slipped knife up sleeve went away produced a saw to make miss gordon for thanks to zirknitz knew visitor be not mr moxton give up will made exchange took away knife burnt will a saw by destroying must hope to get portion of property now mean to have whole else will denounce mr moxton think will do busham for will then state that committed felony by burning will happens ca afford to denounce mr moxton might frighten perhaps a be only woman miss gordon ca frighten a to finding of knife mr moxton threw into laurel bush after murder did not use will find difficult to prove snarled busham beginning to feel beaten if did not use who did man in fur coat who snatched from when be in husband grip who be man in fur coat think know busham indeed confound at least know name of man who endorsed that bill with gasp lawyer started out of chair bill what bill forged bill gave to moxton at merryman music hail on night of murder gave bill know of none oh yes do moxton showed bill to zirknitz told that be forged on father be placed in red pocket book mr busham that pocket book be stolen from corpse lie lie lie raved busham stamping know nothing of bill know who killed moxton elli did not waste word rising to foot glanced at watch with calm air must go now said will give five day to tell truth mr busham failing that will place whole matter in hand of police re open case good day sir with last warning elli walked out of room with white face haggard expression busham sat for hour more in chair twice one of clerk opened door looked in awed by expression of terror in lawyer eye withdrew at last busham wiped brow be beaded with perspiration rose to foot will fly stay asked then bringing down fist on table cried by heaven will stay fight out chapter xxi blind girl in compliment to great poet of nation herr schwartz

above impression have schwartz be in room captain might have controlled better schwartz have not returned after hilda cry for father even on short acquaintance elli must not think how good german must

beyond necessary guidance of machine be preoccupied seemed strange to that garret must so strongly object to janet a companion for daughter captain be supremely selfish man a selfish in way a zirknitz more vicious be indifferent to daughter save that looked upon a necessary link to bind to schwartz schwartz be clever generous devoted to hilda have plenty of money garret idle dissipated must not do without for furtherance of plan usually let schwartz manage hilda hilda business a pleased be therefore surprising that must have taken so unusual step a to object to miss gordon garret schwartz can have nothing to do with murder mused elli knew moxton only slightly have motive to get rid of indeed untimely death have lost schwartz good customer to gambling table if exists a be reported at rate assiduous attendant at music hall garret be anxious on schwartz account hence warned not to have janet in house think be too clever perhaps fancy may learn too much be too fanciful too suspicious yet garret certainly mentioned murder what be best to be done janet must go to goethe cottage to keep hilda cheerful will tell of objection discussion will not bias in way if there be anything to be found out will discover to wise determination elli adhered on seeing janet that evening merely informed that hilda be mopish that wished to cheer girl janet readily consented to be very fond of hilda said earnestly may be sure will do what can doe mr schwartz want to come very much tell miss gordon what be opinion of think be good man doctor several time have be under necessity of testing kindness of heart have never failed then look how good be to poor hilda if depended upon selfish father of hers how wretched must be yet appears to be more attached to father than to schwartz daresay said janet somewhat cynically be that frame of mind created proverb about virtue being own reward people who do most be thought least of be selfish person who get love praise look at own case life have put aside for rudolph laura yet think nothing of say do mere lip service exclaimed miss gordon must not do good turn however little trouble might be laura be grateful to now because be yet in danger stand by when be well will think nothing of service a for rudolph must borrow last sixpence see dying of starvation without returning so much a single penny oh be under disillusion about own folk doctor what do do from sense of duty with regard to sister can say nothing miss gordon a know sufficiently well zirknitz well be thoroughly bad lot must sell nearest dearest at price janet demurred can not believe that be so wicked a be proved to only other day told busham about impersonation of mr moxton betrayed scheme plan while be fighting single handed against overwhelming odds because busham paid now thinking mr moxton will recover husband fortune for told that real will still existed have betrayed busham secret doings to what do think of now be scoundrel will never speak to again oh doctor if only knew what have done for man knew be heartless selfish did not think be wicked heartlessness selfishness usually terminate in wickedness said elli sententiously however one good result have come out of evil way have learnt about mr busham intrigue have given few day to own up that killed edgar asked janet breathlessly no did not kill at least think so have insisted upon revealing name of assassin a be certain know in three day must tell truth will place matter in hand of police oh laura will be arrested do to save from arrest busham know nothing about false will because wish to drive

against must keep in hand what do think will do ah ca say know much not smallest amount of ignorance in matter be bar to giving reasonable opinion on however time work for will be able to defend mr moxton from enemy go to goethe cottage miss gordon cheer hilda do think can give back sight perhaps be difficult case will have to make examination before can arrive at conclusion in meantime wish to be lively gay so must realise that wish ala said janet with melancholy smile have too much experience of world to be gay however will do best will be seen from last observation that janet be rapidly coming under influence of elli be clever woman in own way masterful therefore on finding someone stronger than be prepared to obey sound paradoxical be so especially in relation of sex woman must always succumb to man if be man obedience be in feminine blood notwithstanding new woman janet knew from experience that elli be kind generous be willing to help to extent of power in whom believed now duel with busham mean adversary have given impression of strength moreover loved perhaps be why obeyed without struggle felt happier for such obedience although be new to when woman find master in honourable generous kindly man happiness be assured therefore janet went to goethe cottage be welcomed by hilda with girl be fond of loved to be in such pleasant company warned by schwartz janet be careful to avoid theme of murder indulged hilda in light gossip of day culled from society paper talked of literature to girl read aloud to played sang made agreeable in way so hilda became merry

effusively did welcome that doctor felt almost ashamed of errand bracing up with idea schwartz if not actual criminal yet knew something about crime managed to appear sufficiently stern to german eager inquiry about hilda health hilda eyesight gave brief monosyllabic reply at last schwartz be forced to take notice of visitor unfriendly attitude what be not right doctor asked anxiously elli glanced round to see that door be closed cleared throat mr schwartz said in low tone have come to see about very unpleasant business german turned paler even than be hand shook a tried to light cigar ach be dat zo be about moxton murder veil veil what apout ze murder queried schwartz impatiently must rather put question to schwartz why be moxton murdered rather why be got out of way instead of

schwartz savagely can see that have come to accuse of being mixed up in crime be for purpose that called at house forget called at request to see miss garret schwartz sighed ach liddle hilda said in

be busham said harry must see swing with greatest pleasure for be thoroughly bad lot schwartz have so many good quality must like to give chance of repentance crime be not committed deliberately chimed in janet feel sure that mr schwartz did not come to dukesfield with intention of murdering edgar doubt wanted that forged bill hoped to rob edgar while be drunk be seeing carving knife in laura hand made criminal temptation be put in way snatched at almost without thinking under circumstance because have be kind to must like to escape can take own chance of said elli to counter plot busham be necessary to get full confession from schwartz may go away without making confession bob think so not until be in absolute peril of life will leave idol hilda besides called at goethe cottage be
