stepped into darkness after man hall of seemed to be almost a cold a world without trifling glimmer of lucifer served rather to reveal than dispel surrounding darkness light a be hollowed gulf out of tremendous gloom made house tenfold more ghostly than before footstep of denzil berwin sounding on bare board for hall be uncarpeted waked hollow echo when paused silence ensued seemed almost menacing grim reputation of mansion gloom silence appealed powerfully to latent superstition of lucian how much more nearly then must touch shaken excited nerve of tragic drunkard who dwelt continually amid terror berwin opened door on right hand side of hall turned up light of handsome oil lamp have be screwed down pending arrival lamp be placed on small square table covered with white cloth dainty cold

cherished hope that young man must elevate to rank of matron at present miss julia greeb be unwedded damsel of forty summer who with aid of art be making desperate ineffectual effort to detain youth be slipping from pinched waist dyed hair powdered face affected juvenile dress of white frock blue sash kind in distance looked girlish twenty close at hand various artifice aided to pas for thirty be only in solitude of own room that real age be apparent never did woman wage more resolute fight with time than did miss greeb be worst most frivolous side of character for be really good hearted

wifehood nevertheless continued to keep boarder to make attempt to captivate heart of such bachelor a judged weak in character hitherto effort have be more le of mercantile character with eye to money when lucian denzil appeared on scene poor little woman really fell in love with handsome face in strange contrast to other effort miss greeb never for moment deemed that lucian must marry be god ideal of manhood to offered worship burnt incense after manner of kind denzil occupied bedroom sitting room pleasant airy apartment looking out on to square miss greeb attended to need brought up breakfast with own fair hand happy for day if admired lodger conversed with for few moment before reading morning paper then miss greeb must retire to own sitting room indulge in day dream well knew must never be realised romance wove be even more marvellous than read in favourite penny novelette unlike printed tale romance never culminated in marriage poor brainless silly pitiful miss greeb must have made good wife fond mother by irony of fate be destined to be neither comedy of husband hunting youth be now changing into lonely tragedy of disappointed spinsterhood be one of world unknown martyr fate merit tear rather than laughter on morning after meeting with young barrister sat at breakfast with miss greeb in anxious attendance having poured out tea handed paper ascertained that breakfast be to liking miss greeb lingered about room putting straight crooked in hope that lucian must converse with in be gratified a denzil wished to learn detail about strange man have assisted on previous night knew that one must afford more precise information than brisk landlady to whom be known gossip of neighbourhood first word made miss greeb flutter back to table like dove to nest do know anything

call mr berwin ghost nothing half so respectable be mystery sir be what mr berwin be care if hears commit so far in what way be mystery demanded denzil approaching matter with more particularity why said miss greeb evidently puzzled how to answer leading question one can find out anything about be full of secret underhand going on ai respectable not to be fair above board that ai see reason why quiet living old gentleman must tell private affair to whole square remarked lucian drily who have nothing bad to conceal need be afraid of speaking out retorted miss greeb tartly way in mr berwin life be enough to make one think coiner thief even murderer that be what ground have to believe one of three question also puzzled landlady a have reasonable ground for wild statement nevertheless made determined attempt to substantiate by hearsay evidence mr berwin said in significant tone life alone in haunted house why not man have right to be misanthrope if chooses have no right to behave so in respectable square replied miss greeb shaking head there be only two room of large house furnished rest be given up to dust ghost mr berwin wo have servant to live under roof mr kebby who doe charing say drink awful then have meal sent in from nelson hotel round corner eats alone receive letter read newspaper stay in day only coming out at night like owl if ai criminal mr denzil why doe carry on so may dislike fellow men desire to live secluded life miss greeb still shook head may dislike fellow men said with emphasis that keep from seeing ah that be there anything wrong in said lucian contemptuous of cobweb objection perhaps not mr denzil where do see come from how do mean miss greeb go in by front door be certain continued little woman darkly there be only one entrance to square sir blinder policeman be frequently on duty there two three night be met mr berwin coming in after dark exchanged friendly greeting with time mr berwin have be alone well well what of said denzil impatiently much mr denzil that blinder have gone round square after seeing mr berwin have seen shadow two three of on sitting room blind now sir cried miss greeb clinching argument if mr

puzzled mr berwin can not live alone in house begging pardon be sure cried pertinacious woman doe mr kebby have be over house there be soul in mr denzil take what way will there be something ai right about mr berwin if be real name believe be why miss greeb just because replied landlady with feminine logic if think of having anything to do with mystery mr denzil beg of not to else may come to something a be too terrible to consider that may such a oh know cried miss greeb tossing head gliding towards door ai for to say what think be last person in world to meddle with what concern that be thus ending conversation miss greeb vanished with significant look pursed up lip reason of last speech rapid retreat lay in fact that miss greeb must bring tangible charge against opposite neighbour therefore hinted at complicity in kind of horror be quite unable to define save in term more le vague lucian dismissed such hint of criminality from mind a outcome of miss greeb very lively imagination yet even though reduced communication to bare fact must not acknowledge that there be something queer about mr berwin mode of life man self pity condemnation hint certain people wished to do harm curious episode of shadow on blind thing engaged curiosity of denzil in ordinary degree must not admit to that must greatly ease mind to arrive at reasonable explanation of berwin eccentricity nevertheless held that have right to pry into secret of stranger honourably strove to dismiss tenant of tantalising environment from mind such dismissal of unworthy curiosity be more difficult to effect than expected for next week lucian resolutely banished subject from thought declined to discus matter further with miss greeb little woman on fire with curiosity made various inquiry of gossip regarding doings of mr berwin in default of reporting same to lodger occupied in discussing with neighbour consequence of incessant gossip be that eye of whole square fixed on in expectation of catastrophe although one knew exactly what be going to happen undefinable feeling of impending disaster communicating to lucian stimulated curiosity to pitch with feeling of shame for weakness walked round square on two several evening in hope of meeting berwin on occasion be unsuccessful on third evening be more fortunate for having worked at law book until late at night went out for brisk walk before retiring to rest night be cold there have be slight fall of snow so lucian wrapped up well lighted pipe proceeded to take air by tramping twice thrice round square overhead sky be clear frosty with chill glittering star wintry moon thin covering of snow lay on pavement there be white rime on bare branch of central tree on coming to house of berwin barrister saw that sitting room be lighted up curtain undrawn so that window presented square of illuminated blind even a looked two shadow darkened white surface shadow of man woman evidently have come between lamp window so quite unknowingly revealed action to watcher curious to see end of shadow pantomime lucian stood still looked intently at window two figure seemed to be arguing for head nodded violently arm waved constantly retreated out of sphere of light again came into still continuing furious gesture unexpectedly male shadow seized female by throat swung like feather to fro struggling figure reeled out of radiance lucian heard faint cry thinking that something be wrong rushed up step rang bell violently almost before sound died away light in room be extinguished must see nothing more again again rang without attracting attention so lucian finally left house went in search of blinder policeman to narrate experience at entrance of geneva square ran against man whom recognised in clear moonlight to surprise beheld mark berwin chapter iii unsatisfactory explanation mr berwin cried lucian recognising man be who else must be replied berwin bending forward to see who have jostled who else must be mr denzil thought thought said barrister unable to conceal surprise be fancied be indoors fancy be wrong see be not indoors then who be in house berwin shrugged shoulder one so far a know be mistaken sir there be light in room saw shadow of man woman struggling together thrown on blind people in house said berwin laying shaking hand on arm of lucian impossible tell be so come then will look for said berwin in

break into be peaceful very unfortunate gentleman who wish to live quietly talk of people being in house be nonsense yet seemed afraid when told of shadow said lucian pointedly afraid be afraid of nothing not even of who be after hinted denzil recalling conversation of previous occasion berwin gave kind of eldritch shriek stepped back pace a though to place on guard what what do know about such such thing panted only so much a hinted at when last saw yes yes be not on night wine be in wit be out truth also must seem said lucian drily judging by agitation then now be unfortunate gentleman whimpered berwin tremulously if will excuse sir will leave said lucian ceremoniously seems to be fate to hold midnight conversation with in cold think one have better be cut short one moment mr berwin exclaimed have be good enough to place on guard a to talk quiet course of life be causing pray add to kindness by coming with to house exploring from attic to basement will then see that there be ground for scandal that shadow fancy saw on blind be not of real people ca be of ghost at event replied lucian a never heard to knowledge that spirit must cast shadow well come see for that house be empty warmly a invitation be given lucian have scruple about accepting to explore almost unfurnished mansion with complete stranger one with ill reputation at midnight hour be not enterprise to be coveted by man however bold may be still lucian have ample courage more curiosity for adventure a chance of stirred up that desire for romance belongs peculiarly to youth also be anxious to satisfy concerning blind shadow curious to learn why berwin inhabited so dismal mysterious mansion add to reason keen pleasure in profiting by occurrence of unexpected will guess that denzil ended by accepting strange invitation of berwin being now fully committed to adventure went forward with cool courage observant eye to spy out if possible secret upon hinged mystery a on former occasion berwin inducted guest into sitting room here a previously dainty supper be spread berwin turned up lamp light waved hand round luxuriously furnished room pointing particularly to space between table window figure whose shadow saw said must have struggled together in space so a to be between lamp blind for performance of pantomime must have observe mr denzil that there be disturbance of furniture to show that struggle a describe took place also that curtain be drawn across window light must have be thrown on blind curtain be doubt drawn after rang bell said lucian glancing towards heavy fold of crimson velvet veiled window curtain retorted berwin stripping off coat be drawn by before went out lucian said nothing shook head doubtfully evidently berwin be trying for own end to talk into belief that eye have deceived denzil be too clear headed young man to be so gulled berwin explanation excuse only confirmed idea that there be something in man life cut off from humanity must not bear light of day hitherto lucian have heard rather than seen berwin now in clear light of lamp have excellent opportunity of observing man quarter berwin be of medium height lean with clean shaven face hollow cheek black sunken eye hair be grey thin look wild wandering hectic colouring of face narrow chest showed that be far gone in consumption even a lucian looked at be shaken by hollow cough when withdrew handkerchief from lip white linen be spotted with blood be in evening dress looked eminently refined although worn haggard in appearance denzil noted two peculiar mark about first serpentine cicatrice extending on right cheek from lip almost to ear second loss of little finger of left hand be cut off at first joint a examined man second more violent fit of coughing shook seem to be very ill said lucian pitying feebleness of poor creature dying of consumption one lung gone gasped berwin will soon be over sooner better with health mr berwin be sheer madness to dwell in rigorous english

said lucian drily be certain that before met man woman be in room well said berwin lighting small lamp come with will prove that be mistaken chapter iv mr kebby discovery pertinacity berwin displayed in insisting that lucian must explore silent house be truly remarkable appeared to be bent upon banishing idea denzil entertained that stranger be hiding in mansion from attic to basement from front to back premise led way made lucian examine corner of empty room showed even unused kitchen bade remark that door leading into yard be locked bolted from rusty condition of ironwork must not have be opened for year also made look out of window into yard with tall black fence dividing from other property exploration finished lucian being convinced that host be only two living being in house berwin conducted half frozen guest back to warm sitting room poured out glass of wine here mr denzil said in good natured tone drink draw near fire must be chilled to bone after arctic expedition lucian willingly accepted attention sipped wine be particularly fine claret before fire while berwin coughed shivered muttered to about cold of season when lucian stood up to take departure addressed directly well sir said with sardonic smile be convinced that struggling shadow on yonder blind be child of heated fancy said denzil stoutly be not yet have seen that there be one in house mr berwin said lucian after moment thought propose riddle can not answer wish to answer can not explain what saw to night a surely a be out of house people be in how affect what reason have for denying ask keep own secret go own way wish good night sir lucian moved towards door berwin who be holding full tumbler of rich strong port drank whole of in one gulp strong liquor reddened pallid face brightened sunken eye even strengthened already sonorous voice at least can inform good neighbour be peaceful man desirous of being left to lead own life said urgently sir will have nothing to do with business be stranger to acquaintance be too slight to warrant discussing affair besides added lucian with shrug interest yet may interest three kingdom one day said berwin softly oh if deal with danger to

diseased ' go go good night then said denzil seeing that nothing must be done hope will be better in morning berwin shook head with silent tongue contrasted strangely with late outcry ushered denzil out of house a heavy door closed behind lucian descended step looked thoughtfully at grim mansion be tenanted by so mysterious person must make nothing of berwin a chose to call must see meaning in wild word mad behaviour a walked briskly back to lodging came to conclusion that man be nothing worse than tragic drunkard haunted by terror engendered by over indulgence in stimulant episode of shadow on blind did not attempt to explain for simple reason that be unable to find plausible explanation to account therefor why must trouble head to do so mused lucian a went to bed man mystery be nothing to bah have be infected by vulgar curiosity of square henceforth will see think of drunken lunatic with such resolve dismissed thought of strange acquaintance from mind under circumstance be perhaps wisest thing must do later on certain event took place forced to alter determination fate with own end to bring about be not to be denied by puppet of lucian be one designed for important part

berwin have in own emphatic phrase done something for be wanted by police be always on look out to learn secret of isolated life in order to betray blackmail get in way under thumb a yet have be

strange tenant of silent house gordon link detective charged with conduct of case confessed a much to denzil see slightest chance of tracing berwin past said to barrister be a ignorant about a be of name of assassin be sure there be clue mr link absolutely none even weapon with crime be committed can not be found have searched house inch of with result have found nothing surroundings of case be most mysterious if identify dead can not hope to trace murderer how wretch got into house be more than can discover be strange admitted lucian thoughtfully yet in secret way people be in habit of entering house berwin knew a much not only that protected from curiosity by denying that even existed quite follow mr denzil allude to shadow on blind saw week before murder took place be of man woman must have be cast by body of flesh blood therefore two people must have be in berwin sitting room on night yet when met berwin who be absent at time denied that anyone must have entered house without knowledge more actually insisted must satisfy a to truth of by examining house did yes found nothing yet said lucian with air of conviction however man woman entered be in house then assassin must have come in by same way where way can be how can be found be more than can say doe landlord know of secret passage asked replied detective stated that house nowadays be not built with secret passage when berwin denied that anyone be in house be afraid mr denzil yes seemed to be nervous told have enemy hinted that there be people who wished to see dead from way spoke language used be satisfied that be hiding from vengeance of one vengeance repeated link raising eyebrow be not that word trifle melodramatic perhaps to mind there be more melodrama in actual life than people fancy however mr link added lucian have come to certain conclusion firstly that berwin be in hiding secondly that saw people secretly who entered in way can not discover thirdly that to solve problem will be necessary to look into past life of dead man third conclusion brings round to point whence started retorted link how be to discover man past by learning who be what be real name easy task said detective sarcastically considering meagre material upon have to work how be business to be accomplished by advertisement advertisement yes wonder idea did not strike before seeing how often be used in similar case advertise full description of man who called berwin note physical peculiarity look circulate such description by mean of handbill newspaper link looked angry laughed rather contemptuously a professional pride be touched by fact of being advised by individual not of calling be not so ignorant of business a think said sharply what suggest have already be done there be handbill describing appearance of berwin in police office in kingdom in newspaper also asked lucian nettled by detective tone no be not necessary agree with many people in private life be not likely to see handbill pretend to advise mr link added in soothing tone must not be wise to use medium of daily paper will think of said link too jealous of dignity to give way at once oh quite rely on discretion said denzil hastily know own business best if succeed in identifying berwin will let know link looked keenly at young man why do wish to know about matter asked out of simple curiosity case be so mysterious must like to watch unravel well said link rather gratified by tribute to power will indulge fancy result of conversation be that lucian observed in newspaper next day advertisement describing look name physical peculiarity of deceased with special mention of loss of left hand little finger strange cicatrice on right cheek satisfied that only way to learn truth have be adopted by authority lucian impatiently waited for development of scheme within week received visit from detective be right be wrong mr denzil admitted link generously newspaper be of more use than handbill yesterday received letter from lady who be coming to see to morrow at office so if care to be present at interview have only to say so must like above thing said lucian eagerly who be lady mr vrain who writes from bath can identify dead man think can of course can not be certain until see body going by description however added link be inclined to believe that berwin be husband chapter vi mr vrain story denzil be much pleased with courtesy of detective link in permitting to gain at first hand further detail of mysterious case with natural curiosity engendered by short acquaintance with unfortunate berwin be most anxious to learn why man have secluded from world in geneva square who be enemy hinted at a desirous of death in what manner for what reason have met with so barbarous fate at hand seemed likely that mr vrain who asserted to be wife of deceased must be able to answer question in full therefore be punctual in keeping appointment at office of link be rather astonished to find mr vrain have arrived be deep in conversation with detective while third person who have evidently accompanied sat near at hand silent attentive to what be being discussed a dead man have be close on sixty year of age mr vrain claimed to be wife denzil have quite expected to meet with elderly woman instead of doing so however beheld pretty young lady of not more than twenty five whose raiment of widow weed set off beauty to greatest advantage be charming blonde with golden hair blue eye complexion of rose leaf hue in spite of grief demeanour be lively engaging smile particularly attractive lighting up whole face in most fascinating manner hand foot be small stature be that of fairy figure be perfect in way altogether mr vrain looked like sylph dainty shepherdess of dresden china must have be arrayed in gossamer robe rather than in deep mourning affected indeed lucian considered that such weed be rather premature a mr vrain must not yet be certain that murdered man be husband looked so charming childlike creature that forgave being too eager to consider widow perhaps with such elderly husband eagerness be natural from charming vision lucian eye wandered to attentive third person rosy cheeked plump little man of between fifty sixty from resemblance to mr vrain for have same blue eye pink white complexion lucian guessed that be father such indeed proved to be case link on lucian entrance introduced to sylph in black who in turn presented to silvery haired benevolent old man whom called mr jabez clyne at first sound of voice lucian detected so pronounced twang so curious way of collocating word a to conclude mr vrain amiable parent hailed from state little lady seemed to pride on indicated republican origin in speech more than be necessary at least denzil thought so then on occasion be disposed to be hyper critical say now said mr vrain casting approving glance on lucian face be right down glad to see mr link here be just saying knew husband mr vrain knew a mr berwin mark berwin replied denzil taking seat just think of now cried mr vrain with liveliness rather subdued in compliment to apparel real name be mark vrain well guess wo

voice so ai use wishing back a can see have got to negotiate kingdom come time not in same way hope said lucian dryly beg pardon link interrupt conversation by mean replied detective readily have just begun when entered mr denzil be much of talk anyhow said mr vrain be only replying to stupid question stupid if will necessary observed link with gravity let continue be certain that dead man be

lucian with long sharp instrument dagger suggested clyne must be even more precise said denzil slowly must say stiletto italian stiletto stiletto gasped mr vrain whose delicate pink colour have faded to chalky white oh oh fainted forthwith chapter vii assurance money mr vrain fainting fit be of great duration shortly recovered sens not sprightliness excuse be that long discussion of husband murder too precise detail related to by link before denzil arrival have so wrought on nerve a to occasion temporary indisposition reason be trifle weak since seemed to bear husband loss with great stoicism awakened suspicion in lucian mind a to truthfulness however be too vague confused to be put into word so young man remained silent until mr vrain father departed did almost immediately after widow have given london country address to detective in case must require in conduct of case matter being attended to left room with parting smile especial bow to lucian link smiled in turn a observed parthian shaft shooting of be certainly out of keeping with mr vrain character of mourning widow seem to have made impression on lady mr denzil said with slight cough to conceal amusement nonsense replied lucian fair face crimsoning with vexation seems to one of willow woman who must sooner flirt with tinker than pas unnoticed by male sex like concluded with abruptness on what ground well spoke very hardly about husband seemed rather more concerned about assurance money than death be flippant doll with good deal of adventuress about think said barrister significantly that be altogether so ignorant of matter a pretend to be detective raised eyebrow propose to accuse of murder asked sceptically oh answered denzil hastily say be a guilty a that know something suspect something how do make

until identifies body of dead husband get money if be guilty will track down be certain have nothing to do with crime if have be not likely that must enter lion den by coming to see mr denzil have found mare nest lucian shrugged shoulder took up hat to go may be right said reluctantly have doubt of mr vrain will continue to have until supply more feasible explanation of fainting in meantime will leave to follow out case in manner judge best will see who be right in long run denzil still holding to opinion took departure leaving link confident that young man did not know what be talking about a detective sat thinking over late conversation wondering if must shape definite course out of denzil put head in at door say link called out 'd better find out if mr vrain be really wife of dead man before be guided by story after speech hurriedly withdrew leaving link to digest at leisure at first link be indignant that denzil must deem so easily hoodwinked a speech implied afterwards began to laugh wife said to of course be man wife know too much about to be otherwise even granting that denzil be right for moment admit there be need for to prove truth of assumption if pretty woman be not true wife of berwin vrain dead man name actually may be assurance company will get at right of matter before paying over money subsequent event reflected credit on philosophical speech determination of mr link have mr vrain be imposter house of card must have be knocked down a soon a reared by searching inquiry instituted by sirius assurance company appeared that life of late mark vrain be on book of company for le sum than twenty thousand pound under will be to be paid over to lydia vrain nee clyne widow aided by father who be shrewd business man in spite of innocent look family lawyer of vrains went systematically to work to establish own identity death of husband consequent right to money first thing to be done be to prove that dead man be really vrain there be little difficulty in obtaining order from authority for opening of grave exhumation of body finally consent of in power be obtained there be little difficulty in identification of remains lawyer mr clyne mr vrain several people brought up from bath by assurance company swore that corpse buried under false name of berwin be that of mark vrain for decomposition have not proceeded so far what feature must be recognised there be even need to unwrap body from cerement a face scar thereon be quite sufficient for friend of deceased to swear to corpse thereupon assurance company on fullest of evidence be compelled to admit that client be dead expressed ready to pay over money to mr vrain a soon a will must be proved pending legal process necessary to do widow made great parade of grief affection for dead man have body re enclosed in new sumptuous coffin removed same to berwin manor near bath where after short lapse of time be duly placed in family vault of vrains widow having thus

month have elapsed since murder of mark vrain crime have be relegated to oblivion by press people curiosity concerning be still active in geneva square gossip in talkative quarter have exhausted tongue imagination in surmising who have committed deed how have be accomplished be now known that deceased have be of good county family who have left pretty young wife in fit of groundless suspicion that have enemy have withdrawn to silent house to save from machination of purely imaginary being general opinion be that vrain have be insane even did not explain reason of tragic unforeseen death since murder silent house have acquired tenfold interest in eye of crime added to reputation for being haunted invested with horror commonplace look assumed to fanciful onlooker grim menacing aspect in keeping with blood stained floor ghostly room disheartened by late catastrophe have so greatly enhanced already evil reputation of house landlord did not attempt to relet a knew very well that tenant must be bold enough to take even at nominal rent mr vrain have sold off furniture of two apartment unfortunate husband have inhabited now be a bare lonely a rest of room landlord made effort to furbish up renovate mansion deeming that such expense must be useless so no deserted by man cursed by god remained vacant avoided people came from far near to look at one entered door lest evil fate must befall yet in strange contradiction to horror created in breast house on side continued to be occupied miss greeb frequently took peep across way at empty house with curtainless dusty window smokeless chimney have theorised often on murder of vrain being unable to come to reasonable conclusion finally decided that ghost ghost haunted mansion have committed crime in support of fantastic opinion related to lucian at least score of story in people foolishly sleeping in haunted room have be found dead in morning with black finger mark on throat said miss greeb dramatically look of horror in eye everything locked up just like be in to show that nothing ghost must have killed forget miss greeb said lucian flippantly poor vrain be stabbed with stiletto ghost use material weapon how do know dagger be real one replied miss greeb sinking voice to horrified whisper be ever seen be ever found ghost took away depend upon mr denzil be flesh blood a made spirit of crazy berwin in case ghostly criminal ca be hanged said denzil with laugh be nonsense miss greeb be astonished that woman of sense must believe in such rubbish wiser people than have faith in ghost retorted landlady obstinately have heard of haunted house in west end square where man dog be found dead in morning with valet a gibbered awful ever afterwards pooh pooh be story of bulwer lytton be not mr denzil be fact can see very house in square for be just such nonsense why 'd sleep in to morrow night just to prove that ghostly fear be moonshine miss greeb uttered screech of alarm mr denzil cried with great energy sooner than must do 'd 'd well know what 'd do accuse of stealing silver spoon have locked up said lucian laughing make easy miss greeb have intention of tempting providence same believe for one minute that be haunted light be seen flitting from room to room doubt poor vrain showed over house before died candle explains light have be seen since death said miss greeb solemnly then a ghost vrain must be walking about with old woman phantom who wear brocade high heeled shoe miss greeb seeing that have sceptic to deal with retreated with great dignity from argument nevertheless to other people maintained opinion with many fact drawn from imagination from book on supernatural compiled from imagination a various writer called experience of others agreed with others laughed at one acknowledged that however came about whether by ghostly mortal mean murder of vrain be riddle never likely to be solved with other event of like nature mystery be relegated to list of undiscovered crime after several interview with link barrister be also inclined to take view of matter found detective quite discouraged in effort to find assassin have be to bath said link dismally have examined so far a be able into past life of vrain can find nothing likely to throw light on subject did not get on well with wife left bath ten month before murder tried to trace where went to must not vanished from bath quite unexpectedly four month later turned up in geneva square a know who killed why be killed ca say be afraid will have to give up a bad job mr denzil what lose reward of five hundred pound said lucian if be five thousand must lose returned dejected link case beat believe murderer will ever be run down upon word be inclined to agree with said denzil barrister detective departed convinced that vrain case be ended that in face of insuperable obstacle presented by there be not slightest chance of avenging murder of unfortunate man reading of mystery be beyond mortal power to accomplish about middle of april nearly four month after tragedy lucian received letter containing invitation caused little astonishment note be signed diana vrain having intimated that writer have returned only that week from australia requested that mr denzil must be kind enough to call next day at royal john hotel in kensington miss vrain ended by stating that have particular desire to converse with mr denzil hoped that must not fail to keep appointment wondering greatly how lady who be doubt stepdaughter referred to by mr vrain have obtained address why desired to see so particularly lucian out of sheer curiosity obeyed summons next day at four o'clock appointed hour presented a requested on giving name be shown immediately into presence of correspondent who occupied small private sitting room when miss vrain rose to greet lucian be amazed to see how beautiful stately be with dark hair eye oval face firm mouth majestic figure imperial gait moved towards apparent queen greater contrast to mr vrain than stepdaughter can scarcely be imagined one be frivolous volatile fairy other dignified reserved woman also be arrayed in black garment be made in plainest manner showed none of coquetry of woe such a have characterised mr vrain elaborate costume look of sorrow on face of diana be in keeping with mourning apparel welcomed lucian with subdued courtesy prepossessed greatly in favour quick in like dislike young man be a drawn towards beautiful sad woman a formerly have be repulsed by feigned grief ensnaring glance of silly mr vrain be much obliged to for calling mr denzil said miss vrain in deep voice rather melancholy in tone doubt wondered how obtained address did strike a peculiar confess said lucian taking chair to pointed on considering matter fancied that mr vrain have mr vrain echoed diana in tone of contempt have not seen mr vrain since returned week ago to london got address from detective who examined into death of most unhappy father have seen link yes know link must tell mentioned name frequently in narrative gave to understand on two occasion have spoken with father therefore asked to give address so might speak with personally on matter be quite at service miss vrain suppose wish to learn know of tragedy wish for more than mr denzil said diana quietly wish to help in hunting down assassin of father what do intend to reopen case certainly did not know that case a call have be closed have come home from australia especially to devote to matter must have be in london long ago out in australia be with friend in part of country where be difficult to get letter a soon a mr vrain letter about terrible end of father came to hand arranged affair left at once for england since arrival have seen mr saker family lawyer mr link detective have told know now wish to hear what have to say be afraid can not help miss vrain said lucian dubiously ah refuse to help oh will only be too glad to do what can protested lucian shocked that must think so hard hearted know of nothing likely to solve mystery link have done best to discover truth without success well mr denzil said diana after pause often say that woman wit can do more than man logic so must put head together discover guilty person have suspicion no have suspicion replied lucian frankly have have suspect lady mr vrain yes how do know meant because at one time suspected myself suspected rightly replied diana believe that mr vrain killed husband chapter ix marriage be failure denzil did not reply at once to accusation levelled by diana at mr vrain a be too astonished at vehemence to find voice readily when did speak be to argue on side of pretty widow think must be mistaken said at length mr denzil declared that suspected at one time not now replied lucian decisively because at time of murder mr vrain be keeping christmas in berwin manor like nero fiddling when rome be burning retorted diana sharply mistake meaning say that mr vrain committed crime personally inspired guided assassin who be assassin in opinion count hercule ferruci italian a may guess from name now be strange cried lucian with excitement for from nature of wound believe that father be stabbed by italian stiletto aha said diana with satisfaction strengthens accusation bring against ferruci again continued denzil hardly listening to what be saying when mentioned suspicion about stiletto in hearing of mr vrain fainted showed that guilty conscience pricked oh be sure of mr denzil stepmother count be criminal evidence a yet be only circumstantial said lucian cautiously must not jump to conclusion at present be completely in dark regarding foreigner can enlighten be long story longer better said denzil thinking must hear diana speak watch face for hour without weariness wish for detail then will be in better position to judge what say be only reasonable mr denzil will tell father history from time went to italy three year ago be in italy to be precise in florence that met with lydia clyne father one moment said denzil before begin will tell what think of couple think cried diana disdainfully think be couple of adventurer be worst of two old man jabez clyne think moderately well of be weak fool under thumb of daughter if only knew what have suffered at hand of golden haired doll must think must hold own miss vrain not against treachery lie retorted diana fiercely be not habit to employ such weapon stepmother used others be who drove out of house made exile to antipode to escape falseness be added miss vrain solemnly who treated father so ill a to drive out of own home lydia vrain be not doll think to be be false cruel clever adventuress hate hate with heart soul feminine outburst of anger rather bewildered denzil who saw very plainly that diana be by mean lofty angel have taken to be in first appreciation of beauty passion of moment suited so well with stately look that seemed rather margaret of anjou defying york faction than injured woman concerned with so slight thing a rebuke of one of own sex for whom have little love diana saw surprise expressed on lucian face own flushed little with annoyance that must have betrayed feeling so openly with vexed laugh recovered temper composed demeanour see be saint mr denzil said resuming seat for in anger have risen to foot even if be one must not have restrained from speaking a did when know stepmother a well a do must talk calmly about will not understand reason for thinking concerned in terrible fate of poor father be attention miss vrain will tell know a concisely a possible replied can judge for if be right wrong three year ago father health be very bad since death of mother now ten year have devoted to hard study have lived more le life of recluse in berwin manor be writing history of elizabethan dramatist became so engrossed with work that neglected health consequently there be danger that might suffer from brain fever doctor ordered to leave book to travel in order that attention might be distracted by new scene new people be to go with to see that did not resume study so in evil hour for went to italy father be not mad said lucian thinking of extraordinary behaviour of vrain in square oh cried diana indignantly be trifle weak in head from overwork quite capable of looking after did indulge in strong drink miss vrain looked scandalised father be singularly abstemious in eating drinking said stiffly why do ask question beg pardon replied lucian with humility be reported in geneva square berwin name by father be known drank too much when met be certainly not not quite finished barrister delicately doubt trouble drove to take more than be good for said diana in low voice yet wonder at for health be none of best sometimes admit took sleeping draught drug be consumptive said lucian noticing diana hesitation to speak plainly chest be weak consumption may have developed when left england almost two year back be certainly not suffering from disease see how be said diana wringing hand during short absence under tyranny of wife physical health moral principle gave way drink consumption ah god be not ill enough what woman must add murder to cap know yet if be guilty said lucian quietly will go on with story miss vrain later on can discus matter when be in possession of fact say be evil hour when went to italy be indeed said diana sorrowfully for in florence at pension donizetti on lung arno met with lydia clyne father have only lately arrived in italy from new york suppose already be said to be engaged to needy italian nobleman named hercule ferruci then suppose clynes be rich said lucian for know italian noble too well to suspect that count ferruci must pay attention to one heiress be supposed to be rich mr denzil american for reason be supposed to be millionaire after married father learned that mr clyne have very moderate fortune indeed daughter nothing be for reason that lydia threw over count to whom be almost engaged began to pay attention to father heard talk of estate in gossip of pension believing to be rich decided to marry instead of throwing away in romantic fit on ferruci did love italian yes be sure did what be more love still what be count ferruci still acquainted with mr vrain be a will hear miss clyne a said determined to make rich marriage by becoming second mr vrain never liked knowing that be false frivolous though did best to stop marriage father must not be controlled know that woman be pretty fascinating be certainly first not last interposed lucian at event resumed diana disconsolately be sufficiently fascinating to snare poor foolish old father remained four month in florence before left lydia clyne became mr vrain must hing with father a be possessed of headstrong passion of old man moreover lydia have learned to know weak point so well that must twist round finger angered a be at father folly loved too well to leave at time therefore returned to berwin manor with pair there mr denzil continued miss vrain face growing dark lydia made life so wretched insulted so openly be forced out of self respect to leave house have relative in australia to whom went out on visit ala wish have not done so yet remain with colonial cousin did until recalled to england by terrible intelligence of father untimely end so marriage be failure yes even before left lydia openly neglected father be bound to say that mr clyne who be much better of two tried to make conduct in more becoming manner defied one else after departure received letter from friend of mine who told that lydia have invited count ferruci over on visit father finding that must hing seeing what mistake have made returned to book soon became ill again instead of looking after lydia a heard encouraged to study hard hoping doubt that must die that must be free to marry count ferruci then father left house why be very necessary detail diana thought for moment then shook head despondingly can not explain said with sigh a be in australia at time expect that brain grew weaker with study perhaps with strong drink drug woman drove to take doubt poor man grew jealous of ferruci unable to assert seeing how ill be left house retired to geneva square to meet death a know be supposition remonstrated lucian really know why mr vrain left house what doe lydia say give feasible explanation will oh cried diana be there way of getting at truth of matter feel certain that lydia count be guilty have proof said denzil shaking head proof why said that stiletto be supposition on part interrupted lucian quickly can not say for certain that deed be committed with weapon besides if be how can connect italian with deed can not find proof fear not if search house there be little use in doing rejoined lucian however if will give satisfaction miss vrain will take over house to morrow morning do cried diana may find proof of lydia guilt in way little dream of good bye mr denzil till to morrow chapter x parti coloured ribbon beauty high spirit of diana made so deep impression on lucian that determined to aid by mean in power in searching for assassin of father a yet denzil have reached age of twenty five without having be attracted in marked degree towards woman kind to put more precisely have not yet be in love now seemed that hour come to of adam son have come to for on leaving diana thought of nothing else lovely face charming smile until met again image be never absent from mind took languid interest in daily business social pursuit wrapped up in inwardly contemplating beauty of diana appeared to move amongst fellow men like one in dream dreamer be for there be substantial basis for passion many people particularly without imagination scoff at idea that love can be born in moment such be often case for ill advised jibe man may be brought into contact with loveliest most brilliant of woman yet remain heart whole yet unexpectedly face not always most beautiful will fire with sudden fervour even against better judgment love be not affair of reason to be clipped measured by logic calculation devouring destroying passion impatient of restraint utterly regardless of common sense be born of look of smile of sigh of word spring up fructifies more speedily than did jonah gourd none can say how begin how will end be ever old ever new riddle of creation more narrowly mystery be looked into more impossible doe become of solution lover of to day with century of example at back be wiser in knowledge than be father adam although lucian be thus stricken mad after irrational method of cupid have sufficient sense not to examine too minutely into reason for sudden passion be in love admitting a much to there be end of argument long lane of youthful loveless life have turned in direction at signpost of woman face down new vista lover saw flowering meadow silver stream bower of rose landscape of arcadia be piping swain diana complaisant shepherdess have not yet entered into promised arcadia might never do so unless diana be a kindly a wished to be lucian be in love with diana a yet must not flatter that be in

landlord still lamenting over unlucky possession of haunted blood stained mansion before going to lucian walked down street leading into geneva square in order to meet diana who be due at eleven o'clock punctual a barrister be found that miss vrain in impatience be before for arrived to see dismiss cab at end of street met half way down heart gave bound a saw graceful figure felt hot blood rise to cheek a advanced to meet diana quite unconscious of having like namesake moon caused springtide of heart must not forbear glance of surprise greeted coadjutor without embarrassment with friendliness thought be too taken up with immediate task of exploring scene of crime to waste time in conjecturing reason of young man blush yet instinct of sex might have told truth probably must have that be blunted rather not exercised by reason of preoccupation have key mr denzil said eagerly have seen landlord have given permission to go over house charwoman who be cleaning up place will

ringing bell be in house that father came to untimely end here be mr kebby amiable crone have opened door while young man be speaking now stood eyeing visitor with blear eyed look of dark suspicion

leered amiably at couple dessay be worth two shilling said chuckling hoarsely oh be not so old what know two turtle dove to kiss over yer father blood lawks what match be still laughing hoarsely mr kebby in midst of unholy joy be pushed out of door by lucian who immediately afterwards turned to see if diana have overheard ill chosen ominous word miss vrain with hard white face be leaning against wall gave sign of such knowledge eye be fixed on dull looking red stain of dark hue irregular in shape hand while be pressed closely against bosom a though felt cruel pain in heart with bloodless cheek trembling lip daughter looked upon evidence of father death lucian be alarmed by unnatural pallor miss vrain exclaimed starting forward be ill let lead out of house said diana waving back not till examine inch of speak to please wish to use eye rather than tongue denzil a lover friend respected emotion of poor young lady so natural under circumstance in silence conducted from room to room be empty still dusty for mr kebby broom swept sufficiently light footfall of pair echoed hollowly in vast space diana looked into corner examined fireplace attempted window in place must find extraneous object likely to afford clue to crime went down into basement explored kitchen servant parlour scullery pantry with same unsatisfactory result kitchen door led out into back yard showed sign of having be lately opened when diana drew lucian attention to fact a murderer having possibly entered thereby assured that have only lately be opened by detective link when be searching for clue saw door added lucian striking with cane week before father be killed showed to to prove that one must have entered house during absence be satisfied then from rusty condition of bolt absence of key in lock that door have not be opened at event during tenancy then how must who killed have entered be what wish to learn miss vrain why do speak in plural because believe that lydia ferruci killed father have proved to that mr vrain remained at bath know replied diana quickly sent ferruci up to kill father speak in plural because think in moral sense be a guilty a italian may be miss vrain a yet have not proved guilt diana made answer followed by lucian ascended to upper part of house where found kebby sweeping so vigorously that have raised kind of dust storm a soon a saw couple hobbled towards to cajole if possible into giving money for few moment diana looked at haughtily not relishing familiarity of old dame unexpectedly stepped forward with look of excitement where did get that ribbon asked mr kebby pointing to scrap of personal adornment on neck of rusty old creature croaked mr kebby picked up in kitchen downstairs be pretty red yaller thing of value miss so s'pose will take orf paying attention to whimpering diana twitched ribbon out of old woman hand examined be broad yellow ribbon of rich silk spotted with red very noticeably evidently of foreign manufacture be same cried diana greatly excited mr denzil bought ribbon in florence well said lucian wondering at excitement what doe prove that stiletto father bought in florence at same time have be used to kill tied ribbon round handle of stiletto chapter xi further discovery silence followed diana announcement regarding ribbon stiletto for lucian kept silence out of sheer astonishment be broken by hoarse voice of mr kebby if ye want ribbon miss will not say no to shilling with what good gentleman promised will be three a be ready to take mr kebby held out dirty claw for silver will sell will cried out diana indignantly pouncing down on harridan how dare keep what be yours if have shown detective shaking ribbon in mr kebby face might have caught criminal pardon interposed lucian finding voice hardly think so miss vrain for one must have told that ribbon adorned stiletto where did see weapon last in library at berwin manor hung up on wall myself by ribbon be sure be same ribbon be certain replied diana emphatically can not be mistaken colour pattern be peculiar where did find added turning to mr kebby in kitchen tell ye growled old woman sullenly only found blessed morning 't be in dark corner near door a lead down to woodshed how be to know 't be good did find anything else asked lucian mildly did sir not stiletto demanded diana putting ribbon in pocket know what be stiletter miss did find nothing ai thief though people a set above others by taking ribbon a doe belong to 'em may be much good ribbon be not yours said diana haughtily yes be finding be keeping with answered mr kebby anger whispered denzil touching miss vrain arm may find useful diana looked from to old woman opened purse at sight of mr kebby sour face relaxed when miss vrain gave half sovereign quite beamed with joy blessing of heaven on dear said with curtsey gold good gold ah be brave day work for thirteen blessed shilling ten mean mr kebby oh sir cried mr kebby obsequiously lady gave ten bless heart have quite forgot three said two ah so did sir be poor schollard at 'rithmetic be clever enough to get money out of people said diana who be disgusted at avarice of hag however for present must be content with what have given if in cleaning house find other article whatever may be will have ten shilling on consideration that take at once to mr denzil mr kebby who be tying up piece of gold in corner of handkerchief nodded old head with much complacency will do miss be if gentleman will pay on delivery like cash will have cash said lucian laughing then a diana intimated intention of leaving house descended stair in company miss vrain kept silence until be outside in sunshine when cast upward glance at warm blue sky dappled with light cloud be glad to be out of house said with shudder there be something in dark freezing atmosphere chill spirit be said to be haunted know said lucian carelessly then after pause spoke on subject be uppermost in mind now that have piece of evidence miss vrain what do intend to do make sure have made mistake mr denzil will go down to berwin manor afternoon if stiletto be still hanging on library wall by ribbon will admit mistake if be absent why then will return to town consult with a to what be best to be done know rely on will do wish miss vrain said lucian fervently be very good of replied lady gratefully for have right to take up time in manner have right be mean mean stammered denzil thinking from surprised look of miss vrain that have gone too far at so early stage of acquaintance mean that a briefless barrister have ample time at command will only be too happy to place at service moreover added in lighter tone have selfish interest in matter also for be not one who find so difficult riddle a to solve will never rest easy in mind until unravel whole of tangled skein how good be cried diana impulsively extending hand be a impossible for to thank sufficiently now for kindness a will be to reward hereafter must succeed a to reward said lucian retaining hand longer than be necessary can decide what merit when father death be avenged diana coloured turned away eye withdrawing hand in meantime from too warm clasp of young man sense of meaning be suddenly borne in upon by look clasp felt maidenly confusion at momentary boldness of undeclared lover however with feminine tact laughed off hint shortly afterwards took leave promising to communicate a speedily a possible with lucian regarding circumstance of visit to bath barrister wished to escort back to royal john hotel in kensington miss vrain guessing feeling must not permit so lucian hat in hand be left standing in geneva square while divinity drove off in prosaic hansom with went glory of sunlight sweetness of spring denzil more in love than ever sighed hugely a walked slowly back to lodging for doleful mood hard work other interest be sole cure therefore same afternoon lucian returned to explore silent house on own account have struck a suggestive that parti coloured ribbon to diana attached such importance must have be found in so out of way corner a threshold of door conducted to what mr kebby with characteristic misrepresentation called woodshed in reality place in question be cellar extended under soil of back yard be lighted from top by skylight placed on level with ground on being admitted again by mr kebby sending that ancient female to augean task of cleansing house lucian descended to basement in order to examine kitchen cellar more particularly if a diana stated ribbon have be knotted loosely about hilt of stiletto must have fallen off unnoticed by assassin when weapon in hand be retreating from scene of crime must have come down here from sitting room mused denzil a stood in cool damp kitchen a ribbon be found by mr kebby near yonder door be most probable that left kitchen by passage for cellar now remains for to find out how made exit from cellar also must look for stiletto possibly dropped in flight a did ribbon while thus soliloquising denzil lighted candle have taken precaution to bring with for purpose of making underground exploration having thus provided with mean to dispel darkness stepped into door descended stone stair led to cellar at foot of step found in passage running from front to back of house forthwith turned to right in order to reach particular cellar be dug out in manner of cave under back yard a lucian ascertained by walking round be faced with stone have bin on four side for storage of wine overhead there be glass skylight of glass be so dusty dirty that only few ray of light must struggle into murky depth below what particularly attracted attention of denzil be short wooden ladder lying on stone pavement probably be used to reach wine in upper bin must not be surprised if have be used for purpose murmured lucian glancing upward at square aperture of skylight struck a possible that stranger must enter thereby descend by ladder to test truth of reared ladder in middle of cellar so that top rung rested against lower edge of square overhead ascending carefully for ladder be by mean stout pushed glass frame upward found that yielded easily to moderate amount of strength climbing up step after step lucian arose through aperture like genie out of earth soon found that must jump easily out of cellar into yard good exclaimed much gratified by discovery now see how assassin entered wonder kitchen door be bolted barred that one be seen to visit vrain by front door one who knew position of skylight must obtain admission easily at hour by descending ladder passing through cellar kitchen to upper part of house so much be clear must next discover how who entered got into yard indeed there seemed outlet for yard be enclosed on three side by fence of paling height of man rendered impervious to damp by coating of tar on fourth side by house only over fence be insuperable obstacle must stranger have gained access to yard towards fence opposite to house lucian walked in there be gate opening of kind so must appear that to come into yard stranger must need to climb over feat easily achieved by moderately active man a denzil examined frail barrier eye be caught by fluttering object on left be side in line with skylight found be scrap of woman veil of thin black gauze spotted with velvet at once thought reverted to shadow of woman on blind suspicion of diana vrain great heaven thought can that doll of lydia be guilty after chapter xii veil owner a may be surmised lucian be considerably startled by discovery of important evidence so confirmative of diana suspicion yet knowledge link have gained relative to mr vrain remaining at berwin manor to keep christmas seemed to contradict fact must by mean reconcile absence with presence on fence of fragment of gauze still le with supposition that must have climbed over tolerably difficult obstacle to enter yard let alone necessity by mean easy to woman of descending into disused cellar by mean of shaky fragile ladder after thought lucian when be seated that same evening at dinner be more certain that veil be property of mr vrain than be that be woman whose shadow saw on blind whosoever be that gained entrance by passing over fence through cellar must have come across yard belonging to house facing other road therefore person must be known to owner of house must discover who owner be miss greeb will know lucian made last remark with greatest confidence a be satisfied from long acquaintance with landlady that there be very little concerning own neighbourhood of be ignorant result verified belief for when miss greeb came in to clear table duty invariably undertook so a to have chance of conversing with admired lodger be able to afford fullest information on subject position of house in question name of owner character of tenant be thoroughly well posted up in item willingly imparted knowledge with much detail comment no jersey street said unhesitatingly be number of house at back of haunted mansion mr denzil know a well a know ten finger to whom doe belong asked lucian mr peacock owns most of property round about here having bought up land when place be first built on be seventy year of age know mr denzil continued miss greeb conversationally rich lord know how rich be building house cheap letting dear have made more out of than in sanding sugar chicorying coffee be name of tenant interrupted lucian cutting short rapid sketch of peacock life mr bensusan one of largest woman hereabouts quite understand fat mr denzil turn scale at eighteen stone have pretty well broke weighing machine in place what reputation have miss greeb oh pretty good said little woman shrugging shoulder though do say overcharge underfeeds lodger keep boarding house then well let room explained miss greeb in very definite manner who live in supply own food pay for service kitchen fire who be with now one replied landlady promptly be have bill up three month last lodger left about christmas what be name name oh be 'he ' said miss greeb smiling mr bensusan prefers gentleman who be out of door day to lady muddling meddling day about house must say do too mr denzil ended lady with fascinating glance what be name miss greeb repeated lucian quite impervious to hint let see said miss greeb discomfited at result of failure queer name have to do with payment bill a short for william be that although doe suggest account quarterday have something to do with quarter day rent finished miss greeb triumphantly rent with ' w ' before w r e n t spelled lucian yes wrent mr wrent strange name mr denzil kind of charade a may say be with mr bensusan six month came to house about time mr berwin hired very strange assented lucian to stop further comment what kind of man be mr wrent know never heard much about replied miss greeb regretfully may ask why want to know mr denzil lucian hesitated a rather dreaded chattering tongue of landlady did not wish connection with vrain case to become public property in geneva square still miss greeb be valuable ally if only for wide acquaintance with neighbourhood inhabitant doings therefore after moment reflection resolved to secure miss greeb a coadjutor risk excessive garrulity can keep secret miss greeb asked with impressive solemnity struck by serious air at once on fire with curiosity to learn reason miss greeb loudly protested that must sooner die than breathe word of what lodger be about to divulge hinted with many mysterious look nod secret endangering domestic happiness of family in square be known to appealed to fact that such family still lived in harmony a proof that be to be trusted wild horse must drag out of what know cried miss greeb earnestly can confide in a must in be about to say mother recollecting juvenile look substituted word sister very good said lucian explaining just a much a must serve purpose then may tell miss greeb suspect assassin of mr vrain entered through mr bensusan house so got into yard of lord cried miss greeb taken by surprise say sir mr wrent be murdering villain steeped in gore replied lucian smiling at highly coloured description jump to conclusion miss greeb so far a be aware mr wrent speak of be innocent do know mr bensusan house well have visited several time mr denzil well then tell continued barrister be house built with full frontage like in square mean to gain mr bensusan back yard be necessary to go through mr bensusan house replied miss greeb shutting eye to conjure up image of friend premise can go round back through side passage lead in from jersey road h be said lucian in dissatisfied tone complicates matter how so sir demanded curious landlady never mind just now miss greeb do think must draw plan of passage of mr bensusan house of with yard between never must sketch said miss greeb regretfully be artist mr denzil think can do what want here be sheet of paper pencil will sketch house a clearly a can with much reflection nibbling of pencil casting of eye up to ceiling to aid memory miss greeb in ten minute produced required sketch there be mr denzil said miss greeb placing work of art before barrister be a good a can draw be excellent miss greeb replied lucian examining plan see that anyone can get into mr bensusan yard through side passage oh yes think person must without being seen by mr bensusan rhoda who be rhoda servant be a sharp a needle idle slut for mr denzil say be gypsy of kind be gate of passage locked at night not that know of then what be to prevent one coming in under cover of darkness climbing fence must escape then being seen by landlady servant daresay 'd be seen climbing over fence from back window of house on side of not if chose dark night for climbing well even if did how must get into argued miss greeb know have read report of case mr denzil must be found out a kitchen door be locked stranger entered square how murdering assassin got in may discover even replied lucian not choosing to tell miss greeb that have already discovered entrance with time inquiry observation can do much thank miss greeb continued slipping drawing of plan into breast coat pocket be much obliged for information of course will repeat conversation to one swear to breathe word said miss greeb dramatically left room greatly pleased with secret understanding have air of innocent intrigue such a be detailed in journal designed for use of family circle for next day two lucian mused over information have obtained made fresh drawing of plan for own satisfaction took step on new evidence a be anxious to submit discovery to miss vrain before doing so at present time diana be at bath taking possession of ancestral acre consulting family lawyer on various matter connected with property once wrote to lucian advising that have heard several piece of news likely to be useful in clearing up mystery refused to communicate save at personal interview denzil be thus kept in suspense unable to rest until knew precisely value of miss vrain newly acquired information therefore be with feeling of relief that received note from asking to call at three o'clock on sunday at royal john hotel since going coming week have elapsed now that divinity have returned be about to see again sun shone once more in heaven for lucian arrayed for visit with utmost care heart beat violently colour rose a be ushered into little sitting room thought le of case at moment than of joy in seeing miss vrain once more in hearing speak watching lovely face on part diana recollecting last meeting more particularly parting blushed in turn gave hand to barrister with new born timidity also be inclined to like lucian more than be reasonable for peace of heart so two people drawn to other must have come together a lover even at second meeting ala for prosaicness of workaday world have to assume attitude of lawyer client discourse of crime instead of love situation be trifle ironical must have provoked laughter of god well asked miss vrain getting to business a soon a lucian be seated what have found out great deal likely to be of service to replied miss vrain in satisfied tone have discovered that stiletto with ribbon be gone from library who took away one know ca find out although asked servant have be missing from place for month do think mr vrain took ca say replied diana have made one discovery about mr vrain implicates still more in crime be not in berwin manor on christmas eve in town really said lucian much amazed link be told that spent christmas in manor at bath so did link asked generally be answered generally mr vrain went up to town on christmas eve returned on christmas day said diana with emphasis spent night in town on night murder be committed lucian produced pocketbook took therefrom fragment of gauze handed to diana found on fence at back of no said be veil portion of velvet spotted veil velvet spotted veil cried diana looking at then belongs to lydia vrain usually wear velvet spotted veil mr denzil evidence be complete that woman be guilty chapter xiii gossip going by circumstantial evidence diana certainly have good ground to accuse mr vrain of committing crime for there be four point at least must be proved past doubt a incriminating strongly in matter in first place female shadow on blind seen by lucian showed that woman have be in habit of entering house by secret way of cellar during absence of vrain secondly finding of parti coloured ribbon in silent house have be knotted round handle of stiletto by diana absence of stiletto from usual place on wall of berwin manor library proved that weapon have be removed therefrom to london presumably used to commit deed seeing that otherwise there be necessity for presence in geneva square mansion thirdly diana have discovered that lydia have spent night of murder in town lastly also declared that fragment of gauze found by lucian on dividing fence be property of mr vrain quartette of charge be recapitulated by diana in support of accusation of stepmother always suspected a indirectly guilty declared in concluding speech for prosecution be not certain until now that have actually struck blow did said denzil by mean convinced know what further evidence require to prove retorted diana indignantly be in town on christmas eve took stiletto from library ca prove that interrupted lucian decidedly then seeing look of anger on diana face hastened to apologise excuse miss vrain said nervously be not le friend because combat argument in case be necessary to look on side of question be possible to prove mr vrain removed dagger nobody actually saw in possession replied diana who be more amenable to reason than majority of sex can prove that stiletto with ribbon remained in library after departure of father if lydia did not take who else have occasion to bring up to london let say count ferruci suggested denzil diana pointed to fragment of veil lying on table on evidence of piece of gauze said be lydia who entered house again saw shadow on window blind saw two shadow corrected lucian hastily of man woman in plain english mr denzil of mr vrain count ferruci can not be certain of circumstantial evidence be not always conclusive miss vrain upon word sir seem inclined to defend woman miss vrain said lucian seriously if give benefit of doubt jury will must be tried on charge admit that evidence against woman be strong be not certain argue case looking at from point of view only view be likely to be taken by counsel if mr vrain killed husband must have have strong motive to do so well said diana impatiently there be assurance money know if motive be quite strong enough to justify woman in risking neck responded barrister a mr vrain of berwin manor have ample income for father seems to have left rent to spent little on also have assured position on whole happy life why must risk losing advantage to gain more money wanted to marry ferruci said diana driven to point of defence be almost engaged to before married foolish father invited to berwin manor against wish of husband showed plainly that loved sufficiently to commit crime for sake with father dead in possession of l must hope to marry italian can prove that be so reckless yes can replied miss vrain defiantly same person who told that lydia be not at berwin manor on christmas eve can tell that behaviour with count ferruci be talk of bath who be person asked lucian looking up friend of mine miss tyler brought up with so that must get information at first hand can see at once diana rose to ring bell one moment interposed lucian before must touch button tell if miss tyler know reason for bringing up have not told directly said diana with bluntness a be fool fancy suspect why do ask because have something to tell wish friend to hear unless added lucian significantly desire to take into confidence said diana promptly think be wise to take into confidence be rather well to put plainly mr denzil rather gossip h be a such do consider evidence reliable can pick grain of wheat out of chaff doubt exaggerates garbles after fashion of scandal loving woman evidence be valuable especially a showing that lydia be not at bath on christmas eve will tell nothing so can suspect a much a like if do speak freely will spread gossip if will invent worse fact so in case doe matter what be have to tell lucian must scarcely forbear smiling at diana candidly expressed estimate of ally character fearful of giving offence to companion speedily composed feature with much explanation exhibition of miss greeb plan gave account of discovery beginning with visit to cellar ending with important conversation with landlady diana listened attentively when concluded gave a opinion that lydia have entered first yard by side passage have climbed over fence into second a be clearly proved by veil concluded decisively why must take trouble run risk of being seen when be plain that father expected expected cried diana thunderstruck impossible know so much about replied lucian drily although admit that on face of assertion appears improbable when met father second time be so anxious to prove by letting examine house that one have entered during absence that be certain be well aware shadow saw be of people knew be in room now if woman be mr vrain must have be in habit of visiting father by back way ferruci also be not sure if male shadow be ferruci no more than be certain other be mr vrain veil lucian shrugged shoulder in despair seems to prove be said dubiously ca explain father conduct in receiving in so secretive way whole thing be beyond well what be to be done said diana after pause during looked blankly at one must think head be too confused just now with conflicting evidence to plan line of action a relief let examine friend hear what have to say diana assented touched bell shortly miss tyler appeared ushered in by nervous waiter to whom must seem have addressed sharp admonition on want of deference immediately on entering pounced down on miss vrain like hawk on dove pecked on cheek addressed a dearest di finally permitted with downcast eye modest demeanour to be introduced to lucian might be inferred from foregoing description that miss tyler be young ardent damsel in teen whereas be considerably nearer forty than thirty possessed uncomely aspect unpleasing to male eye own be of cold grey lip be thin waist pinched in a natural consequence of tight lacing nose be red scanty hair be drawn off high forehead very tightly screwed into cast iron knob at nape of long neck smiled occasionally in acid manner with many teeth wore plainly made green dress with toby frill large silver cross dangled on flat bosom altogether be about a venomous specimen of unappropriated blessing a can well be imagined bella said miss vrain to unattractive female for certain reason may tell hereafter mr denzil wish to know if mr vrain be at berwin manor on christmas eve of course be not dearest di said bella drooping elderly head on one scraggy shoulder with acid smile did tell so be asked by lydia ala wish must say dearest lydia to spend christmas at berwin manor invited for singing playing know a have to make ourselves agreeable came to see on day before christmas received letter by early post seemed to upset great deal told must have to run up to town on business did stayed night came down next morning to keep christmas thought very strange what be business in town miss tyler asked lucian oh did tell said bella tossing head at least not directly gathered from what said that something be wrong with poor dear mr clyne father know dearest di be letter from oh must say that mr denzil a know never speak by hearsay so much mischief be done in world by people repeating idle tale of be not sure be count ferruci at berwin manor at time oh dear di told that be up in whole of christmas week only hope added miss tyler with venomous smile that lydia did not go up to meet why must demanded lucian bluntly oh be not blind cried bella shrilly laughing indeed count most amiable man be very attentive to at one time lydia married woman regret to say did not like being so be indeed sorry to repeat scandal mr denzil way in mr vrain behaved towards carried on with count be not creditable be gentlewoman mr denzil churchwoman a such can not countenance such conduct a infer then that mr vrain be in love with italian must be at surprised to hear cried bella again did not care for oh dear be belief mr denzil mr vrain know more about death of husband than chooses to admit oh have read paper know about death miss tyler said lucian alarmed bella cried miss vrain oh be not blind dearest interrupted bella speaking very fast know ask question to find out if lydia killed husband well did how do know miss tyler because be sure of mr denzil be mr vrain stabbed with dagger very well then there be dagger hanging in library of manor saw there four day before christmas when looked for on christmas day be gone gone who took mr vrain be sure yes be snapped miss tyler did see take be there before went be there on christmas day if lydia did not take who did count ferruci perhaps be there cried bella raising head be sure mr vrain stole killed husband care who hears say so diana lucian looked at one in silence chapter xiv house in jersey street a listener made comment on miss tyler accusation of mr vrain paused only for moment to recover breath be off again in full cry with budget of ancient gossip drawn from very retentive memory of way in lydia treated poor dear husband know little cried fair bella only that drove out of house by scandalous conduct yes indeed although may not believe di be away in australia at time kept watch on lydia in interest dear housemaid heard from housemaid most dreadful thing why mr vrain remonstrated with lydia ordered count ferruci out of house lydia must not let go mr vrain left house where did go to miss tyler know nobody know be opinion said spinster with significant look that went to london to see about divorce be weak in head poor man suppose let thing go on when next heard of be corpse in geneva square did father tell wife that be in geneva square dearest di ca say believe have anything to do with after left house then if did not know whereabouts how must kill asked denzil pertinently brought to point must not evade bella declined to answer question tossed head bit lip with fine colour accusation of mr vrain have be made generally a lucian noted be unsupported by fact from legal point of view spiteful gossip of jealous woman be worth nothing in broad sense be certainly useful in showing discord have existed between vrain wife lucian saw that little good be to be gained from prejudiced witness so thanking miss tyler courteously for information arose to go wait for moment mr denzil said diana hurriedly want to ask something bella must mind leaving room oh dear burst out miss tyler annoyed at being excluded have said have to say anything can do dearest di to assist mr denzil in hanging that woman miss tyler interrupted lucian sternly must not speak so wildly for a yet there be nothing to prove mr vrain be guilty be guilty enough for mr denzil like men suppose take side because be supposed to be pretty pretty reflected bella scornfully never must see painted up minx dragged up from gutter wonder at taste mr denzil indeed do pretty idea what fool men be be glad never married one indeed with shrill laugh to point sour grape sentiment mark disdain for lucian fair bella took herself lean form out of room diana barrister be too deeply interested in business to take much notice of bella hysterical outburst looked at one gravely a departed well mr denzil said former repeating earlier question what be to be done now will see mr vrain not yet replied lucian quickly must secure proof of mr vrain being in yard before can get confession out of if will leave in hand miss vrain will call on mr bensusan who be mr bensusan be tenant of house in jersey street be possible that servant may know something about illegal use made of right of way yes think be next step to take what be to do in meantime nothing if be must not even see mr vrain will not seek voluntarily replied diana a have be to berwin manor be certain to hear that be in england may perhaps find out address call if doe may be sure will be most judicious in remark leave to discretion said denzil rising good bye miss vrain a soon a be in possession of new evidence will call again good bye mr denzil thank for kindness diana made remark with so kindly look so becoming blush so warm pressure of hand lucian felt quite overcome not trusting to speak walked swiftly out of room in spite of gravity of task in be concerned at moment thought more of diana look speech than of detective business have taken up for love sake on reaching room in geneva square made mighty effort to waken from day dream with stern determination addressed resolutely to work in hand in case bitter came before sweet by accomplishing desire of diana solving mystery of father death lucian hoped to win not only smile more substantial reward of heart hand before calling on mr bensusan barrister debated within a to whether must not be judicious to call in again assistance of link by telling of new evidence have be found place thereby in possession of new material to prosecute case link lately have taken so pessimistic view of matter lucian fancied must scoff at late discovery discourage in prosecuting what seemed to be fruitless quest denzil be anxious a diana knight to do a much of work a possible in order to gain reward of smile be true that have legal authority to make inquiry be possible that mr bensusan might refuse to answer question concerning own business unsanctioned by law on recalling description of miss greeb lucian fancied that mr bensusan a fat woman might only be good natured timid therefore dismissed idea of asking link to intervene resolved to risk personal interview with tenant of jersey street house must be time enough to invite link assistance thought when mr bensusan a yet unknown quantity in case proved obstinate in replying to question mr bensusan proved to be quite a stout a miss greeb have reported gigantically fat woman made up in breadth what lacked in length yet seemed to have activity about too for opened door personally to lucian who be quite amazed when beheld monstrous bulk blocking up doorway face be white round like pale moon have staring eye of china blue resembling vacant optic of wax doll on whole appeared to be timid lymphatic woman likely to answer question put to in sufficiently peremptory tone lucian foresaw that be not likely to have much trouble with mountain of flesh what might be pleased to want sir asked lucian in meekest of voice be about lodging yes answered barrister boldly for guessed that mr bensusan must scuttle back into house like rabbit to burrow did speak too plainly at outset be wish to inquire about friend of mine did lodge here sir yes mr wrent deary said fat woman with mild surprise mr wrent left shortly after christmas kind gentleman timid excuse interrupted lucian who wanted to get into house think must tell about friend in more convenient situation oh yes sir certainly sir wheezed mr bensusan rolling

mr bensusan be asleep to murder vrain between hour of eleven twelve on same night be plain enough lucian be puzzled by account of mr wrent who asked repeatedly who be grey haired white bearded man who have so often received lydia who have on christmas eve silenced rhoda regarding ferruci presence in yard by mean of cloak who must seem possessed key to whole mystery rhoda must tell no more that have stayed six month with mr bensusan have departed two day after murder whereby must seem that task having be completed have reason to remain longer in so dangerous neighbourhood yet four month have elapsed since departure denzil after reflection asked mr bensusan question two regarding interval have mr wrent returned here since departure demanded lawks sir wheezed mr bensusan shaking head have

with what seemed to be unnecessary violence lucian went off with cloak over arm somewhat discomposed by last piece of information gipsy repeated humph can good come out of nazareth trust girl much if knew why hate wrent 'd be much more satisfied with information who deuce be wrent lucian have occasion to ask question many time before found answer be not until afterwards at present moment dismissed from mind a unprofitable be too busy reflecting on evidence obtained in jersey street to waste time in conjecturing further event on returning to lodging sat down to consider what be best to be done after much reflection internal argument decided to call upon mr vrain by producing cloak force into confessing share of crime whether have be principal in deed accessory before fact lucian must not determine be confident that in one way be cognizant of truth although must probably conceal a revelation must likely be detrimental to own safety at first denzil intended to see diana before visiting mr vrain in order to relate have learned find out from if cloak really belonged to widow on second thought decided not to do so can tell nothing absolutely certain about matter said to a can not be sure of anything until force mr vrain to confess diana so called in discourse to diana will probably know nothing about ownership of cloak a seems new be probably purchased by lydia during absence of diana in australia have address of mr vrain diana gave will be best to call on by displaying cloak make acknowledge guilt with such evidence can not deny that visited wrent be in vicinity of house wherein husband be murdered on very night crime be committed also must state ferruci reason for hiding in back yard tell plainly who wrent be why helped pair of in devilish plan be doubtful if will speak altogether evidence have collected inculpates so strongly that will be quite sufficient ground upon to obtain warrant for arrest sooner than risk that expect will tell a much a can to exculpate be if be really innocent if be guilty lucian shrugged shoulder then can not guess what course will take mr vrain with father to protect have established in small luxurious house in mayfair be preparing to enjoy during coming season although husband have met with terrible death scarcely six month before have already cast off heavy mourning wore only such millinery indication of sorrow a suited with widowed existence ferruci be constant visitor at house although lydia be now free wealthy by mean seemed ready to marry italian perhaps thought with look rich might gain english title a more valuable than continental one in view be supported by father clyne have other desire than to see beloved lydia happy must willingly have sacrificed everything in power to gain end a did not like ferruci saw that lydia affection towards have cooled greatly did not encourage idea of match between however matter be yet in abeyance a lydia be too diplomatic to break off with so subtle man a count who might prove dangerous enemy be love turned to hate mr clyne be quite willing to remain on friendly term with man so long a lydia chose that such friendship must exist in short lydia ruled simple father with rod of iron coaxed ferruci more difficult man to deal with into good humour so managed of skilfully in way contrived to keep thing smooth pending plunge into london society for childish look lydia be uncommonly clever when lucian card be brought in mr vrain proved to be at home a good look have made deep impression on received at once be shown into luxuriously furnished drawing room without delay welcomed by pretty mr vrain who came forward with bright smile outstretched hand looking more charming than ever well do call real sweet of said gaily guess be about time showed up look well be fact what be wrong be worried little replied lucian confounded by coolness be use mr denzil must never be worried guess let anything put out not even husband death be rude said lydia sharply colour leaving cheek what do mean have come to be nasty came to return said denzil throwing cloak have carried on arm before widow echoed mr vrain looking at well what be old thing got to do with be left in jersey street did where be jersey street know well enough said lucian sternly be near place where husband be murdered mr vrain turned white do dare to say began when denzil cut short with hint at former discomposure stiletto mr vrain forget stiletto oh god cried lydia trembling violently what do know of stiletto chapter xvii denial what do know of stiletto repeated mr vrain anxiously have risen to foot with effort to be calm be holding on to near chair bright colour have faded to dull white hue eye have look of horror in depth transformed from childish beauty into much older more haggard woman than really be seemed a though lucian by necromantic spell have robbed of youth vitality careless happiness to extraordinary agitation be proof of guilt hardening heart so a not to spare one iota of penalty mercy did not deserve addressed sternly know that stiletto purchased in florence by late husband hung on library wall of berwin manor know that be gone yes yes said lydia moistening white dry lip be gone know who took person who killed husband feared a much muttered sitting down again do know name of person a well a do name be lydia vrain threw back on chair with look of profound astonishment on colourless face mr denzil stammered be be be jest will not find so mr vrain little woman clutched arm of chair leaned forward with face no longer pale red with rage indignation if be gentleman mr denzil guess wo keep hanging on like let get level do say killed mark yes do said lucian defiantly be sure of on what ground asked mr vrain holding temper back with visible effort made eye glitter breath short on ground that be killed with stiletto go slow how do know be killed with stiletto because ribbon attached to wall be found in geneva square house where husband be killed miss vrain recognised miss vrain diana be in england not only in england in london then why have be to see denzil did not like to answer question more so a lydia sudden divergence from point of discourse rather disconcerted be impossible to maintain dignity in making serious accusation when person against whom be made think so little of a to turn aside to discus point of etiquette in connection with woman seeing that accuser be silent confused lydia recovered tongue colour equability of temper be therefore with raillery that continued speech see how be said contemptuously diana have called into council in order to fix absurd charge on to afraid to come sends a braver person of partnership congratulate on errand mr denzil can laugh a much a like mr vrain matter be more serious than suppose oh be sure that loving stepdaughter will make a serious a possible always hated pardon mr vrain said lucian colouring with annoyance did not come here to hear speak ill of miss vrain know that sent here to speak ill of do ill to well so accuse of killing mark will be glad to hear evidence can bring forward if can make charge good must smile oh guess so denzil noticed that when mr vrain became excited usually spoke plain english without u s accent on growing calmer a be recollecting adopted yankee twang curious style of expression ejaculation led to suspect that fair lydia be not born daughter of great republic perhaps not even naturalised citizeness have assumed such nationality a one attractive to society in europe great britain wondered what past really be if father be doubtful adventurer diana believed to be if so might happen that lydia must extricate out of present unpleasant position by use of past experience to give chance of such dodging lucian rapidly detailed evidence against so that must be hard put to baffle in estimate quite underrated lydia nerve capability of fence let alone dexterity with produced satisfactory reply to of question will begin at beginning mr vrain said soberly say from time drove unfortunate husband out of own house now guess be fault explained lydia be in love with old man mark liked well enough for be real gentleman when make mischief diana who cocked nose at set out for australia got on surprisingly well count ferruci came over to stay a much at mark invitation a mine did pay too much attention to

lengthy toilette to natural anxiety to set right with lucian appeared shortly in ravishing costume fresh from paris perhaps by arraying so smartly wished to assure denzil more particularly that be lady of too much taste to buy rabbit skin cloak in bayswater perhaps be more probable be not averse to ensnaring so handsome young man into innocent flirtation suspicion entertained of lucian love for diana only made more eager to fascinate on own account conceit of hatred of stepdaughter desire to wring admiration out of man who did not wish to bestow be reason led mr vrain to be particularly agreeable to barrister when pair be ensconced in swift hansom rolling rapidly towards camden hill began at once to prosecute amiable design guess will not mind being best boy for day said with

lydia with weary sigh ai sure of anything save that head be buzzing like sawmill who be wrent anyhow know old man with white beard skull cap of black velvet ugh said mr vrain with shiver mark used to wear black skull cap thought of make freeze up sound like judge of court ordering man to be lynched well mr denzil seems to a 'd best hustle ercole if know who woman be must buy cloak for if did will know who wrent be guess can supply information where doe live number marquis street st james go look up while tell poppa what mean white be guess poppa wo let come near again pop be honest man though ai washington suppose find out that killed husband asked lucian rising then 'd best lynch right away replied lydia without hesitation draw line at murder barrister be somewhat disgusted to hear mr vrain so coolly devote whilom admirer to shameful death however knew that heart be hard nature selfish so there be little use in showing outward displeasure at want of charity have cleared from suspicion evidently cared not who suffered so long a be safe well spoken of moreover lucian have learned all wished about movement on night of crime taking hasty leave went off to marquis street for purpose of bringing ferruci to book for share in terrible business however count proved to be from home must not be back so servant said until late night denzil therefore left message that must call at noon next day drove from st james to kensington where visited diana here detailed what have learned done from time have visited mr bensusan up to interview with lydia also displayed cloak narrated how mr vrain have cleared herself of purchase to diana listened with greatest interest when lucian ended looked at for moment in silence in fact diana with wit common sense did not know how to regard present position of affair well miss vrain said lucian seeing that did not speak what do think of mr vrain appears to be innocent said diana in low voice assuredly be evidence of pegall family given in innocence prof that must not have be in geneva square in jersey street on christmas eve then come back to original belief mr denzil lydia did not commit crime herself employed ferruci to do so no replied denzil decidedly whether italian be guilty not mr vrain know nothing about if be cognisant of guilt must not have risked going with to baxter co letting discover ferruci have bought cloak must so lightly surrender possible accomplice a have done ferruci can be said of mr vrain conduct admit that be far from perfect yet must say that appears by strongest evidence to be totally innocent ignorant know more about matter than father doe well said diana unwilling to grant stepmother too much grace must give benefit of doubt what about ferruci so far a can see ferruci be guilty replied lucian to clear will have to give same proof a mr vrain firstly will have to show that be not in jersey street on christmas eve secondly will have to prove that did not buy cloak in face of servant evidence statement of shopwoman will find difficult to clear yet added lucian remembering failure with lydia be always possible that may do so seems to mr denzil that only chance of getting at truth be to see italian think so will see to morrow will take mr link with miss vrain a have found out so much without link may a well proceed in matter until professional service be required to arrest count ferruci by way have never seen that gentleman can describe appearance to oh a far a look go there be fault to be found with answered diana be typical italian tall slender olive complexioned speaks english very well indeed appears to be possessed of considerable education certainly to look at to speak with must not think be villain likely to murder defenceless old man if did not kill poor father know not who did will call on to morrow at noon said lucian later on will come here to tell have passed between remark brought business between to close lucian must fain have lingered to engage diana in lighter conversation miss vrain however be too much disturbed by news have brought to indulge in frivolous talk mind busied with recollection of deceased father anxiously seeking mean whereby to avenge death be ill attuned to encourage at moment aspiration knew lucian entertained barrister therefore sighed hinted in vain dulcinea must have none of courting be compelled to retire a disconsolate lover a must be seen to slightly alter saying of shakespeare course of true love never doe run smooth there be surely unusual number of obstacle in current of denzil desire a consoled with reflecting that greater prize harder be to win so behooved to do devoir like true knight next day at noon lucian armed for encounter with evidence of rhoda of cloak presented at room count ferruci temporarily inhabited in marquis street not only found italian ready to receive in full possession of adventure of cloak a admitted have learned from lydia previous evening also count ferruci be extremely indignant informed lucian that be easily able to clear of suspicion while raged on in fiery italian way denzil who saw chance of staying torrent of word examined at leisure ercole ferruci be a diana have said singularly handsome man of thirty five be dark slender tall with dark flashing eye heavy black moustache alert military look about showed that have served in army above description savour trifle of impossible hero of young lady dream a matter of fact ferruci be not unlike ideal personage have look grace woman admire seemed honest fiery enough in manly way last person a lucian thought to gain aim by underhand way to kill helpless old man lucian legally experienced in human frailty be not to be put off with voluble conversation outward grace wished for proof of innocence tried to obtain a soon a ferruci drew breath in fiery harangue if be innocent count said lucian in reply to fluent incorrect english of italian appearance be against however can prove innocent if will sir cried ferruci be not word good not good enough for english court replied lucian coldly say be not in jersey street on christmas eve who can prove that friend dear friend dr jorce of hampstead sir be with oh yes sir will tell so very good hope evidence will clear replied more phlegmatic englishman cloak never bought cloak saw not before then come with to shop in bayswater hear what girl who sold say will come at once cried ferruci hastily catching up cane come then friend come what doe woman say that sold cloak to tall man to dark man with moustache one who told be italian bah retorted count a hailed hansom be that can say why italian be supposed to be tall dark wear moustache common people in england never fancy one of can be fair be not fair replied lucian drily look correspond to description true oh yes sir description might describe dozen of countryman mr denzil added count laughing go round about saying to common people be italian be not custom to explain lucian shrugged shoulder said more until entered shop in bayswater a knew from previous visit where saleswoman be located led count rapidly to place girl be there a brisk businesslike a ever looked up a approached came forward to serve with swift glance at be sorry to trouble again said lucian ceremoniously told yesterday that sold blue cloak lined with rabbit skin to italian gentleman be gentleman interrupted ferruci did buy cloak replied shopwoman after sharp glance be not gentleman who bought cloak chapter xx new development see mr denzil said ferruci turning triumphantly to lucian did not buy cloak be not italian lady speaks of lucian be extremely astonished at unexpected testimony in favour of count questioned shopwoman sharply be certain of what say asked looking at intently yes be sir replied girl stiffly a though did not like word doubted gentleman who bought cloak be not so tall a one did speak english well have great difficulty in learning what wanted said that be dark with moustache said sir be not gentleman must swear to said lucian more chagrined than liked to show to victorious ferruci if be necessary must sir said shopwoman with greatest confidence after so direct reply such certain evidence denzil have nothing to do retire from awkward position a gracefully a must now sir said ferruci who have followed out of shop come with please where to asked lucian gloomily to friend to room have shown did not buy cloak speak of now must find friend dr jorce to tell be not at jersey street when say be dr jorce at room asked to call about time said ferruci glancing at watch when mr vrain speak to of what say wish to defend so write last night to friend to talk with day get telegram saying must come at two hour lucian glanced in turn at watch half past one said beckoning to cab very good count will just have time to get back to place what think now said ferruci with malicious twinkle in eye know what to think replied lucian dismally save that be strange coincidence that italian must have bought cloak count shrugged shoulder a got into hansom did not speak until be well on way back to marquis street then looked thoughtfully at companion believe coincidence said abruptly in design what do mean count quite follow one who know love mr vrain wish to injure said italian rapidly so make theirself like to buy that cloak ah see must not make a tall a oh yes sir be sure be so do know one who must disguise so a to implicate in murder ferruci shook head can not think of one man not one do know man called wrent asked lucian abruptly mr denzil said ferruci at once why do ask well thought might be man to disguise added lucian remembering rhoda account of wrent white hair beard can not be must not sacrifice beard to carry out plan in fact must not without attracting rhoda attention rhoda wrent what strange name talk of cried ferruci vivaciously stranger than of friend jorce ferruci laughed oh be altogether most strange see be a italian said dr jorce who be waiting for in count room proved to be small dried up atom of man who looked a though colour have be bleached out of at first sight be more like monkey than man owing to slight queer figure agile movement closer examination revealed that have clever face pair of most remarkable eye be of steel grey hue with extraordinary intensity of gaze when fixed on lucian at moment of introduction young barrister felt a though be being mesmerised for rest jorce be dressed sombrely in black cloth be extremely voluble vivacious impressed lucian with idea that be le fellow mortal than changeling from fairyland quite exceptional man be dr jorce a italian said most strange good friend said ferruci laying stern hand on shoulder of oddity gentleman wish to decide what do say bet bet cried little doctor in deep bass voice with indignation do understand count that have brought way from place in hampstead to decide bet ah sir be bet most important said ferruci with smile mr denzil declares that saw in pim pim what in pimlico said lucian seeing that ferruci must not pronounce word say that count be in pimlico on christmas eve be wrong sir said jorce with wave of skinny hand friend count ferruci be in house at hampstead on evening be remarked lucian astonished at confident assertion at what time did leave did not leave till next morning friend count remained under roof night left at twelve o'clock on christmas morning so see said ferruci airily to lucian must not have done what think a be done by what said between eleven twelve on night be count with at ten o'clock on evening asked denzil certainly be so have lost bet mr denzil sorry to bring such bad fortune truth be truth know must repeat statement if wished why not call on at time haven hampstead will always find ah think will be necessary for mr denzil to call on sir interposed count rapidly can always come to well mr denzil be satisfied be replied lucian have lost bet count apologise good day dr jorce thank count ferruci wish good bye not even au revoir said ferruci mockingly that depends upon future replied lucian coolly forthwith went away in low spirit at downfall of hope far from revealing mystery of vrain death late attempt to solve have resulted in utter failure lydia have cleared ferruci have proved innocent lucian must not make up mind what be now to be done in dilemma sought out diana a knowing from experience where man logic end woman instinct begin thought might suggest way out of difficulty on arriving at royal john hotel found that diana be waiting for with great impatience hardly giving time to greet asked how have fared in interview with count ferruci have that man be arrested mr denzil miss vrain regret to say that have not be arrested to speak plainly have so far a can see proved innocent innocent evidence against be utterly useless brought face to face with woman who sold cloak denies that ferruci bought said buyer be italian did dark with moustache same did not recognise count say buyer be not so tall spoke worse english ferruci must make english bad if liked probably must not make stature shorter miss vrain be afraid that italian friend in spite of evidence against did not buy cloak that resembles purchaser in look nationality be coincidence what seeing lucian hesitated design finished barrister indeed count be of opinion belief that one who wished to get into trouble personated have suspicion a to whom person may be say not believe for if did suspect particular individual certainly must gain nothing by concealment of fact h be said diana thoughtfully so that denial of saleswoman disposes of cloak evidence what about count presence in jersey street on christmas eve be not there rhoda servant saw in house in back yard saw dark man with moustache must not say that be foreigner doe not know ferruci remember man saw must have be same a purchaser of cloak where doe ferruci say be at hampstead visiting friend oh doe friend say declares that count be with on christmas eve stayed night be very convenient evidence for count mr denzil who be accommodating friend doctor called jorce can word be trusted so far a can judge from look short acquaintance must say so be half past eight when servant saw dark man run out of yard yes at half past eight ferruci be at hampstead in house of dr jorce not that know of said lucian remembering that have asked jorce question rather generally than particularly doctor declared that ferruci be with at ten o'clock on evening did not leave until next morning so a father be killed between eleven twelve ferruci must be innocent must seem so if doctor be to be believed muttered diana reflectively judging by what have told there be nothing to show that ferruci be not in pimlico at eight thirty be not man whom servant saw well certainly must get from pimlico to hampstead in hour half however main point about evidence be that ferruci lydia vrain killed father seems clear still still know about oh be sure of must have be ferruci who be in pimlico on night if so know who wrent be why stayed in jersey street perhaps although denies ever hearing name of wrent must not be surprised if man who must solve mystery be who who doctor jorce feel sure of chapter xxi two month pas unwilling to give up prosecuting vrain case while slightest hope remained of solving mystery lucian sought out link detective detailed evidence have collected since constituted authority have abandoned matter although mr vrain ferruci have exculpated entirely denzil thought that link with professional distrust trained sense of ferreting out secret might discern better than whether such exculpation be warranted by circumstance link heard that denzil have to tell with outward indifference inward surprise for while unwilling through jealousy of amateur to flatter barrister by visible compliment yet silently admitted that denzil have made discovery profited by with much acuteness what annoyed however be that young man have pushed inquiry to uttermost limit that there be chance of glory accruing to by prosecuting further still on possibility that something might come of went over ground already traversed by amateur detective must have told of intention when miss vrain spoke to in first instance said to lucian by way of rebuke a be have confused clue so much that know one to take seems to have pursued clue until fate circumstance clipped short retorted lucian nettled by injustice mr vrain have defended successfully much in same way a count ferruci have done only chance of getting at truth lie in discovering wrent unless rhoda help there see how can trace man be of different opinion said link lying freely to conceal doubt of success in matter a have failed through lack of experience will attempt to unravel skein attempted to do so before gave up because of tangle said lucian with quiet irony unless discover more than have done will dismiss matter again a impossible so far a can see mystery of vrain death be more of mystery than ever will never be solved will make one last attempt to unriddle however answered link with confidence be far from feeling of course not being one of impossible detective of fiction may fail be certain to fail said lucian decisively with disheartening prophecy left link to task of apparently spinning rope of sand whether be that link be so doubtful of result a to extend little energy in search whether really found task impossible of accomplishment be difficult to say assuredly failed a completely a lucian predicted with outward zeal set to work interviewed lydia italian to make certain that defence be genuine examined pegall family who be dreadfully alarmed by respectability being intruded upon by common detective obtained fresh denial from baxter co saleswoman that ferruci be purchaser of cloak also cross questioned mr bensusan sharp handmaid in most exhaustive manner did best to trace out mysterious wrent who have so much to do with matter even called on dr jorce at hampstead to satisfy a to actual time of ferruci arrival in neighbourhood on christmas eve here received check for jorce have gone abroad on annual holiday be not expected back for month in fact link did that man must do to arrive at truth only to find at end of labour in same position a lucian have be disgusted at result threw up brief called upon diana denzil with whom have previously made appointment to notify of inability to bring matter to satisfactory conclusion there be not slightest chance of finding assassin of mr vrain said link after have set forth at length late failure more go into matter more see yet be so confident of doing more than said lucian quietly link turned sulkily after fashion of bad loser did best retorted gloomily man can do more crime be beyond power of law to punish for sheer lack of proof be one of so far a can see unknown assassin will be punished on judgment day not before then think that signor ferruci be guilty said diana no have have nothing to do with matter have mr vrain brought about death in way can not say who killed father not for certain suspect wrent then why not find wrent asked diana bluntly have hidden trail too well began link if did find finished denzil coolly might prove guiltless after fashion of mr vrain ferruci might sir there be knowing since think have done so little mr denzil let ask who be suspect dr jorce of hampstead pooh pooh cried link with contempt did kill man how must seeing be at hampstead on christmas eve midnight a found out from servant suspect of actually striking blow replied lucian believe know who did not dr jorce have too responsible position to mix up in crime from gain benefit why what position doe hold be owner of private lunatic asylum be likely that man like must commit murder again deny that did commit crime be certain from very fact of friendship with ferruci that know more than chooses to tell why must italian be intimate with owner of private asylum with man so much beneath in rank know sir if suspect dr jorce have better see when come back from holiday in month where be now in italy count have gone with diana lucian looked at one former spoke be strange said agree with mr denzil be peculiar to say least of that italian noble must make bosom friend of man so far inferior to in position think so mr link madam said link gravely think nothing about save that will never find out truth have tried best failed be confident enough in own power to say that where have failed one else will succeed miss vrain mr denzil wish good day with bragging speech revealed hurt vanity of man mr link took departure lucian held peace for in face of desertion of powerful ally did not know what to say diana walked to sitting room window watched link disappear into crowd of passer by at heaved sigh for with thought went chance of learning truth since if experienced person in such matter turned back from quest there must assuredly be help in one not professional with le trained ability then turned to lucian there be nothing more to be done suppose said sighing again be afraid not replied lucian dismally for be quite of opinion regarding desertion of detective then must leave unknown assassin to punishment of god said diana quietly can only thank for have done for mr denzil say hesitated blushed then added with emphasis say au revoir ah ejaculated denzil with indrawn breath of relief be glad did not say good bye wish to say denzil have not so many friend in world can afford to lose so good one a be content said lucian softly that must think of a friend for present meaning be so unmistakable that diana still blushing somewhat confused hastened to prevent saying more at so awkward moment then a friend hope will come see at berwin manor will be delighted when do go down within fortnight must remain that time in town to see lawyer about estate left by poor father see mr vrain replied diana coldly now that father be dead mr vrain be nothing to indirectly look upon a cause of death for if have not driven of out of own home father might have be alive still will not call on mr vrain think will dare to call on be not so sure of rejoined lucian who be well acquainted with length to mr vrain audacity must carry let dismiss with other trouble may call on again before leave town occasionally replied diana smiling blushing will come down to berwin manor when send invitation must think so said denzil in high glee a rose to depart now will say good bye said miss vrain holding out hand will use own form of farewell au revoir then lucian went out from presence of beloved exulting that have proved so kind a not to dismiss when no longer required service in woman must not have minded such ingratitude have diana banished thus must have be miserable beyond word also a lucian joyfully reflected invitation to berwin manor showed that far from wishing to lose sight of desired to draw into yet closer intimacy there must be nothing good resulting from invitation acceptance already denzil looked forward to bright summer day in green leafy country when must ask goddess among woman to be wife if encouragement look blush went for anything hardly doubted happy result in meantime while lucian dreamed dream diana also dreaming in own way remained in town attended to business saw lawyer have affair looked into so that when went to bath be legally installed a mistress of berwin manor surrounding acre a lucian hinted lydia did indeed try to see stepdaughter called twice be refused admission into diana presence wrote three time received reply to letter so consequence be that finding diana declined to have anything to do with in way whatsoever became very bitter feeling expressed to lucian whom one day met in piccadilly a if have done anything finished lydia after recital of grievance call real mean think so mr denzil if ask mr vrain said lucian stiffly think miss vrain be better apart of course defend guess ca blame a know what be driving at what about signor ferruci asked denzil parrying oh be good friend still nothing more a proved that did not kill mark have reason to give walking ticket added mr vrain drily guess will be married to diana before hitch up 'longside ercole how do know will marry miss vrain asked lucian flushing if saw face in glass must ask guess tomato ai in for redness wo dance at wedding wo break heart with gay nod mr lydia vrain tripped away evidently quite forgetful of late tragedy in life chapter xxii at berwin manor heritage of diana lay mile from bath in pleasant wooded valley through meandered placid slow flowing stream on side of water stretched broad meadow land flat fertile a well might be seeing be of rich black loam well drained withal to right meadow be bounded by forest land tree of grew thickly up over ridge on space where wood met field be placed manor quaint square building of georgian architecture two century old against green of tree warm wall of red brick sloping roof of bluish slate made pleasant spot of colour there stretched terrace before beneath terrace flower garden orchard below meadow land white with snow in winter black in spring with ridgy furrow golden with grain in hot day of summer altogether lovely peaceful spot where man must pas pleasant day in rural quiet hermitage of rest for life worn heart weary here towards end of summer came lucian to rest brain after turmoil of london to court mistress under most favourable circumstance diana have established in ancestral home with superannuated governess a chaperon for without guardianship must hardly have invited barrister to visit miss priscilla barbar be placid silver haired old dame who having taught diana for many year have returned now that american mr vrain have departed to spend rest of day under roof of dear pupil took great fancy to lucian be just a well seeing what be object of visit complacently watched growing attachment between handsome young couple who seemed so suited to one duty a chaperon be nominal for when not pottering about garden be knitting in snug corner when knitting failed to interest slumbered quietly in defiance of etiquette must have compelled to make third in conversation of young friend a for lucian charming hostess found that have so many taste in common enjoyed other society so much that be hardly ever apart diana saw with keen eye of woman lucian be in love with let be seen in marvellously short space of time without much difficulty that be in love with even after lucian have be at manor fortnight daily in society of diana spoke word of love seeing how beautiful be how dowered with land rent horse began to ask whether be not rather presumption on part to ask to share life have only three hundred year six pound week profession in a yet have not succeeded so must offer very little in exchange for beauty wealth position poor lover became quite pale with fruitless longing spirit fell so low that good miss priscilla one day drew aside to ask about health for said if be ill in body mr denzil know of remedy old woman medicine will call doubt with blessing of god may do good thank miss barbar be not ill in body worse luck lucian sighed why worse luck mr denzil said old lady severely be ungrateful speech to providence must rather be ill in body than ill in mind explained denzil blushing for in way be younger than year be ill in mind asked miss priscilla with twinkle in eye ala yes can cure for cure will hand over to diana miss priscilla lucian coloured again time with vexation oh mr denzil laughed governess because be old must not imagine that be blind see that love diana better than life cried devoted lover with much fervour of course be usual romantic answer to make well why do not tell diana so with pretty addition fancy suggests might not listen to said doubting lover dolefully very true replied consoler on other hand might besides mr denzil however much world may have altered since youth have yet to learn that be lady part to propose to gentleman miss barbar be poor what of diana be rich know for very reason hesitate to ask because be afraid of being called fortune hunter suppose said old lady drily that show lack of moral courage be not worthy of mr denzil take old woman advice young man put fortune to test remember montrose advice in song approve of marrying diana mean miss vrain from what have seen of from what diana have told about must wish better husband poor girl after tragical death of father wretched life with american woman deserves happy future do think do really think that that must be happy with with stammered lucian hardly daring to believe miss priscilla whose acquaintance with seemed too recent to warrant such trust wise old woman laughed nodded ask dear said patting hand will be able to answer question better than besides girl like to say 'yea ' seemed to be good advice certainly none must have be more grateful to timid lover very night made up mind to risk fortune by speaking to diana be easy matter for young man to bring to do so for cool bold fluent a be on ordinary occasion fever of love rendered shy nervous look of diana acted on spirit a weather doe on barometer smile made jocund hilarious frown abashed almost to gloom in april weather of presence be a variable a weather cock be therefore little to be wondered at one ordinarily daring must tremble to ask question might be answered in negative true miss barbar partisanship heartened trifle still feared for result cupid a well a conscience make coward of lucian be doubting lover towards end of stay miss priscilla a usual fell asleep one evening after dinner diana feeling house too warm stepped out into garden followed by lucian sun have just set behind undulating hill clear sky to zenith be of pale rose colour striped towards western horizon with line of golden cloud in east cold blue prevailed here there star sparkled in arch of sky garden be filled with floating shadow seemed to glide into from dark recess of near wood in copse distance away nightingale be singing to mate filling silence with melody note fluted sweetly through still air mingling with sigh of rising wind musical splashing of fountain shot up pillar of silvery water to great height in descending sprinkled near flower bed with cold spray be inexpressibly beautiful to eye soothing to ear scene hour for love might have be garden of capulets who moved in immortal lover a yet uncursed by fate only three more day sighed lucian a walked slowly down path beside diana then that noisy london again perhaps be a well said diana in practical way must rust here be there need for to go back so soon must for own peace of mind diana started blushed at meaning of tone word then recovered serenity sat down on old stone seat near stood weather beaten statue of venus seeing that kept silent in spite of broad hint lucian to bring matter to crisis resolved to approach subject in mythological way through image of goddess be sorry be not greek miss vrain said abruptly why asked diana secretly astonished by irrelevancy of remark lucian plucked red rose from bush grew near statue placed on pedestal because must lay offering at foot of goddess touch knee to demand boon what boon must ask said diana in low voice must beseech that in return for rose of flower must give rose of womanhood modest request do think must be granted do asked lucian picking up rose again how can reply to parable read dark saying said diana half in earnest half in mirth can speak plainer if permit if if like young man laid rose on diana lap then in return for rose give mr denzil cried diana starting up whereby flower fell to ground surprise indeed surprise said lucian sadly must dare to raise eye to be doubt surprising see at exclaimed diana coldly like to be woo 'd like woman not honoured like goddess be woman goddess be not angry why must be angry because love can not be angry with with will say compliment oh diana wait wait cried miss vrain waving back too eager lover can not love have known only month two love can be born in hour cried lucian eagerly loved on first day saw love now will love ever will truly love ever lucian oh darling can doubt looked at hopefully repeated in pretty mocking tone with laugh bent picked up flower take rose give cried enraptured lover next moment be clasping to breast oh diana dearest will really be wife yes said softly kissed for few moment emotion of overcame too much to permit further speech then diana sat down made lucian sit beside lucian said in firm voice love will be wife when find out who killed poor father be impossible cried in dismay must prosecute search have right to be happy while wretch who killed be still at large have failed hitherto may succeed yet when succeed will marry darling cried lucian in ecstasy then in more subdued tone will do can to find out truth after from what point can begin afresh from point of mr vrain said diana unexpectedly mr vrain cried startled lucian do still suspect yes do have cleared on most undeniable evidence not in eye said diana obstinately if mr vrain be innocent how did find out that unknown man murdered in geneva square be father by assumption of name of berwin be mentioned in advertisement also from description of body particularly by mention of cicatrice on right cheek of loss of little finger of left hand diana started never heard that about little finger said hurriedly be sure yes saw when knew father a berwin that have lost that little finger then lucian did not see father what cried denzil hardly able to credit word father never lost finger cried diana starting to foot ah lucian now begin to see light that man who called berwin who be murdered be not father believe on soul believe that father mark vrain be alive chapter xxiii startling theory when diana declared that father yet lived lucian drew back from in amazement for of impossible thing said of impossible case saying of hers be strangest most incredible hitherto not suspicion have entered mind that man so mysteriously slain in geneva square be mark vrain for moment thought that diana be distraught to deny so positive fact be impossible said shaking head quite impossible mr vrain identified corpse so did other people who knew father well a to mr vrain said diana contemptuously quite believe must lie to gain own end may be that man who be murdered be like father in face have mark on cheek interrupted lucian impatient of obstinate belief in criminality of lydia know that mark well replied miss vrain father received in duel fought in youth when be student in german university missing finger shook head might have lost finger while be in australia suggested barrister might rejoined diana doubtfully be unlikely a to other people identifying body doubt did so by looking at face scar still believe murdered man be father if not why must mr vrain identify body a of husband why because wanted to get assurance money may have be misled by resemblance of dead man to father who provided that resemblance dear lucian must not be at surprised to learn that there be conspiracy a well a murder in matter father left home lydia must not find quite believe that a can not prove death find impossible to obtain assurance money so what doe do can not guess said lucian anxious to hear diana theory why find man who resembles father set to play part of recluse in geneva square selects man in ill health given to drink that may die sooner by being buried a mark vrain give money want when told of man berwin coughing drinking thought strange a father have consumptive disease when left never during life be given to over indulgence in drink now see truth dead man be lydia puppet even granting that be so doubt diana why must man be murdered why cried diana fiercely because be not dying quickly enough for woman purpose did not kill if alibi be to be credited employed ferruci to murder forget signor ferruci also proved alibi very doubtful one said miss vrain scornfully did not ask that dr jorce question must have done go up to london now lucian see at hampstead find out if ferruci be at house at eight o'clock on christmas eve then will believe guiltless till then hold creature tool of lydia jorce declares that ferruci be with at house when murder be committed can believe that ferruci may have made worth while of doctor to lie even granting that much presence of ferruci at jersey street house show that knew what be going to take place on night perhaps arranged with man to do deed way look at be implicated tell be impossible diana said lucian finding vain to combat persistent belief plotting of crime be such a be found in novel not in real life in real life cried diana taking word out of mouth more incredible thing take place than can be conceived by most fantastic imagination of author look at talk of ours began with word of love marriage speech end with discussion of murder say lucian that if love must have marry must find out truth of matter learn if dead man be father for from what have told of lost finger believe that be hunt down assassin discover if be whom believe to be ferruci learn if can what lydia have to do with evil matter do be yours refuse will not marry set hard task said lucian with sigh hardly know how to set about be guided by replied diana go up to london put advertisement in paper offering reward for discovery of father be of medium height with grey hair have clean shaven face with scar on describe dead man diana have not lost finger continued diana a though have not heard if father for fear of lydia be in hiding will come to in answer to advertisement must have seen report of death by violence in paper if indeed be alive urged lucian at wit end father be weak in head perhaps be afraid to come out in midst of such trouble if put in advertisement that daughter be in england will come to for with know be safe also call on dr jorce find out truth about signor ferruci then then when have done two thing will see what will come of promise to do what ask promise said lucian taking hand send on wild goose chase may be lucian heart presentiment instinct like to call tell otherwise now let go inside will tell miss barbar of engagement asked denzil timidly will tell one of until learn truth of conspiracy when do lucian will find that father be not dead be alive will be at wedding doubt doubt be sure of answered diana slipping hand within arm of lover walked with up to house be strangest of wooing miss barbar with true woman interest in love affair be inclined to congratulate when entered deeming a chance have be so propitious that lucian have proposed diana looked so stern lucian so gloomy that held peace later on when curiosity got better of desire not to offend pupil asked if denzil have spoken yes replied diana have spoken have refused cried old lady in dismay for did not relish idea lucian must have lost by counsel have not refused then have said 'yes dear have said sufficient replied diana cautiously please question further miss barbar lucian understand one very well call by christian name thought wise old dame be well will not speak of happiness be ill in various crafty way miss barbar tried to learn how matter actually stood between pair if be skilful in asking question diana be equally skilful in baffling miss barbar learned nothing more than pupil chose to tell be little enough to perplex still further lucian departed for london next day with rather disconsolate look on handsome face gave adviser very satisfactory explanation at parting so miss barbar be forced to remain in ignorance of success failure of counsel must by mean discover if marriage be so anxious to bring about be likely to take place so ended denzil visit to berwin manor in meantime lucian went back to london with heavy heart for did not see how be to set about task imposed on by diana at first thought must be best to advertise a advised considered must do no good a if vrain supposing to be alive in hiding must not come out at false report of murder certainly must not appear in answer to advertisement might be snare then lucian wondered if must be possible to have grave opened second time diana might truly see if corpse be that of father of man also be impossible to speak plainly useless for by time body must not be recognisable therefore must be of little use to exhume poor dead man whomsoever might be for second time finally lucian judged must be wisest of to call on dr jorce find out why be friendly with ferruci how much knew of italian doings while barrister be making up mind to course be surprised to receive visit from le person than mr jabez clyne father of lydia little man usually so bright merry now looked worried ill at ease lucian so much a have seen of have always liked better than lydia be sorry to see so downcast when learned reason be better pleased clyne told to in roundabout way do know anything against signor ferruci asked when first greeting be over very little that bad replied denzil shortly do refer to horrible death of son in law yes do mr clyne believe ferruci have hand in if bring here will tell so can prove asked clyne eagerly a yet ferruci have proved that be not in geneva square on night of crime rather added lucian correcting at hour when murder be committed clyne face fell wish must discover if be guilty not said be anxious to know truth why asked lucian bluntly because if be guilty want daughter to marry murderer what be mr vrain going to marry yes said little man disconsolately wish be so do for own sake thought did not like said a much to ca make out mr denzil grew tired of for time now have taken up with again nothing can say do will stop marriage love lydia beyond word a be only child want to see married to man of doubtful reputation like ferruci so thought 'd call see if must help ca replied lucian a yet have found out nothing likely to implicate ferruci in crime may said clyne hopefully lucian shrugged shoulder if do will know at once said chapter xxiv lucian be surprised although denzil received mr clyne with courtesy promised to aid if must in breaking off marriage with ferruci by revealing true character to mr vrain by mean made confidant of little man entrusted with secret of plan clyne a well knew be dominated in way by astute daughter did learn lucian intention be quite capable through sheer weakness of character of revealing same to lydia who in turn since be bent upon marrying ferruci might retail to italian so put on guard denzil therefore rid of american by promising to tell on future occasion that knew about ferruci satisfied with clyne departed in more cheerful mood apparently hoped for best after departure lucian again began to consider idea of calling on jorce regarding alibi of ferruci on further reflection judged that before paying visit to hampstead might be judicious to see rhoda again refresh memory in connection with event of christmas eve with idea put on hat shortly after departure of clyne walked round to jersey street on ringing bell door be opened by rhoda in person looking sharper more cunning than ever informed that must not see mr bensusan a good lady be in bed with cold want to see mistress girl said lucian quickly to stop rhoda from shutting door in face seemed disposed to do desire to speak with about that there murder asked rhoda sharply then in reply to nod of lucian continued told knew about when called before know nothing more can tell name of dark man saw in yard ca know nothing about did ever hear mr wrent mention name sir called went saw in back yard at never spoke to never spoke to must swear to man if saw yes must have got with asked rhoda eagerly not at present answered lucian rather surprised by vindictive expression on girl face later on may call upon to identify do know who be asked servant quickly think so did kill that man possibly said denzil wondering at very pointed question why do ask have reason sir where be cloak will return later on will probably be used a evidence rhoda started where demanded with frown at trial do think will hang person who killed mr vrain if police catch guilt be proved be sure will hang girl eye flashed with wicked light clasped unclasped hand with quick nervous movement hope will said in low rapid voice hope will what cried lucian with step forward do know assassin cried rhoda with much vehemence swear think murderer ought to be hanged know know well know something see to morrow night will hear hear what truth said strange girl shut door before lucian must say word barrister quite dumbfounded remained on step looking at closed door so important be rhoda word that be on point of ringing again to interview once more force to speak when reflected that mr bensusan be in bed that rhoda alone must reopen door from late action be pretty evident must not do decided to retire for present be little use to call in police create trouble by forcing way into house a might induce rhoda to run away before giving evidence so lucian departed with intention of keeping next night appointment hearing what rhoda have to say truth repeated a walked along street evidently know who killed man if so why did not speak before why be so vindictive heaven if diana belief must be true one father not dead conspiracy murder gypsy girl that subtle italian mysterious wrent head be in whirl can not understand what mean to morrow when rhoda speaks may can trust doubt still there be nothing else for must trust talking to in incoherent way lucian reached room tried to quiet excitement of brain caused by strange word of rhoda be yet early in afternoon so took up book threw on sofa to read for hour found quite impossible to fix attention on page case in be concerned be far more exciting than invention of brain after vain attempt to banish from mind jumped up threw book aside although did not know lucian be suffering from sharp attack of detective fever only mean of curing such disease be to learn secret haunt imagination rhoda a stated rather ambiguously must be confessed must reveal especial secret touching murder of vrain for hidden reason chose to delay confession for twenty four hour lucian on fire with curiosity found unable to bear suspense so to distract mind learn if possible true relationship existing between ferruci jorce set out for hampstead to interview doctor haven a jorce with humour termed private asylum be red brick house large handsome commodious built in wooded secluded part of hampstead be surrounded by high brick wall over tree of park must be seen possessed pair of elaborate iron gate opening on to quiet country lane externally looked merely estate of gentleman ground be large well laid out in flower garden orchard a be dr jorce system to allow least crazy patient a much liberty a possible roamed at will round ground giving place cheerful populated look more violent inmate be of course secluded be well kindly treated by doctor indeed jorce be very humane man have theory that more cure of unhappy being under charge must be effected by kindness than by severity asylum be more like private hotel with paying guest than establishment for retention of insane even to outside observer eccentricity of doctor family a loved to call be not more marked than many of oddity possessed by people at large indeed jorce be in habit of saying that there be more mad people in world than be kept under lock key in be doubtless right however kindly judicious little man be like father to under charge very popular with anything more unlike popular conception of asylum than establishment at hampstead can scarcely be imagined when lucian arrived at haven found that jorce have long since returned from holiday be day at home so on sending in card be at once admitted into presence of local potentate jorce looking smaller more like fairy changeling than ever be evidently pleased to see lucian look on dry yellow face indicated that be somewhat puzzled to account for visit however preliminary greeting having passed lucian did not leave long in doubt dr jorce said boldly without preamble have called to see about alibi of signor ferruci alibi be nasty word mr denzil said jorce looking sharply at visitor perhaps be only word can be used with propriety thought be called on to decide bet oh be count ferruci clever way of putting responded lucian with sneer did not wish to know too much about business h be perhaps know more than think mr denzil what do mean sir cried lucian sharply softly mr denzil softly rejoined doctor waving hand will explain everything to satisfaction do know why went to italy more than know why went with signor ferruci replied lucian recalling link communication ah said jorce placidly have be making inquiry see be wrong in one particular did not go to italy with ferruci left in paris went on to florence to find out true character of man why did wish to do doctor because have business with mutual friend count be not altogether pleased with way in be conducted also last interview with about bet made suspicious of man over in florence learned sufficient about count to assure that be bad man with whom be a well to have a little to do a possible intended to return at once with information call on mr denzil unfortunately fell ill of attack of typhoid fever in florence have to stay there two month be sorry said lucian noting that doctor did look ill why did not send on information to be necessary to see personally mr denzil arrived back few day ago intended writing to when recovered from fatigue of journey however arrival save trouble now can tell about ferruci if like then tell doctor if spoke truly about alibi yes did count ferruci be with night stayed here until next morning what time did arrive about ten o'clock to be precise said jorce about ten thirty ah cried lucian exultantly then ferruci must have be man in back yard what do mean by asked jorce in puzzled tone why count ferruci have have to do with crime committed month ago in pimlico man called mark vrain be murdered a may have seen in paper doctor believe ferruci murdered if remember rightly said jorce with calmness man in question be murdered shortly before midnight on christmas eve if be so ferruci must not have killed because a said before be here at half past ten on night say actually killed man explained lucian eagerly certainly employed one to strike blow else what be doing in jersey street yard on night can say what like dr jorce man be guilty of mark vrain death replied jorce coolly be not for simple reason that vrain be not dead not dead repeated lucian recalling diana belief for last few month mark vrain under name of michael clear have be in asylum chapter xxv dark plot so vrain be alive after be lucian comment on speech of jorce be here under charge jove be wonderful diana be right after diana who be diana queried jorce then held up hand to stop visitor from replying wait know vrain mentioned daughter diana yes be daughter of vrain belief father to be alive on what ground because dead man whom until lately believed to be mr vrain have one of little finger missing that fact came to knowledge only week ago when did declared that deceased must not be father h be said jorce thoughtfully be quite in dark a to why mr vrain be put under charge because ferruci wished to marry widow see ferruci substituted man for patient have killed evidently replied lucian be almost a much in dark a be dr jorce tell how vrain came to be placed here exchanging confidence for confidence will let know have discovered since death of man in geneva square who called berwin be fair offer replied jorce clearing throat one willingly accept wish to think be in league with signor ferruci what did be done honestly be not afraid of telling story be sure of said lucian heartily guessed that ferruci have not trusted altogether from time feigned that evidence be needed only to decide bet trust echoed jorce with scorn never trusted at be too cunning for however will hear be attention doctor week before last christmas signor ferruci called to see explained that be interested in gentleman called michael clear whom have met year before in italy clear said have be most intimate with later on have indulged so much in morphia habit that friendship have terminated with high word afterwards clear have returned to england ferruci lost sight of for month then visited england one day found clear in street looking ill wretched man have become confirmed morphiamaniac habit have weakened brain count pitied poor creature according to own story took to home whereabouts of clear be happily able to remember where be house asked lucian taking out pocketbook number st bertha road bayswater replied jorce when barrister for private information have made note of address continued then appeared that clear be married wife told ferruci that be afraid of husband who in fit of drink for drank likewise often threatened to kill have lost money poor woman be at wit end what to do ferruci explained to that out of friendship be most anxious to befriend clear stated that mr clear wished to get husband cured proposed therefore to put clear into asylum pay on behalf of wife very ingenious plausible plan said lucian well doctor what did say agreed of course provided man be certified insane in usual way ferruci then departed promising to bring mr clear to see brought late on christmas eve at ten ah interrupted lucian did wear black gauze veil with velvet spot did mr denzil have met have heard of be woman who visited wrent in jersey street doubt ferruci be waiting for in back yard who be wrent asked jorce looking puzzled know name doctor did mr clear never mention never ferruci never heard name before replied jorce complacently strange said denzil reflectively yet wrent seems to be at bottom of whole plot well never mind just now please continue dear doctor what did mr clear say oh repeated ferruci story amplified in feminine fashion be afraid of michael who when excited with morphia drink must snatch up knife to attempt life twice have disarmed now be tired frightened be willing for to go into asylum since count ferruci have so kindly consented to bear expense wished to give one more chance then a be late stayed here night so did count on christmas day went away when did come back about fortnight later brought with man called michael clear what be like old man with white beard be mad asked lucian bluntly be not mad now only weak in head replied jorce professionally be certainly mad when arrived man brain be wrecked by morphia not by drink although suited mr clear ferruci to say so clear a may call be very violent quite justified mr clear desire to sequester told that often imagined to be other people sometimes must feign to be napoleon again pope so when week after be in asylum insisted that be mark vrain put down to delusion how must think have come by name doctor dear sir at time paper be full of case mystery a have reading room in asylum fancied that clear have seen account have a delusion called vrain afterwards fell into kind of comatose state for week said very little be most abject frightened responded in timid sort of way to name of clear naturally confirmed in belief that calling vrain be delusion then grew better one day told that name be vrain of course did not believe still be so persistent about matter thought there might be something in spoke to ferruci what did say denied that man name be anything clear that wife two doctor for poor soul have be duly certified a insane have put into asylum altogether persisted so strongly in original story thought be absurd to put crazy man delusion against sane man tale besides everything regarding certificate sequestrating of clear have be quite legal two doctor very rightly too have certified to insanity of man wife a then believed mr clear to be have consented to detention what made suspicious that there might be something wrong asked lucian eagerly visit to meet at ferruci request to prove alibi responded jorce thought be strange afterwards when detective named mr link called thought be stranger still did not see link be in italy then heard of visit in florence heard from most accomplished gossip whole story of mr vrain marriage prior engagement of mr vrain to ferruci guessed that there might be plot must not quite understand how be carried out save vrain a then began to believe clear to be have be placed in asylum under false name on return intended to see when be laid up in florence with fever now however that have met tell so much of story a know afterwards will see mr vrain lucian be willing enough to show confidence in jorce more so a needed help forthwith told knew from time have met michael clear alias mark berwin alias mark vrain in geneva square down to moment have presented for information at gate of haven doctor jorce listened with greatest attention little face puckered up into grim smile shook head when barrister ended recital bad world mr denzil bad world said rising come with will take to see patient what do think of said denzil eager for comment will tell rejoined jorce when have heard story of mr vrain in few minute lucian be led by guide into pleasant room with french window opening on to wide verandah sunny lawn set round with flower book be arranged on shelf round wall newspaper magazine be on table near window in comfortable chair sat old man with volume in hand a jorce entered stood up shuffled forward with senile smile of delight evidently with reason poor soul considered doctor very good friend well well said cheery jorce how be to day mr vrain feel very well replied vrain in soft weak voice who be doctor young friend of mine mr vrain wish to hear story ala ala sighed vrain eye filling with tear sad story sir father of diana be of middle height with white hair long white beard swept chest on cheek lucian saw cicatrice of diana have spoken mainly by dead man have be falsely identified a vrain be very like clear in figure manner of course resemblance in face be not very close a clear have be clean shaven whereas real vrain wore beard eye be dim weak looking altogether lucian saw vrain be not fitted to battle with world in way quite weak enough to become prey of villain a have be sad fate name be mark vrain young sir said beginning story without further preamble lived in berwin manor bath with wife lydia treated badly by letting man love left oh yes sir left went away to salisbury be very happy there with book ala took morph vrain said jorce holding up finger of course of course said old man with watery smile mean be very happy there signor ferruci black hearted villain face grew dark a mentioned name found out made come with to london kept there for month then brought here kept where mr vrain asked lucian gently old man looked at with vacant eye know said in dull voice came here from bayswater hinted jorce yes yes bayswater cried vrain growing excited be there with woman called wife be not wife wife be fair woman be dark name be maud clear wife name be lydia did mr clear say be husband michael yes called michael clear brought to stay with doctor be not michael clear chapter xxvi other man wife a soon a lucian arrived back in room sat down at desk wrote long letter to diana giving full account of extraordinary discovery of father in jorce asylum advising to come up at once to london when posted did same night sighed to think be not love letter must have covered ream of paper with word of passion adoration must have poured out whole soul at foot of divinity telling of love aspiration hope fear doubt from common sense view letter must have be silly enough must have relieved mind completed happiness of knowing that loved be beloved in place of writing thus be compelled by promise to diana to pen description of late discovery interesting a case be now growing found irksome to detail incident of afternoon wished to be lover not detective so absent minded distraught be lucian that miss greeb who have long suspected something be wrong with spoke that very evening about declared that lucian be working too hard that needed rest although have just returned from country recommended sleeping draught finally produced letter have just arrived a be in female hand miss greeb watched effect on admired lodger with keen eye of jealous woman when saw flush seize eagerly casting meanwhile impatient look on to leave room

will be leaving setting up house with other woman only hope will do for a well a have done wonder if be beautiful rich oh how dreadful be cat made comment on tearful address not a much a mew rolled over into warmer place went to sleep again cat be particularly selfish animal two day afterwards miss greeb opened door to tall beautiful lady who asked for mr denzil be shown into sitting room with keen instinct miss greeb decided that be woman who have taken possession of lucian heart being just little creature in spite of jealousy be obliged to admit that visitor be a handsome a picture then seeing that there be chance for beside splendid lady consoled with dismal little proverb looked forward to time when must be necessary to put ticket in parlour window meanwhile to have one on whose bosom must weep miss greeb went round to see mr bensusan leaving diana in possession of lucian cat sole occupant of kitchen in drawing room on front floor diana with eye shining like two star be talking to lucian have come up at once on receipt of letter have be to hampstead have seen father now be telling lucian about visit knew at once poor dear said rapidly asked if have be out just a if 'd left house for visit come back ah shook head sighed be afraid will never be quite again what doe jorce think say that father can be discharged a cured be going to see about for of course will never be quite sane will never be violent so long a morphia drug of sort be kept from a soon a be discharged will take back to bath put in charge of miss barbar then will return to town must expose whole conspiracy conspiracy what else do call lucian that woman ferruci have planned carried out between put father into asylum made man pas a in order to get assurance money a tool did not die quickly

certain lucian lydia will have to disgorge assurance money yes certainly will have doubt assurance company will prosecute for fraud in obtaining will see ferruci to morrow force to confess putting father in asylum said diana shaking head do that until have more evidence against think evidence of jorce be strong enough suppose mean evidence of mr clear yes although for own sake suppose will

however put advertisement in paper saying if called on here must hear of something to advantage be in paper morning doubt if will call said diana seriously what about promised revelation of rhoda

father so thing slipped memory have not be near place since will go round there to night be miss greeb thinking of cried lucian breaking off quickly that front door bell have be ringing for at least five minute to diana amusement lucian went shouted down stair to miss greeb a reply came bell be still ringing furiously be obliged to open door on step there stood little woman in tailor made brown frock plainly trimmed brown straw hat with black gauze velvet spotted veil at once denzil guessed who be be mr clear said delighted that have replied so quickly to advertisement for have only that morning appeared in newspaper yes be answered woman in quick sharp voice be l d who advertised for yes come upstairs have much to say to diana said lucian on entering room with prize let introduce to mr clear mr clear be wife of man who be murdered in house opposite mr clear uttered cry of astonishment turned a if to retreat denzil be between door so saw that there be nothing for to outface situation a though found difficult to breathe threw up veil diana beheld thin white face with two brilliant black eye be trap said mr clear hoarsely looking from one to other who be said lucian politely be man who met husband before husband have husband in asylum ca have met be telling falsehood said diana fiercely gentleman in asylum of dr jorce be not husband father father who be be diana vrain mr clear gave screech dropped back on to sofa staring at diana with wide open terrified eye now mr clear see realise situation lucian said coldly must confess share in conspiracy what conspiracy interrupted furiously putting of mr vrain into asylum passing off of husband michael clear a know anything about come now talk nonsense if refuse to speak will have arrested at once arrest bounded off sofa with flashing eye yes on charge of conspiracy be use getting angry mr clear for wo improve position be lady wish to know firstly how husband came to be masquerading a mr vrain secondly where can find man called wrent who employed husband thirdly mr clear wish to know law wish to know who killed husband know who killed said woman looking rather afraid believe wrent did who be wrent know know many thing said diana taking part in conversation must tell do know otherwise will call in policeman have arrested ca prove anything against think can said lucian in most cheerful manner can prove that be in of square seeing husband for found on fence dividing back yard of house from one in jersey street scrap of veil such a wear also landlady servant can prove that called on mr wrent several time be with on night of murder then there be evidence of cloak left behind wrent gave to servant rhoda also evidence of signor ferruci ferruci what have said about lucian saw that revenge might make woman speak so lied in calmest manner to get at truth ferruci say that contrived whole conspiracy so did said mr clear with nod took to 'the haven ' at hampstead on christmas eve be true took from wrent house in jersey street need not go on mr l d admit whole business do cried lucian diana together yes if only to spite old villain wrent who have not paid money promised before lucian miss vrain must express pleasure at mr clear coming to sensible conclusion door opened suddenly little miss greeb in wonderful state of agitation tripped in oh mr denzil have just be to mr bensusan rhoda run away run away yes have be back day left note for mr bensusan saying be going to hide because be afraid chapter xxvii confession now indeed lucian have hand full rhoda red headed servant of mr bensusan have run away on plea that be afraid of something what did not explain in note left behind be necessary that must be discovered forced into confessing what knew of conspiracy murder mr clear not having be paid hush money have betrayed confidence misdeed of ferruci thereby revealing extent of villainy for diana lucian be prepared now count have to be seen brought to book for doings lydia informed that husband be in asylum vrain have to be released in due form from legal imprisonment how lucian even with assistance of diana must deal with matter did not know why not see mr link suggested diana when mr clear have departed after making clean breast of nefarious transaction in have be involved may take case in hand again doubt responded denzil drily be not very keen to hand over to seeing that have abandoned twice again if call in police be over with lydia count will be arrested punished for murder of clear perhaps if can be proved that have anything to do with certainly for conspiracy to get assurance money by feigned death of father well said diana coldly why must not receive reward of deed quite so question be do wish scandal diana be silent have not looked at matter from point of view be true what lucian said if police took up case again lydia accomplice must be arrested whole sordid story of doings must be in paper diana be proud woman winced at idea of such publicity must be a well to avoid proceeding to such extremity if assurance money be returned by lydia must be reduced to former estate by timely flight might escape vengeance of defrauded company after be wife of vrain little a diana liked did not wish to see woman who be so closely related to wronged man put in prison not for own sake for sake of name so unworthily bore leave in hand said diana to lucian who be watching closely very good replied denzil then think will be best for to see ferruci first hear confession afterwards call on mr vrain learn what have to say then well said diana curiously what then will be guided by circumstance in meantime for sake of name have better keep matter a quiet a possible mr clear may speak out mr clear wo speak said denzil grimly will keep quiet for own sake a rhoda have left jersey street there will be no danger of trouble from quarter first will see lydia count to get to bottom of conspiracy then will set police on rhoda track that may be arrested made to confess knowledge of murder do think know anything think know everything replied lucian with emphasis be why have run away if capture force to speak may be able to arrest wrent why wrent asked diana have forgotten what mr clear said agree with that be assassin although ca prove a yet who be wrent ah said lucian significantly be just what wish to find out upshot of interview be that early next morning denzil went to chamber of ferruci in marquis street informed servant that wanted particularly to see count at first italian being still in bed for be late riser did not incline to grant visitor interview on second thought ordered lucian to be shown into sitting room shortly afterwards joined there wrapped in dressing gown welcomed barrister with smiling nod having instinct that lucian came on unpleasant errand did not offer hand from first two men be on guard against one good morning sir said ferruci in best english may ask why take from bed so early to tell story about friend dr jorce saying be with on night sneered count partly partly about lady know ferruci frowned speak of mr vrain replied lucian coolly speak of mr clear at mention of name be last one expected to hear visitor pronounce italian in spite of coolness cunning must not forbear start mr clear repeated what do know of mr clear a much a dr jorce must tell count ferruci brow cleared then know pay for keeping miserable husband with friend said composedly be for sake be so kind rather be for own be so cunning cunning most strange word for goodness said count coolly most fit word mean replied lucian impatient of fencing be use beating about bush count know that man keep in asylum be not clear mark vrain la la la talk great humbug mr vrain be dead buried be not dead answered lucian resolutely man who be buried under name be michael clear husband of woman who told ferruci who have be pacing impatiently up down room stopped short with nervous laugh be most amusing said with emotion must not conceal despite self control mr clear told eh told what friend be story have come to tell replied lucian sharply very good said ferruci with shrug wait to hear pretty story with frown threw into chair near lucian apparently saw that be found out for took time to keep voice from trembling hand from shaking man be not coward being thus brought face to face with peril little expected be scarcely to be wondered at that felt shaken nervous moreover knew little about english law hardly guessed how misdeed must be punished still did not surrender on spot listened quietly to lucian story in hope of seeing way of escape from awkward position other day went to dr jorce asylum said lucian slowly there discovered matter not how that friend clear be mr vrain also learned that have be placed in asylum by mr clear jorce gave address in bayswater when went there must not find have left then put advertisement in paper stating that if called on must hear of something to advantage now count appears that mr clear be in habit of looking into paper to see if there be message from friend wrent so saw advertisement at once came in person to reply to one moment mr denzil said ferruci politely know one called wrent be not friend will come to hereafter answered lucian with shrug in meantime will proceed with story see interest very much well count seems that michael clear be actor who bore strong resemblance to mr vrain save that have not scar on face vrain at bath be always clean shaven now wear long white beard be neither here there clear have moustache when be shaved off looked exactly like vrain for purpose of own can easily guess made acquaintance of man profligate drunkard proposed for certain sum of money to be paid to wife that michael clear must personate vrain live in silent house in geneva square under name of berwin knew that clear be slowly dying of consumption drink so trusted that must die a vrain that mr vrain who believe be in plot must recognise corpse by description in newspaper when clear be buried a vrain must get assurance money marry be clever said count with sneer be true know best answered lucian coolly however turned out a expected for clear died a vrain rather be murdered at command a did not die quickly enough body be recognised by mr vrain buried a husband got assurance money only thing remains for conspiracy to be entirely successful be that mr vrain must marry a be told by mr clyne have pretty well be arranged do think then that clyne must let daughter marry man who have done said ferruci who be now very pale believe clyne know anything about replied lucian coldly mr vrain made up pretty plot between vrain told how decoyed from salisbury took to mr clear in bayswater where passed a husband although a confesses kept a kind of prisoner be wrong cried ferruci trying to laugh be most foolish how must man of own will pas a husband of woman knew not sane man must not none knew better than count vrain be not sane that dosed with drug let clear keep locked up in house until put in asylum vrain be puppet in hand locked up in asylum fortnight after man who personated be murdered intended to marry mr vrain keep wretched husband in asylum life best place for lunatic said ferruci ah cried lucian then admit that vrain be mad admit nothing not even that be alive if what say be true said italian cunningly how came that murdered man have scar on cheek might have be like vrain eh not so much mr clear explained that replied lucian quickly made that scar count with vitriol such stuff know chemistry for nothing see be quite ignorant of chemistry said ferruci sullenly jorce heard different story in florence in florence did jorce ask about there said count in alarm did heard strange tale count come now be use trying to evade matter further jorce can prove that put vrain into asylum under name of clear miss vrain can prove that so called clear be father mr clear who have turned queen evidence have exposed whole of conspiracy game up count ferruci sprang from seat began to walk hastily up down room looked haggard pale year older a recognised position for saw very plainly that be trapped that nothing remained to flight how to fly stopped opposite to lucian what do intend to do demanded in hoarse voice have arrested along with mr vrain replied lucian making threat to force ferruci into defending confessing mr vrain be innocent know nothing about conspiracy a call planned whole thing admit then that so called vrain be really michael clear yes got to personate man vrain so must get assurance money when married lydia chose clear because be like vrain made scar on cheek thought must die soon being consumptive killed swear did not kill did not take that stiletto from berwin manor never did be telling truth know who killed clear did not visit wrent in jersey street yes be man rhoda saw in back yard be waiting for mr clear to take to hampstead in meantime thought must climb over fence see clear girl saw so ran away joined mr clear up road be not aware at time that woman who saw be rhoda afterwards went to hampstead with mr clear to see jorce did buy cloak did that girl in baxter co told lie for be warned by mr vrain that have made question about cloak so went to girl told be jealous husband paid to say be not who bought cloak did so quite ignorant of real reason wished to deny knowing why did buy cloak asked lucian satisfied with explanation bought for wrent asked to buy what wanted for know have day before christmas believe gave to mr clear afterwards to girl rhoda of be not sure who be wrent asked denzil reserving most important question for last wrent said ferruci smiling in sneering way ah wish to know who wrent be well excuse for few minute will bring something to show who be with nod to lucian passed into bedroom leaving barrister much astonished thought that ferruci be wrent have gone away to resume disguise of wig beard while pondered thus count reappeared carrying small bottle in hand mr denzil said with ghastly smile have played bold game thanks to woman treachery have lost hoped to get twenty thousand pound charming wife have gained nothing poverty chance of imprisonment be of noble birth will not survive dishonour wish to know who wrent be will never know raised bottle to lip before lucian motionless with horror must rush forward next moment count ercole ferruci be lying dead on floor chapter xxviii name of assassin afternoon london be ringing with news of ferruci suicide paper must give reason for rash act inability be due to police who anxious to capture concerned in conspiracy to obtain assurance money of sirius company kept everything must out of paper lest lydia wrent must be put on guard so escape lucian have be forced to report death of ferruci to authority now case be out of hand again in of link who blamed young barrister severely for not having brought into matter before detective be always more prone to blame than to praise what must do cried lucian angrily threw up case twice said assassin of clear a thought vrain must never be discovered did best failed retorted link who did not like position have have better luck have succeeded luck have be sheer hard work link be not so faint hearted a to draw back at first check well well whole truth have be discovered yet mr denzil a have found out conspiracy may learn who assassin be know already assassin be wrent have yet to prove said lucian with disdain prove nothing wash hand of whole affair be detective let see what will make of case have baffled twice denzil with rage in heart went off laughing at discomfiture of link at moment detective hated successful rival with whole heart lucian took hansom to royal john hotel in kensington where diana in great state

afraid to stay feel quite worn out with diana please give biscuit glass of port have have nothing day with sigh diana touched bell when waiter made appearance gave order felt low spirited nervous in spite of discovery that father be alive well indeed extraordinary event of last few day be sufficient to upset strongest mind lucian be leaning back in chair with closed eye for head be aching with excitement of morning suddenly opened jumped up at same time diana threw open door with exclamation of heard thin high voice of woman who apparently be coming up stair never mind name said voice will tell to miss vrain take to at once lydia called lucian here great heaven why doe come here diana said nothing compressed lip a lydia followed by waiter with biscuit wine came into room be plainly neatly dressed wore heavy veil seemed greatly excited did not say word did diana until waiter left room closed door then threw up veil revealing haggard face red eye swollen with weeping filled with expression of terror sake alive be awful wailed making clutch at miss vrain arm have done time diana ferruci dead father alive be not widow father away know where be told that police be after so be clearing out clearing out mr vrain repeated diana stiffly must think so sobbed lydia want to stay be put in gaol though what have done to be put in gaol for know what cried lucian indignantly know when abominable conspiracy be know nothing of conspiracy interrupted lydia did not get ferruci to put husband into asylum did nothing of sort thought husband be dead buried until ferruci told truth then held tongue until must think of what to do after ercole died servant came round told overheard conversation have with count mr denzil be never so astonished in life a to hear about mr clear husband mark alive oh lord be dreadful give glass of wine diana will go right off in dead faint in silence miss vrain poured out glass of port handed to stepmother who sipped in most tearful mood lucian looked at wretched little woman without saying word wondered if indeed be a innocent a made out to be thought that after might be ignorant of ferruci plot although have certainly benefited by be such glib liar that did not know how much to believe of story however have hitherto only given general idea of connection with matter so when have finished wine be somewhat calmer lucian begged to be more explicit did know did guess even suspect that husband be alive mr denzil said lydia with unusual solemnity a be married woman not widow thought be did not know that mark be alive be bad daresay be not bad enough to shut man up in lunatic asylum pretend be dead just to get money much a like did about identifying corpse be done in good faith really thought be father body questioned diana doubtfully swear did responded mr vrain emphatically mark walked out of house because thought be carrying on with ferruci be be that tyler cat who made trouble between mark be so weak silly half crazy think with morphia over study that cleared right out never knew where have gone to when saw that notice about murdered man in geneva square who called berwin be marked on cheek thought might be husband when coffin be opened really believed saw poor mark dead body face be just like scarred in same way what about missing finger mr vrain if remember even gave cause for loss well be way replied lydia somewhat discomposed knew that mark have lost finger when left ferruci said that if denied police might refuse to believe that body be that of husband so a be sure be mark corpse just said have lost finger out west did think there be harm in saying so a for knew might have got chopped off after leaving face of dead man be a thought mark called berwin know diana be name of manor scar be on cheek know now be contrived by ercole then be quite ignorant when did find out truth after cloak business ferruci came to told what that girl at baxter have said insisted that must tell truth well did in order to force to marry then told to go make right with girl so that when mr denzil went again 'd deny that ercole have bought cloak denied sure enough said lucian grimly ferruci before died told have bribed to speak falsely what more did count reveal to mr vrain conspiracy yes said 'd found mark hiding at salisbury half mad with morphia have taken up to mr clear where seems went mad altogether so locked up a husband in lunatic asylum ferruci also told that have seen michael clear on stage that a be so like mark be likely to die of drink consumption got to play part of mark in geneva square under name of berwin mr clear visited husband there by climbing over back fence getting down cellar somehow know said lucian be mr clear shadow saw on blind be fighting with husband when rang bell be so alarmed that left house by back way got into jersey street then mr clear went home man came round into square by front way be how met wondered how people be in house during absence mr clear told did say why husband made examine house asked diana expect made do so that must not have suspicion about back entrance mr vrain when ferruci confessed that husband be alive why did not tell to world well 'd got assurance money see said lydia with shrewd candour thought company must make fuss take back a suppose will now ferruci wanted to marry be so bad a did not want to commit bigamy really held tongue because ferruci told who killed clear knew then cried lucian denied to who killed man wrent did man who lived in jersey street who be at bottom of whole plot said lucian furiously do know where be to be found yes said lydia boldly do be not going to tell where be why not because want punished do said diana angrily be wretch who ought to suffer very well said lydia loudly spitefully then make suffer for wrent be own father be mark who killed michael clear chapter xxix link set trap in course of acquaintance diana have put up with great deal from little american adventuress owing to position of stepmother when heard accusing man have ruined of murder patience of miss vrain gave way rose quickly walking over to where lydia be shrinking in chair towered in righteous indignation above shameless little woman lie mr vrain said in low distinct voice with flushed face indignation in eye know lie only repeat what ferruci told whimpered lydia rather alarmed by attitude of stepdaughter be sure hope mark did kill man ercole said that be in jersey street for purpose be not true father be in asylum at hampstead indeed be not at time clear be killed protested lydia be not put into asylum until at least two week after christmas be that not so mr denzil be so assented lucian gravely even admitting so much be impossible to believe that mr vrain be in jersey street for many month before christmas be in charge of mr clear at bayswater so ercole said replied lydia used to get away from mr clear at time have to be brought back wandered when got chance said lucian with hesitation admit a much well then when be not at bayswater used to live in jersey street a wrent ferruci found out there tried to get to go back took mr clear several time to same place in order to persuade to return to bayswater be why mr clear visited jersey street oh mark played part there a mr wrent guess there ai no two question about finished lydia triumphantly be assassin bet believe cried diana furiously why father be too weak in head to have will let alone courage to masquerade like be like child in leading string be cunning diana be 'cute enough to pretend madness so that wo be hanged be impossible that vrain can be wrent said lucian decidedly agree with miss vrain be too weak irresponsible to carry out such deed besides see how prove guilty of murder even know that must enter silent house by secret way know anything about except what count ferruci told said lydia obstinately said that vrain a wrent killed clear can easily prove if be true not how can prove asked diana coldly by laying trap for mark know at least ercole told suppose mr clear told that corresponded with mark wrent mean in agony column of daily telegraph by mean of cypher yes know that have received answer yet of course not replied lydia with triumph because wrent be mark know be in asylum ca answer be nonsense broke in lucian impatient of cobweb spinning believe word of ferruci story if vrain lived in jersey street a wrent why must mr clear visit to get back to bayswater nonsense nonsense even admitting a much why must mr clear in newspaper correspond in cypher with man whom not only know be in asylum a husband who can be seen by at time quite agree with lucian cried diana emphatically count ferruci told pack of falsehood to mr vrain thing be utterly absurd oh guess be not so easily made fool of a cried lydia firing up if believe lay trap told of let mark go free out of asylum get mr clear with cypher newspaper to ask to meet in house where clear be murdered then will see if mark wo turn up in character of wrent will not cried diana vehemently will not mark when left went on angry lydia have plenty of hair be clean shaven now a ferruci told for have seen be bald wear skull cap of black velvet white beard after ercole told about jersey street went there to ask that fat woman about mark said have gone away two day after christmas described a old man with skull cap white beard oh cried lucian for recollected that rhoda gave same description ah know speak truth said lydia rising have have enough of have lost money suppose will go back to mark have be treated badly round know what poppa will say be going out of london to meet said did not know where father be cried diana scornfully tell everything diana retorted lydia looking very wicked if must know poppa went over to paris last week be going over there to meet will raise cain for way have be treated well said lucian a prepared to take leave hope will get away do intend to stop mr denzil flashed out mr vrain furiously not will give hint railway station will be watched by police for said lydia with scared expression oh sake be awful have done nothing be not fault if got assurance money really thought that mark be dead will try get away to poppa will put thing right good bye mr denzil diana have done heap of harm bear malice mr vrain rushed out of room in great hurry to escape chance of arrest hinted at by lucian have sharp eye to own safety diana waited until cab lydia have kept waiting be driving away then turned with anxious expression on face to look at lucian dear said taking arm what do think of lydia accusation against father said lucian why believe do will be a well to set trap suggests for if father doe not fall into a be not wrent believe will real man may keep appointment with mr clear whosoever wrent be think will come again to silent house replied barrister shaking head must be thrusting head into lion jaw if be in london will see death of ferruci described in paper doubt will guess that game be up so will keep away nevertheless will do a lydia suggests said diana obstinately see mr link mr clear arrange about cypher then father be to be discharged a cured to morrow will let go out if plea of course will follow then will be able to see if go to pimlico diana suppose doe go to silent house prof to be wrent wo do dear father be more wrent than be believe lydia speaks in full belief that be ferruci for own end lied to however to trap real man let do a lydia suggests idea be good one well will try said lucian with sigh do hope diana that case will end soon week there be fresh development in new direction be getting quite bewildered over will end with capture of wrent assassin hope so god grant wrent doe not prove to be father there be fear of said diana gravely father be insane more le be not murderer be quite content to risk trap suggested by woman lucian did not at once adopt plan to net wrent whosoever might be invented by lydia approved of by diana on whole must not bring to believe that weak headed foolish old creature like vrain have masqueraded in jersey street a wrent still there be certain suspicious incident fitted in very neatly with ferruci story mr clear have stated that vrain when under charge escaped several time have remained away for several day until brought back again by count again appearance of wrent a described by rhoda be precisely same a look of vrain when lucian saw in hampstead asylum so seemed that there might be truth in story be impossible said lucian to vrain be half mad incapable of conducting own life arranging so cleverly to commit crime also have money have lived in jersey street must not have be able to pay mr bensusan there be something more in coincidence of similarity of look than meet eye will see link hear what have to say on subject be time found out something next day lucian paid visit to link be not received very amiably by gentleman who proved to be in somewhat bad temper be not altogether pleased with lucian finding out more about case than have discovered also to further ruffle temper clever lydia have given slip have called at mayfair house with warrant for arrest only to find out that having received timely warning from ferruci servant have fled in vain railway station have be watched lydia taking hint given to by lucian have baffled that peril by taking dover train at station outside london lucian heard what link have to say on subject did not reveal fact that lydia have paid visit to diana have gone to meet father at dover did not want to give little woman up to justice a be beginning to believe innocent that in truth have known nothing of ferruci wrent conspiracy therefore giving information to link a to little woman whereabouts denzil told a coming from idea wrent might fall into trap set for in pimlico house by mean of mr clear cypher link listened to tale attentively decided to adopt idea be good one admitted generously be not jealous enough to cut off nose to spite face have have better of through case mr denzil have have word over will show can appreciate cleverness by adopting plan be greatly obliged to for good opinion said lucian drily for saw with humour that link be only too anxious to benefit by very cleverness of pretended to be so jealous will see mr clear yes will see at once get to invite wrent to pimlico by cypher with threat that will betray whole plot if doe not come daresay know already mr clear be traitress impossible replied link quickly have kept mr clear name out of paper be known that ferruci be dead mr vrain be likely to be arrested in connection with supposed husband murder fact of mr clear putting real vrain into asylum be not known indeed anything about woman if wrent think will tell tale will meet in own hunting ground in geneva square to make term hitherto have not replied to request for money now will think be driven into corner will fix up once for do think that wrent be vrain good lord replied link staring what put into head lucian immediately told about supposed connection between vrain wrent suppressing that be be ferruci idea based supposition on fact of resemblance between two men link theory with scorn scouted idea that two men must be one same have seen vrain said old man be a mad a march hare a silly a child be in dotage must not possibly carry out such plan can easily learn truth from whom asked lucian ah mr denzil be not so clever a think scoffed link why from mr clear to be sure visited at jersey street saw wrent a vrain be then with in character of husband will be able to tell if be two men one person be right link never thought of that then can still teach something replied link in high good humour at having for once scored off too clever barrister forthwith went off to see mr clear how interview with lady sped what told refused to reveal to lucian result be that cypher appeared in agony column of daily telegraph calling upon wrent to meet in silent house in pimlico under penalty of telling police knew if did not come in same issue of paper in message appeared there be paragraph stating that mr vrain have be arrested at dover chapter xxx who fell into trap however closely one may study fair sex there be understanding in least one can say how woman will act in given situation for feminine action be based le on logical foundation than on emotion of moment diana have never liked lydia when american girl became stepmother hated not only said a much showed in action that believed what said declared that must be glad to see lydia deprived of money put into jail punishment must be no more than deserved yet when thing came to pas when by discovery vrain yet lived lydia lost liberty when a connected with conspiracy be arrested on criminal warrant put into prison diana be only friend have miss vrain declared that stepmother be innocent visited in prison engaged lawyer to defend lucian must not forbear pointing out discrepancy between diana past sentiment present action miss vrain be quite ready with excuse be only doing duty said in like lydia a little a ever did think have suspected wrongly in being connected with conspiracy so wish to help if possible after added diana be father wife a if fact extenuated have reason to know replied lucian bitterly if have not be for lydia father must not have left home for lunatic asylum must clear have be murdered quite agree with lucian good have come out of evil for if thing have not be a be must never have met egad be true said lucian kissing be ill wind blow nobody good so diana played part of good samaritan towards stepmother helped to bear evil of being thrust into prison lydia wrote to father in paris received reply therefore be without friend in world save diana later on be admitted to bail diana took to hotel in kensington there to wait for arrival of mr clyne absence silence be unaccountable hope nothing be wrong with poppa wept lydia a rule be always smart in replying if have seen about ercole death imprisonment in paper be sure will be over soon while be thus waiting for father link in way be seeking evidence against mr clear received answer to message in same column of daily telegraph in same cypher there appeared message from wrent that must meet mr clear at geneva square link be delighted when mr clear showed rubbed hand with much pleasure affair be about to be brought to crisis a link be moving spirit in matter vanity be sufficiently gratified a to make quite amiable have got time mr denzil said with enthusiasm couple of policeman will go down to house in geneva square by front sir by front mr clear also questioned lucian wishing to be enlightened on point will come in by back down cellarway a wrent expects to come then will follow in same path walk right into trap wo two be seen climbing over fence in daytime asked barrister doubtfully who said anything about daytime mr denzil did not wrent know too much to risk at time that can be seen from window of adjacent house meeting with mr clear be to take place in front room at ten o'clock when will be quite dark policeman will hide in be bedroom listen to what wrent have to say to mr clear will give rope enough to hang sir then pounce out nab well wo show much fight if be mr vrain believe be mr vrain retorted detective bluntly be doubtful of also admitted lucian know vrain be now out of asylum for time being have be left to own device reply to cypher did not appear until be in position supposing after mysterious wrent prof to be unhappy man in case will have to pay for whistle sir mean in connection with conspiracy yes perhaps with murder of clear know if so called wrent committed crime for such reason mr denzil wish to overhear what say to mr clear be a well to give enough rope to hang with can trust mr clear absolutely know on side bread be buttered only chance of getting free from share of matter be to turn queen evidence intends to do so what did say about vrain being wrent well sir said link putting head on one side looking at lucian with odd expression have better wait till man caught before answer that question then maybe wo require answer be very probable wo replied lucian drily what time be to see to night will call for at nine o'clock sharp will go across to house at once have key in pocket now peacock gave to morning scene will be quite dramatic hope wo prove to be vrain said lucian restlessly for thought how grieved diana must be hope not answered link curtly there be knowing however if old man doe get into trouble can plead insanity having be in asylum of jorce be strong card for to play good day mr denzil will see to night at nine o'clock sharp good day replied lucian pair parted for time being lucian did not go near diana day in first place did not wish to see lydia for whom have great love in second be afraid to speak to diana a to possibility of father being wrent diana a good daughter must held firmly to idea that father must not behave in such way a sensible woman did not think that man with so few of sens about must have acted dual part with be credited without in measure betraying lucian be somewhat of opinion yet have uneasy feeling vrain might prove to be culprit fact of vrain being often away from mr clear house in bayswater wrent absent in same way from mr bensusan house in jersey street appeared strange argued connection between two again resemblance between be most extraordinary unaccountable on whole lucian be not satisfied in mind a to what must be end of matter have known mr clear address must have gone to question about only link knew where woman be to be found kept information to especially from denzil now that have rein once more in hand did not intend that barrister must take again punctual to minute link in state of subdued excitement came to lucian room already have sent two policeman over to house into have instructed to enter in quietest most unostentatious manner now came to escort barrister across lucian put on hat at once two walked out into dark night for dark be with moon few star great many cloud most satisfactory night

into sitting room so a to be ready for mr clear be so dark lonely silent that lucian nerve became over strained be a much a must do to prevent from trembling violently in whisper conversed with link have heard anything of girl rhoda asked have traced to berkshire whispered link went back to gypsy kinsfolk know dare say will manage to lay hand on sooner later be accomplice of wrent believe so do hope to make confess a much to night hush suddenly link have laid clasp on lucian wrist to command silence next moment heard swish swish of woman dress coming along passage entered sitting room cautiously moving slowly in darkness stole up to door behind lucian detective be hiding position of knew well because be opposite window be there whispered mr clear nervously yes replied link in same tone mr denzil two policeman keep man in talk find out if possible if committed murder hope wo kill muttered mr clear will if know have betrayed will be right said link in low impatient voice will rush out must prove dangerous get over by window so that can see little of wrent when talk leave door open will see wo mr clear will keep back in darkness if show light will rush before can use weapon clear out get back to window hope will get through with right said mr clear nervously be awful situation moved stealthily across floor to window there be faint gaslight outside watcher must see figure profile black against slight illumination be still silent a grave when began dreary watch minute passed slowly in darkness there be unbroken silence save for breathing of watcher restless movement of mr clear near window saw pas repass square of glass when unexpectedly paused rigid silent stealthy step be ascending distant stair pacing cat like along passage lucian felt tremor pas through body a step of murderer sounded nearer clearer paused at door then moved towards window where mr clear be standing be that said low voice came weirdly out of darkness yes have be waiting for last half hour mr wrent replied woman in nervous tone be glad have come be glad also said voice harshly a wish to know why propose to betray because wo pay money said mr clear boldly if give to very night will go straight tell police about husband will kill first cried man with snarl made dash at woman with cry for help eluded sprang towards bedroom door for protection next moment four watcher be in room wrestling with wrent when felt grip of hand knew that be betrayed cried out savagely fought with strength of two men however must do little against four adversary worn out with struggle collapsed suddenly on to dusty floor with motion of despair lost lost muttered lost breathing hard link slipped back cover of dark lantern turned light on to face of prisoner out of darkness started pale face with white hair long white beard lucian uttered cry mr vrain said shrinking back mr vrain look again said link passing hand rapidly over face head of prostrate man denzil did look uttered second cry more startling than first wig beard venerable look be gone recognised at once who wrent be jabez clyne jabez clyne exclaimed in astonishment yes cried link triumphantly jabez clyne conspirator assassin chapter xxxi strange confession jabez clyne write confession in prison cell of own free will without coercion from one partly because know that evidence concerning share in vrain conspiracy be strong against partly because wish to exonerate daughter lydia be absolutely innocent of knowledge concerning feigned death of husband actual existence in private lunatic asylum on strength of confession of mine will fix guilt of matter on right person demand that will be set free be not fair that must suffer for ferruci planned carried out whole conspiracy well ferruci have punished soon

done so in what way have gained admission while be thus thinking saw woman again apparently rose out of earth after closing what appeared to be trap door made for fence stopped before got there found to surprise that be red headed servant of mr bensusan kind of gypsy very clever think with much evil in be alarmed at being discovered begged not to tell on for own sake promised not to do so made explain how got into house why entered then told extraordinary tale for year said have be with mr bensusan who have taken from gypsy to civilise hating restraint of civilised life have be in habit of roaming about at night knowing that house at back be unoccupied rhoda for be name climbed over fence tried to get into found door window bolted barred then one night saw kind of grated window amid grass a proved not to be bolted pulled open taking candle with went on voyage of discovery dropped through hole distance into disused cellar only cat must have got in safely for height be considerable indeed rhoda did not risk that mode of entrance again for finding ladder in cellar presume have be used to get at higher bin of wine placed against aperture thus be enabled to ascend descend without difficulty frequently by mean entered empty house went from room to room with candle singing gypsy song a wandered so here have found ghost of although suppose impish gypsy girl knew a much haunted house just to amuse when fat mr bensusan thought be safe in bed asked rhoda why have entered house on particular night when have caught confessed that have seen article of silver in clear room wished to steal on occasion have locked door thing did not always do in drunken humour so rhoda be returning disappointed after confession made go back to own house promised to keep secret also told that if held tongue must give present for purpose made ferruci buy cloak lined with rabbit skin a rhoda on night excursion wanted something to keep warm when ferruci gave to be lying in room mr clear came one night to see finding cold borrowed cloak to wrap round kept for time brought back on christmas eve when gave next day to rhoda be ferruci who bought cloak not be purchased for rhoda not for mr clear next night entered by cellarway found of great advantage a must visit clear without exciting suspicion so keep eye on at first be alarmed by unexpected appearance when showed secret way made use of also used only on dark night be for reason that be not noticed by neighbour must never have done for one of to be seen climbing over fence mr clear once visited husband have quarrel with about drinking be shadow clear denzil saw on blind a soon a heard ring went out back way in climbing hurriedly over fence mr clear tore veil be portion of denzil found on night clear after leaving wife entered square by front so met with denzil much to latter surprise be very angry when clear showed denzil over house said that young man be very suspicious only showed house to prove that there be one in that must have be mistaken about shadow on blind notwithstanding explanation did not approve of clear act indeed of acquaintance with denzil for month matter went on in way clear remained in silent house drinking to death mr clear looked after vrain in bayswater house in old man disguise remained in jersey street although at time left there went to see daughter time lydia have idea of what be preparing then began to grow wearied of position for clear proved tougher than anticipated showed sign of dying in despair thought must give mean to kill mind did not wish to murder man when in drinking fit thought be attacked by enemy when in melancholic frame of mind on recovery must frequently hint at suicide therefore thought that if weapon be left within reach might kill defend conduct in case surely drunken scoundrel be better dead than alive in choosing weapon wished to select one must implicate ferruci rather than in case there be trouble over matter so chose for purpose stiletto hung by parti coloured ribbon on wall of library at berwin manor fancied that stiletto having be bought in florence ferruci coming from florence if anyone must of fact come to light must be credited with giving to clear took stiletto from berwin manor time before christmas bringing up to town left on day before christmas on table in clear sitting room be at nine o'clock in night be when last saw alive who killed know more than one else on christmas eve be ill wrote to lydia to come up met at pegalls a felt ill left there at six o'clock lydia stayed with family night at seven o'clock mr clear came to with ferruci brought back cloak gave afterwards to rhoda wanted to see husband again refused to let risk visit ferruci came to tell that be arranging to place vrain who be becoming too violent to be restrained in private asylum of dr jorce at hampstead mr clear be to go with conversed about matter ferruci went away first a desired to see clear for purpose waited about until be darker went into back yard shortly after eight o'clock there be seen by rhoda a be about to climb fence not knowing be girl took fright ran out of yard into jersey street here found mr clear who have left be waiting for pair went off to see dr jorce at hampstead believe remained there night left alone climbed over fence about nine o'clock saw clear be celebrating christmas eve by drinking heavily be unable to bring to reason therefore left stiletto have brought with on table returned to house in jersey street never saw alive again went to bed slept night so be aware of nothing in connection with death until late on christmas day then mr bensusan be told by miss greeb landlady of denzil that tenant of have be murdered fancied that have killed in fit of melancholia with stiletto have left on table did not dare to go near house to find out afterwards learned that doctor who examined body be of opinion that clear have be murdered being afraid about police taking up case paid mr bensusan week rent left house two day after christmas returned to berwin manor shortly afterwards ferruci joined there a have successfully incarcerated vrain in asylum under name of michael clear when advertisement came out be who hinted to lydia that dead man seeing that be called berwin might be husband went up to town lydia identified body of clear a husband in innocence for after death man looked more like vrain than ever in due time assurance money be obtained think there be anything more to tell save did not know that mr clear have betrayed must not pay money a must not get from lydia told lydia be going to paris in reality be hunting for rhoda who have run away from jersey street fancied might betray wished to make thing safe with before found however saw in paper ferruci have committed suicide also that lydia who have gone to dover to meet thinking be returning from paris have be arrested then saw mr clear advertisement saying must betray if did not pay money consented to meet in order to implore silence so fell into clutch of law may state did not kill clear a never saw after nine o'clock then be alive in spite of what doctor said be still inclined to think killed now have made clean breast of be willing to be punished hope lydia will be set free for whosoever be guilty be innocent have be unlucky man remain one at moment when sign for last time jabez clyne needle to say link denzil be greatly surprised at confession revealed thing save one wished to know what do think of idea of suicide asked lucian be quite out of question replied detective decidedly doctor who examined body said that be impossible man must have committed position of wound show that also power of stroke man must drive stiletto so dexterously strongly into heart also room be in confusion point to struggle stiletto be missing be not suicide murder believe clyne ferruci killed man ferruci be not be not there after ten interrupted link be there about eight dare say when rhoda saw be coming back after having committed deed clyne say stiletto be not there at time just to screen be of little use to screen dead said lucian think only one person can tell truth about murder be rhoda be looking for mr denzil be easy saying harder doing for week passed away in spite of effort of police rhoda must not be found then one morning detective much excited burst into lucian room waving paper over head confession cried confession of whom asked lucian surprised of rhoda replied link excitedly have confessed be rhoda who killed michael clear chapter xxxiii what rhoda have to say of news concerning truth of clear death be last lucian expected to hear stood staring at excited face of detective in wide eyed surprise for moment must not find voice be true tell cried link sitting down smoothing out paper carried rhoda none other killed man be sure link of course be flourishing paper be dying confession dying confession repeated barrister blankly be dead also yes be long story mr denzil sit down will tell to a have have so much to do with beginning of case be only fair that must know end strange end be without word lucian sat down feeling quite confused for in way must guess how clear have come by death at hand of rhoda have suspected lydia a guilty of crime have credited ferruci with commission have be certain of guilt of clyne alias wrent to discover that red headed servant be culprit entirely bewildered have motive to kill man have given evidence freely in matter in respect have acted a innocent person so be why have left jersey street be fear of being arrested for crime have driven into wild a lucian privately thought need not have fled for so far a must see beyond startling announcement of link there be evidence to connect with matter be most extraordinary see be astonished said link with nod so be of folk least suspected imp of girl truth must never have be known have not confessed at last moment for even now can not see on face of evidence save own confession to inculpate in matter so see mr denzil mystery of man death have be so anxious to solve have not be explained by discovered by have be brought to light by chance after be great detective may well look astonished repeated man slowly be immensely let hear confession link wait one moment will tell how came to be made then will relate story in own fashion a way in confession be written be too muddled for to understand clearly still show plainly enough that clyne for suspicion be innocent rhoda sharp servant girl guilty said lucian reflectively never must have thought that be involved in matter how deuce did come to confess well said link clearing throat a preliminary to narrative seems that mr bensusan in fit of philanthropy picked up wretched girl in country belonged to gypsy a parent be dead child burden tribe be glad to get rid of rhoda stanley be full name be taken to london by mr bensusan who tried to civilise think succeeded very well link rhoda with cunning way roaming about at night be always savage at heart in spite of what clyne say in confession believe took delight in turning into haunted house with shrieking flitting candle how must have enjoyed when heard talk about ghost have doubt did mr denzil even delight wearied longed to get back to free gypsy life when found through sir that police wanted to know too much about clear death left mr bensusan in lurch tramped off down to new forest where picked up again with tribe how did mistress take desertion very much to heart a have treated young savage very kindly ought to have received more gratitude perhaps when hears how adopted child wandered about at night ended by killing clear will be glad be dead buried yet know woman be wonderfully soft hearted certainly rhoda be thought end of by fat woman well well said lucian impatient of digression so rhoda went back to tribe yes sir a be sharp clever moreover came with money have stolen from mr bensusan for added theft to ingratitude be received with open arm with gypsy cousin went about in true gypsy style not being hardened to outdoor life in wet weather fell ill civilisation made delicate suppose said denzil grimly exactly be not fit for tent life after having lived for so long under comfortable roof fell ill with inflammation of lung in wonderfully short space of time died when did confess crime be coming to sir when be dying sent two gypsy to nearest magistrate who happened to be vicar of parish in tribe be then encamped asked to see on matter of life death vicar came at once when became aware that rhoda be girl wanted in vrain case for have read about in paper became very interested took down confession of wretched girl have signed by two witness rhoda sent up to scotland yard confession here be said link pointing to manuscript on table be too long to read so will just tell briefly what rhoda confessed how committed crime go on be most anxious to hear link well mr denzil know that rhoda be in habit of visiting by night amusing by wandering about empty room although know what pleasure found in doing so seems that when clear became tenant of house rhoda be very angry a presence interfered with midnight caper however on seeing room for clear found one night took in to show to be filled with admiration with true gypsy instinct wanted to steal of ornament tried to pocket silver paper knife on very night clear be so hospitable to be not sharp enough man saw theft in rage at dishonesty turned out of room swore that must thrash if came into presence again did threat keep rhoda away not be sure saw enough of wildcat to know nothing must frighten certainly did not thrust personally on clear whenever back be turned took to stealing thing out of room when be foolish enough to leave door open clear be much enraged complained to clyne known to rhoda a wrent who in turn read girl sharp lecture having shown clyne cellarway into house miss rhoda knew too much laughed in clyne face did not dare to make theft public complain to mr bensusan lest rhoda must tell of connection between tenant of silent house who passed under name of berwin therefore told clear to keep sitting room door locked wise precaution with imp about said lucian hope clear be sensible enough to adopt yes when be sober locked door when drunk left open rhoda looted at will now come more important part of confession remember that clyne left stiletto from berwin manor on clear table yes with amiable intention that poor devil must kill left on christmas eve too pleasant time for man to commit suicide of course intention be horrible said mr link gravely people might think act incredible have seen so much of worst side of human nature be not surprised clyne be too cowardly to kill man so thought to make clear own executioner by leaving stiletto in way well sir weapon proved to be useful in way be intended by clyne for clear be killed with very weapon by rhoda said lucian nodding see how did get hold of by accident when wrent mean clyne mr bensusan went to bed on christmas eve rhoda thought must have of devil dance in haunted house so slipped out of bed into yard dropped down into cellar whence went up to clear room be clear in bed be in bedroom according to rhoda furiously drunk know that clyne said man have be drinking day on night have left sitting room door open lamp burning on table be silver handled stiletto with ribbon when rhoda peered into room to see what must pick up thought must like pretty toy stole forward softly took stiletto before must get back to door clear who have be watching reeled out rushed at did run away must clear be between door ran round room upsetting everything for thought must kill in drunken rage remember mr denzil how disorderly room be well clear got rhoda into corner be going to strike have stiletto still in hand held point outward to save from blow thought when saw weapon must not dare to come nearer however did not see stiletto be too drunk to feel fear for stumbled fell forward so that dagger ran right into heart in moment fell dead before have time a rhoda say to even utter cry so be accident after said lucian oh yes quite accident replied link can see very plainly how took place of course rhoda be terrified at what have done although really be not to blame leaving dead man ran away with stiletto dropped ribbon off near cellar door a be running away there mr kebby found what did do with stiletto have in room when left mr bensusan carried with down country in proof of truth gave to vicar who wrote down confession sent up with paper to scotland yard queer case be very queer link thought everybody be guilty rhoda ah said detective significantly be always least suspected person who be guilty must have sworn that clyne be man now seems that be innocent so instead of hanging will only be imprisoned for share in conspiracy may escape way said lucian drily morally speaking regard a more guilty than rhoda chapter xxxiv end of two year after discovery of rhoda guilt mr mr denzil be seated in garden of berwin manor be perfect summer evening at sunset hour something like evening when in same garden almost at same time lucian have asked diana to be wife between then now twenty four month have elapsed many thing have taken place of more le importance to young couple mystery of clear death have be solved lydia have be set free a innocent of crime father found guilty of conspiracy to obtain assurance money have be condemned to long term of imprisonment what most concerned lucian diana mark vrain have really truly gone way of flesh after conclusion of vrain case lucian have become formally engaged to diana be agreed between that marriage must not take place for time on account of father health after discharge a cured from asylum of dr jorce miss vrain have taken father down to own place in country there tended with most affectionate solicitude in hope that must recover health hope be vain for by over indulgence in morphia worrying wandering irregular mode of life vrain have completely shattered health lapsed into state of second childhood being deprived of drug formerly have excited to state of frenzy sank into pitiable condition for day must remain without speaking to one even ceased to take pleasure in book finally limb became paralysed so spent last few month of wretched life in bath chair being wheeled round garden still constitution be so strong that lived for quite twelve month after return to home died unexpectedly in sleep diana be not sorry when passed so easily away for death be merciful release of tortured soul from worn out body so mark vrain died be buried after funeral diana went abroad with miss priscilla barbar for companion in meantime lucian stayed in grimy smoky london worked hard at profession be beginning to be known in time actually received brief two with did best in court still be far from being successful pleader hoped to be for law of profession be one demand time industry for attainment of degree of excellence be rarely that young lawyer can go to sleep wake to find famous must crawl rather than run with diligence punctuality observance of chance in time wished for goal be reached although goal in nine case out of ten be very moderate distance off lucian did not sigh for judgeship for seat on woolsack be content to be barrister with good practice perhaps qc ship in prospect however during year of diana mourning did so well that felt justified in asking to marry when returned diana on side saw obstacle to course so consented if be not rich dear be said when lucian alleged poverty a only bar to union a money give pleasure without care to stay in berwin manor in lonely spinsterhood will marry whenever choose lucian taking advantage of gracious permission did choose to be married that speedily so within two year after final closing of vrain case became man wife at time be seated in garden at hour of sunset have only lately returned from honeymoon be now talking over past experience miss priscilla who have be left in charge of manor during absence have welcomed back with much joy a looked upon match a one of own making now have gone inside on understanding that two be company three be none young couple be left alone hand in hand after foolish fashion of lover sat under leafy oak tree sunlight glowed redly on happy face after short silence lucian looked at face of wife laughed what be amusing dear said mr denzil with sympathetic smile thought be rather pleasant than amusing replied lucian giving hand lay in squeeze be thinking of han andersen tale of elder mother tree of old couple who sat enjoying golden wedding under linden with red sunlight shining on silver crown be under oak wear crown replied diana in turn be quite a happy think although be not golden wedding perhaps will come day diana fifty year dear be long way off yet said mr denzil dubiously be glad be for will have dv fifty year of happiness with to look forward to upon word diana think deserve happiness after trouble have have with be sure to be happy lucian other people poor soul be not so well off what other people jabez clyne for one dear said lucian seriously hope be not hard man really can not find in heart to pity clyne be dare say be scoundrel deny that acted badly sighed diana be for daughter sake know there be limit even to paternal affection diana putting aside wickedness of whole conspiracy can not pardon man who deliberately put weapon in way of man almost insane with drink in order that might kill idea be diabolically wicked dear think that jabez clyne alias wrent quite deserves long imprisonment received at event sirius company got back money lucian so much a lydia have not spent got back diana when father actually died have to part with very soon again of have gone into lydia pocket after diana blushed be only right dear said apologetically when father made new will leaving to did not think that lydia however badly treated must be left absolutely penniless know lucian agreed must share assurance money with did replied denzil of two evil chose least for if lydia have not got portion of money must have be quite capable of trying to upset second will on ground that mr vrain be insane papa be not insane reproved diana be weak admit at time made will have sens besides after scandal of case think lydia must have dared to go to law about still be best to give money hear from miss priscilla that lydia be now in italy proposes to marry italian prince have flown higher than count then poor ferruci killed for sake for own rather exclaimed mr denzil energetically knew that if lived must be punished by imprisonment so chose to kill rather than suffer such dishonour believe truly loved lydia certainly a wanted assurance money fancy sinned quite a much for own sake a for lydia doubt dare say lydia loved after own fashion yet seems to have forgotten pretty soon a say intends to marry prince envy highness have heart so dare say will be happy a such woman ever be said diana contemptuously yet happiness come out of much evil if have not married father own must not now be in prison must count ferruci rhoda be dead ferruci perhaps might still be alive husband assented lucian have doubt about rhoda be wicked precocious little imp that girl sooner later must have come to bad end death of clear be due to accident admit rhoda have still one person who lament over for although mr bensusan know truth always think of red haired minx a kind of martyr who be led into wicked way by clyne alias wrent be sure mr clear doe think so mr clear have got quite enough to think about in remembering how narrowly escaped imprisonment for share in shameful conspiracy if have not turned queen evidence must have be punished a clyne be a be just escaped by accident still if have not be for must never have discovered truth must never have suspected clyne who be always so meek mild even that visit paid to to lament over daughter probable marriage to ferruci be trick to find out how much knew think hated ferruci be sure did not acted part to find out what be doing if mr clear have not betrayed must never have discovered conspiracy if rhoda have not spoken mystery of clear death must never have be solved said diana although only confessed at eleventh hour when be dying think link be pleased that mystery be solved in so unexpected way said lucian laughing never forgave finding out so much without aid ascribes ending of whole matter to chance dare say be right h be said mr denzil who have great love for detective certainly left everything to chance twice gave up case twice gave up said denzil if have not be for dear must never have gone on with what seemed to be hopeless task when first met induced to continue search for culprit again when by evidence of missing finger did not believe father be dead well worked worked link worked said diana philosophically three did best to discover truth only to let chance discover in long run diana laughed nodded did not contradict husband well dear said think have discussed subject pretty freely there be one thing must like to know what about silent house in pimlico oh miss greeb told other day that peacock be going to pull down know just before be married took leave of miss greeb with whom lodged for long time well gave piece of news be going to be married also to whom do think know said diana looking interested a woman always do in marriage news to peacock who owns nearly property in about geneva square will be splendid match for mr peacock will be much richer than diana not happier dear be glad be to be married a seemed nice woman made very comfortable why be silent house to be pulled down because one will live in be not haunted now know be discovered that rhoda be ghost ghost a miss greeb suggested killed clear be haunted now by ghost of clear said lucian gravely at event be murdered there one care to live in house confess must care to live in so peacock finding house unprofitable have determined to pull down so there be end to silent house of pimlico said diana rising taking husband arm come inside lucian grows chilly 'tho wind be cold night be drear yet love make warm heart dear ' quoted lucian a went up to house be not very good poetry be beautiful truth love diana laughed looked up proudly into bright face of husband so went inside found that miss priscilla have made tea be very happy very thankful for happiness in condition be sufficiently pleasant think may leave end
