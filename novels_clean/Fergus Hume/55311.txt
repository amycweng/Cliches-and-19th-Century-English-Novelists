position of affair be carmela sister of mr verschoyle if so must have be in love with verschoyle a dead friend have clearly said so in case ronald be not first love felt that position be very unsatisfactory thing be if carmela have be standing beside sister on night of departure also must have recognized verschoyle therefore when murder be committed must undoubtedly have connected sister with crime suppose knew about be silent in order to shield sister well must not blame for if be doing be in certain way accomplice must marry woman who be not only cognizant of such crime be closely related to person who have committed ronald used to lie awake at night worry over thing till thought must go out of mind be madly in love with carmela still have certain amount of self restraint determined not to ask to be wife until mystery environed death of verschoyle be cleared up satisfactorily therefore kept away from a dared not trust in presence without giving way marrying without

julian roper to ronald monteith dear sir have now be here week in accordance with instruction have lost time in investigating case entrusted to result regret to say be far from satisfactory on arrival at valletta took up quarter at hotel d'angleterre in strada sta lucia made inquiry a to whereabouts of mr verschoyle after considerable difficulty found that be staying at boarding house in strada cristoforo on learning thought best plan must be to take up abode in same house a must then learn with more precision movement of mr verschoyle to end went to strada cristoforo found boarding house to be very comfortable one kept by fat widow whose name be signora briffa secured very pleasant apartment took possession of next day much to own satisfaction that of signora at table d'hte met rest of lodger who be queer looking lot mostly italian with sprinkling of english people among latter be mr dexter widow of colonel in indian army who have be staying in valletta for last fifteen year for health being garrulous old person much given to gossip know everything everyone be tall rather thin with sharp feature scanty grey hair cold grey eye in fact gave impression of being decidedly unpleasant person presentiment turned out to be true on further acquaintance with confesses to age of thirty five though shrewdly suspect forty five even more must be near mark have one quality however be of great service to hate mr verschoyle with intense hatred of narrow minded woman reason be twofold first mr verschoyle be very handsome mr dexter be not secondly mr verschoyle be rich whereas mr dexter be poor given reason can wonder at malignity of feeling towards mr verschoyle a to latter be very beautiful speak a unenthusiastic man tall dark skinned with clearly cut feature magnificent black eye impressed at once with overwhelming sense of strong personality looking at in repose be fine picture once hear talk charm be gone yes voice be very coarse sound discordantly in addition to be insufferably proud cause of mr dexter dislike have very violent temper of course did not deign to speak to mere english tourist such of course be character gave attention to lord francis hurlington young nobleman who hovers round like moth round candle hope will not singe lordly wing seeing seated in drawing room alone mr dexter came sat beside apparently out of good nature for one so forsaken in reality to learn history gratify love of curiosity told history be invented fictitious story proved that ought to have be novelist in return for confidence told about inmate of house more especially of mr verschoyle thinking have doubt that skilfully coloured story might injure lady in estimation heard about divorce case a be already acquainted with fact there be need on part for repetition so may a well tell story of mr verschoyle life from time settled in valletta after divorce in first place have income from late mr verschoyle not caring to take house lived at first in lodging such be violence of temper that be turned out of one place after till found haven of rest at signora briffa a lady doe not regard temper so long a money be paid regularly mr verschoyle have sister called carmela who be at present in england whither went on board neptune appears be in england before came out to malta to live with sister quarrelled however carmela in rage left mr verschoyle went to london a know in same boat a did marchese vassalla who be cousin also went with though have always be be still good friend with mr verschoyle shrewdly suspect from hint conveyed by mr dexter that lady in question be in love with having thus got general outline of life of mr verschoyle questioned mr dexter in detail here be even more fortunate than before a found excellent person kept diary agreed to show to will wonder at being honoured with confidence after so short acquaintance fact be mr dexter discovered with woman instinct that mission be inimical to interest of mr verschoyle agreed to let see diary in order might secure anything must be detrimental to enemy character might a well mention that mr colonel dexter being quite alone in world having very little money agreed to accept sum of money a bribe a put loan loan bribe fact remains same took likewise promised to observe profound secrecy so having thus secured allegiance went to own room perused page of diary taking note a went along note be a follows be afraid be of small value a seem to mind to lead to nothing extract from diary of mr dexter april th quarrel knew must lead to wonder carmela put up with insolence of sister wonder mr verschoyle divorced one must live with such bad tempered woman say divorced of course know truth though doe think so put in mind of horrid major penton wife at same bold way about asked carmela where mr verschoyle be said did not know of course did not do be in australia signora briffa told that carmela be in love with mr verschoyle herself preferred sister wonder quarrel may st mr verschoyle be setting cap at lord francis can see very well be trying to marry be fool know not quite so foolish a to make wife in fact think rather incline to sister believe mr verschoyle see make none more friendly towards carmela wonder how will end may th lot have happened lately lord francis be gone mr verschoyle be furious be very glad a have missed chance of coronet believe proposed to carmela went away in rage because refused have left for constantinople in yacht mr verschoyle must have given ear to have gone also bold thing enmity between sister still continues verily believe mr verschoyle must kill carmela with pleasure if must do so with safety overheard curious conversation between wonder what mean be sitting in drawing room half hidden by curtain when sister entered room began to quarrel a usual most delightful pair despise listener must not help so have to overhear conversation unwillingly of course will be best for to put in dramatic form mr verschoyle know loved wonder whom mean carmela yes did be only fancy of girl when married did not care bit about see now be talking of mr verschoyle husband be good husband to might have made life happy mr verschoyle betrayed for woman carmela only after made life so unendurable that have to leave mr verschoyle take part believe be in love with still carmela be not know here mr verschoyle burst into torrent of such abusive language a gentlewoman christian have to interfere carmela left room after mr verschoyle anger have expended relapsed into sulky silence june th such delightful man be staying here marchese matteo vassalla be cousin of sister be waiting arrival of p o neptune to go on to england have made discovery be in love with carmela mr verschoyle be in love with how strange carmela always seems to stand in way of sister doe not mend breach between went out together came back quarrelling suppose about marchese carmela said be going to england in neptune june th neptune have arrived carmela have secured passage be going to sir mark trevor in england will be escorted by cousin vassalla must not wonder if be engaged by time reach london carmela sister made up quarrel went out together then carmela came back alone almost cry shut in room mr verschoyle minx later on lady came back in fearful rage fancy must have spoken to one who differed from tried to see carmela that young lady very properly refused to be further insulted so mr verschoyle shut up in room carmela went away without saying good bye to mr verschoyle refused to come to dinner after dinner went up to room knocked at door be still locked must obtain answer from so went to bed early having headache june th next morning mr verschoyle be not at breakfast sent down word have headache wonder with way let violent temper run away with saw later in day asked why did not answer when knocked on previous night said be asleep did not hear did not speak to again have lost lover sister be not sorry here extract from diary likely to be of use to end if will read carefully will see that according to report of mr dexter faithfully given mr verschoyle did not leave house on night of sailing of neptune so must not have be on board consequently must be innocent of crime now of course be debatable question whether not mr verschoyle really did leave house will perceive that refused to come down to dinner stayed in own room after dinner mr dexter went up to door found locked must get answer now what be easier than for mr verschoyle to slip out of room while be at dinner servant away in kitchen lock door to lead to belief that be still there go off to ship commit crime come home again unluckily mr dexter went to bed early mr verschoyle return must not have escaped lynx eye so if did go out a surmise mind be only surmise servant might have seen return therefore questioned servant must get satisfactory answer out of a must remember nothing not even money must sharpen wit in extremity bethought of boldly asking mr verschoyle in drawing room after dinner led conversation round to excellence of p o steamer asked if have seen neptune winced changed colour little then answered mr dexter then became ally conversation be a follows mr dexter sister went to england in neptune mr verschoyle yes so did cousin marchese vassalla for did not see boat why did not go on board to say good bye mr verschoyle have headache did not leave room mr dexter yes remember knocked at door must get answer mr verschoyle quickly be asleep be pity did not see neptune be such magnificent vessel closed conversation left thing a be see mr verschoyle denies that left house on evening so if be case can prove alibi thus can not be accused of committing crime however be not satisfied with denial winced when mentioned neptune moreover knew that husband be on board a met during day by way explains passage in mr dexter diary that returned in rage to mind therefore only people who can definitely say if be on board be miss carmela cotoner marchese vassalla for even if went on board secretly to see husband must not have escaped notice by sister cousin advice therefore be for to see either miss cotoner marchese vassalla find out if mr verschoyle be on board before neptune sailed if so can pursue inquiry if not must turn in direction a have now got information can obtain here be leaving to morrow for england if possible will get stiletto used in committal of crime from authority at gibraltar may add have obtained specimen of mr verschoyle writing to compare with paper gave though there be similarity there be also distinct difference then handwriting doe alter in five six year best thing will be to submit paper to expert who can easily tell if be written by same person will call at mr foster room directly on arrival in england report more fully yours obediently julian roper chapter xv marchese matteo vassalla after reading roper letter ronald went to foster chamber showed to barrister read in silence then laying down on table looked hard at monteith see be right said tapping letter with finger miss cotoner be a thought sister of mr verschoyle yes replied ronald quickly have nothing in common with ah think not let see taking up letter glancing over have temper woman must show temper living with fiend a mr verschoyle retorted ronald defending carmela loved same man meaning verschoyle carmela love for be only girlish fancy a say in mr dexter diary in short said foster replacing letter on table be so much in love with that can not see imperfection be not blind to if be what mean retorted ronald doggedly know be love intend to ask to be wife ah well a soon a mystery be cleared up understand said foster rising from chair walking to fro judging from letter of roper elucidation seems a far off a ever see that for taking thing into consideration be inclined to think mr verschoyle be telling lie oh so believe be on board 'neptune night ronald nodded there be proof certainly not actual proof said ronald quietly think be very probable that roper theory be correct did leave bedroom lock door then return without anyone seeing well whole affair be easily settled go see miss cotoner vassalla ask if mr verschoyle came on board will certainly know believe miss cotoner know anything about said ronald angrily if quarrelled before leaving house may be certain that mr verschoyle never came near on boat miss cotoner might have seen sister might wo ask well dear boy said foster rather annoyed at sentimental obstinacy go see vassalla yes will do that will be able to tell whether be on board not doubt if suit to acknowledge retorted foster dryly what do mean asked australian impatiently think mean nothing think nothing replied other quickly go see marchese vassalla then tell what discover then well then depends on answer regarding next move ronald put on hat glove then taking leave went outside into roar bustle of fleet street through archway must see quiet temple garden must not help contrasting solitariness charm with turmoil on pavement hang said to a watched busy crowd rushing past everyone here seems to live with watch in hand must not like to live here suppose will have to stop till find out about verschoyle death last reflection putting in mind of engagement stepped into hansom drove off to langham hotel to see vassalla vassalla be upstairs in private sitting room enjoying breakfast when monteith card be sent to carmela have gone out with sir mark daughter so marchese felt perfectly secure against chance of ronald meeting dreaded meeting because disagreeable explanation might be made must reconcile lover ruin carefully prepared scheme a looked at card thoughtfully be rapidly running over in mind reason might make ronald thus seek feasible one however presenting to told waiter to show gentleman up quietly went on with breakfast have reason for coming muttered quietly will find out trouble mr monteith friend enemy be equal to arose from seat with enigmatical smile on face a australian entered held out hand other took with slight reluctance be noticed by clever maltese gentleman hum thought not quite friendly see ronald took seat declined offer of breakfast prepared to talk miss cotoner be out said coldly yes with sir mark trevor charming daughter replied vassalla do wish to see want to see foreigner eyebrow went up well be at disposal be about murder took place on board 'neptune said ronald going straight to point ah indeed said said marchese quietly most interesting subject have discovered anything yet yes many thing such a will lead to detection of assassin presume know answered ronald shortly be pity can assist in way think can then may command service replied marchese politely thank will take advantage of offer said ronald glancing at impassive face before vassalla bowed folded arm leaning back in chair prepared to listen in first place said ronald knew vassalla shook head have not honour of m ventin acquaintance name be not ventin indeed be leopold verschoyle leopold verschoyle repeated marchese looking at sharply be name of man who married cousin yes from whom be afterwards divorced exactly said vassalla see know whole story so be man who be killed be want to find out who killed eyebrow went up again incredulously hope will succeed said vassalla politely in what way can help do know anyone who desired death not even wife vassalla rose to foot with bound looked fiercely at ronald be insult sir hissed out between teeth do dare to accuse cousin of murder accuse one retorted ronald coolly merely asked if wife must have be sorry at death vassalla threw back in chair with short angry laugh upon soul sir said coldly hardly recognise right to speak to about thing a seem so bent on knowing think must have be very sorry indeed oh then still loved vassalla cast fine eye up to ceiling passionately be curious said ronald sardonically a have document in possession written five six year ago in threatens to kill indeed how did obtain such document found among paper left by verschoyle with sister mr taunton ah vassalla thought moment so be reason monteith be with mr taunton be business not love that brought together well at event must not let carmela know after moment deliberation faced adversary with clear brow very likely be written in first outburst of jealous anger at being so betrayed by husband assure loved husband deeply in spite of way wronged often spoke of with affection judging from story told to by verschoyle extract from mr dexter diary ronald thought doubtful restrained desire to give opinion on point did mr verschoyle come on board night 'neptune left malta vassalla glanced keenly at why must to see miss cotoner off suppose did come on board might have seen husband impossible did not know be on board yes did verschoyle told met in valletta on day vassalla drummed quickly in annoyed manner on table with finger then answered abruptly did not come on board oh ronald be disappointed be suspicion groundless after be confined to room evening with headache statement a ronald knew tallied with mr dexter diary felt that after might be truth that mr verschoyle have not be on board in case who be assassin vassalla saw expression of disbelief flitting across ronald expressive face arose to foot in order to convince said quickly will show letter received from cousin there be need began ronald vassalla interrupted pardon there be said coldly wish to be thoroughly convinced that mr verschoyle be not on board must not have seen husband have have anything to do with death did not say have interrupted ronald hastily thought so retorted marchese a left room ronald arose to foot walked hastily too fro be wrong then mr verschoyle be innocent of husband death who then be assassin for one else appeared to have have reason to wish evil vassalla no must not be because have motive theory of mr verschoyle criminality having be thus effectually disposed of there appeared to be absolutely clue to perpetrator of crime vassalla returned with letter handed to ronald showing at same time passage alluded to be so sorry said letter not to have be able to come down see carmela away by boat have very bad headache be shut up evening in room ronald handed back letter in silence first thoughtfully glanced at writing certainly resembled that in letter written five six year ago must not recollect with sufficient clearness to satisfy be convinced said vassalla a placed letter in pocket book yes answered ronald be convinced good bye thank for kindness in answering question pleasure said marchese bowed visitor out with smile however faded a door closed curse that meddling fool muttered to why ca mind own business have baffled time will baffle again if interfere chapter xvi carmela be questioned of course ronald went straight to foster office there made report regarding statement of vassalla barrister listened to monteith in silence when be in full possession of fact sat absently scribbling on blotting paper much to ronald disgust at what deemed inattention hang foster said australian irritably wish 'd say something have not lost tongue have brain retorted foster lighting cigarette 'd better have smoke will soothe want to be soothed oh yes do returned gerald imperturbably try one of be real russian cigarette in order to propitiate companion ronald took one smoked away in sulky silence mr foster settled deliberately in chair fixing clear eye on monteith began to talk what do think of position of affair now asked knocking ash off cigarette seems to that game up retorted ronald sullenly on contrary game be just beginning to be interesting said foster

murdered at very place where be staying roper say did not leave house vassalla say be not on board own letter say be confined to room with headache fudge believe one of then think be on board asked ronald eagerly be certain of ask a logical man whether jealous woman like mr verschoyle knowing husband be on board 'neptune must resist temptation of seeing nonsense tell be on board if vassalla say be not have reason what reason can have want to shield from consequence of crime be cousin blood be thicker than water be very well said ronald quietly view be quite theoretical can not obtain single particle of evidence to prove that came on board at how do know can not well there be roper letter own letter vassalla denial who else can prove be on board miss cotoner oh ronald arose went to window think so said turning round if mr verschoyle quarrelled with sister be not likely 'd go near perhaps not miss cotoner might have seen 'd better go ask ronald hesitated moment then made up mind very

woman to be lightly won thrown over what consummate actress woman be when ronald entered drawing room expected to find carmela pale anxious through fretting over long absence from side be rather blow to self love when came forward with bright smiling face outstretched hand how do do mr monteith said in low sweet voice be quite stranger ronald muttered something about business a took hand then sat

secondly made acquaintance a signer clement liked very much have frequent conversation with told be friend of vassalla know said ronald fair in love war detective work observed roper quietly told mr verschoyle who knew from mr dexter diary be in love with vassalla that marchese wanted to marry carmela cotoner sister be true enough said foster be engaged to now whereat ronald winced result be aroused jealousy swore that must prevent marriage how from ronald eagerly fain to cling like drowning man to straw be what must not find out said roper thoughtfully said must stop marriage vassalla must have to obey now what logical inference do draw from vassalla committed murder said ronald hastily not necessarily replied roper dryly if vassalla knew be on board night also knew committed murder must therefore have power over determination to stop marriage show that must have power over so that be innocent committed murder can force by fear of exposure to do what want of theory do think be right asked foster be doubtful said detective becoming little agitated have third theory yes said ronald in quiet tone looking strangely at detective roper arose to foot took walk up down room for minute then turned to young men who be puzzled by curious manner of course be only theory said roper nervously can only tell what think tell in heaven name cried foster rising then think miss

kind aid of mr dexter obtained letter of miss cotoner by will see correspond in particular at moment ronald arose from seat staggering to table produced from pocket book note written to by carmela before neptune reached gibraltar laying down by other paper with shaking hand at first glance must be seen handwriting be identical be true groaned ronald god be true fell heavily into chair again what be opinion asked foster theory corrected roper be think miss cotoner saw old lover on boat committed murder trusting to presence of sister on board to shield from consequence of crime also believe that vassalla know be guilty have threatened to tell unless marry yes what about mr verschoyle oh think know that carmela guilty threatens to expose if will not refuse to marry vassalla seems clear enough said foster thoughtfully yes be d d lie for said ronald springing to foot oh how haggard worn young face looked look here fellow love miss cotoner believe be guilty think that cursed
