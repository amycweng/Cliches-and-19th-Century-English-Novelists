detective nodded mr burgh told will have talk with humph seems to that one of chinaman killed miss wharf that tie be used to lay blame on mr ainsleigh here well said ainsleigh drawing breath be glad to hear that suspect ca think that tung yu stole tie even though did see place in coat will look after cloak room attendant said rodgers making note will have to give account of see what private god kwang ho have to do with matter can only tell said major tidman have cold last night stopped in room heard that tung yu be down stair a knew in canton went to have look for be pleasant companion in canton did tell about fan adventure ainsleigh be annoyed that must have let slip have adventure want to be mixed up in matter tung yu be nice enough if have to do with fan be quite capable of turning nasty making thing unpleasant for mentioned about advertisement how came to know of through confessed that lo keong have lost fan wished back again a have to do with family business finding of be referred to god kwang ho priest of god said that two men be to search for fan hwei tung yu yes be to search on alternate day if hwei found be to kill person from whom got if be tung yu day be to give fortunate person five thousand pound whose day be on night of crime hwei said major be why tung yu must not buy fan when miss wharf offered to chapter xii at inquest when mr orlando rodgers of cid rolled into superintendent office next day to relate what have heard be not so glib a usual after sleeping on extraordinary tale have heard from major tidman considering fragment imparted by clarence burgh young ainsleigh came to look on matter a something to do with arabian night fan deceased lady have carried at ball be certainly gone whole of marvellous matter connected with china hung on fan miss wharf may have be murdered for other reason rodgers be half inclined when looking into case in cold searching morning light to abandon fan theory delayed doing until have consulted with superintendent young who looked after marport police what do think of asked when tale be told superintendent be tall thin man with cold eye distrustful manner believed only half saw absolutely nothing heard consequently when rodgers ended opinion be asked sniffed disdainfully put on most official expression be fairy tale said young in dry voice be like creaking of rusty wheel well now woman be murdered not for fan mr rodgers then what motive do think undertake to say sir let gather evidence can submit to intelligent jury at inquest take place to day at public house near corner of cliff road not far from ivy lodge when jury have inspected body will sit with coroner at bull head chinaman calling tung yu be at ball know said rodgers unwilling to abandon theory in spite of doubt where be now ca say mr christopher walker brought down went to see that young gentleman before departed for business morning told that tung yu be clerk in same firm of tea merchant a be employed with have not be at office since left to come to ball mr walker last saw tung yu at door of hotel looking out across pier well said young drily that yacht be there went on rodgers showed green light so be just possible that mr burgh may be right that chinaman did steam away in well then search for yacht intend to when find mr tung yu will have explanation mr rodgers said superintendent rising ca believe business be about trifle such a fan more serious motive be at bottom of murder now mr ainsleigh tie can explain said detective did young listened disbelievingly so say be comment think mr ainsleigh be sort of man to commit brutal crime like in so public place everyone capable of committing crime if there be anything to be gained be superintendent philosophy mr ainsleigh very agreeable manner with appear to be struck may be mask to hide evil nature oh rubbish begging pardon mr young look at joss stick rodgers held out be found in ruin of royabay abbey so see chinaman must be mixed up in job be beginning to believe that tale may be true after be too wild too far fetched ca believe because have imagination want imagination in matter mr rodgers fact sir rodgers got up put on hat well will not be able to agree can see said a case be in hand be going away to look after evidence why not arrest mr ainsleigh because evidence against be not sufficiently strong detective sat down again see here mr superintendent if so chose must manufacture case against three of people at least give to pretty strong too supposing for sake of theorising mind say mr ainsleigh killed woman be inclined to think did on tie evidence very good can show how strong can make case against mr young young man be at ball hated deceased hated on account of difficulty of marriage with miss rayner ainsleigh want money badly might have killed old woman to get fan sell for five thousand pound also by marrying miss rayner who will inherit miss wharf money get rid of mortgage be troubling what be easier for than to pretend to put silk scarf in coat pocket so a to blind who saw do then to lure miss out on to step scrag then must pas fan to tung yu who wanted arrange about money being paid after when tung yu have gone off to yacht mr ainsleigh must slip back into ball room assist in finding body remember say be strolling on beach smoking between hour of eleven twelve wo prove alibi though between ourselves think can through major tidman well said young dryly doe go to prove guilt can prove tung yu in same way said rodger coolly be in cloak room when mr ainsleigh placed scarf in coat must easily have stolen a chinaman be clever thief have then lured miss wharf on to step under pretence of treating about fan suddenly slip scarf round throat before can cry out go down step on to beach where boat be waiting for by now may be on way to employer mandarin lo keong sound feasible admit one moment went on rodgers eagerly quite a strong case can be made out against major tidman did not come to ball lurked in room evening yet came down to see tang yu what about to sell fan of course ca prove be proving anything be simply showing what strong case can be built up out of nothing well then tidman see scarf put in coat by young man whom know be at enmity with deceased take out again get miss wharf to come on to terrace pretext will do a be lover old friend there strangles on step taking fan pass along to chinaman who make for yacht so see if chose can build up case against of three gentleman equally strong why if have mind to entangle young mr burgh in affair must do so tung yu mr burgh major tidman might prove alibi so might mr ainsleigh might do so also have not done so yet if be in danger must quite so said rodgers quickly seeing slip very reluctance to prove alibi for surely someone besides tidman must have seen on beach show be innocent however be business mr young so will go see what evidence can gather so to dr forge went detective feeling very bewildered over case small blame to for matter be surely most perplexing be only in novel that heaven born detective in confidence of author display wonderful cleverness in finding clue where none exist flesh blood worker like rodgers have to puzzle out matter in real life a best must be not at sanguine that must run down assassin of miss wharf on face of rupert ainsleigh appeared to be guilty rodgers doubted guilt for very reason believe one of chinaman did said rodgers a rang forge bell dr forge be within consented at once to see detective when two be in chinese room rodgers unfolded asked forge who knew chinese character what thought dear sir case be plain said forge calmly tung yu gave office lured miss wharf on to step where hwei strangled with scarf stolen by tung yu so a to throw suspicion on mr ainsleigh humph look like said rodgers musingly so believe wild story of major tidman know be true said forge quietly helped to get free a related be partner with mr markham ainsleigh in mine on hwei river went to pekin about concession while be away mr ainsleigh died of dysentery a to fan ca exactly say never knew of private god business be kind of thing lo keong might invent be very superstitious man like napoleon belief in star be concerned in boxer rebellion afterwards joined court party of dowager empress who be now powerful never saw fan in hand might have to do with secret kind of secret ca say unless have to do with lo keong political fortune have many enemy who envy rapid rise enemy probably stole fan to ruin how coolie who gave to major tidman got hold of know be glad to get rid of make think story of alternate day blessing of god kwang ho might be true chinese think a do mr rodgers have own way of settling matter attack on tidman when have fan in canton show clearer than ever that be wanted by lo keong enemy gave to why did want for two reason said forge quietly in first place from what happened to tidman saw that while held fan be in danger then be in same danger objected detective be expected trouble be better able to deal with matter than tidman a understand chinese character got fan in london locked up in yonder cabinet thought be there time when found gone be quite annoyed a major tidman will tell then recollected that have taken back to china to give to lo keong be second reason mr rodgers knew must get concession wanted through lo

couple of chinese brute very clever brute said forge softly rodgers took notice marched away with head in air come what may be determined to punish assassin of miss wharf if be hwei man must have to be caught will go to pekin for said rodgers angrily be not going to be bested by barbarian little be new came to hand before inquest be comparatively tame affair jury inspected body then adjourned to bull head to hear case rodgers set forth what evidence have gained touched a lightly a possible on chinese business called dr forge who deposed to having examined body asserted that miss wharf have be killed between eleven twelve must have be strangled almost instantaneously a have cried out must have be overheard by on terrace evidence caused little sensation when rupert be called however be excited deposed a to scarf have received from olivia said what have done with declared that have be walking on beach smoking only returned to ball room shortly before midnight when body be discovered stated that have spoken to major tidman on beach thus proved alibi clearly enough rest of evidence be not very important chris walker told how have brought tung yu to ball handed in slip of advertisement then rupert be recalled to tell what knew tidman related interview with tung yu described how have seen rupert place tie in overcoat pocket then appeared that whole of case turned on fact that scarf have be removed from pocket one knew miss pewsey said that rupert took evidence be so obviously prejudiced that jury must not believe said lotty dean who be at ball declared that saw miss wharf cross terrace about eleven go towards floral arch on other side of be step be quite alone seemed tranquil be fanning at moment said witness ah said coroner then have fan at time be gone when found body put in miss pewsey be rebuked for speaking out of order interest of case turned on evidence of dalham attendant in cloak room be dissipated looking man gave evidence very unwillingly owing to having left cloak room at burgh request rupert a threatened to do have reported to manager mr dalham have be dismissed loss of situation did not make sweeter towards ainsleigh same must not state on oath that young man have returned to take tie again from pocket have chinaman major tidman returned dalham knew major well a phrased must have spotted at once while gay dress of tung yu must have be equally conspicuous have attempted to meddle with coat did not belong to did not leave room again asked coroner only left once said dalham because mr burgh mr ainsleigh wanted to fight have heard about have nothing to do with case said coroner be in room rest of evening have said so dozen time sir growled badgered man lot of people came for thing late arrival left theirs be at post time except once when left mr burgh with mr ainsleigh never saw major tidman mr ainsleigh chinaman touch cloak coroner called burgh asked if be alone in room at time clarence frankly admitted that be a never saw ainsleigh place tie in coat never knew that possessed tie see how can accuse much more evidence be given led to result finally jury having heard much more of chinese story than rodgers approved of brought in verdict against tung yu hwei must say nothing about a have not be present tung yu wanted fan fan have disappeared while tung yu be also absent wilful murder against tung yu be verdict on hearing evidence on reading have be said in paper general public agreed with verdict under circumstance other must have be given only one person dissented be that ainsleigh who killed dearest sophia said miss pewsey chapter xiii will funeral of miss wharf be attended by many people of course friend came with usual wreath of flower owing to tragic circumstance of death many stranger be present be buried in family vault with much ceremony then mourner departed talking of crime be general opinion that tung yu who have not yet be heard of be responsible for death that have sailed away in stormy petrel rodgers having returned to town after inquest be making inquiry about yacht when discovered hoped to learn particular a to flight of tung yu many day rupert have not seen olivia although have called at ivy lodge miss pewsey who took charge of everything in usual meddlesome way must not allow to be admitted olivia did not even know of visit remained in room mourned death of aunt miss wharf have certainly be good friend to must not be said to have be kindly aunt same olivia conscience pricked for having secretly married rupert a now thought must have told aunt marriage be decided upon in hurry when girl have be more than usually piqued by insulting speech of miss wharf however old woman be dead olivia little a loved wept for tragic end miss rayner during mourning read evidence given at inquest wondered why have not be called a witness if only to prove that have given scarf to rupert thought extraordinary that tung yu must have used tie to strangle miss wharf must not think how came into possession after thought concluded that have taken scarf from rupert pocket so a to implicate in crime have bribed dalham attendant who certainly be not above being bribed to say nothing about matter if be case dalham must probably blackmail tung yu for rest of life a be just kind of rascal to make money in shady way then occurred to olivia that a tung yu have sailed for china presumably in yacht dalham must not be able to make milch cow of however whether tung yu be guilty not cared little rupert be safe in spite of evidence of scarf so long a escaped being arrested girl felt perfectly happy after funeral olivia came downstairs again found miss pewsey looking after thing a usual little old maid be most polite seemed a though be now anxious to make much of olivia

might be learned from burgh relative to murder to chinaman knew hwei knew something of fan so rupert resolved to be on reasonably friendly term with buccaneer in hope of learning something likely to be of use if mr burgh have lantern there be reason why ainsleigh must not use light to illuminate somewhat dark path therefore when rupert did speak be to express wish to be friendly yet strange to say a soon a showed disposition to come forward clarence wary showed equal disposition to retire ho said buccaneer guess want help must be so friendly at once be friendly by own desire said ainsleigh

light high low in hope of discovering crouching form time petley waited trembling at door rain fell softly there be gentle wind swinging heavy bough of pine so that murmurous sound echoed through cloister like breaking of league long wave on pebbly beach for at least hour rupert searched must see one must not even find impression of foot sodden a be ground after looking everywhere within cloister in abbey brushed past old butler walked down avenue here also be at fault a must see one gate be closed there be light in small house near at hand ainsleigh knocked at door shortly old payne
