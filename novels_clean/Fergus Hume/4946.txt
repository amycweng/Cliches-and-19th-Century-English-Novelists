white wet looking wash impelled by runner must roll past with roaring grinding of wheel at interval on side of main drive black chasm appeared archie informed companion be drive put in to test wash a smaller gallery continued branching off vandeloup thought whole mine resembled nothing so much a herring bone being accustomed to darkness knowing inch of way manager moved forward rapidly sometimes vandeloup lagged so far behind must see of guide be candle carried shining like pale yellow star in pitchy darkness at last mcintosh went into one of side gallery going up iron ladder fixed to side of

trouble often often did wish that pierre must break neck that mine must fall in crush to death nothing of sort happened pierre continued to vex eye to follow about with dog like fidelity arose not from love of young man from fact that found stranger in strange land vandeloup be only person knew with millstone round neck young frenchman often despaired of being able to get on in australia meanwhile surrendered to situation with kind of cynical resignation looked hopefully forward to time when kind providence must rid of unpleasant friend feeling of madame midas towards vandeloup be curious have be very impressionable girl ill fated union with villiers have not quite succeeded in deadening feeling though have doubtless gone good way towards doing so being of appreciative nature liked to hear vandeloup talk of brilliant life in paris vienna london other famous city to be merely name for young man have certainly seen great deal of life added to skill a talker be considerable so that frequently held madame selina mcintosh spell bound by fairy like description eloquent conversation of course only talked of most general subject to mr villiers never by chance let slip that

connected with pactolus claim madame found that must leave everything to with perfect safety must rely on matter of business being well promptly attended to be too clever woman to let manage thing even know how much trusted vandeloup knew that whatever did calm dark eye be on that least slip neglect on part must bring madame midas to side with quiet voice inflexible will to put right again

queer smile on lip then turned on heel walked home humming song chapter viii madame midas strike aesop knew human nature very well when wrote fable of old man as who tried to please everybody ended up by pleasing nobody bearing in mind madame midas determined to please take one advice own with regard to vandeloup knew if dismissed from mine must give colour to husband vile insinuation so thought wisest plan must be to take notice of meeting with let thing remain a be turned out to be best thing must have done for though villiers went about ballarat accusing of being young frenchman mistress everyone be too well aware of existing circumstance to believe what said knew that have squandered wife fortune that have left in disgust at profligacy so declined to believe accusation against woman who have proved true steel in withstanding bad fortune so mr villiers endeavour to ruin wife only recoiled on own head for ballarat folk argued rightly that did be not place to cast first stone at seeing that unsatisfactory position be now in be mainly own work villiers therefore gained nothing by attempt to blacken wife character except contempt of everyone even few friend have gained turned back on until one must associate with sliver who did so in order to gain own end company have quarrelled over unsuccessful result of villiers visit to pactolus sliver a senior partner assisted by billy called villiers name must lay tongue to abuse villiers accepted in silence not even having spirit to resent though be outwardly sulky quiet yet within cherished deep hatred against wife for

tear away from place where resided have called on kitty father rev mark marchurst who lived at top of black hill near ballarat did not like mr marchurst grave quiet man who be pastor of particular sect calling very modestly 'the elect ' be hardly kind of individual to attract brilliant young fellow like vandeloup wonder be that ever have such charming daughter kitty have fallen deeply in love with vandeloup so a told loved in return thought that day must get married nothing be farther from m vandeloup thought than marriage even with kitty for knew how foolish must be for to marry before making position ' want wife to drag back ' said to one day when kitty have hinted at matrimony 'when be wealthy will be time enough to think of marriage will be long before be rich can wait for bebe

selina also contributed mite of wisdom in form of proverb ' stitch in time save nine ' intimating thereby mr villiers must be locked up never let out again in case tried same game on with next big nugget found madame thought for few moment seeing that be unanimous agreed to proposal that villiers must be prosecuted with stipulation however that must be first written to asked to give up nugget if did promised to leave district further step must be taken if declined to do so wife must prosecute with uttermost rigour of law then madame dismissed a be anxious to get little sleep vandeloup went to office to write letter accompanied by mcintosh who wanted to assist in composition meanwhile there be individual in ballarat who be much interested in villiers kind hearted gentleman be none other than sliver villiers be accustomed to come sit in office morning talk to about thing in general pactolus claim in particular on morning however did not arrive sliver be much annoyed thereat determined to give villiers piece of mind when did see went about business at 'the corner ' bought share sold others swindled a many people a be able then came back to office waited in afternoon for friend who however did not come sliver be just going out to seek when door of office be violently flung open tall raw boned female entered in very excited manner dressed in dusty black gown with crape bonnet placed askew on rough hair lady banged on sliver table huge umbrella demanded where villiers be ' know snapped sliver viciously 'how devil must ' ' swear at wooden legged little monster ' cried virago with bang of umbrella raised cloud of dust that nearly made sliver sneeze head off 'he ai be home night have be leading into bad habit cork armed libertine ' 'have be home night eh ' said sliver sitting up quickly while billy who have be considerably alarmed at gaunt female retired to fireplace tried to conceal up chimney ask who be ' 'you may ' said angry lady folding arm holding umbrella in such awkward manner that nearly poked sliver remaining eye out 'well who be ' snapped sliver crossly after waiting reasonable time for answer getting none `` m landlady ' retorted other with defiant snort cheedle be name care who know ' be not pretty name ' snarled sliver prodding ground with wooden leg a always did when angry be what do mean by banging into office like insane giraffe ' in allusion to mr cheedle height 'oh go on go on ' said that lady defiantly `` ve heard before be used to here sit until tell where lodger be suiting action to word mr cheedle sat down in chair with bang billy gave screech of alarm said 'pickles 'pickles little bag of bone cried mr cheedle who thought that word have proceeded from sliver call pickle be used to be lonely woman since cheedle went to cemetery be always being insulted oh nerve be shattered under such treatment ' last because saw whisky bottle on table thought might get sliver took hint filling glass with whisky water passed to mr cheedle with many protestation that never touched spirit drank to last drop 'be villiers always in habit of coming home ' asked 'always replied mr cheedle 'he bin with eighteen month never stopped out one night if have ' grimly `` d have known reason of rampagin '' betrange ' said sliver thoughtfully fixing mr cheedle with one eye did see last ' 'about three o'clock yesterday ' said mr cheedle looking sadly at hole in one of cotton glove conduct be most extraordinary came home at unusual hour changed linen clothes for dark suit after have eaten something put on hat walked off with stick under arm 'and have never seen since ' 'not blessed sight of ' replied mr cheedle 'you think harm come to sir not a care much for drunken wretch still be lodger owes rent so know what might be off to

putting empty glass on table home at once will speak to perhaps ' with bashful glance 'you must mind seeing up street short way a be alone unprotected ' retorted sliver ungraciously 'there be plenty of light be big enough to look after ' at mr cheedle snorted loudly like war horse flounced out of office in rage after informing sliver in loud voice that be selfish cork eyed little viper from confusion of word will easily be seen that whisky have taken effect on good lady when have gone sliver locked up office sallied forth to find missing villiers though went over town to gentleman favourite haunt mostly bar yet must see nothing of on making inquiry heard that have not be seen in ballarat day be so contrary to villiers general habit that sliver became suspicious a walked home thinking over subject came to conclusion there be something up 'if said sliver pausing on pavement addressing street lamp 'he doe turn up to morrow will have look for again if do will tell police must wonder went on sliver musingly must wonder if called on madame midas ' chapter xv sliver in search of evidence sliver be puzzled over villiers disappearance so determined to go in search of evidence against madame midas though for what reason wanted evidence against one perhaps billy knew then sliver always be enigma regarding reason for doing thing even sphinx must have found difficult riddle to solve reason have for turning detective be simply soon became known that madame midas have be robbed by husband of famous nugget great be indignation of everyone against mr villiers gentleman must have fared very badly if have made appearance for reason did not venture forth in fact have completely disappeared where be one knew last person who saw be barty jarper who left at corner of lydiard sturt street when mr villiers have announced intention of going home mr cheedle however asserted positively that have never set eye on since time stated to sliver a be now nearly two week since have disappeared thing be beginning to look serious generally received explanation be that have bolted with nugget a must hardly dispose of large mass of gold without suspicion a police in ballarat melbourne have made inquiry proved futile theory began to lose ground be at period that sliver asserted coming forward hinted in ambiguous sort of way that villiers have met with foul play that people have reason for wishing to get rid of be clearly insinuation against madame midas everyone refused to believe impossible story so sliver determined to make good word went in search of evidence wopples family having left ballarat sliver be unable to see mr theodore wopples who have be in villiers company on night of disappearance mr barty jarper however have not yet departed so sliver waylaid asked in casual way to drop into office have drink with view of finding out from event of night barty be on way to lawn tennis party be arrayed in flannel suit of many colour with small white face nearly hidden under large straw hat being of social turn of mind did not refuse sliver invitation walked into dusty office assisted liberally to whisky 'here be fun old cock said in free easy manner raising glass to lip shadow never be le sliver hoped devoutly that shadow never must be le a must involve loss of several other limb must ill spare so honoured mr jarper toast with rasping little laugh prepared to talk very kind of to come talk to old chap like ' said sliver in a amiable tone a must command be not much be gay young fellow mr jarper acknowledged modestly that be gay that owed certain duty to society have to be mildly social 'and so handsome ' croaked sliver winking with one eye at billy who sat on table be there ai billy ' billy however did not agree to merely observed 'pickles ' in disbelieving manner mr jarper felt rather overcome by praise blushed in modest way felt that must not return compliment with degree of truth a sliver be not handsome be all there however decided that sliver be unusually discerning person worthy to talk to so prepared to make agreeable sliver who have thus gained goodwill of young man by flattery plunged into subject of villiers disappearance ' wonder what be become of villiers said artfully pushing whisky bottle toward barty `` m sure know said barty in languid used up sort of voice pouring out more whisky have seen since last monday week did leave on night ' asked sliver 'at corner of sturt lydiard street 'early in morning suppose ' 'yes pretty early about two o'clock think 'and never saw after ' 'not sight of ' replied barty 'but say why thusness ' `` ll tell after have answered question retorted sliver rudely 'but be not asking out of curiosity business ' barty thought that sliver be very peculiar determined to humour to take leave a early a possible 'well go on ' said drinking whisky `` ll answer ' else be with villiers on night ' asked sliver in magisterial kind of manner ' french fellow called vandeloup ' echoed sliver in surprise indeed what devil be doing ' 'enjoying ' replied barty coolly came into theatre villiers introduced to then mr wopples asked to supper ' went of course ' old chap what do take for ' from barty with knowing wink 'what time did vandeloup leave ' asked sliver not paying attention to barty pantomime 'about twenty minute to twelve ' suppose be because have to drive out to pactolus ' 'not fool dear boy stayed night in town ' ejaculated sliver in excited manner drumming on table with finger 'where did stay ' 'at wattle tree hotel sliver mentally made note of determined to go there find out at what time vandeloup have come home on night in question for suspicious old man have now got into head that vandeloup be in way responsible for villiers disappearance 'where did villiers say be going when left ' asked betraight home ' 'humph well did go home at ' echoed barty in astonishment 'then what be become of men disappear in mysterious way without reason 'ah there be reason replied sliver bending across table clawing at paper thereon with lean finger of one hand 'why what do think be reason faltered barty letting eye glass drop out of eye edging chair further away from terrible old man hissed other through thin lip be murdered ' 'lord ejaculated barty jumping up from chair in alarm be going too far old chap `` m going further ' retorted sliver rising from chair stumping up down room `` m going to find out who did then will grind to powder will twist neck off curse ' 'be woman asked barty who now began to think of making retreat for sliver with one eye blazing cork arm swinging rapidly to fro be not pleasant object to contemplate unguarded remark recalled sliver to 'that be what want to find out replied sulkily going back to chair 'have more whisky thanks answered barty going to door `` m late a be for engagement ta ta old chap hope will drop on be looking for be quite wrong villiers have bolted with nugget be fact sir with airy wave of hand barty went out

barty picturesque garb `` ve found out want from will track down put in gaol hang hang till be a dead a door nail ' having given vent to pleasant sentiment sliver put on hat taking stick walked out of office not before billy saw intention have climbed up to accustomed place on old man shoulder so sliver stumped along street with cockatoo on shoulder looking like depraved robinson crusoe took way to wattle tree hotel argued sliver to a pegged bravely along villiers wanted to get rid of nugget 'd have come to for knew 'd keep quiet tell tale well did come to there be one else must go to have be

jackadandy ' cried sliver viciously suddenly stopping shaking stick at imaginary vandeloup `` ve got under thumb will crush life out of of also if can ' with amiable resolution sliver resumed way sliver argument be plausible there be plenty of flaw in however did not stop to consider so carried away be by anger against madame midas stumped along doggedly revolving whole affair in mind by time arrived at wattle tree hotel have firmly persuaded that villiers be dead vandeloup have committed crime at instigation of mr villiers found miss twexby seated in bar with decidedly cross face argued ill for anyone who held converse with day a sliver be quite a crabbed a be moreover feared god man much le woman tackled at once 'where be father ' asked abruptly leaning on stick looking intently at fair martha vinegary countenance snapped that damsel jerking head in direction of parlour 'what do want ' very disdainfully ' little civility in first place retorted sliver rudely sitting down on bench ran along wall thereby causing wooden leg to stick straight out being perceived by billy descended from old man shoulder turned leg into perch where sat swore at martha 'you wicked old wretch said miss twexby viciously nose getting redder with suppressed excitement along with take irreligious parrot with will wake par ' wo thank for doing so ' replied sliver coolly `` ve called to see about new share just on market if treat with more respect will go will be out of good thing ' now miss twexby knew that sliver be in habit of doing business with parent moreover be power in share market so did not deem diplomatic to go too far bottling up wrath for future occasion when loss must be involved graciously asked sliver what 'd be pleased to have 'whisky said sliver curtly leaning chin on stick following movement with one eye ' say 'well asked miss twexby coming from behind bar with glass bottle of whisky 'what do say ' be that good looking frenchman ' asked sliver pouring out

button several pin on floor a trace of visit chapter xvii best of friend must part union be strength if dr gollipeck have only met sliver revealed true opinion of vandeloup to doubt that clever young man must have found somewhat embarrassed a great deal of man past history can be found out by simple plan of putting two two together fortunately however for gaston two gentleman never met gollipeck came to conclusion that must see nothing to blame in vandeloup conduct though certainly mistrusted determined mentally to keep eye on movement what led to be suspicious be curious resemblance appearance of young man have to that of criminal described in 'les empoisonneurs d'aujourd'hui ' a having be transported to new caledonia for crime of poisoning mistress everything however be vague uncertain so dr gollipeck when arrived home came to above named conclusion that must watch vandeloup then dismissing from mind went to work on favourite subject meanwhile m vandeloup slept sleep of

celebrate success of tour will have theatre in melbourne will make favourite house of city see if ' seemed therefore a though kitty have found vocation must develop into operatic star fate intervened miss marchurst retired from stage have adorned so much be due to madame midas who driving down collins street one day saw kitty at corner walking with fanny wopples immediately stopped carriage alighting therefrom went straight up to girl who turning seeing for first time grew deadly pale dear ' said madame gravely have be looking for vainly for year have found at last kitty breast be full

drove along mr villiers delicately refrained from asking kitty question about flight seeing that stranger be present determined to find out about when got alone down at st kilda kitty on part be thinking how to baffle madame inquiry knew must be questioned closely by resolved not to tell more than must help a curiously enough considering how have treated wished to shield vandeloup still cherished tender feeling for man loved have vandeloup asked to go back live with must no doubt have consented fact be girl nature be becoming slightly demoralised kitty who sat looking at madame midas now though face be a pretty eye a pure a ever be not same innocent kitty have visited pactolus for have eaten of tree of knowledge be already cultured in worldly wisdom madame of course believed that kitty have gone from ballarat straight on to stage never thought for moment for whole year have be vandeloup mistress so when kitty found out a very soon did took cue at once asserted positively to madame that have be on stage for eighteen month how be ' asked madame who believed fully 'that must not find ' 'because be up country time replied kitty quickly 'and of course did not act under real name 'you must not like to go back to father suppose ' suggested madame kitty made gesture of dissent 'no ' answered determinedly ' be tired of father religion be on stage now mean to stick to ' 'kitty kitty ' said madame sadly little know temptation 'oh yes do ' interrupted kitty impatiently `` ve be nearly two year on stage have not seen great wickedness besides be always with mr wopples 'then still mean to be actress asked madame 'yes replied kitty in firm voice went back to father 'd go mad leading that dull life 'but why not stay with dear ' said mr villiers looking at ' be lonely woman a know if come to will treat a daughter how good be ' cried girl in revulsion of feeling falling on friend neck 'but indeed can not leave stage be too fond of ' madame sighed gave up argument for time then showed two girl over house after have dinner with sent back to town in carriage with strict injunction to kitty to come down next day bring mr wopples with when two girl reached hotel where family be staying fanny gave father glowing account of opulence of madame midas mr wopples be greatly interested in whole affair be grave however when kitty spoke to privately of what madame have said to asked if must not like to accept mr villiers offer kitty however said must remain on stage a wopples be to see madame midas next day made promise must say nothing about having found on street of living with lover wopples who thoroughly understood girl desire to hide shame from friend agreed to so kitty went to bed confident that have saved vandeloup name from being dragged into affair wopples saw madame next day long talk ensued ended in kitty agreeing to stay six month with mr villiers then if still wished to continue on stage be to go to mr wopples on other hand in consideration of wopples losing service of kitty madame promised that next year must give sufficient money to start theatre in melbourne so parted mutually satisfied kitty made present to family who be very sorry to part with then took up abode with mr villiers a kind of adopted daughter be quite prepared to play part in comedy of fashion so madame midas have be near truth yet never discovered sent letter to vandeloup asking to come to dinner meet old friend little thinking how old intimate friend kitty be to young man be a mr wopples must have said highly dramatic situation ala that confiding nature of madame midas must thus have be betrayed not only by vandeloup by kitty very girl whom out of womanly compassion took to breast yet world talk about inherent goodness of human nature chapter viii m vandeloup be surprised owing to quiet life kitty have led since came to melbourne fact that appearance on stage have taken place in country felt quite safe when making appearance

known life q have anyone who must wish to injure not that knew of be favourite with everyone q what time did come home from ball be at about half past two think went straight to mr villiers room q

filled with dark fluid blood stomach be somewhat congested contained little partially digested food intestine here there be congested throughout body blood be dark fluid q what then in opinion be cause of death in opinion death resulted from serous effusion on brain commonly known a serous apoplexy q then found appearance in stomach elsewhere must lead to believe poison have be taken none q from post mortem examination must say death of deceased be not due to narcotic poison post mortem appearance of body be quite consistent with of poisoning by certain poison there be reason to suppose that poison have be administered in case a of course go by what see presence of poison especially vegetable poison can only be detected by chemical analysis q did analyse content of stomach chemically no be not duty to do so handed over stomach to police seeing that there be suspicion of poison thence will go to government analyst q be stated that deceased have convulsion before died be not symptom of narcotic poisoning in case yes not commonly aconite for instance always produce convulsion in animal seldom in man q how do account for congested condition of lung believe serous effusion caused death by suspended respiration q be there odour perceptible none whatsoever inquest be then adjourned till next day there be great excitement over affair if kitty marchurst statement be true deceased must have died from administration of poison on other hand dr chinston asserted positively that there be trace of poison that deceased have clearly died from apoplexy public opinion be very much divided asserting that kitty story be true while others said have got idea from 'the hidden hand only told in order to make notorious there be plenty of letter written to paper on subject offering new solution of difficulty fact remained same that kitty said deceased have be poisoned doctor that have died of apoplexy calton be considerably puzzled over matter of course there be doubt that man who committed murder have intended to poison madame midas fact that selina stayed night with have resulted in wrong person being killed madame midas told calton whole story of life asserted positively that if poison be meant for villiers must have administered be very well question then arose be villiers alive police be once more set to work once more search resulted in nothing altogether whole affair be wrapped in mystery a must not even be told if murder have be committed if deceased have died from natural cause only chance of finding out truth must be to have stomach analysed cause of death ascertained once be done matter must be gone on with dropped according to report of analyst if said be apoplexy kitty story must necessarily have to be discredited a invention if on other hand trace of poison be found search must have to be made for murderer matter be at deadlock everyone waited impatiently for report of analyst suddenly however new interest be given to case by assertion that ballarat doctor called gollipeck who be noted toxicologist have come down to melbourne to assist at analysis of stomach knew something must throw light on mysterious death vandeloup saw paragraph gave information disturbed very much 'curse book of prevol ' said to a threw down paper will put on right track then well ' observed m vandeloup sententiously 'they say danger sharpens man wit be lucky for if doe ' chapter xiii diamond cut diamond m vandeloup room in clarendon street east melbourne be very luxuriously artistically furnished in perfect accordance with taste of owner a satiated despot be depicted by moralist a miserable amid splendour so m gaston vandeloup though not exactly miserable be very ill at ease inquest have be adjourned until government analyst assisted by dr gollipeck have examined stomach according to paragraph in evening paper strange statement implicating various people must be made next day be that made vandeloup so uneasy for knew that dr gollipeck must trace resemblance between death of selina sprotts in melbourne adele blondet in paris then question must arise how poison used in one case came to be used in other if question arose must be over with for must not dare to face examination a discretion be better part of valour m vandeloup decided to leave country with usual foresight have guessed that dr gollipeck must be mixed up in affair so have drawn money out of security in be invested sent most of to america to new york bank reserving only certain sum for travelling purpose be going to leave melbourne next morning by express train for

to club show in order to obviate suspicion a to going away did not intend to send out ppc card a be modest young man wanted to slip unostentatiously out of country besides there be nothing like precaution a least intimation of approaching departure must certainly put dr gollipeck on alert cause trouble gas be lighted there be bright glare through room everything be in confusion with m vandeloup seated in centre like marius amid ruin of carthage while thus engaged there came ring at outer door shortly afterwards gaston landlady entered room with card ' gentleman want to see sir '

be something apparently went wrong in inside rasping noise came out of mouth clever young man said affectionately to gaston a unwound long crimson woollen scarf from throat thereby caused button to fly off waistcoat with exertion dr gollipeck however being used to little eccentricity of toilet pinned waistcoat together then sitting down spread red bandanna handkerchief over knee stared steadily at vandeloup who have put on loose velvet smoking coat with cigarette in mouth be leaning against mantelpiece be raining outside pleasant patter of raindrop be quite audible in stillness of room while

replied gaston promptly 'and then queried doctor gaston shrugged shoulder 'depends upon circumstance answered lazily 'that be mistake retorted gollipeck leaning forward depends upon ' vandeloup smiled that case circumstance a represented by will permit to choose own destination 'depends entirely upon being guided by circumstance a represented by ' retorted doctor grimly 'pshaw said frenchman coolly have done with allegory come to common sense what do want ' want octave braulard ' said gollipeck rising to foot vandeloup quite expected be too clever to waste time in denying identity stand before ' answered curtly 'what then 'you acknowledge then that be octave braulard transported to new caledonia for murder of adele blondet ' said doctor tapping table with one hand yes ' answered vandeloup crossing to door locking 'to others ' 'why do lock door asked gollipeck gruffly want private affair over melbourne ' retorted gaston smoothly returning to position in front of fireplace afraid ' something again went wrong with dr gollipeck inside grated out hard ironical laugh look afraid ' asked spreading out hand vandeloup stooped down to portmanteau lying open at foot picked up revolver pointed straight at gollipeck 'you make excellent target observed quickly putting finger on trigger dr gollipeck sat down arranged handkerchief once more over knee havery likely answered coolly 'but target wo practise on ' 'why not ' asked vandeloup still keeping finger on trigger 'because pistol shot must alarm house said gollipeck serenely 'and if be found dead must be arrested for murder if be

braulard with vandeloup a have proof to show that be same with regard to death of mademoiselle sprotts died a have said though maker of poison did not administer ' 'who did then asked gollipeck who be quite prepared for denial vandeloup smoothed moustache looked at doctor with keen glance marchurst ' said coolly rain be beating wildly against window someone in room below be playing eternal waltz 'one summer night in munich while vandeloup leaning back in chair stared at dr gollipeck who looked at disbelievingly be not true ' said harshly 'what reason have to poison woman sprotts ' 'none at

mocking tone 'bah be le moral than thought be ' doctor did not take notice of sneer putting hand in pocket faced round to young man give evidence to morrow ' said quietly looking keenly at young man prove conclusively woman be poisoned to do must refer to case of adele blondet then that implicates ' 'pardon ' observed vandeloup coolly removing ash from velvet coat implicates octave braulard who

glass bottle on top committed crime a kitty marchurst say be done if have done there must be trace assure mademoiselle marchurst none other be guilty woman be in room madame midas asleep in bed what

octave braulard 'why must ' said doctor harshly 'for many admirable reason replied vandeloup smoothly 'in first place a braulard friend can prove case against mademoiselle marchurst quite a well a if appeared a braulard in next place have evidence to prove be identical with murderer of adele blondet lastly suppose did prove what satisfaction must be to to send back to french prison have suffered enough for crime now be rich respectable why must drag back to depth again read le miserables of great hugo before answer friend ' bead book long ago retorted gollipeck gruffly more moved by argument

be ready to stand test of trial surely that ought to content a be will stay in melbourne long enough to give satisfaction of hanging woman for murder then will go to america dr gollipeck be disgusted at smooth brutality of man moved hastily to door not have glass of wine ' asked vandeloup stopping 'wine with ' said doctor harshly looking up down 'no must choke hurried away ' wish must ' observed m vandeloup pleasantly a reentered room 'whew devil of doctor what dangerous fool have got better of at event said lighting cigarette have saved vandeloup from suffering for crime of braulard chapter xiv circumstantial evidence there be doubt sprotts poisoning case be sensation of day in melbourne paper be full of even went so far a to give plan of house with dotted line thereon to show how crime be committed be extremely amusing for a matter of fact evidence a yet have not shown reasonable ground for supposing foul play have taken place one paper indeed said that far too much be assumed in case that report of government analyst must be waited for before such emphatic opinion be given by press regarding mode of death be use trying to reason with public have got into sage head that crime have be committed demanded evidence so a press have real evidence to give made up public in private conversation amplified evidence until constructed complete criminal case 'pshaw said rolleston when read sensational report spite of quidnunc mountain will only produce mouse after be wrong for now rumour be started that government analyst dr gollipeck have found poison in stomach that moreover real criminal must be soon discovered public opinion be much divided a to who criminal be having heard story of madame marriage said be husband others insisted kitty marchurst be culprit be trying to shield behind wild story of hand coming from behind curtain while others be in favour of suicide at event on morning when inquest be resumed evidence be to be given of analysis of stomach court be crowded dead silence pervaded place when government analyst stood up to give evidence madame midas be present with kitty seated beside latter looking pale ill kilsip with gratified smile on face seemed a though have got clue to whole mystery be seated next to calton vandeloup faultlessly dressed a cool calm a possible be also in court dr gollipeck a awaited turn to give evidence must not help admiring marvellous nerve courage of young man government analyst being called be sworn in usual way deposed that stomach of deceased have be sent to to be analysed have used usual test found presence of alkaloid of hemlock known under name of conia in opinion death of deceased be caused by administration of extract of hemlock sensation in court q then in opinion deceased have be poisoned yes have not least doubt on subject detected conia very soon after test be applied there be great excitement when evidence be concluded a gave quite new interest to case question a to cause of death be now set at rest deceased have be murdered so burning anxiety of one be to know who have committed crime sort of opinion be given murmur of voice ceased when dr gollipeck stood up to give evidence deposed that be medical practitioner practising at ballarat have seen report of case in paper have come down to melbourne a thought must throw certain light on affair for instance where poison be procured sensation about three year ago crime have be committed in paris caused great sensation at time case being peculiar one be reported in medical work by monsieur prevol lebrun have obtained from france two year back fact of case be shortly actress called adele blondet died from effect of poison administered to by octave braulard who be lover deceased have also lover called kestrike who be supposed to be implicated in crime have escaped woman in case have be poisoned by extract of hemlock same poison used a in case of selina sprotts be similarity of symptom made suspicious of sudden death braulard be sent out to new caledonia for murder while in paris have be medical student with two other gentleman one of whom be monsieur prevol who have reported case other be at present in court be called m gaston vandeloup sensation in court everyone eye being fixed on vandeloup who be calm unmoved m vandeloup have manufactured poison used in case with regard to how be administered to deceased must leave evidence to m vandeloup when gollipeck left witness box there be dead silence a everyone be too much excited at strange story to make comment thereon madame midas looked with astonishment on vandeloup a name be called out moved gracefully to witness box while kitty face grew paler even than be before did not know what vandeloup be going to say great dread seized with dry lip clenched hand sat staring at a if paralysed kilsip stole look at then rubbed hand together while calton sat absolutely still scribbling figure on notepaper m gaston vandeloup being sworn deposed be native of france of flemish descent a must be seen from name have known braulard intimately also knew prevol have be eighteen month in australia for time have be clerk to mr villiers at ballarat be fond of chemistry yes have made several experiment with poison while up at ballarat with dr gollipeck who be great toxicologist have seen hemlock in garden of hotel keeper at ballarat called twexby have made extract therefrom only did by way of experiment have put bottle containing poison in desk forgetting about next time saw that bottle be in possession of miss kitty marchurst sensation in court have threatened to poison again saw bottle in possession on night of murder be at house of m meddlechip report have be circulated that witness be going to marry mr villiers miss marchurst asked if be true have denied miss marchurst have said that sooner than witness must marry mr villiers must poison next morning heard that selina sprotts be dead kitty marchurst heard evidence in dumb horror now knew that after ruining life man wanted to die felon death arose to foot stretched out hand in protest against before must speak word place seemed to whirl round fell down in dead faint event caused great excitement in court many began to assert positively that must be guilty else why did faint kitty be taken out of court examination be proceeded with while madame midas sat pale horror struck at revelation be now being made coroner now proceeded to cross examine vandeloup q say put bottle containing poison into desk how did miss marchurst obtain because lived with for time have access to private paper q be wife mistress sensation in court q why did leave have difference of opinion about question of marriage so left q wanted to make reparation in other word to marry yes q refused yes q be on occasion produced poison first yes told have taken from desk must poison if did not marry changed mind however went away q did know what became of yes heard went on stage with m wopples q did take poison with yes q how do know took poison with because next time saw be still in possession q be at mr meddlechip ball yes q on night of commission of crime yes q what made take to ball rather difficult question to answer heard rumour be to marry mr villiers even though denied declined to believe then produced poison said must take q where did conversation take place in conservatory q what did do when threatened to take poison tried to take from q did succeed threw out of door q then when left mr meddlechip house to come home have poison with think so q did pick bottle up again after threw out because went back to ball room with then came out to look for bottle be gone q have never seen since must have be picked up by someone who be ignorant of content q by own showing m vandeloup miss marchurst have poison with when left mr meddlechip house how then must commit crime told still have poison left that divided content of bottle have taken from desk that still have enough left at home to poison mr villiers q did say must poison mr villiers yes sooner than see married to sensation q do believe went away from with deliberate intention of committing crime do m vandeloup then left box amid great excitement kilsip be again examined deposed that have searched miss marchurst room found bottle of extract of hemlock content of bottle have be analysed be found identical with conia discovered in stomach of deceased q say bottle be half empty rather more than three quarter empty q miss marchurst told m vandeloup have poured content of one bottle into other must not account for bottle being three quarter empty possibly if first bottle be full be probable must halve poison exactly so if have be untouched ought to be half full q then think of content of bottle be used be opinion vandeloup be recalled deposed that bottle kitty took from desk be quite full moreover when other bottle have be found in room be shown to declared that be a nearly a possible same size a missing bottle so inference drawn from be that bottle produced being three quarter empty of poison have be used question now arose that a guilt of miss marchurst seemed so certain how be that selina sprotts be poisoned instead of mistress be settled by madame midas who being recalled deposed that kitty did not know selina slept with on night curtain being drawn must not possibly tell two people be in bed be evidence obtainable coroner now proceeded to sum up case said be most remarkable one must be necessary for jury to consider very gravely evidence laid before in order to arrive at proper conclusion before giving verdict in first place have be clearly proved by government analyst that deceased have died from effect of conia be a have be told alkaloid of hemlock well known hedge plant grows abundantly in most part of great britain according to evidence of dr chinston deceased have died from serous apoplexy from post mortem appearance be case must remember that be almost impossible to detect certain vegetable poison such a aconite atropia without minute chemical analysis must remember case startled year ago in poisoner have poisoned brother in law by mean of aconite taxed ingenuity cleverness of expert to find trace of poison in stomach of deceased in case however thanks to dr gollipeck who have seen similarity of symptom between post mortem appearance of stomach of adele blondet present case usual test for conia be applied a have be told by government analyst result be conia be found so must be quite certain that deceased have died of poison that poison being conia next thing for to consider be how poison be administered according to evidence of miss unknown person have be standing outside window poured poison into glass on table mr villiers have stated that window be open night from position of table near nothing must be easier than for anyone to introduce poison into glass a asserted by miss marchurst on other hand evidence of detective kilsip went to show that mark be visible a to anyone having be at window thing rendered miss marchurst story doubtful be resemblance have to drama in have frequently acted called hidden hand ' in last act of drama poison be administered to one of character in precisely same manner though of course such thing might happen in real life still in case be highly suspicious circumstance that woman like miss marchurst who have frequently acted in drama must see same thing actually occur off stage rejecting then a improbable story of hidden hand seeing that evidence be strongly against next thing be to look into miss marchurst past life see if have motive for committing crime before doing so however must point out to that miss marchurst be only person in room when crime be committed window in own room one of window in mr villiers room be locked open window have table in front of so that anyone entering must very probably knock over thus awaken sleeper on other hand one must have entered in at door because must not have have time to escape before crime be discovered so be clearly shown that miss marchurst must have be alone in room when crime be committed now to look into past life be certainly not very creditable one m vandeloup have sworn that have be mistress for over year have taken poison manufactured by out of private desk regarding m vandeloup motif in preparing poison must say nothing of course probably did by way of experiment to find out if colonial grown hemlock possessed same poisonous quality a did in old world be careless thing of however to leave in desk where must be obtained for such dangerous matter must be kept under lock key to go back however to miss marchurst have be proved by m vandeloup that be mistress that quarrelled produced poison said must kill m vandeloup persuaded to abandon idea subsequently left taking poison with then went on stage subsequently left in order to live with mr villiers a companion time still have poison in order to prevent losing put half of into bottle now looked very suspicious a if have not intended to use certainly must never have taken such trouble over preserving meet m vandeloup at ball hearing that be going to marry mr villiers loses head completely threatens to poison m vandeloup try to wrench poison from whereupon fling into garden bottle have disappeared presumption be that be picked up if jury have idea that poison be administered from lost bottle might a well dismiss from mind a be absurd to suppose improbable thing must happen in first place one m vandeloup miss marchurst knew what content be in second place what motive must anyone who picked up have in poisoning mr villiers why must adopt extraordinary way of doing a miss marchurst asserted did on other hand miss marchurst tell m vandeloup that still have poison left that will kill mr villiers sooner than see married to declares to m vandeloup that will kill leaf house to go home with apparently intention of doing so come home filled with furious rage of jealous woman enters mr villiers room here jury will recall evidence of mr villiers who said miss marchurst did not know that deceased be sleeping with so when miss marchurst entered room naturally thought that mr villiers be by herself must a matter of course refrain from drawing curtain looking into bed in case must awaken proposed victim there be glass with drink on table be alone with mr villiers heart filled with jealous rage against woman think be rival own room be few step away what then be easier for than to go to own room obtain poison put into glass jury will remember in evidence of mr kilsip bottle be three quarter empty argued of have be used evidence against miss marchurst be purely circumstantial for if committed crime human eye beheld doing so presumption of having done so in order to get rid of successful rival be very strong weight of evidence be dead against jury must therefore deliver verdict in accordance with fact laid before jury retired court be very much excited everyone be quite certain that kitty be guilty there be strong feeling against m vandeloup a having be in measure cause though indirectly of crime that young gentleman in accordance with usual foresight have left court gone straight home a have wish to face crowd of sullen face perhaps worse madame midas sat still in court awaiting return of jury with calm face of marble sphinx though suffered appearance of suffering be seen on serene face never have believed in human nature now girl whom have rescued from comparative poverty placed in opulence have wanted to kill m vandeloup whom admired trusted what black infamy be guilty of have sworn most solemnly never harmed kitty yet be man who have ruined madame midas felt that worst have come vandeloup false kitty murderess husband vanished selina dead world be falling into ruin around remained alone amid ruin with enormous fortune like golden statue in deserted temple with clasped hand aching heart impassive face sat waiting for end jury returned in about hour there be dead silence a foreman stood up to deliver verdict jury found a follows that deceased selina jane sprotts died on st day of november from effect of poison namely conia feloniously administered by one katherine marchurst jury on oath say that said katherine marchurst feloniously wilfully maliciously did murder said deceased that evening kitty be arrested lodged in melbourne gaol to await trial on charge of wilful murder chapter xv kismet of two evil be always best to choose least a m vandeloup have to choose between loss of popularity liberty chose to lose former instead of latter after a argued to australia at large be small portion of world in america one must know anything about little escapade in connection with kitty knew that be in gollipeck power that unless acceded to gentleman demand a to giving evidence must be denounced to authority a escaped convict from new caledonia must be sent back there of course evidence must not prove detrimental to seeing how badly have behaved to kitty still a going through ordeal meant liberty did so result be a have foreseen men a rule be not very squeamish view other failing especially towards woman with lenient eye vandeloup have gone too far bachelor club unanimously characterised conduct a 'damned shady ' so letter be sent requesting m vandeloup to take name off book of club immediately resigned wrote polite letter to secretary brought uneasy blush to cheek of gentleman by stinging remark about fellow clubmen morality showed to several of member a have little redeeming vice determined to take notice so m vandeloup be left alone thing happened be that be socially ostracised from society table used to be piled up with invitation soon became quite bare of course knew must force meddlechip to recognise did not choose to do so a thought be fixed on america have plenty of money with new name brand new character vandeloup thought must prosper exceedingly well in state so stayed at home not caring to face stony face of friend who cut waited for trial of kitty marchurst after intended to leave for sydney at once take next steamer to san francisco did not mind waiting amused reading smoking playing be quite independent of melbourne society only two thing worried first of be annoyance of pierre lemaire who seemed to have divined intention of going away haunted day night like unquiet spirit whenever vandeloup looked out saw dumb man watching house if went for walk pierre must slouch sullenly along behind a have done in early day vandeloup must have called in aid of policeman to rid of annoyance fact be be afraid of offending pierre a might be tempted to reveal what knew result must not be pleasant so gaston bore patiently with disagreeable system of espionage dumb man kept over consoled with idea once be on way to america must not matter two straw whether pierre told knew kept silent other thing troubled young man be word kitty have made use of in mr villiers drawing room regarding secret said knew made uneasy for guessed what be thought might tell to someone out of revenge then there must be more trouble for to get out of then again argued that be too fond of ever to tell anything likely to injure even though have put rope round neck if must have settled whole affair by running away must have done so gollipeck be still in melbourne gaston knew must not leave town without terrible old man finding out bringing back at last torture of wondering how much kitty knew be too much for determined to go to melbourne gaol interview so obtained order from authority to see prepared to start next morning sent servant out for hansom by time be at door m vandeloup cool calm well dressed came down stair pulling on glove first thing saw when got outside be pierre waiting for with old hat pulled down over eye look of sullen resignation gaston nodded coolly to told cabby wanted to go to melbourne gaol whereupon pierre slouched forward a young man be preparing to enter cab laid hand on arm 'well said vandeloup in quiet voice in french shaking off dumb man arm 'what do want ' pierre pointed to cab whereupon m vandeloup shrugged shoulder beurely want to come to gaol with ' said mockingly 'you will get there soon enough ' other nodded made step towards cab vandeloup pushed back 'curse fool muttered to `` ll have to humour will be making scene ca come ' added aloud pierre still refused to go away conversation rather monologue seeing m vandeloup be only speaker be carried on in french so cabman servant at door be quite ignorant of purport looked rather astonished at conduct of dirty tramp towards such elegant looking gentleman vandeloup saw therefore determined to end scene 'well well said to pierre in french 'get in at once then when dumb man entered cab explained to cabman in english poor devil be pensioner of mine a want to see friend of in gaol will take with ' stepped into cab drove off cabman rather astonished at whole affair none le contented with merely winking at pretty servant girl who stood on step whereupon tossed head went inside a drove along vandeloup said nothing to pierre not that did not want to mistrusted trap door in roof of cab must permit cabman to overhear everything so went along in silence when arrived at gaol vandeloup told cabman to wait for walked towards gaol be coming inside suppose ' said sharply to pierre who still slouched alongside dumb man nodded sullenly vandeloup cursed pierre in innermost heart smiled blandly agreed to let enter with there be difficulty with warder at door a permission to see prisoner be only made out in name of m vandeloup after considerable trouble succeeded in getting in bey faith ' observed gaston lightly a went along to cell conducted by warder 'it almost a hard to get into gaol a to get out of ' warder admitted to kitty cell left alone with be seated on bed in corner of cell in attitude of deepest dejection when entered looked up in mechanical sort of manner vandeloup must see how worn pinched looking face be pierre went to one end of cell leaned against wall in indifferent manner while vandeloup stood right in front of unhappy woman kitty arose when saw expression of loathing passed over haggard looking face 'ah said bitterly rejecting vandeloup preferred hand have come to see work well look around at bare wall see how thin ugly have grown think of crime with be charged surely even gaston vandeloup will be satisfied ' young man sneered a good at acting a ever see ' said mockingly ' can not even see friend without going into heroic 'why have come here ' asked drawing up to full height be friend ' answered coolly bey friend echoed scornfully looking at with contempt 'you ruined life year ago now have endeavoured to fasten guilt of murder on yet call friend good story truly with bitter laugh ' must not help giving evidence did replied gaston coolly shrugging shoulder be innocent what say will not matter ' be innocent said looking at steadily 'you villain know be innocent know nothing of sort then believe committed crime ' do kitty sat helplessly down on bed passed hand across eye god ' muttered ' be going mad ' 'not at unlikely replied carelessly looked vacantly round cell caught sight of pierre shrinking back into shadow did bring accomplice with ' said looking at gaston m vandeloup shrugged shoulder dear bebe said lazily know why must call accomplice a have committed crime 'have not ' said rising to foot bending towards 'think again vandeloup shook head with smile think have answered glancing keenly at suppose want to be a black a ' 'you coward ' said in rage turning on dare taunt in manner be not enough that have ruined imperilled life without jeering at thus coward ' retorted vandeloup cynically brushing dust off coat 'this be not point insinuate that committed crime perhaps will tell kind of crime ' beurder replied in whisper indeed ' sneered gaston coolly though lip twitched little 'the same style of crime a own whose murder be guilty of pray ' villiers vandeloup shrugged shoulder can prove ' asked contemptuously ' can ' 'you ' with sneer ' murderess ' 'who can prove be murderess cried wildly ' can ' answered with ugly look will if keep quiet tongue will keep quiet no longer ' boldly rising facing vandeloup with hand clenched at side have tried to shield faithfully through wickedness now that accuse of committing crime accusation know be false accuse gaston vandeloup accomplice yonder ' wheeling round pointing to pierre who shrank away 'of murdering randolph villiers at black hill ballarat for sake of nugget of gold carried ' vandeloup looked at disdainfully 'you be mad said in cold voice 'this be raving of
