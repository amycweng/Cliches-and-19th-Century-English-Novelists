attend have quarrelled with well there be more to be said dr herrick by way if have talked freely must excuse for doing so have reason day hope to tell to be stopping here for long day so be on walking tour with friend mr joyce return shortly to london good day mr corn good day replied rector raising hat slipped away into gorse bush like ghost herrick walked on somewhat puzzled what be meaning of frank speech to stranger parson looked smarter more of man of world than many serious minded people must have approved of yet have talked to say least of in most indiscreet manner moreover have promised quite unnecessarily to explain reason for doing so to doctor what did mean doe know something a well a miss be thought herrick returning to inn of seem to have better opinion of colonel carr than rest of people humph seem to be surrounded by mystery here well will see what inquest will do robin proved more fractious than herrick expected be most anxious to be present at inquest in end over ruled by stronger will of friend consented to remain where be doctor walked by to pine be received by inspector bridge who introduced to coroner to dr tiler who have examined body after discussion bridge collected jury of mixed villager beorminster citizen after have inspected body witness be called herrick gave evidence of discovery of position of body of condition of house be followed by tiler who declared that in opinion carr have be shot on tuesday night going by condition of body flouted idea of suicide shirt front be neither blackened singed said tiler must have be have deceased fired revolver at so close range be shot through heart a believe by someone who stood at door seems to that be standing by bed heard footstep on stair at once turned only to meet levelled revolver shot passed through heart imbedded in opposite wall again there be three other shot in different part of body one in neck in abdomen third in right leg shot killed deceased be first went through heart how do know shot be first asked coroner from examination of wound replied tiler remaining three shot be fired when man be down dead said coroner aghast certainly deceased must have died almost instantaneously thrill of horror passed through present at idea that assassin have fired three more shot at dead body there be something horrible about wreaking of such vengeance vengeance must have be for bridge proved that robbery have taken place most interesting part of bridge evidence be yet to come produced revolver found in hand of dead man six chamber proved to be loaded therefore must not have be weapon have be used idea of suicide be out of question also gentleman continued inspector first shot be fired with different weapon to employed to fire other three bullet passed through heart embedded in wall have be extracted here be other three shot be found in body in floor here be piece of evidence thus produced be placed before jury first bullet be round of old fashioned kind fired from muzzle loading pistol remaining three be conical in shape of most modern manufacture plainly then two pistol have be used one of antique pattern to fire first shot shot killed colonel other revolver of most modern type latter have be merely employed to make target of dead body finally said bridge after explaining third pistol rather revolver found in hand of deceased be not fired at chamber be loaded there be smoke stain on barrel be simply put into left hand of dead to hint at person who did so knew that colonel carr be left handed in agitation forgot that six chamber be loaded in fact defeated own scheme evidence be surprising enough why must assassin use two pistol when one must have sufficed asked coroner why do say 'he mr inspector do then think that guilty person be man think woman must have committed so brutal murder said bridge bluntly must have be satisfied with killing man not have proceeded to mutilate body also idea of putting revolver into hand of dead must not occur to woman there differ from mr inspector contradicted coroner woman might do thing be more likely woman must forget in agitation that revolver be loaded than must man in like circumstance inspector coroner argued out point at length bridge losing temper stated that believed frisco shot master called napper a witness landlord stated that on tuesday night at six o'clock frisco have be drinking rum at carr arm seemed to be angry with master whom alleged have treated badly a left inn about seven o'clock said let take care wo live long at time napper thought be merely drunken threat in face of death frisco flight thought that man be guilty of course coroner who have lost temper with bridge told napper that did not want opinion simply evidence there be further trouble about remark in inspector got worst of final witness be stephen marsh be tall slight young man with bowed shoulder pensive face stated that have called on evening of murder for mother at rectory have be up at pine in afternoon a drove home told that colonel carr have expressed intention of living for many long day coroner why be mr marsh not here to give evidence marsh mother be seriously ill in bed must not come coroner evidence must be taken did say how conversation came about to induce deceased to make such speech marsh yes mother wanted colonel to lend money refused said that might a well a when died estate must come to be then that uncle expressed determination to live for many long day merely give evidence to show that uncle have thought of committing suicide coroner have seen uncle lately marsh not for six month be not on good term coroner how be then that mr marsh called to see on afternoon of murder marsh be determined to go asked not to insisted at reply there came smile upon face of of jury who lived at beorminster afterwards herrick learned that mr marsh be well known a possessed of violent temper there be doubt a one remarked that have given colonel good talking to however evidence of marsh did not point to who have killed carr at time there be more available evidence bridge insisted that frisco be guilty have left house in clothes stood up in evidently driven forth in panic have made inquiry have heard from police at southberry frisco person answering to description of frisco have gone to london by morning train at moment herrick asked to be allowed to give further evidence have just recollected that have seen man a be described be stopping at southberry said herrick waiting for friend mr joyce who have gone to london went up

over face be dressed in blue serge suit with red tie looked like sailor waited until london train went saw get into third class carriage coroner how be dr herrick that recollect only now because never thought of matter before since inspector bridge have given description of dress especially red tie be sure man be frisco did not see face coroner be displeased with evidence said so in fact be disagreeable man with strong animus against bridge a there be more evidence summed up trying to prove frisco must have have nothing to do with murder however jury be of different opinion more sensible so brought in verdict of wilful murder against frisco made coroner ill tempered again left pine in great rage however verdict be given inquest be at end jury left house stephen marsh a nearest relative of dead man asked bridge to allow three policeman to remain in house a have to return to mother bridge consented then marsh went up to herrick who be standing in hall doctor said will come with to beorminster want to attend mother herrick stared have doctor already have not mr marsh marsh shook head no replied in low voice beorminster doctor will attend please come sir be so ill

come back with from south america yes whether be south america north can not say frisco must hold tongue when chose however carr turned back on country people went on worse than ever be said to be mad think be mere devilment one queer thing did two queer thing building of tower be one said herrick shrewdly marsh nodded other mad act be throwing down of wall fence round pine dr jim looked puzzled humph said noticed that house have fence round one came upon suddenly a if have be dropped from sky carr threw down wall to show that be not afraid on other hand must have built tower to show that be understand what mean why be not difficult if remember what said to when met that girl hinted that carr be afraid of something in frisco be concerned well then evidently first attitude be one of defiance towards fear afterwards thought better of built tower man must not leave that splendid house to sleep in bare room at top of tower unless be afraid think be right said stephen musingly know what be afraid of be third year after returned that built tower be in such hurry to get done that have men working at by night know have magnificent system of electricity round about 'the pine well light be on night after night until tower be finished relay of workman replaced one whole county wondered at way carr went on gave explanation no saw one shut up like hermit frisco attended to house cooked colonel meal think carr often cooked for be fond of cooking for eight year never went outside house humph that account for gymnasium bowling alley shooting gallery what about business did mean of letter frith frith sent down clerk occasionally carr be clever man of business invested money in good security so mother said used to beard in den clergyman corn yes called also to try reform colonel did not succeed good fellow corn weak can hold tongue though on contrary talked good deal to so said muttered stephen wonder what meant by did know secret of carr life not that know of corn always kept mouth shut a said why must have talked openly to ca say seems to that there be mystery on side said herrick with shrug miss be used to visit carr say did once twice will leave to tell of visit opinion of host marsh said dr jim after pause have idea who murdered carr no not remotest unless be frisco on face of one must think so why did frisco run away stephen rubbed chin think must ask be said thoughtfully if anyone know what be at back of be be endicotte chapter v theory of mr marsh for next week so herrick have hand full mr marsh grew rapidly worse several time nearly slipped through finger doctor skill petronella nursing above indomitable determination of mr marsh not to die enabled to turn corner became much better still suffered from racking pain at time herrick gave morphia did so sparingly from petronella learned that have taken chloral for year past feared that if gained taste for morphia might take to instead of weaker drug for stephen sake jim must not let that happen never have herrick have so unruly patient did not wonder that have quarrelled with beorminster doctor wonder be that have friend left temper be ungovernable fought herrick on point did not chime in with inclination in spite of fact that be attending out of sheer kindness have intimated to stephen that expected fee mr marsh abused virulently whenever felt so inclined then abused everyone even petronella who be slave a to stephen devoted a be to must not find word bad enough for sometimes be fool ninny milksop lived upon charity etc etc yet there be time when young man be be good in eye even herrick came in for share of praise at odd moment gran ' dio petronella must say to herrick after tussel be there ever diavola a padrona old italian woman have taken great fancy to dr jim be good to mistress whom idolized be kind to petronella must speak language have once made tour of europe for three year with young dipsomaniac have contrived to pick up three four tongue spoke remarkably correctly spanish french german italian dr jim knew must read write with wonderful accuracy in eye of petronella be marvellous man often talked to on subject must not discus with anyone else be angry with padrona signor dottore said sometimes be blood of michelotto family eh michelotti be wicked like colonel carr eh petronella signor dottore colonel be angel of light to wicked michelotti padrona be last of be not wonder be angry per bacco added petronella who must swear on occasion see casa fitting casa for last of grand signior be right now petronella a soon a signora can be removed will take to pine be fine casa if like petronella spat shook white elf lock will bring luck eh signor man have evil eye once went with padrona to see overlooked although made horn hurt foot if padrona go to casa will die herrick shrugged shoulder did not argue there be mean of persuading petronella out of spite have taken to pine be now property of stephen marsh senior partner of frith frith have come down personally with will left stephen house on condition that pulled down tower furthermore personal property of late colonel amounting to eight thousand year well invested be given to young man on still more curious condition be to have special vault constructed in saxham churchyard said mr frith be to be built of stone lined with sheet iron body of late client be to be put in there alone be to hold key of door once month be to enter vault see that body be safe if do for year then property becomes yours absolutely if miss going once money go to frisco to frisco colonel servant said stephen in surprise by name mr frith yes be legal enough man evidently murdered master have gone away to avoid consequence think will be troubled by also mr marsh rather mr carr since have to take name can avert chance of man getting money by visiting vault monthly for year here be mystery why money must have be left to frisco one must guess stephen often talked over with herrick must come to conclusion however set to work to carry out term of will body of workman be employed to take down tower mr corn be seen about construction of new vault evidently colonel did not consider that remains must be safe in ancestral burial place in spite of secrecy countryside came to know of strange provision of carr will be said that wanted to make sure that body must not be carried off by devil to whom have sold in fact general opinion be that night remains must be carried off like of old woman of berkley villager grew confused over matter did not distinguish between body soul while mr marsh be slowly getting better stephen be attending to carrying out of will dr jim remained at saxham rather for sake of patient lived at beorminster paying occasional visit to village robin have long since returned to london have left in much anger at jim refusal to accompany have found new friend said angrily must go to wall do call unfair jim dear robin can not be shadow be quite well able to look after now took for walking tour to do good now be in excellent health must remain here until mr marsh be quite well remember if go have doctor to attend ca do without persisted robin have influence over that be lost if be away must take up life on own shoulder replied herrick impatiently be use relying on other people if feel that be so indispensable to why not stay here have money tie can do work here better than in london want to go back to town if stay here will not see much of marsh be friend now like marsh be good fellow can make something of suppose robin think be after money know better than that three hundred year have be enough for be never man for luxury never thought hinted thing said joyce with blush well if like to stay here jim will return to london can meet when

when departed why ca stay here said in blunt way can work better in country miss be be like charles lamb london be home can not get enough of divine fire in tame locality there be nothing tame about cried be fired with indignation joyce laughed not to perhaps prefer london however hope will let come down see at time can correspond if have manuscript think well of send to will see what can do with arrangement be made robin taking friendly leave of jim went back to west kensington fiat wrote frequently at first after time letter became rarer herrick be sorry on whole somewhat relieved to be rid of such burden for robin be one of people who be delightful to meet terrible to live with have be ill in trouble conscientious jim must have stayed with since have be particularly well after attack of nerve when body be discovered there be necessity for herrick to martyrise further besides jim have fallen seriously in love with ida endicotte when mr marsh be fairly on road to recovery stephen have taken jim over to saxham introduced to biff lived in tumbledown house of considerable size down deep leafy lane at one time endicottes have be great folk late mr endicotte who have married daughter of

mouse what be to be done will earn own living said be who be most energetic of five ida can look after house frank can manage farm sidney can go to school will ask mr arch to take on to weekly chronicle dear child expostulated earl what doe matter cried be be endicottes whatever may do everybody know who be what be there be nothing disgraceful in earning one own living uncle gar earl rather helpless person who have never done stroke of honest work in life be rather surprised at energy of be however scheme recommended to favour since there be absolutely other way of settling matter in one way lord gartham paid off debt by selling of land arranged that united five must have small income must have to increase a best must thus be that endicottes found with ancestral home small farm two hundred year world before be young hearty so thought very little of matter be obtained post on weekly chronicle at beorminster ida looked after house frank managed farm flo be put to beorminster

of eight thousand year have altered intended to ask ida to be wife on very earliest opportunity be pity jim did not know of have fallen in love with ida a be always pleasant to never crossed mind that heart be engaged open on most point with new friend stephen out of delicacy for ida be reticent about love so jim continued to live in fool paradise not even sharp eyed joyce have be able to able to enlighten certainly mr marsh have spoken to jim on subject wanted stephen to marry miss endicotte dr herrick thought be merely own desire did not think there be anything serious between young people must mr marsh inform of more than fact that liked one that be desire of heart to see married one day when stephen be at saxham mr marsh have long talk with doctor in saw more of stormy character than have ever be shown to before must sit up in bed now wearied of society of petronella frequently asked herrick to stay beside be one of few sensible men have met said drawing black brow together come talk want to tell what think of stephen what can think that be best of fellow replied jim taking chair by beside h be that sound like 'weakest of men stephen mean be strong enough in way be why want to look after stephen how do mean look after mr marsh widow mused for time before replying be good hearted fool said at last with sweet nature be likely to be imposed upon in world now be rich scoundrel will prey on want to see come to harm have to return to london remonstrated jim rather taken aback by responsibility thrust upon be not rich man mr marsh must look after practice can arrange that replied sharply be good man dr herrick can see be fool influence over stephen will be for good can get to offer inducement to stay beside at event until be married until be married echoed jim puzzled have intention of getting married not that know of be too much wrapped up in poetry wish to marry ida endicotte be well born girl good woman think will make stephen excellent wife like jim felt blood flush in face liking be not love said in rather irritated tone mr marsh pulled curtain aside so that light fell on face of young man then after scrutiny gave short laugh so be be said be in love with girl never said so mr marsh pshaw ca blind be woman come be in love herrick shrugged broad shoulder see why must deny said coldly be in love with miss endicotte so far a can judge be not in love with think be in love with anyone replied mr marsh have not seen enough of to judge if must only see together must tell like stephen though here be chained to bed can not get out to attend to matter of importance humph eyed herrick steadily so be in love with well have be desire of life to see stephen married to ida for want to stay stephen will give thousand year to stay dear mr marsh now contradict will put out of temper know what that mean ask to stop to show regard for many woman must get out of way rather than see pet scheme interfered with be not that sort of narrow minded person will have chance along with stephen if love marry in god name let have done with matter if however prefers poor stephen sweet hearted fool that be must promise not to put obstacle in way of marriage if miss endicotte prefers step son certainly must not think of objecting mr marsh said herrick stiffly remark be rather unnecessary think be retorted widow be gentleman know be also human being when love come into question there be few thing man will not do woman for matter of clenched thin hand laid outside coverlet face darkened know know muttered between teeth who must know who have suffered give something to drink doctor throat be dry with talking think have better leave said herrick after thirst be assuaged be wearying go cried mr marsh abruptly have much to say of importance may not be here long to say nonsense mr marsh be getting better much better same may die one never know said widow gloomily herrick laughed at foreboding what said trying to joke out of so morbid mood have enemy like carr anyone who came into contact with carr be bound to have enemy said mr marsh bitterly be devil if ever there be one however be not to point went on impatiently want to know if will stay with stephen for thousand year be tempting offer to poor man like said herrick with hesitation until stephen asks to stay can not promise may not wish oh be right dr herrick stephen know that be best

looked at uneasily again have hinted at something of danger to herself wish must be plain with said what do mean asked mr marsh with frown think can guess retorted doctor hint at dying so far a know there be not least likelihood of doing so unless take overdose of chloral be always advising to leave off have enemy who be likely to replied mr marsh with unnecessary violence have enemy feel have presentiment be not long for world a italian know be bound to be superstitious must think english part of blood must revolt against such morbid nonsense again say be not plain with be how dare talk to so cried mr marsh furiously be one man have met in world of fool other than dead devil carr if made confidant of anyone must be of so far a personally be concerned there be nothing to say stephen hesitated fell to plucking restlessly at coverlet well wish to be bear leader if be willing be willing thousand year be not to be despised moreover conscience be perfectly clear a regard miss endicotte understand if love marry by mean if stephen be choice must promise promise nothing said herrick impatiently walking to fro there be necessity to promise be man of honour if stephen miss endicotte love one be last man in world to step between know that if did must not ask to stop look after said mr marsh cynically however complained of want of confidence be going to amend do know why want to stay with stephen to make man of so said that certainly be something of excuse also want be main reason to guard against whom what be hinting at asked herrick sharply at frisco be unexpected reply oh may look astonished if remember will well will repeated dr jim see what mean money go to frisco if stephen must neglect to visit vault monthly for year what of much frisco killed colonel carr oh be sure of if not why did fly besides there be one else can think of who have interest in carr death know what secret have what there be frisco knew be why carr left money to failing stephen nonsense if frisco possessed colonel carr secret must have blackmailed without necessity of murder ah know said mr marsh mysteriously have heard frisco carr quarrel be belief if remember be evidence that quarrelled on night of murder must have fought duel be just what two devil like must do frisco killed master before must fire shot be why chamber of revolver be found loaded well frisco have have to fly will not give up chance of getting money will here mr marsh bent forward to whisper will try maim kill stephen so that may not fulfil condition of will visit vault then frisco will claim money have thought out while lying here be ingenious replied herrick forget that if frisco show will be arrested that stop attempting to harm stephen mr marsh shook head know frisco do said not word must herrick extract from chapter vi changeling while tower at pine be being pulled down stephen paid frequent visit to saxham sometimes dr herrick went with together must go through wonderful house marsh have never before be inside be amazed at luxury life have be so simple so deprived of beauty that artistic temperament have be starved from lack of nutriment highly gifted with imaginative faculty possessed of keen perception of loveliness stephen revelled in beautiful thing filled corner of house will have to get wife to share said herrick one day after conversation with mr marsh looked keenly at young man a spoke stephen however betrayed emotion suppose will have to marry day said coolly if be to die without child cousin must get property did not know have cousin said herrick rather astonished believe so distant cousin although have never seen mother can tell about seems that colonel carr father have younger brother who be turned out by father went to america married there then died leaving widow daughter widow died daughter married one in state know name mother may believe there be son whether be in america in england can not say humph said jim very interesting must ask mother about if secure property by complying with condition of will will be yours entirely even if marry will be able to leave to whomsoever please must leave to cousin whatever name be said stephen in careless tone seems to that have right to enjoy after since be of carr blood always provided marry have child of course there be time enough to think of marriage want mother to be sole mistress of beautiful place for time have have such dose of poverty must like to taste luxury be not in love then asked herrick in jocular tone know time stephen flushed will tell when be meantime let enjoy present will soon have tower down house put to right then mother can come hope will stay also herrick added rather anxiously want to lose friend know depends replied jim with flush be thinking of ida will remain until mother be quite well may be sure of nothing more be said at time herrick must not be certain that stephen be in love with ida that girl have set heart on marsh be excellent friend in spite of herrick lynx eye must not learn if understood one a matter of fact did of wished to hurry matter felt that mr marsh must have to be consulted before anything be settled therefore waited until recovered health be established at pine mr marsh slowly regained strength almost dispensed with herrick attendance never recurred to subject of ida of frisco after one interview although herrick several time tried to make speak evidently knew something about man perhaps have heard colonel speak of whatever be kept own counsel there be need that must do otherwise perhaps if frisco have made appearance might have be induced to speak out ex sailor a herrick learned be have vanished completely be traced to paddington station after sign of trail be lost like rain drop have disappeared into mighty sea of london life in spite of offer of reward not hint must be gained of whereabouts be generally considered that be criminal most people holding that have shot colonel unawares napper evidence went to prove that two men be on bad term with one probably frisco excited by rum sense of wrong whatever might be have returned to pine with intention of righting one entertained idea of duel having be fought only mr marsh gave frisco that grace herrick considered theory feasible one felt that be confirmed by fact of revolver found in dead man hand being loaded if frisco have fired first colonel must have fallen with weapon undischarged must account for six chamber being filled what must not account for be fact of one bullet being different to remaining three be puzzle dr jim must in nowise arrive at solution of problem although thought over great deal be endicotte be only person who insisted on frisco innocence declared that man be too devoted to master to kill that there must be reason for crime explained to herrick week after interview with mr marsh herrick marsh have come over to biffstead to spend afternoon intending to return to beorminster by last bus somewhere about ten o'clock be characteristic of stephen simple habit that still went to fro by public vehicle although must now have afforded cart horse bicycle even have so chosen motor car before taking full advantage of new position of wealth wanted mother to be well enough to direct matter have held in subjection for so many year that hesitated to do anything without approval so herrick stephen came to

discovered whereabouts be what frisco meant at public house when hinted about master not living long if frisco have given information enemy must have killed colonel wonder if frisco did then went away to escape consequence said be thoughtfully frisco must have be killed also think that enemy found out colonel murdered then frisco ran away to save own life humph be one way of looking at matter did

who agreed to boil kettle for after deliberation fixed on library a best place for meal on entering found boy reading in corner under window here sidney said ida amazed how can come here without asking stephen permission stephen doe mind be sure replied sidney with smile stephen assured that be welcome while others be talking admiring place dr jim stood looking at boy who be leaning back on sofa taken up with own thought there be something peculiar about sidney endicotte procured name of changeling be given to in fun by be many people in village really believed that be fairy if not whole one reputation rose from fact that lad possessed that gift in scotland be called second sight one in saxham who saw master sidney large blue eye fixed upon turned pale in italy must have be credited with evil eye indeed old petronella always crossed when chanced to meet once twice sidney have foretold death of who have afterwards died thus have uncanny reputation be small thin boy looking much older than year although be sixteen yet on occasion looked quite twenty pale thin faced with large blue eye curious insistent gaze sometimes made even own family feel uncomfortable then have such peculiar habit at night be generally wakeful slept much in day time particularly in cold weather sometimes must slip out of bedroom by window remain away for hour when questioned where have be used vaguely to answer in wood doctor who have seen must make nothing of be healthy in own way head be clear corn reported that learned rapidly about hung glamour not of world might have be male kilmeny who have returned from fairy land be sometimes called thomas rhymer when did so sidney must nod laugh in so strange way that be grew frightened dropped name how do feel to day sidney asked jim sitting down beside boy not very well replied vaguely feel that be not came here to read to sleep why did want to do because must go away then always do when feel like like what jim be puzzled boy be by mean mad yet talked in manner quite beyond comprehension of sane person jim have never met anyone like before be much taken up with oddity of case from medical point of view ca explain must not understand said sidney please leave alone dr herrick at moment be called to jim from other side of room hurried across to sidney remained vaguely staring into nothingness after time eye closed looked a though be fast asleep others gathered round tea table prepared to eat be must not allow brother to be awakened make ill if be roused suddenly said will wake up be right doe look to like natural sleep said jim anxiously how pale be think said ida sharply agree with be sidney have better be left alone get into state at time let have tea be so hungry be past five quarter past said stephen glancing at watch began to eat drink laughing enjoying one took notice of sidney even jim attention be distracted boy remained on sofa leaning back white a snow drawing long deep breath looked like dead person after time conversation languished tea be done food be finished talked about packing up to go poor sidney tea be quite cold said ida really think might wake now oh be coming to wake up sidney have tea be nearly six must be getting boy face have now delicate pink tinge on seemed more than have be when fell asleep for moment be silent then looked slowly round at who be present until blue eye fixed calmly on stephen mr marsh said quietly have better go home mother be dead ida gave cry stephen turned pale be alone retained sufficient presence of mind to cross over to boy shake sidney what do mean by saying horrible thing be true replied boy quietly mr marsh be dead have just seen died at half past five go home stephen without word marsh rushed from room knew of sidney prophecy dreaded lest one must be true made for beorminster a fast a must go be met by petronella padrona be dead said old woman chapter vii nine day wonder petronella made terrible announcement with ominous calmness then when saw stephen staring at open mouthed wild southern nature must no longer be controlled with choking sob flung apron over head began to lament loudly for dear padrona voice ascended shrilling in long wail like of corsican vocieri luckily there be few people in street sound be scarcely noticed be simply thought that excitable italian woman be in one of tantrum beorminster be used to petronella fit of rage stephen caught suddenly dragging inside by main force closed door before petronella must recover breath for howl found on one of dining room chair with marsh standing over young man be so shaken that must hardly speak prophecy of sidney hurried journey to beorminster on grocer cart have met near saxham now terrible confirmation of death thing shook to soul hardly recognised own voice tell everything happened said slowly make mistake must know petronella crossed holy virgin muttered eye be like coal then after muffled wail burst out into rapid italian stephen understood easily from habit of talking to to mr marsh after left at mid day signor padrona tried to get little sleep when postman came at two o'clock brought one letter for took up woke then went out of room in quarter of hour signora called looked white so white letter be before told to give chloral a wanted to sleep asked if have bad news in letter said that felt suddenly sick gave medicine in little bottle went away took think for when went up again hour later be asleep went again again be still asleep then took up tea wanted to waken gran ' dio be dead dead what time be that petronella at half past five signor hour when always take up signora tea oh be dead nursed cursed be that live still while old woman wailed on stephen shuddered hour be that sidney have named be sure died at time asked quite sure signor stephano when went in before be only asleep saw breathing be up at quarter past five still breathed have colour in poor cheek when set down tray turned to see that be quite still face pale a snow put hand to heart be dead ah dio mio must have passed away when entered room heard sigh at door said petronella beginning to embellish be spirit passed what must do open window to let soul go free ah holy virgin old woman crossed again by time stephen have somewhat recovered composure without word went up to room petronella have drawn sheet over dead drew down gently saw waxen face beneath wrinkle have be smoothed away there rested peaceful expression on once stormy countenance a marsh stood tearlessly looking at dead heard light step enter room herrick appeared almost a pale a dead woman after glance at corpse recognised that be over looked at marsh with shudder yes whispered young man replying to unspoken thought at half past five o'clock herrick shuddered again drew sheet over dead face then took stephen by arm led downstairs into study there left in chair went into dining room whence returned with decanter two glass pouring out two stiff glass of brandy forced stephen to drink one took other be in need of stimulant for event have shaken considerably by bye marsh laid down head on table wept quietly have be devoted to dead woman be unstrung moreover uncanny way in first announcement of death have be made shocked deeply herrick went out to see petronella found in death chamber genuine romanist have placed candle round bed crucifix on breast of dead on knee be praying aloud seeing that have be done must be done herrick returned to study stephen be calmer inclined to talk be half past five a sidney said said in low voice oh herrick what doe mean know said usually sceptically doctor after have gone asked boy how knew said that while asleep have dreamed so put that be standing in mother bedroom be dying in stupor saw breath gradually leave body also said that saw spirit after be dead of course must be nonsense after what said can believe anything said marsh what else well said jim uncomfortably described bedroom exactly be ever in stephen certainly not described exactly a being in state in now be said that petronella came in at door with tray placed beside bed then put hand on mother heart found that be dead afterwards opened window why what stephen god cried young man now ghastly white be exactly what petronella told did oh oh fainted herrick scarcely wondered at felt deadly sick needed glass of brandy before must recover sufficiently to attend to unconscious man next day news be known over beorminster sidney prophecy also endicotte family must fain have kept to sidney have spread news for on way home before rumour must have reached saxham did not until late night told several people of mr marsh death hour at have occurred so report spread that night saxham accustomed to sidney second sight be in ferment many believed others doubted upshot be that few enquirer went over to beorminster whence rushed back with confirmation of news mr marsh be dead moreover have passed away at half past five up till late hour night nothing be talked about wonderful boy next morning crowd collected about grange hoping to catch glimpse of ida be very angry at sidney indiscretion told so took placidly why must not say that mr marsh be dead asked be dead died at time said how did know sidney dear asked perplexed sister when be on sofa in library dreamed be in room saw die white spirit get out of body spirit pointed to bottle on table beside bed then forgot till woke on sofa saw stephen looking at then told to go home there be nothing strange about ida know can see thing ida shuddered ran away to tell be that sidney be most uncomfortable person to talk to boy stayed indoors at request of be morning then slipped off in afternoon to go to favourite haunt in pine wood when came into village next day refused to talk of dream vision whatever might be called seemed quite cross when be referred to from day sidney be shunned a though have plague everyone be afraid of being told too much about relation troubled boy very little went on living in usual dreamy way have more vision for time even at biffstead be regarded a something dangerous there by tacit consent subject be dropped what dr jim thought of be difficult to say sidney prophecy be thrown into background so far a be concerned by discovery that mr marsh have died from overdose of chloral have always warned that might make mistake apparently have done so at last when petronella told of letter changed mind what if have committed suicide recollected vague allusion to enemy persistent declaration that might not live long at once set about hunting for letter petronella helping be not to be discovered although searched high low at last herrick spied ash in fireless grate found that paper have be burnt without doubt letter mr marsh have received be there fire in grate on day mr marsh died asked signor dottore grate be empty of course need not have asked flimsy stuff must have be swept away with ash humph must have got up burnt letter then well must wait for inquest be herrick who attended to detail of funeral a marsh be completely bewildered by sudden catastrophe inquest resulted in verdict mr marsh have died from overdose of chloral one hinted at suicide a dr jim gave evidence of use of drug to alleviate pain obtain sleep be concluded that have miscalculated dose even stephen believed that be case for herrick said nothing of suspicion what petronella thought dr jim must not find out be a secret a grave mr marsh be buried in family vault of carr at saxham large number of people came to funeral not because dead woman have be popular that wished to attend rite of person whose death have be foretold in so curious manner in vault coffin be laid beside of late colonel herrick shuddered a thought of enemy lying side by side certainly when new vault be ready body of colonel must be removed to in accordance with term of will must be time before be completed meantime carr body remained in old sepulchre pending removal stephen have have new iron door put on old vault kept key to be quite safe in pocket never parted from after funeral herrick made several attempt to discover something about letter delivered to mr marsh on day of death although be careful not to hint that have connection with sudden end although questioned postman postal authority must gain very little satisfaction be plain envelope stamped so far a must be remembered with london post mark humph said dr jim to when acquired information frisco be in london wonder if wrote that letter however be little use conjecturing mr marsh be dead have taken secret secret of colonel carr along with into next world herrick put idea out of head a have much to do in considering future position three four day after funeral be alone with stephen in beorminster house there spoke to young man about movement must return to london marsh said can do more good here must attend to practice replied stephen quickly must not leave like herrick have grown used to a companion like more than man ever met without must be lost must stay with be practice large one on contrary be very small have be established in west kensington only for two year if have not small income of own must starve well must come to hope will herrick be rich can allow good income say thousand year be generous of marsh did mother speak of to did not why do ask because wanted to stay with proposed same amount be glad cried stephen face lighting up can do much at least for memory so wished to remain with will of course can not do without herrick smoked in silence for few minute man in position have right to turn back on such good fortune same marsh if did not like personally if did not think must earn income by helping must not take position then will do so cried stephen stretching out hand doctor grasped heartily in token of acceptance be not without scruple a to taking such large amount of money said make only couple of hundred year by practice rate at high value not too high for good will do said marsh heartily have be different man since came into life have shown how to look at thing in broader spirit be le morbid than be herrick have eight thousand year will have sum name very good be delighted for what period see marsh day will marry then will find in wife companion necessary to existence will not want think have better make agreement for three year by time will have done good can will be used to position continued jim looking into young man eye will be looking for wife stephen nodded three year then said if want document lawyer can draw up a to marrying dare say will marry already have here broke off abruptly there be thing man can not talk about even to best friend let subject of love marriage be tabooed between herrick certainly replied doctor rather stiffly have wish to force confidence marsh be not that have idea in head may come to nothing on other hand well dismissed with wave of hand time enough to talk about when ripens let change subject in face of unwillingness on part of marsh herrick be obliged to do a be asked wondered if stephen really loved ida endicotte whether be be who attracted time alone must reveal truth so herrick for moment thought more about matter have engaged to look after stephen at once set to work to earn income subject be introduced by marsh think ought to go abroad for year two said restlessly feel that beorminster saxham be distasteful to for time have arranged to let petronella live here on small income thought must like to return to italy begged to allow to stay here for time asked to go to 'the pine refused so here must stay herrick will go up to london for couple of week said herrick promptly want to go further afield for longer time have forgotten term of will put in dr jim must pay monthly visit to vault money go to frisco stephen nodded somewhat grimly must have remembered said yes can not travel until year be at end even if so happened that did not go to vault lost money think that frisco must return to claim well know replied herrick musingly after can not be certain that frisco killed master may re appear explain flight prove innocence on face of must seem be guilty evidence be circumstantial better stick to term of will not give chance of claiming money very good herrick then will go up to london can take to tailor other tradesman whose good may need want to educate dr jim have have varied experience of world have not be country mouse town one at thirty five must have have experience marsh yes have travelled in time have be round europe with man be trying

expedition into interior of africa now be settled in dull quarter of west kensington often wish must be off again on long trail civilised life be too respectable for when year be out will go on long trail together well said exploration of planet will do harm later on can settle down be comfortable with wife beg pardon be trenching on forbidden ground however marsh be glad thing be so arranged be bit of good luck for for also herrick can do nothing good hope so said herrick cheerfully first thing intend to do be to take out into open air must hunt shoot golf swim get into state of physical perfection mind be all right like poem have in to do great thing marsh first of must attend to body have neglected thing said stephen straightening life be so narrow that did not look after a man must besides to tell truth herrick be so much of student that out of door life never attracted be because have never have companion to interest in life said herrick smiling now be devoted to athletic sport of kind if can infect with enthusiasm will soon be able to take deepest interest in not be fortunate enough to succeed with joyce finished dr jim with shrug ah friend who be staying at carr arm never met will when go to town be not bad little chap brain be too large for body besides be neurotic intensely trying at time suppose must have cured altogether must have made twice man be have only taken advice robin be always a obstinate a mule life into for there be hope for man like hope will succeed with herrick be certain to succeed with in first place nerve be not diseased in second be le selfish thirdly be sensible enough to see sense last be not given to many men well have have long talk marsh so have better go to bed begin new life to morrow be three day after that two went up to london herrick called at biffstead told be about new relation with stephen expressed greatly pleased will do end of good said physical exercise be what need in making good use of money added emphatically have too good opinion of miss be girl laughed blushed in heart liked herrick greatly be so big so strong so sensible exactly sort of man admired frank brother resembled in many way be not so worldly wise perhaps so clever however be too much woman to make direct reply to herrick speech changed subject when come back must have talk said meantime will give something to go on with in london do know anything about cryptograph dr jim have looked into subject once twice never did much good at why be went to desk fished out bit of paper want to see if can solve said have done best failed be piece of paper picked up in colonel house when be alive be sure have to do with secret whatever might be else why must be in secret writing herrick took paper held out be yellow kind of chinese paper tough wrinkled on be written in red ink following sgd kzrs vzqmhf shkk itkx sidn cdzsg tmkdrr jumble of letter made herrick stare must make nothing of yet here doubt be secret of colonel carr perhaps if writing must be read reason of death might be explained even name of assassin might be given be watched eagerly what do think of asked daresay may help herrick said doubtfully if colonel have secret if have cried be emphatically know have then may be contained in mixture of letter have failed say well miss be know that will succeed however will try will let have if will take very greatest care of have copy to be sure be original will bring back to safe sound in two week will be back then asked with quick flush certainly will arrange about practice return for good be looked down be glad said in low tone then thinking might have said too much smiled in face of course be glad cried gaily be not pledged to find out who killed colonel chapter viii curious discovery be now quite two month since death of colonel carr time robin have be in london have written to herrick telling felt so much better that must not go abroad have new idea for novel wrote joyce now have leisure intend to throw heart soul into still keep on flat herrick therefore determined that first visit must be to little man stephen doctor took up abode in guelph hotel in jermyn street be first time young man have be in london novelty excitement of town life did much to dispel grief felt for death of step mother be not that regretted le be sensible enough to see that be foolish to weep over irremediable misfortune therefore took herrick advice threw with ardour into fitting out with complete ward robe for first time in life doctor took to best west end shop instructed in topography of fashionable locality when stephen be fairly set going found time to attend to own business first went to house in west kensington saw that be all right then called upon young practitioner who have nursed practice while be away made offer to sell young doctor who have only lately started in district be overjoyed at chance a jim have got together fair number of patient herrick made term of purchase a light a possible spread payment over considerable time dr grant asked two day for consideration a being poor be necessary must see way how to pay money at once jim consented to after finishing necessary business went off to robin flat arrangement discussion with grant have taken up best part of afternoon be close upon seven when herrick found time to see friend at first hesitated half made up mind to put off until next day a be in neighbourhood finally decided to go sent wire to marsh that must not be home until ten o'clock intended to ask joyce for meal making sure that must be welcome yet strange to say robin be not so hearty a herrick expected perhaps have not got over anger at desertion of doctor after last letter jim must not think that such be case in spite of severance herrick still wished to keep eye on robin knowing that be foolish in many way therefore when joyce showed disposition not to invite to stay herrick at once determined that must remain there be reason at back of confusion herrick in interest of weak man resolved to find out what might be seeing that be bent on remaining robin made best of what evidently considered bad job became more of old self be not looking so well a letter led to hope robin said herrick when two be smoking in study be in best of health said robin quickly of course have be working hard at book that take out of chap read of chapter said herrick who once have be kind of literary adviser to author robin shook head uneasily not until book be done said want to get impression a whole will be master piece besides added glancing at clock might be interrupted at half past seven friend of mine be coming to dinner hope unexpected coming will not upset arrangement joyce of course not how can think so said robin with air of constraint did not escape herrick be always welcome will stop night can put up must get back to marsh be companion doctor for time being very good billet assure robin what about practice asked joyce be now selling to grant be such small practice that be not worth while to stick to a against assured income of thousand year be that what marsh give yes mind telling robin a be such old friend mention to anyone else stay with marsh for three year in way will be able to save money buy practice in better part of town be wonderful bit of luck be indeed congratulate replied robin cheerfully shaking friend by hand marsh must be well off to be able to afford companionship at price yes have be left about eight thousand year more le by colonel carr late uncle be business robin will not talk about have yet found out who killed colonel carr not yet of course be supposed that frisco killed man have disappeared when be caught will know truth read case robin what do think seems a though man be guilty replied joyce slowly be not prepared to offer opinion fact be be so busy with book have put horror out of head by way what about southberry helen miss endicotte oh have seen good deal of be still in love not very passionately perhaps think respectable affection be better to marry upon than wild romantic adoration will not resist wear tear of life hope day if miss endicotte will allow to marry be when have good practice if man more worthy of come along why ardent lover laughed joyce if really felt passion must not contemplate with equanimity idea of intruder believe like little journalistic girl better kind of dull anger stirred in doctor breast at hearing be so flippantly alluded to saw that joyce did not mean harm so turned off remark with laugh be charming young lady robin be better a comrade than must be a wife comrade be what want said joyce shrewdly luke warm affection will not win love of woman perhaps not however will see herrick be annoyed for felt there be truth in remark be glad when ring came to door interrupted conversation be rapidly getting unpleasant to there be friend who be mexican called don manuel santiago humph not often one foregathers with nationality in london where did meet at apollo club johnstone introduced to here be think will like herrick be not so sure have met with mexican on native heath did not like breed however a man be guest of joyce felt compelled to behave at least politely same knowing robin weakness in picking up doubtful acquaintance determined to be observant of mexican dr herrick don manuel santiago seor be very best friend little dark man clicked heel together foreign fashion bowed politely herrick looked at from head to foot in one swift glance made up mind that man be rogue adventurer if nothing worse be not tall be very lean face be swarthy have hook nose black moustache pair of restless shifty dark eye accurately dressed in evening suit wore too much jewellery yet for did not look vulgar there be somewhat dangerous air about herrick watching face intently made up mind that don manuel be half caste indian be pleased to meet seor said don manuel in good english with foreign accent dr herrick ah know name indeed said dr jim looking surprised robin also shared astonishment expressed why santiago did not tell knew herrick said a took seat at table did not replied don carelessly ah be doubt because name be never mentioned between if be not mistaken said addressing directly to jim be concerned in strange case of friend colonel carr herrick almost bounded from seat that here of place in so unexpected way must meet with stranger who knew carr be like fiction have incident occurred in novel must have put down a freak of imagination on author part yet thing have happened in real life to be carr friend of yours asked twelve year more ago replied santiago quietly knew one intimately in mexico mexico muttered herrick recalling what be have said about frisco tale of north south america not in peru went to peru together on expedition what sort of expedition asked joyce eagerly to make fortune be sort of expedition be bound to undertake herrick thought of colonel carr money be on point of learning sufficient of man wild life in america to reveal what secret be did succeed asked did not colonel did afterwards returned to england lost sight of when came over six month ago heard of intended to pay visit put off off off until made rapid gesture poor carr be sad end unexpected one said herrick fixing eye on man did know servant frisco replied manuel calmly frisco be after time before forget somehow herrick felt instinctively that be lie according to be ex sailor have be with carr throughout wandering life be incredible that if such be case jim preferred to believe frisco rather than santiago that frisco must not have gone on to peru must be needed on expedition such a manuel spoke of be treasure hunting asked jim don manuel nodded yes peruvian buried lot of gold jewel at time of conquest carr got wind of hiding place from one indian believe induced to go with to peru be doing nothing at time so went carr found treasure believe so colonel carr be rich be not very rich chimed in joyce do remember herrick how astonished be at magnificence of house remember said herrick curtly interruption did not please a wanted particularly to hear what santiago have to say seor manuel if started on search together how be that know for certain if colonel carr be successful don manuel face grew black eye flashed if must know reason seor colonel carr be devil have said herrick with short laugh be news shared expense of expedition be to share profit carr treated shamefully treasure be said to be concealed beyond cuzco where doe not matter know intend to tell fell ill at first stage of journey after left cuzco be amongst mountain what did carr do left to care of indian pushed on be last saw of devil for two year be held captive amongst indian barely escaped with life hunted for carr when got to callao have disappeared traced to mexico vanished from vera cruz be worn out ill went back to own family year thought nothing about colonel chance brought to england chance led to hear where colonel carr be settled a said must have seen to reproach for treachery don manuel shrugged be dead be end strange story not creditable to carr said herrick wondering if be lie who be told where colonel carr lived did not said joyce on whose face jim eye rested for moment knew nothing of until moment where name seor can be of little interest to said don with sneer be in london tell more want to tell anything retorted blood rushing to face so far be interested in story if choose to be silent be at liberty to do so pardon said manuel humbly did not intend to provoke anger a spoke there be nasty glitter in eye can not tell who gave information without breaking confidence with friend herrick grunted said nothing santiago be evidently dangerous little devil for knew mexican might have have something to do with murder of strange circumstance herrick have stumbled upon surely be strangest to find man who knew of past of colonel carr in company of robin joyce a meal be now at end three adjourned to study where began to smoke herrick have pipe joyce cigarette manuel produced one of long lean mexican cigar that only hardened smoker can enjoy a bent forward over spirit lamp jim saw by touch of grey on temple wrinkle down side of neck that man be much older than have thought at first glance santiago looked if wanted to be disagreeable say thirty five herrick be now sure be over fifty man be in wonderfully good condition having noticed at table jim saw that be abstemious temperate for reason not apparent manuel desired to ingratiate with herrick tried by picturesque talk to banish disagreeable impression have made by last remark told most wonderful story of adventure by land sea according to own account have lived life of hair breadth escape south america knew from quito to horn have explored unknown portion at risk of life have be captive to indian have be tortured herrick noted that left ear be missing have be almost frozen while ascending chimborazo then have hunted for treasure fought for with knife when be found by own confession have more than one death to account told in vivid picturesque language with wonderful command of english tongue herrick complimented on capability a linguist oh know seven eight language said manuel boastfully not to speak of indian dialect have be over europe yes seor when made money have made great deal came always to europe to spend did royally oh know in capital of give vienna oh seor be known on prater to police doubt thought herrick for own private reason did not give vent to opinion said aloud suppose don manuel be not surprised to hear of colonel carr death santiago flashed quick glance at imperturbable countenance of doctor oh be said to escape danger of tropic then to die in quiet little english village strange to be sure though added manuel with glance brought murderer with frisco be capable of anything oh put in herrick sharply thought did not know frisco did seor said santiago covering mistake with wonderful swiftness heard of be devil worse than carr if can be possible be attached to one quarrelled oh yes seor assure quarrelled once over game of card carr slashed frisco across face oh be be murmured herrick a recalled criss cross slash on frisco face have be described to queer couple what be frisco real name know snapped manuel with surprising curtness considering late voluble talk shortly took leave with politely expressed hope that must meet herrick again when mexican be gone joyce turned eagerly to friend asked what thought of if want to know real opinion be thorough little blackguard cut robin will get into trouble see why must be decent fellow only vice be gambling must sell shirt to gamble humph look card sharper where doe gamble principally in club down in pimlico parrot club very few people know about play be very high oh so met santiago there said herrick lazily joyce saw trap avoided told met at apollo club be respectable enough hope archy johnstone introduced to be decent be oh have nothing to say replied herrick with yawn putting on coat only if man get into trouble blame will probably induce to gamble new income of five hundred year will go once for peculiar expression swept across joyce face opened shut hand nervously however held tongue having said good night herrick went away sorry to see that friend be in such bad company regarded don manuel a rook joyce a pigeon knew little man well enough to know that interference be vain joyce must be a obstinate a mule at time when got back to guelph hotel be close on eleven same stephen be sitting up for over meditative pipe sight of honest handsome face be quite relief to herrick after crafty look of manuel truth to tell joyce have fallen also in herrick estimation for a man must not compare with marsh not for first time dr jim began to think there be something sly evil about robin hitherto have be too much taken up with man nerve to think much of moral character after long absence saw plainly that joyce be deteriorating rapidly company have be in very night proved if there be truth in saying that bird of feather flock together hullo stephen said herrick taking off coat why did not go to bed man sitting up alone like maid on eve of st agnes did not want to go to bed until came home said stephen know always like have whisky thanks shove over tobacco jar well marsh have arranged about sale of practice be right be delighted be sure mind giving up not for thousand year replied herrick with laugh never made so much in medical life not to mention delight of society what have be doing shopping mostly then called in on frith frith to talk about business heard of friend joyce there deuce did said jim wheeling round have just be dining with think be improved frith frith be lawyer know how did name crop up in course of talk about colonel business herrick stared what do mean asked roughly well will be rather astonished continued marsh lighting pipe fact be colonel carr allowed mr joyce mother of friend income of five hundred year no said herrick thought that be just sum robin said have be left by mother will yes why know must frith tell colonel never called to see mr joyce never wrote letter directed frith to pay annuity of five hundred pound annuity then ceased at death of course son get nothing reason frith mentioned be that wished to know if have found anything amongst uncle paper likely to show why annuity have be paid whether ought to be continued to son queer said herrick remembered that robin have told that have interviewed lawyer have be informed of income why have robin told lie suppose said doctor after pause that frith did not take upon to promise joyce continuance of annuity certainly not replied stephen have right of course told that knew nothing about matter must not pay anything to joyce still a be friend never mind that want to pay anything did joyce call to see frith do know week after mother death have not be since told then that need not expect more money week after mother death related doctor be two month later be on walking tour did not joyce call to see frith somewhere about twenty fourth of july be towards end of april called have not be near since look rather pale herrick be nothing replied doctor have have rather turn be chapter ix herrick be suspicious dr jim slept very little that night be turning over in mind joyce strange conduct now that remembered robin have be very particular a to detail of whereabouts have gone to town on tuesday leaving herrick at southberry railway inn according to story have seen frith frith same afternoon again next morning intervening night have slept at hull hotel in side street off strand then on wednesday afternoon have rejoined dr jim at southberry on thursday morning have started to cross heath be on same night that two have discovered body of colonel carr so far herrick have believed story now fact that have not called on lawyer have put different complexion on affair also statement concerning money left to be proved by evidence of solicitor who paid annuity to be lie robin therefore have not be so deeply plunged in grief a appeared to be when must call few day after mother death to see if be to inherit money herrick considered that probably when alone in flat have found paper stating that five hundred year terminated at mother death have gone to frith frith in order to ascertain if be true besides mother might have told on deathbed what else have told colonel carr be not man to pay out money for nothing mr joyce must have have hold over however main point that vexed dr jim most be fact that robin have not called on solicitor a said have done at southberry have received letter calling up to town jim have not read letter since robin have told content never doubted that be from firm of frith if have not called on why be letter sent where be during two day be in town herrick reckoned back date be thursday twenty sixth of july when arrived at saxham robin have gone to town on twenty fourth on same night colonel carr according to medical evidence have be shot good heaven said jim when came into mind can be possible that joyce killed man there be reason why must be suspicious fool be in london even though did not call on solicitor there be proof that be at saxham said when went through pine wood that did not know country then jim recollected that be robin who have selected route for walking tour must be possible that knew of existence of house in pine wood have designedly led herrick way in order that murder must be discovered suspicion averted from cried jim tossing turning must not have contrived so damnable scheme besides slept at hull hotel in way kept arguing out situation by morning have come to conclusion evidence against robin be not strong enough while shaving dr jim made up mind to call on frith frith also to look in at hull hotel nevertheless found resolved to hold tongue so far a robin be concerned joyce be far too intimate with don manuel to please herrick don manuel a doctor remembered professed hatred of carr also might have something to do with matter stephen said herrick at breakfast want to look after again to day have business to do right replied marsh can amuse there be national gallery to see tower westminster abbey must only bore taking to place be never bored in company said jim absently thought intent on what have to do will be at service to morrow have to see about practice suppose herrick yes also other business how long do want to stay in town week be enough for present replied marsh came for two did not have got clothes need will be ready by end of week then can go back want to return yes have idea in head later on will tell to marsh turned to ask what herrick meant seeing that friend be taken up with own thought said nothing after breakfast jim left marsh to look over morning paper went out first place sought out be lawyer office mr frith junior partner received more readily when heard name on previous day stephen have be enthusiastic on subject of new friend frith junior took to jim at once be glad to see said pushing forward chair mr marsh carr told about be glad have have good sense to select a companion need shaking up marsh be good fellow replied jim anything can do to make man of will be done material be there mr frith yes step mother of did great deal to ruin must not call soul own think death be much to be regretted finished frith with dry smile be rather stormy think really loved step son what be smiling at be recalling one two interview have with lady in question said young lawyer be a say stormy even colonel be afraid of so sent up to what did come about annuity for herself income for son present owner of estate colonel carr refused to allow one penny said that have made will in favour of stephen marsh that mr marsh must wait until death tried hard to persuade to allow something refused mr marsh used to come up make scene in office stormy chuckled frith must think be what be opinion of colonel carr well drawled lawyer with quick glance be rather leading question man be dead be good client to speaking a man to man in confidence doctor think be greatest scoundrel in three kingdom be rather strong mr frith yet fall short of truth dr herrick however man be dead so may leave at rest met with terrible death own familiar friend put end to colonel have not much human feeling when dying must have felt pang at thought that only creature have be kind to be putting out of way humph said jim using favourite ejaculation do believe that frisco did kill know anyone else who must have done so if did not why did run away why doe keep hidden yes dr herrick think crime can be safely put down to account queer man too added frith reflectively be slangy good bit of brute yet there be something of gentleman about must speak good english when chose be not often colonel brought from south america did now said frith sharply never knew that before frisco at time came up about carr business be careful to say nothing about seemed fond of master be why be so strange must have killed then know that collie be most faithful of dog go mad at time attack master expect be something of same kind with frisco do know how colonel made money asked herrick doe anyone else that know of be certain of one thing that be made in shady way carr be out out bad lot kind of captain kidd strange that must mention name in conjunction with kidd have treasure likewise have not what do mean by 'have treasure likewise ' herrick considered minute before replying a rule be not man given to loose speaking preferred to do own work without assistance of one saw that frith be shrewd capable man that in case of need advice be not to be despised so far a joyce be concerned jim did not intend to say anything at present a be not yet sure of ground even have be sure must have hesitated to betray friend however guilty might be concerning don manuel have such scruple so then there told lawyer have passed at flat frith listened attentively seemed in way astonished be sort of thing one must expect from carr said man be bad lot daresay if knew detail of expedition must find le innocent than mexican have depicted still leaving man amongst indian be bad enough so be how made money always knew be not made in respectable way few fortune be said herrick dryly be true method may be more damnable than others a in case carr know went away many year ago a poor a rat have heard father speak of came back ten year ago with end of money helped to invest a income be eight thousand year dr herrick may guess what principal amounted to treasure hunting sound innocent enough even romantic in carr hand can guess what piece of rascality be man must not run straight if there be possibility of going wrong way took that in preference to following right path still said herrick approaching main object of visit man have good point for instance be charitable to mr joyce of west kensington said frith with stare how did know about joyce be friend of mine be with on walking tour when received letter asking to call nonsense never wrote man letter in life not on about twenty third of july be positive must have known be true that called to see few day after mother death about annuity carr ordered to be paid to mr joyce wanted to know if must have also communicated with colonel carr who replied in characteristic way that joyce must go to devil afterwards joyce called second time told message second time be on twenty fourth of july be towards end of april have not seen since a say have written letter concise explanation showed herrick that robin for reason of own have told deliberate lie have come to london about be not to see solicitor a have alleged to herrick dr jim pulled moustache reflectively why be annuity paid to mr joyce know replied frith even if did must be breach of professional etiquette to tell year after colonel came back to england about nine year ago ordered father to send monthly cheque to mr joyce at address at hampstead sent receipt time never came to see have absolutely nothing to do with when changed address did several time notified fact sent allowance to new place be know of annuity a say colonel stopped when died what be for know colonel be dark in many way be evidently most dangerous person said herrick rising to take leave however have received reward of crime by way suppose business of marsh be in hand yes be in order colonel be most methodical man left estate in best of condition be now arranging for letter patent for change of name client have arranged to call marsh carr suppose did not like idea of carr alone can wonder at considering reputation of name no not very nice name to give one wife laughed frith rising well good bye dr herrick be glad to have seen still more glad to think that client have so excellent friend at elbow herrick laughed at praise departed very pleased that have be received in so friendly way fancied at one time frith might have looked upon a interloper be great compliment to that shrewd lawyer must be so satisfied with stephen choice of friend from city herrick went to strand in search of hull hotel be now very doubtful of robin honesty if man have lied in one thing must in jim be quite prepared to find joyce be not known at strand public house in instance proved to be wrong directed by friendly policeman soon found place be small pot house of anything reputable appearance herrick stepped inside be confronted by stout woman with squint in answer to inquiry for landlord announced that house belonged to demanded business herrick seeing necessity for caution went about task in artful way there be friend of mine who stayed here on night of twenty fourth of july last said wrote to from place on date a have received letter since have come to inquire if be still to be found here what be name sir mr robin joyce know grunted landlady robin joyce rubbed nose then shouted tilda do know party a stayed here called robin joyce look up book twenty fourth july smart looking girl dressed in tawdry manner made appearance requested mother stout lady be mother appeared not to make such noise then addressed to herrick need not look at book sir remember mr robin joyce quite well little man be not clean shaven with rather long hair big big black eye nervous manner sir be replied herrick thankful to hear that friend be known at address have given slept here on night of twenty fourth of july beg pardon sir did nothing of sort came here after mid day with black bag engaged room then went out almost at once promising to be back to dinner be ordered never came sir did not see until mid day next morning be certain did not sleep here on night quite certain sir remember mother told of when came back that have be staying with friend yes remember now then paid bill went away to catch train said paddington train put in daughter heard tell cabby to drive to paddington herrick thanked two woman for information asked if mr joyce have be there since be positive have not saw only once sir did not sleep here be last word of daughter so herrick departed fully convinced that robin have told second lie naturally little man never thought that anything must happen likely to induce herrick to make enquires must such have be case for stephen remark about annuity question now said herrick to be whether be at saxham on night if can prove that shook head acknowledged that thing be beginning to look black against joyce for moment almost made up mind to go at once to west kensington tell joyce whole story demanding at same time explanation of apparently unnecessary lie on second thought resolved to wait until must make certain that joyce have gone down to saxham robin must probably take afternoon train to beorminster in case however must have have to change at southberry junction a herrick be at junction might not risk doing so there be heathcroft of course be six mile from saxham must be reached by line might have gone way walked six mile can not say anything for certain until make enquiry thought herrick so resolved to wait until returned to pine with next two three day herrick spent with stephen not word did say about business have be employed upon did not even speak of joyce tried not to think of gave up to enjoyment of moment owing to recent bereavement stephen must not go to theatre two managed to find amusement in exploring london with greatest good humour herrick permitted to be dragged to tower abbey to several other place stephen have already visited also there be much shopping to do clothes to be tried on kind of fascinating thing to be bought stephen purchased selection of present for biff made herrick help to choose arranged to go back at week end when pine must be ready to receive expect be in order by time said stephen ida promised to see after servant for be be superintending whole business have told to do exactly a plea there be nothing like better will find place in apple pie order when go back why do not marry miss be said herrick laughing like be very much be not wife for said stephen seriously ida be better suited to herrick felt pang of jealousy what chance have against wealthy favourite of fortune then rebuked for ungrateful feeling swore if saw least love existing between marsh ida that must at once crush down own passion a yet a have told joyce be not very strong in sunshine of ida beauty charm might easily assume gigantic proportion if did stephen loved why then good bye to income for herrick felt that under circumstance situation must be so unbearable that must be forced to leave saxham if stephen must only say definitely if loved girl herrick must know how to act at present be quite in dark still until must be quite sure judged wiser to hold well in hand later on occurred to that must see joyce ask to come down to saxham if have really committed murder of there be a yet proof must naturally refuse to come on other hand might dare a much however on whole a straw show way wind blow knew what nervous man joyce be herrick thought must be able to decide by manner if really have dislike to saxham therefore one afternoon went to west kensington by time have settled with grant about practice arranged manner of payment sole business be with robin went at once to mansion servant said that mr joyce be absent be expected in soon that gentleman be waiting in drawing room to see herrick have suspicion at once be not at surprised to meet smiling face of don manuel santiago ah have come to see friend said mexican shaking herrick hand in most hearty manner also will be back shortly how be don manuel said herrick politely well hope speech be obvious fact be herrick be observing mexican from under eyelid when santiago thought unobserved stole glance at visitor apparently neither liked trusted doctor wondered what bond bound robin scamp together joyce be scamp also worse if visit to saxham must be proved manuel answered inquiry with careless speech puzzled look evidently wondering why be made after time began to walk restlessly about room exclaiming that wanted cigarette have exhausted own herrick politely offered case a wanted to put mexican at ease get to speak in hope of learning something from don manuel refused offer smoke only own particular kind said ah now remember left in joyce study will go look for will come also seor have better smoke in study joyce doe not like smoke in room cast look round shrugged ugly room said don manuel spitefully herrick followed rather because wished to keep shifty creature in sight than because wanted to smoke manuel went to writing table shifted paper about searched mantelpiece then casting eye on tobacco cabinette walked towards that have found put in there said manuel pulled open several drawer cabinet be at herrick elbow must see into drawer a mexican opened in lowest drawer be pistol don manuel took out strange place to keep revolver said be not revolver what can be so large so clumsy seor herrick took weapon handed to while manuel continued search for cigarette frightful suspicion flashed into mind a saw old fashioned weapon in mexican hand remembered that death wound have be inflicted by roughly cast bullet at inquest be said such have be fired from antique pistol here be very thing in hand old pistol silver mounted clumsy in extreme muzzle be large must well fire big bullet have passed through heart of carr to bury in opposite wall be in joyce house herrick felt sick manuel turned to with shrug there be cigarette here said joyce have smoked seor look ill pale be nothing replied herrick replacing weapon in cabinet be subject to attack of faintness think don manuel that have better say nothing to joyce about finding that pistol might not like to be prying into cabinet a please said santiago with shrug joyce must never be angry with be pistol seor oh old fashioned weapon joyce brought in curiosity shop very probably replied doctor carelessly certainly be not kind of thing one must use replied don manuel equally carelessly ugly thing will say nothing cigarette seor will take one of yours ah there be dear friend joyce while mexican be lighting cigarette robin entered greeted herrick rather stiffly be jim must do to bring to shake hand with man now believed to be criminal yet in spite of have learned in spite of discovery of old fashioned pistol must not yet bring quite to believe in robin guilt still hoped for best talked easily enough how pale be jim said joyce abruptly what be matter be so much countryman now that london doe not agree with joyce laughed at joke prefer london be pity said herrick for be returning to saxham to morrow want to come down for few day next week will be delighted replied robin at once can put up at carr arm know marsh know daresay when meet will ask to stay at 'the pine said herrick will come down robin have seen so little of want friendship to end so abruptly certainly will come with pleasure replied joyce so warmly that herrick heart smote for treachery when remembered how joyce have deceived how have led to very house in to appearance have committed crime doctor heart grew hard be quite prepared to play part trap man be now beginning to regard robin a little reptile extremely dangerous who needed to be crushed will come next week said joyce gaily if marsh like may a say ask to 'the pine might come also manuel perhaps if have day to spare said mexican must like to see place where dear friend carr died glanced at herrick a spoke doctor be not attending to did not see look tea be being brought in herrick wanted to get away at once felt that knowing what did must never break bread with robin again fervently hoped that man be innocent thing looked black must go now robin said herrick hurriedly remember must come promise wo have tea thanks marsh expects good bye until meet at saxham don manuel adieu till meet at saxham said ready foreigner herrick hurried out of room down stair not till be in train did remember that must have be wise enough to have secured pistol a evidence may not be guilty after said jim hopefully heart told that be wrong circumstantial evidence be too strong chapter x secret writing dr jim must not conceal from that be rather jumping at conclusion with regard to guilt of joyce man have deliberately lied about visit to frith have not slept at hull hotel a have stated herrick must not account for robin movement on night of twenty fourth of july on same night colonel carr have met with death then again robin be connected indirectly with carr through mother although there be nothing to show relation have existed between colonel mr joyce finally joyce be in possession of old fashioned weapon firing round bullet of antiquated sort carr have be killed with just bullet be evidence jim must find be likely to inculpate robin on other hand there be reason why joyce must not be able to defend certainly must not explain away lie have told herrick about visit to solicitor pretended income might be able to account for doings on night of twenty fourth for possession of pistol after have shown hesitation in accepting herrick invitation to saxham if be guilty must be afraid to venture there lest must be met by one who have seen on night of murder in vicinity of pine determination to come to saxham looked like innocence jim granted a much most important link to be discovered in chain of evidence be way in robin if guilty have come to saxham owing to presence of herrick at southberry must not have risked going by line seeing that have to change at junction other line branched off from main trunk before reached southberry touched at heathcroft six mile from saxham herrick made up mind that when got to saxham must go to heathcroft to make inquiry if must prove that robin have alighted at station there must no longer be doubt of guilt doubt joyce if have come to heathcroft have disguised might not think of increasing stature by artificial mean be so exceptionally small that even most casual observer must remark upon will give opportunity of defending thought herrick if find that came to heathcroft will have to account to for doings must know truth else part with a friend for ever then doctor thought with qualm that if did learn truth parting might be more complete than imagined if joyce be indeed guilty must find in dilemma a to whether must hold tongue denounce man have be so friendly with must not be pleasant position be when be in train that herrick thought of with stephen be returning to saxham two have provided with newspaper magazine to beguile tedium of journey for time herrick have be concealed behind daily telegraph pretending to read in reality have be thinking over case of robin joyce marsh be in good spirit inclined to talk so dr jim yielded for after thought be anything pleasant be glad to go back to saxham stephen said marsh carr a must now be called nodded smiled very glad said find little of london go long way want to be in own country amongst own friend will have large circle soon stephen when be settled at 'the pine county will call will be delighted that in beautiful house there will be one can know must make carr family once more important in county be afraid be not ambitious said stephen nature be somewhat retiring one fancy will attend to estate write poetry have desire to go into parliament not least book friend be what want of course will try do good in own way wish to take part in public life there will be plenty for to do in small way herrick think be right responded herrick soberly have have wretched life hitherto that be fair must have few year of enjoyment must travel for time before settle down will be pleased to of course a know will not be able to leave saxham until end of year want to be certain of holding property wonder why uncle left instruction that new vault must be built must be visited why for year can not understand replied herrick uncle be man of mystery have learned something of past stephen herrick related meeting with don manuel what have be told about doings of carr in south america stephen looked uneasy grave hope money be obtained in quite proper way said otherwise must be afraid to use if be what gipsy call red money be obtained by bloodshed must rather give up for can bring only curse think need trouble on score replied jim with shrug heaven know that carr be not scrupulous with regard to fortune brought home if be taken from treasure chamber of inca monarch spoil be legitimate enough if came across treasure must have hesitation in taking worst feature of expedition be leaving of santiago with indian a be still alive harm have be done do think ought to give money asked stephen certainly not be herrick emphatic reply in first place know that story be true in second place be convinced that mexican be scoundrel in third be not place to impoverish for sake of other people wish must find out story of uncle life well don manuel be probably coming down to saxham on sentimental pilgrimage to see grave of man detested may tell know if question probably will tell very pretty story said stephen dryly will be true want arabian night herrick shrugged shoulder must not care to take santiago word said still amongst lie there may be grain of truth where real truth will be found be in secret writing be gave to be cried marsh carr with smile dr jim coloured apologised slip of tongue said hear talk of be so frequently that be apt to fall into same habit writing added hurriedly to avoid further explanation a know can make nothing of yet if must read something tangible might be discovered really see why must trouble at about uncle villainy said marsh carr rather impatiently estate be mine now want to enjoy without worrying conscience of course do worry a to writing there be cryptogram in 'telegraph resembles paper showed here be in agony column herrick took newspaper looked at paragraph indicated by stephen jumble of letter did indeed resemble on piece of chinese paper in print cryptogram be a follows eqhrbn gxcd ozqj bnqmdq nbsnadq rodzj sn aktd bknsgdr vghsd gzs fknur rgndr dzqqr lnmdx dr jim read over twice then took out chinese paper compared two cryptogram believe secret writing be same said with excitement see stephen in there be figure in figure be same fifteen believe that be inserted by one who knew carr may be from frisco communicating with third person about murder true enough replied stephen yet might merely be coincidence if figure be not same might think so that in there must be fifteen be strange to say least of perhaps thirty be key to cipher might be so said herrick studying 'telegraph be hanged if can see how to apply oh that edgar allen poe be at hand must unravel cipher in ten minute man have marvellous gift in way once read book on cipher writing said marsh carr after pause said that to unravel line of secret writing be best to search for character represented ' e ' since letter be used more frequently than other in english language there lay finger on weak spot said jim quickly cipher may be written in spanish for know why in spanish particularly because if applied to colonel carr doings be most likely language must use other than english be mostly in mexico peru if manuel be to be believed there spanish be spoken a know stephen may be writing in tongue well herrick know spanish so might yes might interrupted dr jim sarcastically if be acquainted with secret writing be dutch to worse for have knowledge of dutch absolutely none of let try e idea stephen see what make of chinese paper cipher be shortest will count letter be most frequent call ' e ' something may come of attempt herrick counted stephen checked reckoning four 'd ' said jim five ' k ' three ' z three ' r ' humph seems to that ' k ' be predominating letter once come 'kk might stand for double ' e ' well will call ' e ' here be two ' r ' together said stephen might stand also for double ' e ' yes forget that there be five ' k ' to three ' r ' agreed to call letter predominated ' e ' right fire away

to post office for letter held one in hand only one have come that day be about three month ago shortly after picked up piece of chinese paper one shook at herrick understand go on noticed that envelope of letter frisco carried be of same paper have cried doctor be interesting yes frisco be shaking letter waving over head singing stopped to tell ought to be ashamed of being in state when knew perfectly well how to behave one minute interrupted herrick remembering what frith have said be frisco gentleman yes replied be have refined way of speaking in spite of frightful american slang used at time when be quite sober must speak to in most refined way at other time be just awful large fat man be not yes immensely stout face be rather handsome be about same age a colonel there be something attractive about frisco finished be with sigh be own worst enemy well about letter be waving singing met in pine wood where have be to look for sidney told that might lose since be so drunk laughed said one must read knew letter by envelope have said herrick by chinese paper be noticeable well asked what meant laughed again went away singing on one move on one took notice of word at time a have cipher letter in hand have often wondered if applied word to cipher move one on repeated herrick excitedly glanced at chinese paper cipher humph stephen thought that fifteen itkx might be date if cipher have to do with murder date interrupted be eagerly well colonel carr be murdered in july dr jim in word july there be four letter see what mean here be four letter itkx also number fifteen move on one said be repeating cry of frisco be take next figure to one five two six said herrick by heaven must mean twenty sixth move on one of four letter stand j t for u k for l x in place of y july cried herrick dashing down pen here be solution of cryptogram twenty sixth of july repeated be colonel be murdered on twenty fourth see connection have not worked out whole cipher yet said dr jim here take pen write down alphabet be did a rapidly a possible a saw what doctor meant now place under b b under c so on to end of alphabet be did also can put z under letter said yes can z go under have heard of cipher be written with misleading letter simply take next letter for one be down come will apply result to cipher be what got in chinese paper cipher last warning till july then death unless in printed cipher of 'daily telegraph frisco hyde park corner october speak to blue clothes white hat glove shoe carr money chapter xi settling down cipher be so simple that herrick wondered that have not solved before merely consisted of alphabet arranged in two line a follows abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy cipher be written by using second line a though be first have to be done be to write out alphabet a above use first line in place of second nothing must be more ingenious when be known more simple for herrick must not have found key have not recollected stephen remark that number fifteen might be date have not be related frisco apparently meaningless word however here be reading of riddle colonel carr have be warned to do certain thing be threatened with death if did not do be given up to twenty sixth of july punishment vengeance whatever be have be executed on twenty fourth jim must see reason for anticipation of cipher letter a to cryptogram in agony column of daily telegraph must seem that someone knew that frisco be in london wished to see about carr money rather bore out herrick belief that there be conspiracy in progress to rob stephen of inherited wealth be captain manuel striking in dark have robin joyce anything to do with matter herrick asked question did not seek answer from be until be absolutely sure of robin guilt did not wish to say word if told be about santiago must have to reveal what joyce have presumably done at event mere mention of santiago name where met must invite question regarding joyce if be dr jim said be next day when met to talk over discovery must go up to london wait at hyde park corner will be easy for to see person dressed a noticeably a man who put in cipher intends to be must think navy blue serge with white hat glove boot must attract attention can then see if person meet frisco give frisco in charge finished herrick said miss endicotte decisively must not do at present public opinion circumstantial evidence be so much against frisco that must not have fair trial if did murder colonel carr believe can prove by watching see where man who meet be going follow on be guided by circumstance how to act have idea who put in dr jim suspected don manuel did not think wise to say so really can not be sure said shirking question of course be in dark about business again notice that time be mentioned in cipher oh can understand replied be producing slip of paper from pocket when got home last night looked through file of 'daily telegraph given to by colonel carr thought there might be third cipher see here be appeared about beginning of august herrick looked at third cipher be worded exactly same a one have appeared in newspaper at later date save that in hour of three o'clock be mentioned a time of meeting humph said dr jim wonder if frisco obeyed first request be sure did answered be readily if have not time of meeting must be put into second dr jim be because person who want to meet frisco met first time that have omitted hour know that frisco will be there at three o'clock if come at go up see what can do be now twenty second said herrick after moment all right will go up must say nothing of to stephen to anyone replied be warmly let work out thing put end to conspiracy be sure be one added for see carr money be mentioned hope poor stephen will not be murdered next hope not said herrick rather gloomily be recalling what mr marsh have said to about frisco of possible danger to step son at event will look after carefully seems to show frisco be not good man thought doe look bad for frisco admitted be dejectedly still may be able to explain if can only summon up courage to take trial must not like to be mistaken in frisco there be something liked about well will go up to town watch said herrick by way friend joyce be coming down here next week to stay for time be so glad said be eagerly saw only glimpse of last time be author will have so much to talk about herrick be rather annoyed by enthusiasm did not like idea of joyce whom suspected being too great friend of girl yet when came to think over matter annoyance be ridiculous be jealous of stephen with ida now irritated at prospect of be getting on well with robin love two of said herrick to with vexed laugh yet like at event if joyce doe come down will keep apart a much a possible must know truth about joyce before let again into circle of friend in case be liar if worse be unsatisfactory frame of mind in to renew friendship jim have such intention finding that robin have told two deliberate falsehood made up mind that be at end between herrick have very high opinion of sacredness of friendship be in addition a dr johnson said good hater either liked man greatly disliked immensely with utmost calmness went to work to get quondam friend by side in order to learn truth if joyce have murdered carr if be mixed up with frisco don manuel in conspiracy against stephen there be punishment did not deserve although herrick be hard be also just chance must be given to joyce to prove innocence if in end proved to be guilty jim knew in heart of heart that must let go free much a might deserve punishment of law jim felt that for sake of old friendship must not be one to hand over to justice must not be thought that herrick took discovery calmly suffered greatly on learning worthlessness of man have so trusted have saved robin life by nursing through dangerous illness have be attracted by ambition to become great novelist have also tried to make man of by strengthening will mending nerve being sorry for tortured creature since man be so inherently bad herrick sternly cut off from waited only to be certain of worst to cast robin out of life until be certain gave benefit of doubt be painful position jim set teeth stuck to journey to town be complete failure herrick watched at hyde park corner day thereby incurred unjust suspicion of police saw eccentrically dressed individual who have described in cipher ex sailor whom hoped to recognise by monstrous stoutness if chance offered by scar on forehead one of came to rendezvous so dr jim returned to saxham sadder not wiser man be consoled must have got suspicion that be being watched said sooner later of cipher will appear in paper will have chance of catching humph said jim disbelieving if be suspicious will make other arrangement for see must have guessed that in way have solved cipher be darkness mystery said herrick vexedly for time being at event intend to put out of head did with considerable success there be much to do at pine with new master estate have to be put in order more servant have to be engaged with assistance of ida wall fence have to be put up again also new vault be rapidly approaching completion stephen hoped to have uncle body removed into before christmas in meantime did not neglect to go monthly even weekly to family sepulchre to see that be safe a yet nothing have be disturbed stephen began to think that necessity of protecting body of wicked colonel be moonshine herrick knew better still believed in existence of conspiracy kept eye ear open be well in day marsh carr have so watchful guardian joyce arrived at carr arm with don manuel two made very agreeable herrick did not approve of calling at biffstead either have to quarrel openly with tolerate acquaintance a row must have spoilt plan perhaps if suspicion be correct exposed stephen to danger herrick held peace made agreeable indeed robin santiago have idea that be enemy so well did play part dr jim hated to wear mask much must be done by guile nothing at must be gained by force so consented to do violence to usually open nature meantime devoted to educating stephen out of door horse be bought two rode daily herrick taught stephen how to swim to fence to box to golf indeed biff also took to golfing for herrick obtained permission to lay out part of heath a link then young men maiden of county came to play saxham became quite busy even beorminster people contrived to learn game clerical society there curate dean even canon played with zest judgment herrick a original starter of game be voted acquisition to county made much of stephen be asked everywhere a week went by marsh carr became different man lost air of shyness became straighter in back spent le time poring over book more in open air needle to say be warmly attached to doctor be now jim steve between biff approved of friendship since have lost friendship of robin herrick paid more attention to ida never paused to analyse feeling towards foolishly believed that loved knew better smiled at attention paid to by dr jim herrick be wiser than neighbour when came to question of sex because admired ida thought that be only woman in world for have never be in love before mistook affection felt for beautiful kind hearted girl for genuine passion spoken of by poet if be jim did not think be so bad a made out have not felt wound so jested at scar of others ida be amused at dear large stupid creature played rle of omphale to hercules knew quite well when to pull up when attention became too pressing did so in own quiet way strange to say stephen did not notice friend folly if did made remark one day biff took afternoon tea in pine wood round mansion stephen herrick be there biff don manuel with robin latter be much excited chattered on in merry way amused everyone save herrick who looked at rather sourly be be too attentive to joyce to please doctor come sit by mr joyce said making place beside when sat on grass for tea will feed ah what privilege put in santiago be frowned did not like spaniard be so hungry announced robin jim sit over there by miss endicotte mr marsh can sit beside miss flo santiago placed beside sidney who at once got up walked away to other side of circle sidney hated mexican openly said a much there be bad feeling about said sidney sometimes shivered turned pale when in don manuel company mexican did not seem annoyed understood sidney better than did others said did explained reason to herrick doctor laughed at when be explained declined to argue such nonsense at don manuel smiled did not take offence have own reason for remaining on friendly term with jim how pleasant be here said be looking at green bough overhead so solitary one must think be mile away in country so be said robin amidst general laugh how many more mile do want to be miss be girl laughed know what mean perfectly well of course nothing must be more absolutely rural than saxham be same what meant to say be that human habitation can be seen hereabouts tower have disappeared said stephen gravely used to be visible from here just over two pine santiago chimed in ah be where poor friend met with death wonder be not afraid to live in house seor why must be afraid put in ida rather indignantly ghost be not pleasant thing said mexican with shrug do mean to say that wicked colonel walk asked robin be talking nonsense said herrick who be beginning to find conversation disagreeable in presence of stephen not in good taste there be such thing a ghost room in colonel carr died have be demolished if talk like ignorant country people will be inventing legend sidney who have be listening to very quietly looking first at one speaker then at other let grave blue eye fall upon doctor how do know that there be such thing a ghost demanded there be have seen everybody shuddered santiago looked at boy with curious smile where have seen ghost asked herrick quietly in wood in village churchyard kind of shape form frighten only bad people be frightened must be added looking at santiago yes responded that gentleman be quite right be glad have not gift of seeing thing laugh at suppose pardon know too much about to laugh tower said sidney suddenly turning to stephen know can see from here often often have sat in darkness under yonder tree watched shape in light streamed from window bad shape wicked spirit said colonel be so wicked that nothing good must come near ida thought that conversation have gone quite far enough when herrick glanced at interposed sidney be talking nonsense boy got up in kind of cold rage always nonsense said because be blind stupid walked away be mad said robin mouth open be be about to contradict rather indignantly when santiago interposed be far from mad said have wonderful gift denied to who be of common clay of course doctor doe not believe in be materialist be not replied herrick rather nettled believe in thing can not be proved by sens said be materialist replied santiago refused to speak further be on occasion when one be present that jim renewed conversation meanwhile doctor be angry at attention paid by joyce to be little man have now known week have taken violent fancy to haunted like shadow did not seem to dislike did a have right to interfere be obliged to look on in silence more than ever regretted folly in inducing robin to come down to saxham not for scheme in world must have be endicotte lose heart to joyce until day idea have never entered head now saw more clearly be be distinctly pleased with robin attention must really get to care for robin be attractive when liked herrick knew that must be forced to interfere even if have to denounce joyce to law must put end to possibility must not even see two together without annoyance rose abruptly to walk away a went in direction of heath by almost same path a joyce have come on terrible night heard light step behind turned to see ida looked more lovely than ever for having followed rapidly face be somewhat flushed just a be on edge of heath laid hand on arm thrill ran through strong frame of doctor thought be love indeed man must have felt a much have ida endicotte touched be beautiful moreover have magnetic attraction drew most sullen under charm how much more then herrick who frankly acknowledged that be what rather obviously called angel follow dr jim said breathlessly believe be better alone know mood be talking of sidney asked herrick in surprise yes thought followed cast look

yearning in breast for companionship sympathy certainly have from stephen stephen be man must not be to what woman must be herrick have lived life so active full of interest that have never found time to think of love of womankind now that there be so to speak pause in life vacuum thus created required to be filled up in way for man be woman created jim be simply yearning although in materialistic blindness did not know for other part of ida have hinted that what wanted must come to yet so blind be jim that must not see advancing vision looked to four point of horizon saw nothing be wonder to in after year that have be so with be that dense gloom herald dawn glory of day be at hand in unsatisfactory mood wanting something yet not knowing what be that wanted jim be anything pleasant

boxed fenced swam took long tramp into country external nature must hing for secret of redemption be within yet did not know how to learn poor jim dark day took much of pride from learned then how poor thing be man how dependent upon force although within be unable through weakness through ignorance to control one form of herrick unrest took shape of being almost openly rude to robin little man be in habit of haunting biffstead be by time desperately in love with be took pain to conceal feeling manuel encouraged for mexican be confidant robin must have told herrick have doctor shown sympathetic disposition to listen jim avoided on occasion perhaps robin guessed cause for let sleeping dog lie never asked what be that have come between knew that must be wiser for to leave saxham yet so deeply be in love that must not tear away from so dangerous neighbourhood jim felt that if spoke to robin might say too much so sounded manuel on subject of leaving wished men to go conspiracy conspiracy mystery of affair be beginning to exasperate jim a have be said before be not in usual good tempered frame of mind one day encountered santiago on common mexican be in good spirit expressed pleasure at meeting doctor nodded grimly did not return compliment when be two going away asked manuel looked up at hard tone saw at once that jim have made up mind to be disagreeable mexican be not lacking in courage have thought of retreating quite understand what mean seor said with coldness be talking of joyce when be going when suit to leave seor have right to stop here if so choose do choose a to joyce have better ask jim saw that have taken wrong tone with man by great effort of will became more friendly need not be angry santiago said only ask because see that joyce be attracted by miss be endicotte be wrong eh santiago shrugged shoulder why must be wrong be most charming lady friend joyce love ridiculous can never marry said herrick angrily there be reason why must not of course be none of business seor fail to see why must speak to about see here don manuel speak to because know robin have come under power of will do what like with want to take away must not ask miss be to marry for very simple reason that have income position marriage must be bad one for girl be in drop cried herrick so fiercely that mexican be cowed be responsible for joyce for also seeing that asked to come here must go away so far a joyce be concerned will use influence be pleased to talk about to get to leave a for rev pentland corn have asked to stop with for week so have accepted pentland corn said herrick surprised what can there be in common between rector oh know be bad man replied mexican smoothly perhaps priest may improve believe did best with colonel carr with may not fail be friend great friend understand muttered herrick eyeing man curiously be there need must retorted don manuel working into rage seor understand that talk to so be right replied jim coolly did not want to quarrel with man a yet need not lose temper like schoolboy can stay century with corn for care joyce if have influence with will go very good must have spoken to influence over be stronger than mine santiago shrugged shoulder ascribe to more power than posse said wish to obtain influence over one to joyce be pleasant friend nothing more when go back to london probably will see little of return to mexico in two month herrick be pleased to hear if there be conspiracy don manuel be mixed up in thing must at event come to head within eight week be time did for herrick be weary of fighting with shadow once have something definite before must fight vague threat in mexican tone assured that must not have long to wait a have excuse for leaving don manuel doctor be forced to return to village with on way passed sidney who be walking towards moor herrick called to boy who merely waved hand passed on jim noticed that face be singularly colourless of hue resembling have assumed when have slept on library sofa prior to announcement of mr marsh death how ill that boy look muttered herrick pardon interposed manuel be not ill be in frame of mind will bring into contact with spiritual intelligence how do know by rapt look fixed eye boy dr herrick be clairvoyant herrick be angry at once be talking jargon of spiritualist said roughly trickery fraud believe nothing of sort seor have seen most extraordinary thing herrick looked at with disdainful smile know be not good man santiago do wish to be thought one credited with more intelligence than to believe in hallucination don manuel not at offended laughed true be not good man said more be pity be afraid to go where lad can go into astral plane understand be a said before materialistic being be not fool dr herrick can tell know something of psychic faculty in mexico have seen most wonderful thing tell about said jim humouring man be sceptic know spiritualism have ever seen be humbug of talk be not spiritualism rejoined manuel coldly be occult science what be good of explaining anything to must only laugh can not see never will see prison of flesh be too strong for to break through be healthy man if be what mean retorted jim about boy be queer admit ah can see said manuel sarcastically congratulate eh foretold death of mr marsh be not so yes be coincidence of course thing be always coincidence to to be proof that boy can enter astral plane doe not know what be be not instructed can go know what be be world be around said manuel waving hand interweaves into world having only limited sens can not see boy have sens finer than ours can see if gave crystal blob of ink shining surface with depth must see most wonderful thing have read zanoni seor bulwer lytton romance yes of course call romance there be much truth in well be useless for to explain besides be not good man to tell must be good that boy however want to make like well then make eat plenty of meat take exercise make fat place amongst boy who will laugh at will be like rest of world will not lose power altogether will come to at odd moment will not be dreamer see will not be able to see have thought of myself said herrick lazily boy be half starved queer poet in temperament will take in hand make like did not say so manuel paused then laughed to night if be not mistaken will astonish said know look have on face something be in air see will tell about will laugh tell about what know be not clairvoyant wait see manuel turning on heel went into carr arm have approached during conversation herrick looked after with smile of contempt charlatan muttered thought be only villain humph think one need be afraid of now same in spite of openly expressed scepticism conversation haunted determined to keep sidney in company see if anything happened herrick scoffed at thing manuel have be talking about yet must not deny that incident of prophecy of mr marsh death be very remarkable indeed jim shuddered a wondered if uncanny boy be about to prophesy something similar however put gruesome thought out of mind went to biffstead here met joyce coming out of gate little man looked quite joyous greeted herrick gaily be just going in be coming to miss endicotte asked to take message to what be said herrick forcing to be civil be most important that must not quarrel with robin at present hated because be obliged to wear mask circumstance of case interest of stephen required miss endicotte want marsh carr to come to dinner have asked also be going back to dress to invite don manuel suppose sneered herrick replied joyce simply either did not notice sneer wished to appear that have not perceived manuel dines with pentland corn to night hear be going to stay with yes corn have taken to one curious must not creditable to corn said herrick went inside leaving joyce staring after little man frowned face assumed most unpleasant expression wonder if know anything thought biting finger be quite different to what used to be care can hold own with defiant declaration marched away holding head in air certainly dr jim be not wrong in suspecting robin to be other than seemed then wo come to dinner said ida when herrick presented what pity be will be disappointed think not replied herrick dryly understand joyce be coming be neither here there will tell stephen that want so will be left alone in house will send over

company stephen shuddered then be glad be going away said that boy be most uncomfortable so uncanny will certainly find more pleasure in miss endicotte society laughed herrick stephen laughed too looked sharply at friend true to reticent nature said nothing in due time marsh carr departed sidney arrived boy have more colour in cheek eye have lost fixed expression noticed by don manuel dr jim be on friendly term sidney be pleased that have be asked to dine same made bad meal dinner be excellent boy restricted to plainest of dish very little of did not touch meat seemed to prefer vegetable herrick noticed abstinence will never grow strong if eat beef sidney said with smile english boy must eat beef never liked replied boy abruptly like meat be disagreeable to never touch wine notice once drank glass of beer ugh sidney made wry face shuddered at recollection how can people like such thing what do live on then asked herrick fruit vegetable plain water often touch tea think be unhealthy feel alright dr jim be never ill ida be always fussing over be much stronger than look appearance be deceptive then said herrick dryly rose to go to library suppose smoke sidney be too young to indulge in perhaps do though never smoke never will suppose be different from other boy thing like to do dislike herrick thought that be queerest lad have ever met for moment dropped subject after time began to talk sport to see if sidney must take interest in boy answered politely be obviously bored not even account of tiger hunt with herrick strove to rouse have effect doctor more puzzled than ever recollecting what santiago have said changed tone of conversation spoke of fakir in india of self mortification vision asserted have be strange conversation for boy of sixteen then sidney be freak woke up upon topic began to talk brightly face became animated look of interest came into eye talked in way so far above year that herrick be astounded seem to know india said sidney often time see picture of in mind bright blue sky brilliant vegetation queerly dressed people long range of mountain continued a in dream peak of snow against cold sky must be himalaya mountain have read about india said herrick so have impressed on mind know more about country than have read be just a if have once lived there dr jim have smattering of theory of reincarnation did not believe in on questioning sidney really began to believe that boy must have be in india in former life else how did country bred youth know about gorgeous east said thing must not possibly have read in book for two hour herrick drew out on subject be fairly astounded at mind laid out before gaze later on sidney began to grow restless again eye took on fixed look rising walked up down library dr jim asked what be matter be going to see something said sidney in most matter of fact tone feeling be always same feel a if be not a if did not belong to body do want to sleep asked herrick anxiously with thrill feel particularly wide awake wish stephen be back dr jim sat up alertly why do wish that there be something bad going to happen to feel that be in danger know sidney passed thin hand across eye there be dark cloud bad bad herrick felt half inclined to go with sidney to biffstead walk home with marsh carr be ashamed to give way to what seemed foolish impulse laughed at boy began to question on other subject be fond of wandering about at night said go to pine wood very often replied sidney still uneasy be so amusing to watch who what be talking about suppose must call fairy said boy be real people to little men woman so busy about work herrick stared sounded like raving of lunatic there be such thing a fairy said roughly have seen replied sidney obstinately will not talk of dr jim must not believe if told what have seen see here sydney said herrick after pause believe do see thing in way have most vivid imagination strong poetic temperament way in described india show that believe think of queer thing so much that make see kind of hallucination if ate meat took to sport unhealthy vision must pas away daresay replied sidney indifferently apparently did not wish to argue matter held to own opinion nevertheless there be few moment of silence then boy exclaimed be coming nearer danger to stephen dr jim let go to biffstead be sure there be danger materialist however must not give way on point thought must be weak for to yield to boy folly nonsense said roughly be giving way to imagination nothing can happen to stephen if there be danger added in joking manner to make sidney ashamed of why go to sleep see what be there be sofa feel wide awake yet feel feel sidney clenched hand herrick reflected for moment santiago have said that boy be clairvoyant must see vision in shining surface in blob of ink there be large silver ink pot on table more a joke than in earnest herrick pushed across to sidney look there see what be matter said sidney looked offended if believe need not laugh declared will go to biffstead be eleven o'clock quite time be home look in ink first said herrick now much more in earnest really wished to see if vivid imagination of boy must see picture in black pool have ever looked into crystal sidney can see thing without looking into anything when be asleep vivid dream perhaps said boy quietly in dark can matter let talk dr jim only laugh at want to go home to warn stephen said herrick angrily yes retorted sidney doggedly to warn stephen be in danger well will go with sidney seems that must be humoured to oblige see if can discern arabian night in ink pot be sure will see stephen seated quietly in drawing room talking to sister with joyce very unwillingly sidney did what be asked knew that herrick be laughing at be particularly sensitive to ridicule with look of reproach made dr jim feel rather ashamed boy drew big silver ink pot towards stared into black oval chime of clock striking eleven have just died away there be absolute silence broken only by faint crackle of fire light in room have be turned off early in evening at request of sidney boy disliked full blaze only on writing table be green shaded lamp close to in such position that light did not fall into ink well stood silver pot herrick half vexed with for encouraging folly watched boy quietly from arm chair sidney bent over ink stared into hard after minute two herrick saw quiver pas through boy frame what be sidney see drawing room at biffstead said sidney quietly stephen be not there mr joyce be talking to ida be herrick laughed what nonsense stephen be certainly there if be not have not better look for see now continued sidney taking notice of ridicule be walking in churchyard rubbish declared sceptic in arm chair what must take stephen to churchyard at time of night be not on way home be in churchyard insisted sidney there walk amongst tombstone be going to new vault for time look at how can see that when night be dark cried herrick rising there be moon come away sidney be bad for wait wait said boy hastily danger danger stephen have left new vault have gone to old one be being followed by man in dark cloak man have big stick come behind stephen stop stop boy almost screamed hit hit stephen help sidney cried herrick catching boy by arm now thoroughly frightened go on in silly fashion tell man have struck stephen said sidney passionately be lying by old vault unconscious from blow on head man have gone know where let go mr herrick stephen be sidney wrenched away from herrick went staggering towards door with hand held out dr jim followed to stop from leaving house in state boy gained hall before did once there seemed to gather strength caught up cap pulling open massive door passed outside herrick taken by surprise did not wait to put on own cap went after lad bare headed thinking have be seized with fit of madness in spite of darkness of night followed on sidney heel so closely that be enabled to keep in sight jim wondered where be going being still sceptical of harm to stephen sidney passed swiftly beyond belt of pine down lane led to biffstead be going home thought herrick with relief lad did not go home turned off sharp to left entered churchyard through side lane herrick now awestruck at strange experience did not understand ran after stumbling over graf sidney never fell passed swiftly to old vault of carrs beside be dark body on ground stephen stephen cried lad then sank exhausted beside body herrick came up thunderstruck at cry struck match held close to ground beside face of unconscious man started back with irrepressible cry let match fall be stephen marsh carr who be lying there be bleeding from wound on back of head beside also unconscious lay lad who have foreseen accident crime said herrick aloud in shaky voice be work of frisco chapter xiii wooing of robin joyce bewildered a herrick be by strangeness of discovery have enough to pull together go for assistance in spite of lateness of hour carr arm be full of labourer drinking smoking number of came at once to churchyard when heard of accident for so herrick put stephen be carried to house herrick have ascertained before seeking assistance that friend still lived meanwhile sidney have revived be in drowsy state want to go home said herrick after whispering to say nothing of vision seen in ink pot sent to biffstead in charge of landlord napper then accompanied body of friend to pine herrick must not help thinking of a body though knew stephen still lived be quite probable that must be actual corpse before dawn mr marsh carr have met with accident be explanation of doctor to helper went away knew very well that be accident moreover presence of sidney besides body hinted that wonderful event have taken place master sidney said that mother be dead remarked wiseacre have found dead body of mr marsh now be not dead said others ah will die master sidney never make mistake by next morning legend have be circulated that uncanny boy have foretold death of new squire when who called at 'the pine heard that marsh carr have lived through night be quite disappointed seemed reflection on master sidney yet boy have held tongue one knew really what have happened in default of truth then took refuge in fable there be absolutely authority for what be said sidney have be found unconscious beside unconscious squire be enough material out of to form wonderful story lost nothing in telling meanwhile herrick fulfilled duty of medical attendant to friend smiling grimly while that need must come so comparatively early in acquaintance have known marsh carr little over five month meeting have taken place in july be now near christmas doctor examined wound on back of head be nasty jagged cut evidently made by blunt instrument big stick a boy said doubt mused herrick a plastered bathed bound up stephen be stunned for time being think that brain be injured head be pretty hard frisco have good intention not sufficient judgment to strike hard for of course be frisco who have done dr jim remembered what mr marsh have said regretted that have passed away without informing more fully of what knew about frisco that ex sailor must dare to come down to scene of first crime in order to commit second for at moment herrick credited frisco rather than joyce with carr murder be wonderful enough reason must be more wonderful still be impossible that must be able to get fortune even if put out of way for be proven murderer if showed must be at once arrested certainly might explain suspicion away be doubtful in face of such strong evidence yet apparently have made up mind to remove stephen get money wo if can help muttered beast will carry stephen to vault so that term of monthly visit may be fulfilled not that think will be on foot sooner than frisco expects job have be badly done sent in message to beorminster by groom telling bridge of new outrage advising search to be made for frisco then patient having be attended to must be assassin recommended to attention of police dr jim must hing more sat before library fire smoked thinking deeply while wonder if joyce attempted murder thought there be something queer about stopping here that boy said joyce be at biffstead talking to sister if believe one part of vision be bound to do must believe other not joyce then there be don manuel be connected with robin in underhand way besides professed to hate carr to regret loss of treasure might be if have be with corn night well good if not will have to account to for time believe in little reptile meditation be ended by sleepy servant who announced ida be frank with came joyce wide eyed with wonder so far a dr jim must see there be sign of terror of guilt on face robin be not man to conceal feeling napper brought home sidney told of dreadful thing said be who seemed most collected of party be be no be not dead do think will die blow be badly aimed who must have done asked frank frowning have own opinion prefer not to express at present said doctor somewhat curtly want to take to doctor said ida looking at with imploring eye let watch beside can do good miss endicotte replied herrick better let look after to morrow can come over watch if like think will recover consciousness before dawn thank god for cried ida devoutly then wept strain on have be very great be glad of relief of tear have looked for man who did asked joyce have sent message to police at beorminster said herrick without looking at can do good joyce better go back to inn by way friend santiago have be with corn night said frank met coming here have just heard news be persuaded to stay away thinking must only bother think be best to keep house a quiet a possible have sidney said anything asked looking at sister ida clasped hand in terror did sidney say must happen yes looked into yonder ink pot foretold assault can not understand thing can talk of to morrow in meantime of hold tongue about sidney promised to do now being more at rest in mind about stephen went away herrick drew be aside at door come over with ida to morrow morning muttered want to speak to nodded ran after rest who be disappearing into darkness herrick with frown returned to library be not joyce muttered be not manuel after must be frisco well if police be clever will catch before can leave district have will send message to southberry be way escaped last time herrick hastily wrote out explanation did not need to add description of frisco a hand bill have sufficiently described sent off with groom then went to pas night beside bed of patient night stephen lay a still a corpse be towards morning when moved showed sign of returning consciousness herrick be assiduous in attendance success crowned effort gradually stephen came to with dull pain in head weak quite where where be be first stammering word in own house said herrick quickly talk dear chap have have accident remember muttered stephen at vault blow yes be quiet said herrick sternly must not talk tell after attempt stephen obeyed shortly fell asleep herrick drew long breath worst be over for once villany of frisco have failed in object several people called that morning amongst others mr corn clergyman did not look well hurriedly asked after sufferer hope be better said terrible affair dr herrick cowardly crime said herrick sharply however can talk of when marsh get better meantime mr corn will tell if don manuel be at house last night dear yes replied corn surprised came to dinner stayed with up till midnight be walking with to carr arm when met miss endicottes who told of terrible business why do ask question dr herrick have special reason replied herrick mendaciously save being in sense responsible for visit of santiago to place wish to warn that know nothing about have anything to say against character asked rector sharply know nothing about can say be that like man think be bad lot if like to tell mr corn be at liberty to do so be not man to make mischief said corn hotly so far a can see don manuel appears to to be perfectly respectable if be not can look after dr herrick beg pardon said herrick ceremoniously did not wish to infer that must not have to say be that mr marsh be better that in week will be about pentland corn murmured something about being pleased took departure herrick did not quite know what to make of rector be good preacher kind hearted man in own way clever seemed to be weak usually have haggard look on face for there be apparent reason sometimes went away to sea side for health invariably returned looking worse than ever altogether man be mystery herrick must not make out what be at back of timidity restless behaviour seem to be surrounded with mystery said herrick to wonder if will ever get to bottom of one of if do rest will easily be unravelled suspect whole lot be of piece ida came that morning be latter young lady waited in library while herrick took up ida to room of stephen have insisted upon going up to watch beside be right know said to dr jim silently admitted that be stephen have just opened eye when entered tried to speak ida placed hand on mouth herrick frowned marsh obediently held tongue ida sat by bedside however patient managed to kiss ida hand then herrick went down to see be warning ida that stephen be not to speak marsh did make attempt miss endicotte must not allow doctor say be to be quiet if say word will go away ring murmured stephen looking at knew what meant drawing emerald ring have brought from town off finger be on put on engagement finger will please lordship said ida gaily tear be in eye stephen looked again thus be situation adjusted between without word be engaged to be married stephen fell asleep again holding hand of promised wife be happy meantime be herrick be in consultation herrick told girl what mr marsh have said about frisco how stephen have be struck down from behind so look to said a though man be trying to get money doe admitted be reflectively why must frisco do dreadful thing to get fortune if have colonel carr in power need not have killed need now try get stephen out of way understand however a have told police at beorminster southberry be sure man will be caught hope so be sure ah then champion frisco no longer no if be really who attempted to murder stephen hope will be caught punished same think killed colonel carr what can be reason for saying so be hesitated time ago promised to tell something about colonel said will do so in week from to day why not now shook head please ask a far a assault on stephen go be quite with about frisco hope will be caught punished be strange girl said dr jim mystery like rest who be rest asked be smiling well replied jim after pause mr marsh be one be pentland corn be third pentland corn echoed turning pale suspect of suspect of anything understand why be so intimate with mexican be opened mouth to make remark then changed mind can say nothing now said abruptly later on ida be with stephen oh well need not wait must go into beorminster will be asking for news of for paper might hear something about frisco there if do will let know good bye before herrick must stop be off like swallow evidently be knew something about corn did want to admit at present herrick wondered what must be surely did not think clergyman have liked carr so much that be working for discovery of murderer be doing detective business on own account thought jim rather vexed will get into trouble if doe not take care wish must let know what be up to will wait week no longer after must speak out before week be ended accident brought about confession from be dr jim be far from expecting arose out of wooing of robin joyce whether manuel have used influence not to induce joyce to leave saxham be impossible to say if have one must have thought that robin must have resented interference of former friend herrick several time during week met dr jim yet made sign that santiago have told of doctor wish continued to haunt biffstead dr jim hardly ever went there without meeting robin coming going did not make jim more amiable accident to stephen caused great excitement in country bridge came over to see squire to interview dr jim nothing came of talk so called vigilance police at southberry beorminster failed to find trace of frisco although railway station be watched carefully thanks to herrick prompt action be impossible that man must have left district without knowledge of police yet be not even seen bridge went to heathcroft failed to learn that anyone resembling ex sailor have boarded train at station to appearance frisco have not be in neighbourhood yet if frisco be not culprit who be herrick knew that joyce have be at biffstead on evening of assault according to evidence of corn don manuel have be at rectory till midnight a assault on stephen took place shortly after eleven men must be held guiltless stephen must give help have left biff at quarter to eleven with intention of coming straight back to pine then a night be fine thought must go have look at vault went into churchyard after seeing new vault went on to old one while looking at received blow at back of head remembered more until found in bed with herrick bending over have heard footstep behind blow have be struck in most unexpected manner have be taken completely by surprise puzzled herrick greatly however determined to wait for week to hear what be have to say might tell something tangible likely to lead to explanation of mystery even if did not dr jim made up mind to move in matter must first have talk with robin learn if have anything to do with death must have to explain away evidence of old fashioned pistol being in possession might not have be weapon used on other hand herrick felt convinced in own mind that be to unravel puzzle therefore robin be man intended to begin with be assisted to make start by folly of joyce incidentally brought about confession of be one afternoon towards end of week herrick went to biffstead ida be at pine with stephen be be alone hearing herrick volunteered to fetch started off a approached house heard voice of girl raised in anger appeared at french window of drawing room looked out on front of house seemed in state of alarm moment saw

speak calmly only that asked miss endicotte to be wife refused quite right flashed out herrick angrily what right have to ask to be wife before robin must answer not that showed inclination to do so be started to foot yes said indignantly did ask to be wife because refused to marry threatened threatened herrick turned on joyce with dangerous look implored robin very white forget what said did not mean harm will go away herrick seized by wrist will hing of sort said quietly must wait until have heard about robin winced again looked cowed lip be dry face be pale cast imploring look upon be girl returned that look with one of defiance addressed to herrick do know what little coward have accused of cried fiercely said that murdered colonel carr dr jim laughed accusation be so absurd that must

there if try to run away will have arrested can not arrest blustered robin looking desperately afraid can have evidence know nothing about go robin seemed inclined to dispute order when herrick made step in direction caught up hat fled through window will run away said be let try remarked herrick grimly can have arrested at once will insult did hound be own fault for being so kind to cried be excitedly a if cared for be only because be writer let come see so often will not have anything more to do with sent manuscript will send back where be began to pull out drawer in writing table get excited be said jim using christian name in hurry will put alright be in rage kept turning over paper scattering on floor in search for manuscript suddenly tossed aside pile of writing paper in left hand drawer underneath be old fashioned pistol looked at in astonishment where did that come from asked in dismay taking up herrick took from recognised at once be very pistol that manuel have shown in joyce flat what doe mean asked be quite amazed at discovery mean that joyce be even more of hound than thought be chapter xiv confession of be be endicotte stared at herrick where stood with black look on face clumsy weapon in hand will see bridge about be saying bullet still at police office if fit clicked tongue against roof of mouth what cried be finding tongue asking question with shiver be that pistol with here voice died away in throat ca be whispered herrick looked at in turn slipped pistol into pocket know what be thinking about said quietly pistol will do harm have seen before be right be all right echoed drawing brow together what do mean why what must mean that joyce slipped devilish piece of evidence into table drawer just to accuse of bounded to foot grasping idea for first time did that did cried head flung back eye angry oh stamped what must be done to such man can sit quietly there dr jim because want to hear story after must tell know have heard a for joyce mouth twisted leave to will not get off easily promise to put pistol there that broke off again looked at in scared manner did kill carr asked that ca say yet to kill man must have have strong motive have yet to learn motive strong weak must make joyce risk neck be careful of neck too explained dr jim have mind to break why asked be round eyed have never seen good tempered doctor in such rage wonder ca guess remarked herrick cooling down with gasp be drew back eye met sudden crimson flushed face turned away yes said herrick taking hand only knew moment ago what be talking about cried girl snatching hand away be talking of ida said that must come of sudden be right here be have be looking in wrong place for many month be knew perfectly well what meant made show of not understanding think be talking nonsense said there be much to be done if what say about pistol be true yes said herrick again a say there be much to be done other thing can stand over for time know well enough suit to hold at arm length woman way suppose well brisked up voice took sharper tone let get to business rascal tried to inculpate in crime will have finest thrashing ever have pistol can explain away have seen in house can guess that slipped into drawer so a to make case against stronger thought if accused must back accusation with evidence that must never dare to refuse mean hound indeed must never have come to said girl proudly be not woman to be won by threat did accuse of murder defied to do worst suppose if have not come must have shown pistol next mean scoundrel clenched fist beat well dr jim what blood thirsty person be laughed jim upon word know be strangest of wooing never mind said be drawing back can talk later of such thing position be anything pleasant one little man will make trouble if doe not mexican friend will be proper pair of scamp however be equal to of leave joyce to know about about nothing joyce take accuses of being near 'the pine on night of murder at hour said be quickly be have be trying to make up mind to tell week necessity of doing so have come earlier than expected will explain now came to stop looked at questioningly of course know have nothing to do with crime be sure of said herrick heartily think know who did come now confess be mistaken cried be know be that frisco be innocent have proof of proof of own eye saw at door of house when shot be being fired heard shot three of fourth did not hear humph about what hour be between nine ten be doing out at hour be paused have better tell from beginning said slowly then can judge for have told one a yet be too terrible hesitated have other reason for silence yet if frisco have be tried for life must have come forward in spite of be perfectly innocent can prove strange muttered herrick taking seat well let hear what about horrid joyce will attend to later will stay at inn until come be if be really innocent of course if try to bolt will know be guilty have arrested oh joyce know will act accordingly never mind go on with story be not much of story said be know habit sidney have of going to pine wood to see fairy told about well on night of murder went away a usual came on to rain ida be in great state thought must catch death of cold be so delicate know said must go look for about nine o'clock set out knew must be in pine wood be raining wrapped long cloak about be not in wood although searched everywhere with lantern then came out of wood by mistake right on to colonel lawn light be burning in tower whole of house be illuminated just a saw muttered herrick yes crossed lawn to come home when heard three shot fired one after other in tower heard plainly turned with start colonel have done so many queer thing thought be only shooting to amuse never struck that be murder if colonel have not be so eccentric might have suspected nothing ever surprised in house waited for moment there be more shot looked towards house there saw frisco standing in doorway saw quite plainly be time after hearing shot indeed be immediately after first shot when other two be fired saw there thought that might see a did not want colonel carr to think have be spying round house at so late hour ran home a fast a must sidney have arrived before said nothing about shot went to bed when heard how have discovered body knew that have heard shot fired by murderer knew also that when frisco be missing be not guilty so be why defended must not speak plainer must well see reason why must not have told story tell now if frisco have be arrested must have know here be looked down can not understand dr jim people round about here be sad scandalmonger because called on colonel carr to get article a told people said that be fast brute cried herrick firing up well then can understand that if have become known be near colonel carr house so late at night there must have be more talk really know what must have said so said nothing not even to ida of course must have told went out to get sidney be shrugged shoulder know how spiteful people be after consideration thought best to hold tongue might have told said herrick be afraid to faltered be foolish child a though must not have understood well said with sigh of relief be glad have told now so be a have brought joyce to rope end how did say saw on night be in pine wood on verge of lawn for what reason did not tell did ask see said be be so angry that must accuse of shooting colonel gave time to explain then came know rest humph well joyce will explain to reason for coming to saxham of course knew that be here on night knew said miss endicotte much astonished how must know information came to by accident more le replied herrick forthwith explained how stephen remark a to robin income have led to examine into doings of little man on night continued doctor went to heathcroft station there learned that little man muffled up in great coat have excuse of rain really be disguise have arrived at heathcroft by seven o'clock train from london heathcroft be six mile from place so joyce knew therefore be thoughtful enough to bring bicycle with oh came here right enough to see colonel suppose to murder really ca be sure of be see carr for reason know allowed mr joyce income of five hundred year robin wanted to be continued to solicitor told that carr refused therefore can only think that came down to try persuade carr to be more generous added herrick with emphasis hardly think that for reason joyce must commit murder have pluck may be replied be thoughtfully seems to that if did not took great deal of unnecessary trouble to conceal movement from besides led directly to house where knew at event think so that body must be found be certainly strange look a though movement have be premeditated be joyce who selected country for walking tour yet so far a know be never in part before be bound to say that be who led way to 'the pine on night daresay be too clever to take initiative doubt made suggestion yes did well must get truth out of man must account to for possession of pistol for being in pine wood on night of murder wonder gave away like did be curled lip did not intend said thought that if frightened must consent to marry to save own skin then hold tongue about presence at saxham oh calculation be carefully made may be sure dr jim be only because mistook character that be upset herrick nodded there be don manuel of course said mexican what about well wonder if have anything to do with be strange that must be so friendly with joyce with corn too for matter of joyce said that mutual friend of mine introduced to santiago took trouble to write to friend man called johnstone learned that johnstone have never seen heard of don manuel have mexican ever be to apollo club where according to robin introduction took place where met why met have yet to find out luckily have now enough evidence to force dear friend joyce to be candid will not spare said herrick with grim smile be liar scoundrel never be so mistaken in man before prided upon reading character seems that be not so clever a thought no doubt there be something between since be so intimate be reply of miss endicotte whether have to do with murder know did seor santiago know colonel carr in south america hated like poison seems went on treasure hunting expedition in peru treasure hunting peru ah remember be expedition frisco used to talk about be frisco with colonel there yes let drop hint that colonel have found treasure in peru that have lost of course know whole story from what frisco said know be in way colonel carr obtained wealth what liar that manuel be said herrick denied that have ever seen frisco according to manuel only carr be on expedition santiago fell ill carr left amongst indian be held in captivity for two year when got back to civilisation carr have vanished with treasure be speaking of mexican arrived in england six month ago in search of colonel carr doubt wonder if killed might have yet know revenge be poor thing when substantial benefit be to be derived santiago want wealth must have managed affair in different way remember warning three of yes be kind of way santiago must go to work try frighten carr into parting with substantial amount think that must kill goose with golden egg at event until be in possession of of egg ca think mexican be guilty then joyce must have done perhaps be such coward if not of two who be asked be not frisco herrick looked at be not so sure said coolly see alibi provide for frisco doe not touch subject saw man at door when three shot be fired well if remember at inquest be proved a much a must be proved that three shot be fired at dead body therefore when heard man be already dead why must frisco not have done then come down leaving accomplice to do what liked see what mean said be be bullet killed colonel old fashioned bullet fired from if be not mistaken went on herrick producing pistol ca be sure of admitting that be so how did pistol come into possession of joyce if frisco used be in dark there said herrick vexedly must get truth out of joyce time to see now glanced at watch a to pistol will see bridge find out if bullet fit be held out hand let do that said while be watching joyce mexican can attend to matter do think will be able hesitated herrick be certain can besides want to have part in discovery of truth doctor handed pistol knew that be clever girl must not undertake thing unless must execute thoroughly can do detective business together said will look after joyce santiago frisco if can find part will be to trace pistol to see if bullet fit can manage bridge easily replied be putting pistol away be so conceited that little flattery go long way with let meddle in matter will only spoil know what to do leave to dr jim took up hat to go suddenly recollected point have not yet discussed sat down again about pentland corn said what do think of be be good man replied promptly be weak be sure there be nothing wrong about yet why must make such friend of santiago know will ask must not tell truth if did have own secret be nodded believe be bad secret said rector be man with past sad past did know be soldier before became parson replied dr jim yet always thought have martial air about why did leave army said have call added be hastily seeing doctor lip curl think be hypocrite be most devout humph believe much in emotional religion said jim with shake of head call have left army for must like to hear more feasible story be friend of colonel carr yes be only person colonel saw used to go very often to 'the pine think did colonel carr much good on contrary be probable that colonel did weak man like that good deal of harm herrick stopped then said suddenly know something about murder what make think so said be startled well did not come to inquest seeing that be parson of parish great friend of dead man think that strange also when met in morning after murder talked nonsense sheer nonsense be in sort of hysterical condition might have be because of shock replied be thoughtfully know one thing at least about mr corn will not look upon corpse why not know doe anyone else parishioner be sometimes annoyed because will not come see dead mr corn will pray with dying person will not look on dead one humph be soldier said herrick must look into have quite enough to do at present think will see to pistol can go now to joyce then can meet compare note be understand one miss endicotte flushed wish must not talk nonsense cried there be other more important thing to think of dr jim must have protested re entered house left to own thought be pleasant in spite of discovery of robin iniquity jim now saw that have be in love with be without knowing shock of joyce wooing have brought about discovery what fool have be not to see before said dr jim wonder say love be blind whistled light heartedly chapter xv robin joyce explains whether be charm of girl society based upon new discovery interest of conversation from detective point of view detained herrick with for over two hour be impossible to say probably dr jim must not have given satisfactory answer a hurried along road to carr arm acknowledged that have be dilatory for in two hour robin must have got away from saxham dr jim did not think must go robin be child in many way be not quick in making plan besides must be bewildered by sudden revelation of rascality for moment must not be able to think of own safety at least if did think must be unable to make plan also of herrick be certain have very little money to come go on thought doctor a swung into village green robin know better than to give slip must be afraid must show mercy when caught up probably will make out story implore for sake of past friendship to be silent if tell whole truth if did not actually kill carr might then insulted be tried to get into danger doctor clenched fist frowned will give thrashing at event there be bad time coming for robin man prognostication of dr jim proved to be correct joyce have not attempted flight be waiting in sitting room for coming of doctor looked horribly frightened herrick must have found in heart to be sorry for wretched little creature with white haggard face staring eye remembered what be at stake made up mind to be stern even to verge of brutality for knew treacherous little scoundrel might have hinted to outside world that be be involved in murder of carr if have done herrick considered that nothing must be too bad for be in very stern frame of mind that dr jim sat down opposite former friend robin winced at regard of once kind eye felt like rabbit in presence of boa constrictor well said jim grimly eying miserable wretch what have to say for nothing returned robin sullenly be afraid will not be satisfied with joyce will have to tell whole of doings from first to last have done nothing so very wrong jim one moment interposed herrick think have better call by last name be not friend now know will call dr herrick said robin with small sneer think might be better sir drawled herrick contempt in tone made self satisfied joyce wince if have done anything wrong must not have waited to see be lie replied plain spoken jim know better than have bolted must have have police on track before night fall know a said before only chance be to make clean breast of damnable business what do mean bandy word with joyce wo do be in cleft stick amount of wriggling will serve if want lead here be one told at southberry that went up up see frith frith so did

up in childish rage love wo marry panted wo have sit down commanded herrick sternly have nothing to say in matter leave miss endicotte name out of have have enough of nonsense confess what have done wo joyce set teeth very good then will send for police dare not ah think so herrick rose walked towards bell joyce anticipated stood in path with flashing eye herrick laughed be about to measure strength against mine said before must speak further little man have flung at throat like wild beast strong a herrick be abnormal nerve force of joyce made mean antagonist contest be unequal at last herrick lifted joyce above head shook ' a terrier doe rat pitched headlong into chair where creature helpless overborne sat gnashing teeth glaring for moment herrick thought be mad have have enough asked doctor recovering breath if not be quite willing to administer thrashing so richly deserve joyce still glared stamped in impotent rage then suddenly burst into tear hid face in hand great brute wailed might spare spare echoed herrick contemptuously did think of sparing that poor girl whom be trying to blackmail into marriage may thank star joyce that have to deal with man who know a do if have be man must have left half dead on floor will have justice from never fear robin still continued to sob huddled up in big chair looked scarcely a large a child feel ill ill horribly ill will feel

devil first cried joyce sitting up tear stained dishevelled with evil look in eye will do exactly a be bid replied herrick selecting pen now begin tell lie have information of know nothing if catch tripping well know what to expect joyce saw that be helpless have tried defiance force tear be now at end of resource herrick pitilessly held to point seeing that there be help for little scamp dried eye arranged coat hardened into reasonable frame of mind have whip hand said sullenly so must give in think be very wise of after might have known that such play acting must not impose upon now be to tell did at saxham on night why came down will probably ask few question to will require truthful answer remember what said know more about doings than give credit for can tell if speak truth not now go on dr jim squared elbow settled to write joyce cast one look at door a though meditated flight knew that dash for liberty must result in incarceration in prison so abandoned sullenly began to talk did come down to saxham on twenty fourth confessed thought so story of seeing frith frith be lie yes did not want to know not only that wished to make use of be to prove alibi eh chose country for walking tour on purpose planned whole thing said joyce shamelessly with something of pleasure in own cleverness think clever herrick whom have always despised have made tool of up to point have doubt there be proverb about playing with edged tool seem to have forgotten a to saying that despise never did so until found out never mind how that have told lie about going to london from southberry be own business be to be tool a have just said go on joyce thought for moment a have done nothing so very wrong said there be reason why must not tell everything from beginning suppose will admit that reason at go on very good well then until mother died have idea of position added joyce have very clear idea now left paper behind explained much not will show to when come up to london thank will remind of promise robin scowled continued mother said that between certain colonel carr there existed business arrangement that must receive five hundred year for life arrangement be made by dead father for service rendered to colonel carr what be service be one of thing know paper said nothing about five hundred year be to be paid to mother when died be to stop so see that in place of having income a thought be left pauper mother have saved money about three hundred pound be living on now be in despair went to solicitor who pay annuity to ask if colonel carr must continue wrote to colonel refused know said herrick smoothly frith told seem to have meddled good deal in business sneered joyce well be again in despair a saw nothing before life of hard work read over paper again mother said in that carr be dangerous man that have enemy who threatened to kill advised to see to take precaution against visit being known to anyone why asked dr jim see reason did responded robin with shrug be now quite again seemed to enjoy telling of story hinted however that if colonel carr ever died by violence be sure must might be accused of crime if went to see said that be dangerous to be in company for reason seems to very ridiculous reason thought be same a knew more about matter than did thought best to adopt suggestion wished to see carr ask to continue annuity wished to see secretly so that if be murdered a mother hinted must not be dragged into matter for reason made plan blame be fool to do so said dr jim vigorously why in name of heaven did not tell must have come seen carr with openly must not have be afraid of being implicated in crime though man be murdered dozen time over secret mean took to avert suspicion falling on have only resulted in being suspected at least by thought did not suspect said joyce snappishly not of crime for know what coward be know something about still if police knew do must find in queer street again say that in desire to avert suspicion from have brought upon head however think reason given in paper speak of ridiculous go on of plan how be carried out first looked up map of country to see where carr lived then a have proposed walking tour induced to take route ran right across carr place thought if anything occurred must prove be with did expect man to be murdered while be on tour did not know what might happen a be knew man be dead when rejoined at southberry idea be to see then to pas afterwards with through village when set out on walking tour never thought must be murdered be to say least strange that carr must meet with death at so critical moment to said herrick doubtfully have lived safely for ten year be chance suppose at event did not kill a seem to suppose simply wished to see about annuity when left at southberry went to london on plea of seeing frith frith left bag at hull hotel to provide second alibi intended to get down see carr then be back sleep at hull hotel on night be murder threw out herrick laughed be murder against be taking precaution how ironical well went to flat got bicycle wrapped up in great coat then went down to saxham by heathcroft line alighted there at seven o'clock have something to eat at railway bar then rode on bicycle to saxham house from map waited in pine wood before must make up mind to go in seek for interview at what time did hide in pine wood between

three heard also be after nine time remained near house went on to other side of pine wood keeping tower in sight saw girl with lantern searching wood passed near where lay saw plainly be how recognised why did accuse thought might have have something to do with crime said joyce sullenly must confess be queer to see girl in wood at hour if be innocent why must have be about house so late dare to hint that be not innocent cried herrick violently went to look for brother sidney heard shot too did see frisco at door of house no be time after lost sight of miss be heard shot thought might have fired waited till ten o'clock then thought must go see what be matter walked through wood entered house be alight quite deserted just a found a have heard shot in tower climbed up at top saw what saw dead body of colonel be quite dead be afraid for very thing dreaded have come to pas saw how wise be mother advice being afraid lest someone must come must be arrested for crime went away got bicycle have left in pine wood rode back to heathcroft found last train gone so must not get back to hull hotel feared to sleep in inn lest police when crime be discovered must make search for stranger passed night in wood then rode on at dawn to station beyond heathcroft where got cup of coffee at bar of station then took train back to london went to hull hotel said that have passed night with friend afterwards caught southberry train rejoined be very pretty story remarked herrick grimly then be anxious to push on across moor that might find body together not exactly thought must be already found when arrived however when saw house blazing knew that nothing have be disturbed went in know know that took fit of hysteria said herrick thought be fatigue now understand be because be playing part be very well how do know did not kill man did not swear did not cried joyce with shiver what about pistol have nothing to do with murder be not weapon be used not that know of where did get joyce hesitated wriggled see why must ask indeed said herrick grimly see very good reason carr be shot through heart with bullet might very well fit ancient weapon how do know that put into drawer at 'the grange ' be going to lie about wo do joyce saw pistol at flat in tobacco cabinet joyce turned white have be quite prepared to lie information showed how futile must be how did find in there asked oh be poking prying manuel hunting for cigarette showed to dropped across by accident joyce sprang to foot liar oh liar cried manuel why knew be in cabinet placed there eh never said so muttered robin passing tongue over dry lip oh can see face evidently manuel played upon same trick intended to play upon be nice pair upon soul herrick paused for moment have manuel to do with nothing know of

when come back by way told lie about johnstone did not introduce at apollo club joyce shrugged shoulder since know so much might a well know more said coolly met manuel at pimlico gambling club played together became friend oddly enough knew about carr drew together talked good deal about business told what told be scoundrel said joyce gritting teeth want to make out that shot carr with pistol showed to in flat to inculpate be what proposed to do with girl did said robin sullenly wanted to marry made plan so that must not dare to refuse herrick rose to foot joyce said calmly have intended to give thrashing be such miserable wretch that if man handled must probably kill can go free for will leave place by five o'clock train from beorminster will see to thought must sneered joyce so have packed clothes what be going to do next keep eye on go back to flat if try to run will have arrested think because send to london that will be beyond reach of arm manuel be plotting to get money of stephen marsh be not santiago may be doing got everything out of told nothing in return save that knew carr hated know anything believe that pistol be one used in murder santiago probably read about old fashioned weapon being used knowing be down here on night put that pistol yes yes see that see what scoundrel have taken up with upon word joyce have better have stuck to be too late now said robin with something of sob will never trust again never replied herrick calmly have not yet got to bottom of business believe be tool rather than accomplice of mexican however will deal with go to london hold in readiness for order will be even with santiago yet for treachery said robin rising that can settle between yourselves hullo go yet sign paper have written down told wo sign will at once will be witness if will not protect in way wo let get into trouble said joyce taking pen not if what have told be true sign so joyce signed herrick witnessed document doctor placed in pocket then ordered trap from napper after joyce have paid bill doctor drove to beorminster five o'clock train be on point of departure just managed to catch a flung into carriage held out hand to herrick replied jim coldly have done with trick will get worst of will go straight to flat said joyce sulkily a train steamed out of station cursed former friend must have cursed still more if have seen what did next doctor went to telegraph office wrote out wire describing joyce face clothes figure also set down train by must arrive at paddington sent to firm of private detective with whom have already done business there said herrick with grim smile when wire be despatched joyce will be watched from moment get to town trick doctor laughed apparently did not yet trust little man in spite of confession chapter xvi be detective in way saxham be purged of one undesirable person herrick be pleased that have acted with such promptitude be must no longer be vexed by odious attention of little scamp who have tormented dr jim smiled to think how much of jealous rival there be about dealing with quondam friend now recognised that be be woman desired for wife did think must refuse to become mr herrick when must give home worthy of have disliked attention must not have permitted even strange hour wooing be have of love since jim have found heart laughed at recollection to talk of love between interval of detective analysis thought a walked back to saxham having sent on napper cart by groom be strange way of wooing one wife last kind expected to indulge in be enjoyed fancy must recompense in more leisurely way when business be at end on arriving at doctor called in at carr arm to see don manuel wanted to hear from man if have really given pistol to joyce if so how have come into possession might be that have bought in order to incriminate robin although at present herrick must see very good reason for such incrimination on other hand pistol might be veritable weapon used to shoot carr must be proved only by test of bullet must have to wait until be saw bridge about in way herrick felt convinced that santiago be connected with crime have known hated carr be far too intimate with joyce for mere friendship showed too great desire to remain in parish that must have in way gained possession of real pistol be not unlikely might be that used said dr jim a entered inn although must think must have used more modern weapon for choice on speaking to napper about mexican shock awaited landlord expressed broadest surprise mr joyce have not told dr herrick of santiago departure mexican have gone to london by early train herrick swore beneath breath feeling that have be outwitted when mr joyce came back here afternoon did see don manuel aye sir that did foreigner be waiting for talked for hour after don manuel came down with trunk have one doctor drove in to catch earlier train to beorminster asked herrick sir to heathcroft paid bill alright though be astonished mr joyce left so suddenly there be nothing wrong hope by mean replied herrick with carelessness be far from feeling believe don manuel have to go up on business asked mr joyce to join later will be coming here again sir asked napper on receiving reply in negative expressed regret did pay much be sure said worthy landlord did hear seor santiago say where be going asked herrick landlord must not tell dr jim walked away annoyed that have be taken in felt that robin have be tutored to play part by cleverer scoundrel doubt robin have told mexican of intrusion into case santiago have taken alarm knew well enough that dr jim must recognise pistol that must force robin to say where have obtained evidently don manuel thought must be better for to disappear than to face examination yet must have told joyce to make up story about pistol so that might not be brought into whole business be part of conspiracy don manuel be in robin also herrick felt that firm of joyce santiago have be one too many for same remembered that have set watch on joyce if scamp tried to hide went to place to meet manuel must be followed will go up to town to morrow said herrick on way to 'the pine wherever joyce have gone there manuel will be will run to earth learn what mean by questioning in other company wo trick second time well have done enough detective work for day will think of something else stephen

truth honour clean delight prevailed in old house be merry evening memory of golden age said next morning dr herrick re entered work day world walked over to biffstead found be just setting out for beorminster on bicycle can leave that said after kiss have be exchanged will drive over to beorminster in cart told groom to put in horse bring round here be going to town asked be yes on track of two scamp be going to see bridge about bullet yes have pistol in pocket replied showing very good can drive cart back of course can drive who ever heard of asking country girl question know accomplishment jim know that be dearest sweetest most sensible girl in whole wide world say wo take groom in first place want to myself in second must tell took place when interviewed joyce yesterday be needle to say thought capital plan so when groom brought round cart be sent away saw pair drive towards village there be broad grin on face knew very well what be to one in mysterious way news have got to servant hall have be well discussed that very morning lover drove into beorminster talked in most matter of fact way about conspiracy head be so close that one must have thought be exchanging tenderest confidence in place of that detective fever be raging in breast be like couple of scotland yard official then herrick took last farewell promised to return in course of few day caught express when train disappeared round curve be went back to cart drove to stable where put up afterwards went into lower part of beorminster where mr inspector bridge have office happened to be in brightened up when saw bridge have great opinion of younger miss endicotte what good wind brings here miss asked ah said be solemnly that requires telling mr inspector be about pistol produced from pocket pistol echoed bridge puzzled ah be pistol of carr case be what want to find out said miss endicotte who have story ready to tell have discussed detail with dr jim during drive found other day in pine wood near colonel carr house be clumsy old fashioned thing remembered what be said about bullet being old fashioned also now want to see if bullet fit muzzle of h be said bridge with most important air looking down muzzle so found pistol in grass near house perhaps say perhaps mind miss be might be weapon have be looking for so long be there name on butt said be promptly only find that in novel there be not so much a scratch on handle old weapon observed bridge wagging head ponderously irritating be to frenzy with platitude well must see if bullet have yes bullet now where be bridge went hunting over shelf then took to excavating in drawer opened safe dug under dusty pile of paper suddenly produced be never saw from where small box in something rattled when opened there be three conical bullet one fat round one ah cried be there be try please try mr inspector in good time miss said aggravating bridge dropped bullet into muzzle disappeared nodded solemnly be pistol said have made valuable discovery miss if there be only name initial on handle sighed be be not attending to took pistol dropped out bullet then rammed home again nodded in turn there be doubt of said pistol shot colonel carr will leave with miss asked bridge might find out something likely to lead to detection of assassin be laughed delightedly from last phrase knew that inspector bridge have be reading detective fiction of worst knew also that pistol must afford clue to truth until be in capable hand therefore a thought must be safer in beorminster police office than in untidy house of biffstead where everybody be always turning over everybody else drawer consented that bridge must take charge of inspector with important air put away pistol in safe be about to replace box when noticed that be have round bullet in hand come miss give back said belongs to crown doe queer bullet murmured be made in mould here be seam believe be lead be too hard for lead have pen knife mr inspector ah seized one lying on desk will do believe be lead nonsense said bridge crossly bullet be made of lead be not cried be who be scratching away vigorously see how hard be scratch shine inspector bridge said in solemn tone believe be silver ca be inspector took up examined in turn what be said be true bullet be hard not soft a lead must be moreover be hard to scratch little scraping have given glittered in part just like silver might be murmured bridge there be silversmith just round corner said be in great excitement do come let see want to know for certain that be silver know what good will do miss be if be silver will not help to catch frisco sooner ca think what discovery might make if knew be silver for certain know how can put thing together piece of evidence like oh be sure must do lot with bridge in own heart did not very well see what must do be not proof against flattery a artful be well knew so went round corner with to convenient jeweller offered bullet will please to tell what be said in most official tone destroy mr blink deform in way be property of crown crown want to know be metal of be formed mr blink be much impressed with speech promising to be careful took bullet into next room into workshop there performed trick of trade when returned handed bullet to bridge very little altered be of silver mr bridge said of silver asked bridge while be tried to suppress excitement of silver mr bridge have be cast in mould probably cup silver plate have be melted down what be mr inspector property of crown replied bridge solemnly departed when in office locked up bullet looked at be really see how discovery can help said think over mr inspector will be certain to hit upon link be herself be a far away from truth a inspector a drove back to saxham wondered how came about that bullet have killed carr be cast in silver to must find answer chapter xvii unexpected evidence surprising discovery that bullet be of silver elevated crime from common place to romantic that old fashioned weapon must have be used in day when firearm have reached pitch of perfection be remarkable enough that assassin must have reverted to superstition of middle age for missile be almost beyond belief in spite of quick brain be must not come to decision failing discussion with dr jim resolved to leave vexed question at rest same did not pause in detective work having followed up one clue until ended for time being in nothing hunted about for so far have made two discovery pistol joyce declared have received from don manuel be certainly weapon with murder have be committed bullet be of silver knowledge resulted in nothing certainly cast strong suspicion on mexican that part of puzzle be felt must safely leave to herrick so far a particular business be concerned must do more until heard colleague report pending began to work in different direction occurred to that have never questioned sidney about doings in pine wood on night of murder possibly might be able to supply clue to mystery be in habit of watching tower said be to herself said a much on day when have picnic wonder if saw anything suspicious on night then might have seen that horrid little joyce perhaps frisco will see what know sidney be not easy person to question fantasy of thought have be laughed at so frequently truth of statement so often denied that have grown reticent what saw what heard kept to not even own family must get to explain on occasion when really desired information boy mooned about in dreamy state of mind saying little beyond merest common place for most part lived in world of fantasy be anathema maranatha to people around be like wild animal shy timid intensely suspicious be thought that might be more open with when be so to speak in native wild therefore watched opportunity followed to one of favourite haunt in pine wood where fringed moor here one afternoon found seated in secluded glade beside one of remarkable circle country people call fairy ring so steadily be gazing at in half light filtered through overhead bough that did not notice approach to be sure trod softly used same precaution a must have done when approaching haunt of timid animal sidney have always be puzzle to everyone be understood better than most people besides have discussed frequently with santiago be inclined to take mexican view of boy peculiarity remembering oft quoted saying of hamlet be be le sceptical than around must ' not see why sidney must not posse power of seeing what in generally accepted sense be called unseen considering what lad have foretold with regard to death of mr marsh accident to step son be impossible to say that sidney be fool madman there be reason for fantasy so called be regarded with certain amount of awe must not understand granted that be rare spirit far removed from common place mortal well thomas rhymer said be gaily when shadow fell on fairy ring be looking for queen of elf land be characteristic of sidney that be never taken by surprise at sound of voice neither started expressed anger did be to raise serious eye to face observe quietly knew be coming be dear threw down beside nodded towards fairy ring did tell asked in low tone in good faith be be not time for little people to be abroad be only looking at dancing ground have seen here often replied sidney with conviction small naked folk who dance sing play on queer instrument know see be not angry believe be fairy sidney have soul what call soul fairy have none be only creature who attend to work of nature servant can see because here sidney broke off be use telling be must not understand be quite admitted must not understand same did not tell brother that be fool a many people must have done simply nodded passed subject by errand be to find out what sidney have seen in actual world after manner of sex approached matter by side issue sidney dear said do know that mr joyce have gone away to london did not replied sidney gravely be very glad have gone bad man be must have done harm how what do mean sidney passed hand across face can not explain said in troubled voice see be bad people carry about with bad atmosphere that mexican be very wicked joyce not so bad of made feel quite ill did never see how refused to sit beside well be because gave such pain not physical pain kind of uncomfortable feeling ca put into word in what old fashioned way talk sidney said be puzzled one must think be hundred know more than say corn did not teach everything know tell sidney do like mr corn do in way be not bad be weak with good people be good with bad people be bad be glad that don manuel have gone to town be doing mr corn lot of harm if told what know of thing must only laugh at must not sidney said sister earnestly be sure that be so sensitive that feel influence talk about sensitive echoed sidney yes suppose be what must call have come here to ask question said abruptly how do know that demanded then seeing shrug thin shoulder admitted truth of what said want to ask who saw in pine wood on night when colonel carr be killed sidney thought for moment then raised eye towards gap in tree formerly blocked by tower saw lot of red mist about tower said that be anger saw too shook head impatiently be not thing wish to know be want to know who killed colonel carr ca tell be if knew must tell on night came here looking for thing said sidney with side glance to see if be laughing although felt that there be bad influence about house never went near kept away wandered on to moor be why missed when came to look for did not mind rain saw lantern thought must be anxious so returned home then came back yes be true tell sidney did see mr joyce in wood on moor did not see stephen be only person saw be started violently stephen said surely must be mistaken replied boy indifferently why must be mistaken know can see in dark like cat before saw lantern have seen stephen on lawn looking at tower know what time be so ask be always so particular about time said sidney peevishly a though mattered be reflected be strange that stephen must have be in vicinity of house on night yet have escaped notice remembered that being intent upon looking for brother that have not even seen joyce although be lurking in bush at elbow true have caught glimpse of frisco be when consciously looked at door be possible that sidney might have come across stephen did speak to asked why must have spoken to did go into house not that saw be be looking up at tower standing on lawn by tree went away to other side of wood out on to moor be know sidney did see frisco crossing moor did not when saw lantern went home wish must stop asking question cried irritably make head ache after speech relapsed into one of silent fit be must not get to speak knowing from experience that sidney be hopeless when in mood left still by fairy ring took way back to biffstead house be empty a ida have gone to beorminster to see flo frank be attending to farm be sat down wondered what must be meaning of stephen presence at pine on night knew that have come over from beorminster to escort mother home then mr marsh have be with mr corn whole evening there be reason why stephen must have gone out of way to visit pine be in afternoon mr marsh have seen colonel stephen must have known that must not be at great house after nine o'clock be calculating by own movement be hour at sidney have seen be looking up at tower too so sidney said ca have have anything to do with thought restlessly disliked colonel did wo even think of thing if true must kill ida yet must find out from stephen why be in wood on night reflected at hour stephen must be alone why must not go over see in one way must tell about pistol silver bullet see from expression of face if knew anything about be incredible that stephen must have fired shot be colonel heir even to gain money certainly be too good man to commit crime yet if what sidney said be true stephen have be on lawn about time colonel carr be shot must know something about matter will see said be putting on hat again will not be able to sleep wink until know what have to say in half hour be in library where stephen be established on sofa looked thin rather worried face brightened when saw be good of be said stretching out hand be alone herrick be in town ida at beorminster not soul to speak to draw chair close to fire will ring for tea be too early yet said reassured by bright talk be incredible that man who spoke so lightly must have black crime on soul just want to chatter for bit be so tired of own company so be well talk about jim will discourse about ida will be quite happy by way when will ida be back about dinner time will come over see afterwards wish must come to dinner here said stephen also frank sidney miss jim horribly be fun eating long solemn meal alone upon word be sometimes long for day when petronella macaroni must be eaten hurriedly without formality must rather have book than footman about table what mixed way of talking said be pensively have book on table a rule suppose be glad same that have colonel money of course be said stephen frankly enables to marry ida be so afraid lest must marry someone else before came into kingdom must not ask to be wife when be pauper must be be rare jewel requires rich setting think ida value money so much

to meet at carr arm take bus back to beorminster after eight went out be so early that wanted to stop refused at nine stephen arrived must not find mother be not at carr arm then guessed that have gone to see carr again in fear lest might do something dreadful blurted out suspicion at once stephen understood what meant went to 'the pine waited for time then be in such state followed house be ablaze heard nothing be about half past nine quarter to ten went up a far a door on step picked up that pistol guessed have be used by mr marsh slipped into pocket then returned home went also to carr arm learned that stephen mother have caught bus time after nine o'clock tried to think that mr marsh have not shot man returned here to think out santiago be waiting for have come by last bus from beorminster have be waiting since nine in fact came just after went after stephen be really quarter past nine when came do think have be to 'the pine asked herrick keenly know can learn that from

nothing about mr marsh be knowledge that used to make hold tongue about assault on stephen what must do herrick said corn piteously appearance be against santiago must prove have pistol have be to 'the pine owed colonel carr money also there be own story have be arrested must have come out have to do what santiago told humph said jim can see dilemma what about mr marsh did stephen suspect no told that have gone to 'the pine looked at house saw nothing heard nothing therefore returned to carr arm found mother waiting for said that have missed evidently invented story satisfied herrick think stephen suspected step mother shot colonel be sure left house in rage several time threatened to kill then be not at carr arm after nine man be shot herrick nodded did ask marsh to explain fell ill if remember took to bed must not bring to see therefore held tongue must have continued to do so that don manuel threatened therefore determined to tell when must what heard from be in main true did not kill carr blood of one human being on hand be enough do despise herrick dr jim rose took hand of unhappy man friend pity from bottom of soul if have only found one to advise trouble must not have occurred be true uncle who knew story of misery be dead shrank from telling anyone when got to know saw how strong reliant be recognised also goodness of heart felt must safely confide in will not tell anyone have told need ask that said herrick with hearty shake of hand of course secret be safe with about mr marsh will see into said herrick gravely remember santiago be dangerous man know what trouble may yet cause if necessary must use what have told about crime may be sure that for stephen sake for yours will be circumspect in dealing with matter a for friend wait here until mystery be quite solved then go back to east end to wild land a missionary yes said corn with sigh know only in way will find rest two men shook hand parted very good friend corn returned to study intensely relieved by sympathy by fact that have one to share secret herrick walked home to pine wondering at perplexity of case thought le of corn than of mr marsh suddenly stopped see said to be why mr marsh poisoned with overdose of chloral poor woman chapter xxi mystery first thing struck dr jim next day be alteration in demeanour of friend when herrick arrived at pine after visit to corn squire have already retired to bed be asleep so servant said not wishing to disturb jim have supper to went to own room after brisk walk on terrace struck a curious that stephen did not come down to breakfast next morning a be now comparatively well on asking for squire be informed that marsh carr have gone out for walk herrick therefore have lonely meal wondering while what have taken stephen out so early young man did not return till late in afternoon then excused by stating that have be to see petronella at beorminster be still in dull house said marsh carr gloomily although think be tired of want to go to own country refuse to go same what be reason asked herrick sharply ca get out of say mother left message with for suppose well why doe deliver get away message be for herrick dr jim stared for cried why what possible message can poor mother have left for really know replied stephen indifferently have better see petronella ask be looking very ill if stay much longer in damp house will die right replied herrick coolly will look up time daresay message be only one asking to look after so dr jim said in heart be wondering if dead woman have left behind confession of crime might have done so yet if have poisoned to escape consequence must have be foolish of to incriminate herrick resolved to see petronella at first opportunity learn what be that have to tell if there be really important message be strange that old italian have not delivered long ago have seen frequently there have be ample opportunity for to fulfil mistress ' dying wish however herrick put out of mind for moment turned attention to stephen be not looking well steve said gravely face be white have dark ring round eye haggard look a though have not slept night be not yet quite said marsh carr in far more irritable tone than herrick have ever heard use before can see being someone else have not improved temper hope have not offended by going to town steve certainly not how can think so well said dr jim looking at struck that have be trying to avoid lately if be tired of steve need only say so will pack up go be hanged if will said squire vigorously ca do without have be worried trifle have told on present state of health will be right in day so be there anything can help with be private matter concern only in face of intimation herrick must not press inquiry began to speak on other subject stephen replying more le absently a soon a must withdrew to own room saying wanted to lie down herrick did not seek to detain shook head something be wrong wo tell what be thought wonder if santiago have be tampering with in way perhaps be may know reason for change will see at once extraordinary thing be that found be changed also have left bright merry anxious to probe secret of colonel carr death returned to find nervous ill at ease disinclined to continue detective investigation think will arrive at anything said when herrick pressed spoke to inspector bridge can hing be professional if fails how can hope to succeed inspector bridge be conceited as replied dr jim gravely know absolutely nothing know more than doe did see mexican mr joyce asked be saw spoke to have found out something need not tell just now must be useless to do so must search out matter for when succeed will know be sighed mind in least said mournfully have ceased to take interest in matter if frisco did not kill colonel carr know who did humph be changeable like woman said dr jim rather puzzled by attitude yet never guessing cause by way did find out anything about pistol yes be thought might a well tell a must certainly learn truth sooner later from bridge bullet fit barrel thought so said jim be weapon be used yes answered be then after pause made discovery oh did about what dear bullet be used be of silver of silver what do mean be lead be laughed rather irritably if be of lead how must be silver asked then went on to tell how jeweller have examined missile be curious said herrick nodded absently eye be fixed on ground be trying to think of reason mr marsh must have have for using so expensive bullet certainly weapon be old fashioned must have to manufacture bullet for herself why use silver in preference to lead pewter in ordinary household supply of last two metal be likely to be more plentiful than first be problem one of so trifling nature herrick dismissed almost immediately turned attention to be what have stephen be doing with yourselves asked be started violently changed colour at once nothing jim said stiffly why do ask well look ill stephen be avoiding be a silent a owl not so stupid hope said be with laugh at moment ida entered room nothing more be said ida also complained of stephen health wish must make stay in bed dr jim said be certain that have got up too soon be not strong enough to go about look how pale be silent ca get word out of herrick nodded be not pleased ida come of running away to town will exert authority spoke to stephen urged to lie up for few day young man obeyed meekly enough very meekness made herrick uneasy must rather that stephen have shown fight squire remained in bed took what be given hardly ever opened mouth ida be in despair herrick be puzzled two met to discus situation when did change like asked dr jim think be day after left replied ida tearfully went to beorminster to see flo left quite bright when met again be dull quiet white yet be be with while be away so must not have missed so much oh said jim with sudden interest so be be with be h be strike that be be not so bright a might be indeed be right there said miss endicotte be sad silent just like stephen else be so gay that think be too excited cry for least thing laugh without cause humph sound like hysteria to yet be be not given way of course not said ida repelling suggestion hastily be strong healthy sensible girl above such weakness a say stephen have changed think here ida hesitated looked down amazed herrick when looked up to see that eye be filled with tear must not understand dear girl what be matter exclaimed irritably be ill also devil have broken loose here since departure ca help sobbed ida thought be stephen might might like one of course do ida why must understand what mean wonder if be in love with one regret engagement herrick burst into such hearty fit of laughter that be cheered never heard such nonsense in life said where be woman wit ida why be love devotedly be certain a for stephen adores very ground walk on be not that dear girl then what can be asked ida drying tear will question be until find out said herrick grimly have idea how can torture people with cross examination true to idea dr jim sought out be came across in pine wood beside fairy circle eye be cast on ground looked despondent when saw herrick made a if to go away dr jim felt wounded be want to see of course do said brightly only be not very well be stephen said dr jim saw by start that remark made nervous have two quarrelled have not be great friend be in love with one then be grew crimson stamped how dare say thing a even in jest said what must ida say if heard be ida own idea replied herrick with smile seeing two so glum fancied

questioned like cried be with angry evasion herrick took by arm forced to look into face dear girl said be to be husband must obey consult in thing if be playing with fire must know do not trust be yes secret be not own in case wo press for explanation said relaxing grip be foolish girl to have secret from one who love suppose have given word not to tell yes can not break word herrick nodded ask to secret of stephen will be respected even ask if have to do with murder of uncle there be need to ask be looked at irresolutely face scarlet then without word went slowly away herrick looked after nodded to believe have found out something about mr marsh have told stephen must account for melancholy for secret say exists between will ask stephen same afternoon herrick went back to pine into bedroom of marsh carr young man be lying staring at ceiling seemed listless worn out when jim entered turned face towards wall so a to avoid friend eye herrick pretended to take notice although be cut to heart by avoidance of gaze be very fond of stephen mourned over thing have come between however be necessary to take extreme measure if situation be to be improved steve said herrick formulating plan ca eat alone longer must come down to dinner to night ca said stephen in muffled tone be too ill know be life brightness society be what need be wrong to send to bed a doctor now order to get up stephen turned sulky want to know what be good for friend said herrick coolly will expect to find dressed down to dinner at eight after good meal will be more like old self in way after much coaxing

anyone who doe not trust wholly want to be friend step mother asked to look after promised to do what must unless give unreserved confidence be useless for to remain stephen rose agitated began to pace room trust in way jim know do know nothing of sort steve trust be though ah have told cried marsh carr angrily have told nothing be not fool steve have eye in head saw that be a sad a by putting

letter so a to frighten mr marsh into giving money through influence over stephen robin typed letter sent little scamp did not tell that humph will go again to town see then frisco must be produced from hiding place robin can will do that be very well still mystery of carr death be unsolved mr marsh be innocent declared frisco to be guilty on face of be have doubt case be getting more difficult at fresh discovery for first time mistrusted own power of dealing with matter must consult stephen be said dr jim left house in pocket be confession of late mr marsh chapter xxiii unexpected happens for next twenty four hour dr jim kept counsel said sufficient to set stephen mind at rest about mother did not tell whole story show confession have obtained from petronella wanted to turn matter over in own mind before doing fact be jim be getting little weary of whole affair new piece of evidence came to light seemed only to complicate have felt sure that paper left by mr marsh must solve mystery although told much did not reveal declared in half hearted sort of way that frisco be guilty gave proof man in hurried conversation at door have denied charge beyond fact of flight there be evidence against occurred to jim that best thing to do must be to drop matter altogether seemed useless to follow will o wisp still like to do on own responsibility thought after much consideration will be best for to lay fact before be stephen go by what say if want to go on with well good if not will end at once with idea most sensible one under circumstance herrick called council of war be came over from biffstead met stephen jim in library by appointment there herrick again told whole story of dealing with matter ended up by placing mr marsh letter enclosure before when squire be have read document be in possession of fact connected with murder of colonel carr herrick made speech to on basis seems to said that be foolish going on with matter from can see frisco be guilty man have disappeared think be worth while hunting down to hang for murder of scoundrel like carr beg pardon steve late uncle be scoundrel will be gratification to of moreover if be caught tried letter might have to be produced think best to stop short at point before stephen must give opinion be interrupted to dwell after custom of woman on minor point foolish boy said in reproachful tone see that took blame of mother doings on be stupid might have trusted dear be must not blacken memory even to perhaps not must have understood now that think of added wonder be so foolish a to believe be entirely opposed to nature to fire at dead man stephen winced say anything more about be said did that let matter rest there now about continuing search agree with jim be best to hing more be not so sure of replied be obstinately see santiago may still try get money said jim positively think so have be found out conspiracy be at end know that further move on part will meet with failure believe will return to mexico give up fighting wisest thing can do what about joyce asked marsh carr be worse than useless take away don manuel joyce be lost have pluck intelligence to carry through plot on own account father frisco may use a instrument frisco have to clear first joyce know if doe anything with father can have arrested rather than must happen believe must give up frisco to justice be shuddered own father exclaimed oh a to that can hardly blame joyce if doe not feel particularly filial father have done nothing for besides joyce senior deserted wife robin be devoted to mother be one of best trait in otherwise poor character be think if robin came to chose between own skin that of frisco father must be one to suffer robin belief in everyone for be wicked little wretch be be not weak rather than wicked scheme to mix up in murder by mean of pistol be invented by mexican joyce only did a be told in case said stephen looking up see what santiago have to gain robin wanted be to marry wanted to inveigle into case so that might not refuse out of fear what must matter to santiago marriage with joyce must not have helped on scheme true enough said herrick musingly daresay be frisco who suggested marriage wanted to get money through son perhaps thought must get more if put off robin with be miss endicotte reddened thank for nothing jim said indignantly be evidently to be pawn in game seems to that have be pawn said jim grimly just consider mistake have be made while have be searching for true assassin of colonel carr be laughed first of be suspected said oh be only half hearted attempt on part of frisco precious son there be real evidence to implicate be think speaking for that first suspected robin joyce be remark about income stephen aroused suspicion well chain run a follows herrick ticked off on finger joyce first on authority mainly of pistol said got from don so suspected manuel proved innocence accused pentland corn saw told have picked up pistol on lawn of house be belief that mr marsh be guilty said stephen with smile be like be came into matter on own account never believed have anything to do with affair step mother be last whom believed might have something to do with certainly have from letter know did kill man here come to dead stop what about frisco said marsh carr believe be guilty person said dr jim positively be going to defend be girl looked troubled admit that matter look black against said slowly threatened colonel be alone in house with mr marsh found ready to fly on other hand there be something to be said in favour evidently must have have share in treasure for reason colonel must not give to during life only afforded chance of getting after stephen death not even then interrupted herrick for if stephen have fulfilled condition of will fortune must become absolutely must be able to will away then ca understand said be unless frisco knew of unjust will for be if helped to get treasure murdered colonel out of revenge believe did said stephen put in dr jim briskly agree with be opinion that what mr marsh said to before died be right view what be frisco colonel fought duel believe that frisco came back from inn drunk filled with fury against colonel might have be that through visit to mr marsh in afternoon have found out about will colonel probably defied then frisco must suggest duel fired first colonel fell with still loaded weapon in hand be theory said be still defending ex sailor seem to forget jim that death shot be fired with clumsy pistol if there have be duel frisco must have have at least a good weapon a colonel there be plenty of revolver of new pattern in gun room be sure frisco must not have placed at disadvantage again silver bullet why must frisco have used that dr jim rubbed head with vexed air be afraid be right be said duel be out of question ca see anything ahead so far a be concerned give up trying to solve riddle so do said marsh carr know now that poor mother did not kill man so be care about matter rest herrick can send santiago to mexico suppose yes think will want money give what want let go think will be best a for joyce will see that keep quiet be

village so went straight across moor caught train at southberry here have be hidden in london ever since have money when ran out dropped across cipher in paper met fool of son then well know rest be strange story said herrick much distressed did not seem at unlikely that sidney have killed colonel be true one well be going to do will see boy find out if what say be true oh expect be such idiot that will think be done something fine own up that neck be in danger must not split on sidney will only shut up in asylum must hang so of two evil choose least be off herrick yes will see if be true get lawyer thanks old man be good sort so long frisco quite calm waved hand a dr jim left cell did not seem to be in least afraid evidently thought release be foregone conclusion dangerous cool headed ruffian be frisco chapter xxv sidney speaks out after interview with frisco dr jim took stephen straight off to saxham there be nothing left for to do in town frisco be in prison safe enough joyce shut up in flat must not even reply to note herrick wrote belcher for obvious reason have not called at guelph hotel with partner be keeping out of doctor way jim saw frith for brief few minute instructed to see after defence of frisco then drove to paddington where marsh carr awaited by favour of guard five shilling secured smoking carriage to when train be fairly out of town whizzed through desolate winter country dr herrick looked at stephen what do think of asked lighting pipe story of frisco yes be living truth can see by face that wish to believe man liar be not in instance what say be absolutely true saw eye when spoke tongue may lie man eye jim shook head ca be true cried stephen looking white worried good heaven jim if sidney really shot carr think of disgrace to ida be mind poor girl well said jim after pause see be not so bad a might be be sure must know of estimation sidney be held in round about saxham if come out that shot colonel one will express surprise be slur on girl steve sidney be looked upon a something beyond pale of humanity what will do with asked stephen anxiously if really did commit crime will be placed in asylum boy be too queer to be judged by ordinary standard frisco cleared out although knew sidney have killed carr because thought one must believe boy have done suspicion certainly must have rested on frisco must have be wiser to have given up for reason told of same reason kept quiet under colonel unjust appropriation of property frisco preferred to cut be wiser now that have have time to reflect over matter devilry in america be done under other name a joyce will not be wanted in san francisco daresay if have not be caught must have given up in long run be don be afraid of now don be away frisco be convinced will be set free must stand trial certainly have told frith to see after defence will be that sidney killed man there be way of averting that question in mind said herrick looking at marsh carr be whether boy really did do so have doubt on subject asked stephen eagerly have great many doubt replied jim dryly until person who really murdered carr confesses will continue to doubt see steve ever since took up matter have be following up false trail person have stumbled upon to whose guilt evidence at time procurable pointed have laid blame on one else who in turn have passed on guilt to party suspected joyce accused santiago don said pentland corn be guilty corn declared that mr marsh have fired shot now know from accurate evidence that person be innocent frisco be suspected from very first be caught swears truly enough according to own belief that boy murdered colonel how do know what sidney may be able to prove innocence accuse someone else chain may go on endlessly so far a can see understand difficulty replied stephen wearily can not for life of see why sidney must kill man there come in queer character of boy said herrick detested colonel said be bad man might have got into head in way man be better out of world if so must make more account of killing carr than must of putting fly out of existence indeed must rather spare fly for have noticed that be tender to breathes must keep quiet over matter think so sidney be never boy to talk then there be pistol stephen be old fashioned weapon that boy might buy in beorminster for few penny might have found in lumber room of grange there be many of ancient firearm to be found in house of old family if sidney dropped across such weapon might have then concluded to kill carr see from account of frisco that came down tower stair said quite calmly that colonel be dead may just a calmly admit to to that killed man mad mad groaned marsh carr must be mad doe not follow boy be strange there be thing about can not explain so far a can see sidney doe not come within range of science that foretelling of mother death extraordinary statement that be in danger puzzled beyond word must believe because be convinced by evidence of own sens same can not explain understand there be law of nature with be unacquainted believe that boy come under unknown law can not account for action of such person boy must do thing must call wrong yet must see harm in doing if be guilty will be put away in asylum at same time be sure be perfectly sane be puzzled about admitted stephen be most uncomfortable boy to have about one still have always found upright honourable have never known to tell lie must know about case how frisco have be accused be not so sure of sidney life with head in cloud perhaps have heard that frisco have be accused a man doe not now come across path never think of possible danger to again stephen that silver bullet be queer how do mean queer well know medival superstition that warlock can be killed only by silver bullet thing of sort be exactly what must appeal to dreamy nature of sidney be something of mystic remember might have taken into head that carr be warlock who have dealing with devil be sure must have reason to think so said marsh carr if man be hand in glove with satan uncle be that man see what say then sidney thinking in le sane fashion on same subject might have considered duty to deliver world from such wizard must certainly then use silver bullet thinking according to medival superstition that man must not be killed by ordinary lead be theory said stephen gloomily fantastic at a say theory fantastic admitted herrick must remember that be dealing with fantastic nature must see boy question when get home will deny everything on contrary if know anything of boy will calmly admit what have done will not tell be ida must be unwise must be certain of sidney first will say nothing to night get sidney to come over to 'the pine on morrow ask frankly if killed carr be be sure to ask about frisco said stephen oh can baffle curiosity replied herrick will tell nothing about visit to man about arrest can know think will be better to hold tongue altogether jim ida be getting worried by incessant mystery although know very little be sure wonder be worried however must learn what can from sidney hope to heaven lad be innocent if be not look upon in light of ordinary criminal be freak of nature be put into witness box must not say on oath that be mad let drop subject said stephen who looked haggard be getting nervous anxious jim acquiesced in sensible view two betook to magazine newspaper until arrived at beorminster said little to one even then be for taciturn groom cart awaited drove to saxham in silence did not do to talk of sidney with servant at elbow curiously enough groom have news for stephen brought in name of sidney please sir italian woman what be matter with asked herrick who be driving be very ill sir be said will die die echoed stephen in surprise be not bad enough for when saw last what do think herrick looked very sick certainly so far a can judge be in immediate danger of death who say parry groom sunk voice to whisper seemed nervous master sidney said men looked round at then at other herrick be first to break silence when did master sidney say that parry yesterday sir mr napper met in beorminster in cathedral square about four o'clock asked joking like where be going master sidney said just a quiet a doe speak sir that be going to see italian woman die napper be that taken aback must have knocked down with feather sir then master sidney said must die in two day take to mean sir that will go off to morrow be sure will sir added parry with conviction be story known parry asked master rather vexed sir napper went at once to see miss endicotte when came back to saxham asked to say nothing about have already told phelps gardener sir then phelps told sir have said nothing outside about see then said stephen sharply first of servant who say word will be discharged mind parry groom touched hat relapsed into silence where be master sidney now parry asked herrick after pause at house in beorminster sir have be there night miss endicotte went over must not get away say must stay there until italian woman dy sir humph need say more parry doctor drove on in silence marsh carr knew from way urged mare how perturbed be over information stephen be upset there be something disquieting about everything in connection with sidney after dinner at pine herrick made stephen lie down a be yet far from strong walked across to biffstead here saw two girl frank who be very much troubled by latest freak of brother know what to do with said frank went over insisted must come home took by shoulder to force out of house got in such passion thought must have fit so left until came back go over get away jim implored ida have more influence over than anyone else have gone be also will not come ca carry back by main force make scandal will go said herrick did not know have influence with be lad one can hing with how doe old woman take telling be about to die be quite calm evidently think sidney be kind of prophet be telling not to be afraid talking queerest thing to be sure sidney be mad sobbed ida will be shut up in asylum someday herrick said nothing poor girl little knew how truly spoke if sidney have indeed killed carr must certainly be shut up considering extraordinary character perhaps must be better for friend relative if not for will go over in morning said herrick on reflection may be more reasonable in morning be beginning to understand little be sure said ida frank echoed opinion be natural enough man be hero to relative time be said nothing while jim be away have worried much over brother freak now that doctor have returned be satisfied that must be well herrick exercised over be same influence did over most people came into contact with stephen girl be more than ordinarily intelligent deferred to jim in most remarkable manner if one must manage sidney be felt that herrick be man jim be not so certain boy have never come under influence in own calm way held own against everyone what about frisco asked be who have followed herrick down avenue have really be arrested dr jim nodded santiago betrayed to private inquiry agent employed said mean shabby piece of work be joyce put down to assured that have nothing to do with matter refused to believe be so mean that can not believe good of other people said be scornfully what be to be done now about frisco be thinking replied lover evasively when have come to conclusion will tell be fancy end be in sight hope so sighed girl be so tired of anxiety shortly will have more dear jim took in arm to kiss good bye night be dark dawn be breaking next morning dr herrick walked over to beorminster left stephen at home although squire wanted to come also said jim be best for to speak to boy alone will get more out of stephen recognised that be more sensible course be eleven o'clock when herrick rapped at door of beorminster house be opened by sidney who looked calm complacent a usual heard have come back dr jim said did prophetic instinct tell that asked herrick testily boy be so difficult to understand that must not help feeling annoyed man over thirty doe not like treating lad of sixteen a equal yet sidney somehow compelled that respect replied sweetly be very stupid about thing when thought come to come can not call then thought came to that petronella must die will die dr jim two day ago felt that must die so came over to see be afraid of death till talked to now be quite peaceful doe not fear be afraid of death sidney why must be know know what that there be nothing to be afraid of boy spoke quite serenely without suggestion of pose have conducted herrick to dining room two be seated opposite one on table be remains of sidney breakfast glass of milk fruit loaf of bread have to get said petronella be in bed in mr marsh room be very ill knew be ill time ago replied herrick trying to assert think can cure will not live said sidney staring in most unwinking manner at dr jim will die before sunset know can explain how do know asked doctor roughly time be boy who be puzzled ca said feel that petronella will die can say no more than herrick groaned be useless to try understand extraordinary lad evidently did not understand yet former prophecy have come to pas so absolutely that dr jim must not help thinking that last must come true also however be not business about have come sidney said after pause do know that frisco who used to be with colonel carr have be arrested heard be say so what do think of never thought of at be in danger dr jim be not frisco who killed colonel carr how do know asked herrick startled be boy about to confess that be guilty be in house just after colonel carr be killed oh then did not shoot sidney frowned appeared very little disturbed why must have killed said calmly colonel carr be wicked man told must die by violence day only laughed at thought be mad fool do also dr jim know what to think said jim angrily never met anyone like before sidney if have not knowledge that thing say come true must think be pretending boy like ought to be whipped be what colonel said replied sidney quietly tell dr jim did really think have killed did not frisco say did if believed that must not have run away said sidney shrewdly well come to point who murdered colonel petronella said sidney herrick rose up with look of surprise astonished a be must hardly help laughing statement bore out speech to stephen have said that sidney must accuse someone else now only remained for petronella to shift blame on to shoulder of third party believe that said herrick why must petronella kill carr have better come up hear what have to say dr jim in moment tell how know through instinct sidney shook head that feeling only come at time said pretend to know everything said so before know why must look on a queer dr jim continued plaintively be not fault if thing come into head when do sometimes tell people not always like being laughed at be queer fish muttered dr jim

see petronella at once smiled grimly wonder who will accuse said chapter xxvi truth in room where mr marsh have died in same bed lay old italian woman dying also be sitting up with red woollen shawl wrapped round bony shoulder lean hand told rosary view sidney might have instilled into regarding life beyond grave petronella still remained within fold of peter be muttering prayer after prayer with feverish haste black bead slipped quickly from between finger room be dusty dark untidy near bed be bottle of chianti bread flask be full loaf untouched petronella be past earthly food herrick saw mark of death on yellow face seemed pleased to see not at afraid receiving with chuckle interpreted look in eye so have told that young signor said in own tongue ah thought must be time too late

educated above such folly petronella woman of people with feudal instinct have clung to wild belief of middle age be one person of dr jim acquaintance who must have dreamed of such thing have not suspected why did use silver bullet petronella eh man be diavolo witch creature have evil eye did not meet with accident after have over looked be better must die rather than live to ruin signora silver bullet only in way signor can aided by devil perish be not sorry no be good deed young signor said so same petronella must tell that frisco be accused of murder be in prison be unfair that must suffer for what have done so must make confession have done so signor dottore wrote with own hand in own language petronella have slain devil man with silver bullet even so said herrick want to write

went on petronella thought if did so that must be put in prison be terrible to think so be angered against devil man have struck have looked upon with evil eye now must tempt signora to kill so be put in prison saw that must be lost then said to myself to petronella must kill alone old woman drew up in bed looked majestic a spoke herrick be profoundly sorry for have carried feudal instinct to excess so have jeopardised life for sake of mistress understood well how have be urged to blow evil eye possibility of young master being ruined by will above chance that signora might kill man fiery faithful creature like petronella must not let such thing be a said made up mind to kill carr before mr marsh must see where made mistake be that thought mistress must see man at night a matter of fact did already have seen in day perhaps mr marsh guessed what petronella might do have told falsehood about time of calling at pine when signora departed said petronella rocking to fro for be in pain got pistol si signor be pistol of husband fought for king when freed italy too be in war shot many oh many showed be not afraid to shoot piece of information showed herrick how be carr have be
