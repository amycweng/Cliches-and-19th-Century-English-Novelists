landlady without raising eye be most unfortunate most unexpected certainly most unexpected sir detective looked at sharply noticed that finger played nervously with stuff of gown also heard tremor in voice a answered now mr boazoph be not easily upset yet a fanks well saw only unusual self control prevented from having attack of hysteria to many men circumstance of crime having be committed in house must have accounted for fanks be too well acquainted with queen beelzeebub to give benefit of doubt be disturbed by something more than mere fact of murder do know man asked keeping eye fixed on face retorted mr boazoph with suspicious promptitude never set eye on until evening with hinted defiance stared fanks boldly in face when saw that be watching twitching finger became motionless on instant only one conclusion must detective draw from behaviour knew more than must own to be afraid lest must find out after look discovered nothing for be now on guard fanks turned sharply to crate where be body upstairs in one of bedroom be murder committed in one of bedroom mr fanks be committed in room at end of passage why be body removed out of room removed body said mr boazoph in low voice have right to do so rebuked fanks sharply be duty to leave thing a be when discovered that crime have be committed to give immediate information to police did do so sir police be in house ten minute after saw dead body nevertheless found time to remove in ten minute thought best to do so said mr boazoph obstinately doubt will not forget zeal be fanks rejoinder woman must not repress shudder at ironical tone of detective pale face turned yet paler however passed discreetly over remark turned conversation briskly will take upstairs to see body sir will first examine room afterwards will hear story inspect corpse come with crate still preserving impenetrable countenance mr boazoph preceded two men into little room at end of passage be apartment of great size furnished in scanty almost in penurious fashion window draped with faded curtain of red rep faced entrance there be fireplace furniture consisted of mahogany horse hair sofa placed against right hand wall looking from door round table covered with stained red cloth stood in centre of room on side of two chair crimson felting carpeted floor few racing picture crudely coloured adorned salmon tinted wall beyond room contained nothing save iron gas pipe suspended from roof by two jet flaring in pink globe lighted apartment fanks glanced slowly round taking in detail walked across to window be locked curtain be drawn blind

evening when entered room discovered fact of murder where be body huddled up on yonder sofa sir be room in same state a be now in precisely same state mr fanks wait moment interposed crate told that took glass out of room mr boazoph darted tigerish glance at detective revealed hidden possibility of nature however replied with possible meekness quite forgot that sir did take two glass off table recalling crate remark that deceased have probably be poisoned fanks be rendered angry suspicious by action a be mere folly to quarrel with so clever woman a mr boazoph made light of circumstance observed casually that doubt glass have be washed put away yes sir assented landlady be washed put away by own hand have always known to be extremely tidy woman said fanks ironically two glass say then there be two gentleman in room between six seven there be two men in room between six seven replied mr boazoph making correction with emphasis two men say came to have chat by appointment think so sir white man came at six black man arrived hour later ho ho said fanks rather taken by surprise so one of men be negro see who lie dead upstairs white man sir negro assassin what of have proof that negro committed crime mr fanks protested mr boazoph forgetting caution for moment there be mark of violence on body of course not said fanks with grim humour doubt white man died convenient natural death while negro for reason fled in alarm be obliged to for suggestion mr boazoph probably be a say not sufficiently clever to see irony of remark crate looked surprised woman be clearer sighted seeing that have over reached by saying too much relapsed into silence detective feeling that have scored smiled grimly went on with examination of room body be on sofa say said after pause yes be tumbled in heap against wall glass be on table on table on tray be there sign of struggle not that saw mr fanks can describe appearance of white man stop will see body when go upstairs what of black man be tall burly fat creature sir just like other negro how be dressed in black opera hat dark trouser brown boot long green overcoat with brass button said mr boazoph concisely rather noticeable dress said fanks carelessly have ever seen negro before sir white man never saw white black man in life till evening by time patience of mr boazoph be nearly worn out self control be gradually giving way evidently felt that must hold out no longer for after replying to last question left room suddenly that fanks interfered crate must have stopped let go said former can see later on in meantime continued pointing to table what be crate bent forward on dingy red saw number of tiny black grain scattered about be powder of sort said told that thought man have be poisoned even a crate spoke gaslight went out leaving in complete darkness ah said fanks rather startled by unexpected incident mr boazoph be fiddling with meter what deuce did do for asked crate a superior struck match ca guess saw black grain on tablecloth want to get rid of be why left room turned off gas hope that darkness will drive out then will explain incident by lie enter before to relight gas well said crate stolidly well repeated fanks crossly will never make understand anything crate before lighting gas will pull off tablecloth scatter grain do think be in mr fanks ca say yet know something get candle hang match cried fanks have burnt finger a uttered exclamation match still alight dropped on table among black grain to allusion have be made there be flicker sparkle of light when fanks struck match grain have disappeared gunpowder said detective in puzzled tone now what possible connection can gunpowder have with matter to there be answer by glimmer of single match two men looked blankly at one chapter ii recognition topping discovery came return of mr boazoph with candle apology procedure be so exactly same a suggested by fanks crate must not forbear from paying tribute of admiring chuckle to perspicuity of chief only in action with tablecloth did mr boazoph vary from prescribed ritual regret apology sir said addressing fanks with side glance at table one of servant idle slut whom have now discharged turned off gas at meter by accident hope that be not alarmed by sudden darkness permit to relight burner with neat speech mounted chair with activity of girl having remedied accident stumbled seemed to stumble in descending caught at table to save thereby dragging cloth on to floor then be that crate chuckled whereupon mr boazoph be on foot at once with look of startled suspicion however a have accomplished object recovered equanimity speedily made apology with lie tacked on to regret for second accident remarked glibly be due to overstrung nerve put down to gentleman if please will put down to right cause pray mention mr boazoph said fanks significantly have already examined cloth now if please will go upstairs woman drew back bit lip guessed that fanks have seen through stratagem for moment be minded to excuse fortunately habitual caution saved from second blunder strove to conciliate fanks by piece of news trust that will not think presuming sir said in hope that there might be chance of life remaining in sent for doctor be now upstairs with kindness doe great credit said fanks seeing way clear to thrust must not have behaved better if have known man holding candle before face mr boazoph drew back step with one hand clutching bosom of dress composure gave way in one word suspect cried with glitter in eye in one word suspect nobody retorted fanks have not yet heard story remember know know said mr boazoph man who came here at six evening man who lie dead upstairs be complete stranger to caught only glimpse of a entered did not speak to asked for private room in to wait for friend be shown into room waited negro arrived ten minute later saw showed into room indeed mr fanks never set eye on before pair white black be together till close on seven have something to drink for dead man paid did not enter room be barmaid who served with drink did not know when negro went wanting room for other gentleman knocked at door at seven o'clock to ask if have finished conversation received reply opened door entered found white man dead negro absent after removing body upstairs covering with sheet a decent woman must sent for police be swear that be truth say what please do what please can not fasten crime on to fanks listened to speech with great imperturbability made one comment thereon took for clever woman mr boazoph said evidently have be wrong will be so kind a to light upstairs mr boazoph thrust candle into hand have seen once refuse to look upon again passed out of room shaking a with ague fanks nodded in satisfied way beckoning to crate went frightened housemaid on landing indicated room of be in search entered to come face to face with doctor summoned by zealous landlady introduced a dr renshaw made announcement with bland smile condescending bow fanks eyed tall burly figure napoleonic countenance smooth brown beard perfect dress there be look about man did not like mistrusted uneasy glance of hard grey eye detective relied largely on instinct in case warned against false geniality of dr renshaw representative of law believe said medical man in deep rolling voice be about to take departure if can be of service in interest of justice pray command suppose there be doubt that friend there be dead said fanks dead a caesar sir said magnificent doctor waving arm caesar died by steel remarked fanks significantly appears that man died in easier manner there be parallel said doctor condescending to add to historical knowledge of detective if may believe brutus great julius be slain a traitor to republic unknown man added renshaw pointing to body also died death of traitor if a say dead man be unknown said fanks quickly how can tell that be traitor by inference deduction be reply can judge for far be from must set opinion against of law have theory must care to hear if may venture on jest said renshaw with ponderous playfulness medical mouse may help legal lion let hear theory by mean said fanks easily first permit to speak with assistant doctor bowed passed over to other side of bed while fanks went with crate to door here hesitated glanced at doctor finally led subordinate into passage crate said in rapid whisper mistrust man will shortly leave place follow find out where life then set someone to watch place return to do think that have anything to do with asked crate ca say at present may be wrong about about mr boazoph same mistrust pair of now off with when crate departed to watch for outcoming of doctor fanks re entered chamber of death renshaw still stood beside bed seemingly have not moved from position nevertheless mat placed midway between bed door be rucked up by merest accident fanks have previously noticed that be lying flat thence deduced that renshaw have crossed to door in plain word renshaw have be listening fanks be confirmed in opinion by complacent smile played round lip of doctor now for theory doctor said fanks noting saying nothing certainly sir a detective know of course of existence of secret society do know also that who reveal doings of such society be punished go on doctor first must inspect body replied renshaw drew down sheet concealed face of dead in cruel glare of gaslight fanks beheld countenance discoloured distorted head be that of young man with brown curly hair well marked eyebrow moustache of same hue a hair body be clothed in moleskin trouser flannel shirt from bedpost hung rough grey coat cloth cap glance assured fanks that clothes of working man be perfectly new glance confirmed first belief that dead man be gentleman on looking intently into face started back in surprise recovering said nothing if doctor have observed action made pointed remark thereon set down merely to natural feeling of repulsion wonder that state of body revolt sir said corpse be swollen discoloured in terrible manner of course can say nothing authoritatively until post mortem have be made from appearance be inclined to ascribe death to poison ah then be case of murder so say sir secret society to man belongs must call punishment how do know that man belongs to secret society do recognise body sir man be nameless so far a be concerned there be mark on linen clothes there be paper in pocket likely to identify oh believe sir society have done work well seem to be very confident about secret society doctor bent over body rolled up shirt sleeve of left arm between elbow shoulder there appeared swollen mark in shape of rude cross surrounded by wheel violet in colour slashed across with knife to pointed in silence see what mean said fanks twisting signet ring always sign of perplexity with secret mark of society have be obliterated precisely now can understand sir why infer that man be traitor evidently negro of whose presence mr boazoph informed be emissary of society killed traitor by poison afterwards a be natural obliterated secret mark by drawing knife across did not do work thoroughly then doctor secret mark be cross secret mark be more than cross sir replied doctor else may be sure that negro must have obliterated more perfectly detective replaced sheet over face of dead prepared a did doctor to leave room turned down gas departed while descending stair renshaw asked fanks question be satisfied that explanation be correct one demanded be perfectly satisfied said fanks looking directly at man strange to say unhesitating acceptance appeared to render renshaw uneasy flow of magnificent speech broke up in confusion may be wrong muttered be liable to error such a be be opinion must be willing to repeat opinion at inquest doctor renshaw drew back with shudder be necessary must go to inquest asked faintly think so replied fanks significantly be first to see corpse will have to describe state in found address if please twenty four great auk street said renshaw after hesitation be staying there at present staying there yes not practise in london practise at in fact travel travel great deal in two week go to india must go first to inquest responded fanks dryly if practise in london how come that mr boazoph sent for did not send for explained doctor for friend dr turnor be absent on holiday be acting a locum tenens for short period thank doctor be thoroughly satisfactory explanation quite a satisfactory a theory of death good evening must recommend glass of brandy look a though needed weak heart muttered renshaw in explanation took departure with evident relief before left hotel acted on detective suggestion mr boazoph gave brandy with own hand action afforded opportunity of exchanging few word with fanks thwarted intent by also entering bar asking for refreshment whereupon doctor finished liquor departed left alone with fanks landlady drew breath of relief addressed to detective do wish to know anything else sir said coldly if not with permission will retire to bed have learned wish to know at present thank mr boazoph go to bed by mean be sure that need rest after anxiety landlady looking worn out haggard retired fanks went to door to wait for crate return in meantime made note formed theory will be revealed hereafter in meantime case be in too crude state for to come to smallest conclusion however have already decided on next step in chamber of death have made important discovery enabled to move in matter in hour crate returned with information that dr renshaw have entered no great auk street that have set detective to watch house fanks smiled on receiving report be cleverer than thought murmured left tooley alley with crate well mr fanks whom do suspect one at present crate oh what do do next make certain of dead man identity crate stopped in surprise do know who be mr fanks yes be friend of own sir gregory fellenger baronet chapter iii result of crime week after discovery of identity of dead man fanks having slipped detective skin for time being be seated in writing room of athenian club with morning planet newspaper on knee be not reading however be looking absently at long lean young man who be writing letter at near table francis garth of middle temple barrister journalist be one of few west end men who knew real profession of rixton alias fanks in fact there be very little did not know fanks a will be convenient to call detective be debating a to whether must question about tooley alley crime be urged to course by remembrance that have seen garth at inquest have be held on previous day jury have brought in verdict of wilful murder against person person unknown conduct of case have be placed officially in hand of fanks so far be ship shape now detective found at standstill evidence have be brought forward implicating mr boazoph dr renshaw doubtful a be fanks a to honesty must gain clue from one other of likely to elucidate mystery failing have determined to learn if possible about previous life of deceased in way discover if anyone be likely to be gainer by death garth who have known late sir gregory intimately who have be present at inquest be most likely person to furnish detail fanks be waiting for opportunity of addressing on result of projected conversation must depend future movement say garth said fanks how much longer will correspondence take will be at service in ten minute replied garth without desisting from occupation what do wish to talk about about death of friend sir gregory fellenger garth looked up turned round with alacrity be case in hand fanks yes want information from will be happy to give wait for few minute be just writing about to friend of mine yours humph name ted journalist looked at one same thought occupying mind have reason for writing anything to do with left arm of friend asked fanks after pause garth nodded returned to work when have sealed directed stamped letter fanks spoke again garth said say garth yes what be matter send that letter till after conversation ah guess why be writing to remark of few moment ago ought to have shown that said fanks dryly yes guess object want to leave case in hand be too difficult one for to manage alone know that be difficult fanks wish to solve mystery because fellenger be friend asked fanks because fellenger be cousin replied garth announcement took fanks by surprise a have not known of relationship be aware that fellenger garth have be close friend knew little of former save a club acquaintance latter be very reticent about private affair although be curious concerning affair of others so wish to revenge death of cousin remarked after thoughtful moment garth shrugged shoulder hardly that replied between did not care overmuch for fellenger be bad lot only held together because of relationship must like to find out what took to tooley alley who killed laudable curiosity do suspect anybody not soul be a much in dark a be may not be so much in dark a think said other then why did ask to assist retorted garth sharply see here fanks will tell know if will promise to keep posted up concerning progress of case fanks twisted ring reflected agree said briefly must not meddle unless tell to do so agreed pair shook hand on bargain now said fanks grimly that letter if please after moment hesitation garth handed over have great respect for mental capacity of friend on whole judged advisable to carry out agreement have be concluded though must send that letter if be expostulated hersham have know what hersham have interrupted fanks want to see not wait till know how stand at present moment come into smoking room answer question what peremptory chap be grumbled garth a left room evidently confide in discretion be about to do so said fanks who understood art of conciliation will work together know will know must let manage thing in own way in heart garth be flattered that fanks must have chosen a coadjutor dominated by stronger will of detective quietly took up position of underling garth be self willed not usually amenable to reason fanks have law at back without garth must not hope to do anything hence acquiescence come now old fellow said fanks amiably have hard task before so must make easier by answering question go on said garth lighting cigar always give in to man who have have more experience than fanks laughed at delicate way of adjusting situation a wished to keep on good term with touchy lawyer let remark pas in silence when be fairly settled saw that have smoking room to took out pocket book began examination a to past of dead man fellengers be hampshire family believe yes replied garth with nod sir gregory be fourth baronet only son family seat be mere hall near bournemouth be sir gregory cousin be on mother side who be present baronet somebody else somebody else said garth with sigh must have told if have be heir wonder at so clever man a asking so very frivolous question have reason said fanks calmly well who be heir cousin louis fellenger be twenty five year of age a great prig a ever lived where doe reside now believe that have gone to mere hall to take possession of property did live at taxton on thames village near weybridge do know sir louis intimately have only seen once twice be bookish scientific man invalid at least corrected garth have always doctor living with tall fat brute called binjoy who twist round finger have be with for year tall fat brute repeated fanks smiling at amiable description have gentleman in question long brown beard be clean shaven pompous creature fond of using long word proud of voice oratorial power something like 'conversation kenge ' in 'bleak house humph said fanks rather struck by description be not unlike of renshaw will discus dr binjoy later on in meantime just enlighten a to precise relationship with present baronet be easily understood gregory father sir francis after whom be named have brother sister married respected father richard garth be sole offspring brother be father of present sir louis exactly there be great deal of similarity between three case gregory be only child parent be dead louis be only child parent have also gone way of flesh be only child be likewise orphan fanks made note of family tree in book so far so good said with nod sir gregory be dead sir louis have succeeded if louis dy without issue be heir failing property go to crown replied garth louis be sole representative of fellengers race have dwindled considerably now what about dead cousin be trifle rapid believe regular bad lot kept in with because well because be useful to understand perfectly replied fanks who knew of garth financial difficulty will pas have idea what took to tooley alley not slightest saw two day before death on nineteenth said nothing about going there then did behave a usual towards be out of sort have lost lot of money at card believe be crabbed in consequence there be other trouble financial difficulty not that know of fast a be must not get through ten thousand year before age of twenty eight have known men who have done so said fanks dryly however if be not question of money what about inevitable woman think be that demurred garth be man met negro not woman true well be at inquest how do know asked garth starting saw there in crowd see everything fanks be business to see everything garth be because be at inquest sought out to day now that have explained to relationship to sir gregory understand why be present to return to main point heard theory of dr renshaw yes replied garth reflectively there might be something in secret society business not mind that gregory be man to meddle with rubbish of kind be too much of fool one never know man doe not have cross tattooed on arm for nothing do think that be mark of revolutionary society ca say must like to know be why be writing to hersham of course know that know that have cross tattooed on arm also be for reason reject secret society business be mine be merely following lead of renshaw then be following will o wisp retorted fanks see here garth have known hersham for long time be son of clergyman in isle of wight be brought up to law like also like left for journalism a know be merry open minded creature who must not conceal secret if life depended upon do think that if have be mixed up with secret society that must have be able to conceal fact from then why be there cross tattooed on left arm asked garth intend to see find out noticed long ago made remark on thinking that be result of school boy freak now have assumed new importance in eye therefore must let interview hersham choose own time place for doing so suppose be right tear up letter please fanks held out letter tear up said garth did without further remark looked at friend what do intend to do now asked continue conversation for few minute longer be intimate with dead man garth did ever notice cross did not said garth promptly must have asked what meant by jove added with start then obliteration business must be nonsense of course assented fanks smoothly came to conclusion long ago fellenger have cross on arm when entered tooley alley be tattooed that night by negro what make think that found few grain of gunpowder on tablecloth of room in be together gunpowder be used in tattooing again arm when renshaw showed to be raw a though operation have be done lately why must gregory go to tooley alley to be tattooed tell that mystery of death be at end said fanks significantly be certain that fellenger voluntarily let negro tattoo arm so came by death came by death echoed garth in astonishment what do mean why answered fanks seriously mean that needle used for tattooing be poisoned so shrugged shoulder man died chapter iv discovery informed of astounding fact garth stared at friend in blank astonishment detective resumed cigar waited can not be in earnest said barrister after pause why not theory be feasible enough be proved at inquest that man died from blood poisoning yes might have be administered in liquor pair have drink remember have not forgotten said fanks quietly on part remember that trace of poison be found in stomach while blood be so corrupted a to show that deceased have be inoculated with powerful vegetable poison there be mark on body save cross on left arm by own showing be not there when fellenger went to tooley assumption be that be done there a be more than confirmed by presence of gunpowder again according to mr boazoph there be struggle therefore deceased must have passed away quietly inference be that negro desired to kill sir gregory else be instructed to do so by one else who wished for death of cousin what then so easy a for negro to have poisoned needle prepared to execute tattooing quite unaware of danger fellenger for unknown reason must permit insertion of fatal needle a work went on must gradually be inoculated with poison when gunpowder acid be applied job must be finished must pull down sleeve quite ignorant to intent purpose be dead man then sat chatted with negro till end came when sank into state of coma died when certain that death be assured fact negro took departure oh be all a plain a day to excepting one fact that fact why did fellenger get negro in tooley alley to tattoo garth reflected can only conclude that secret rubbish said fanks contemptuously secret society tell be nonsense even assuming that cross be emblem of association grant for moment have proved that be not tattooed on cousin arm when went to keep appointment therefore must not at time have be member of mythical society if on other hand be being made member ceremony must not have taken place in low pot house why must be killed society admit living men to work end have use for dead body be true enough fanks must reject idea of secret society in affair of robbery murder in such affair method of procedure must be different bludgeon sand bag knife of weapon if please if negro have designed to rob fellenger need not have ingratiated into confidence to permit performance of so delicate operation a of poisoned needle must reject that theory also then what do think be motive of murder be not detective out of novel mr garth ask easier question rose from seat began to walk to fro whole mystery lie in tattooing muttered to if can only find out why sir gregory permitted that cross to be tattooed why went to tooley alley to have done will discover assassin hersham have tattooed cross on left arm said garth perhaps can explain riddle perhaps can perhaps ca returned fanks sharply coincidence be certainly curious will see question hersham there be much to be done before then must help garth be willing to do wish friend ah said fanks with smile have touch of detective fever suffer from notwithstanding experience unravelling of criminal problem be like gambling never failing source of excitement like gambling chance enters largely into solution see much 'chance ' in case think again why very fact that must know hersham have tattooed cross on left arm be chance such knowledge be mere chance knowledge might lead to nothing on other hand may help to find man who killed cousin surely suspect hersham certainly not why must suspect on evidence of tattooed cross for know may be simple coincidence such a crop up constantly in real life suspect hersham do suspect anyone suspect special person of committing murder suspect people particularly one individual of knowing more than chose to say be beside point wish to help by mean what be want to do know chamber of cousin by desire have be in hand of police since death fellenger valet be also there detained by desire now wish to search chamber for possible evidence to examine must take there at once be necessary when by own showing be supreme already friend said fanks solemnly be experience that when lower order to valet belongs come into contact with detective be quite useless a witness for very simple reason that presence of law paralysis to avoid danger must introduce into chamber a sympathising friend only can question servant in presence having got rid of in meantime can search chamber together police may recognise police have instruction will recognise a mr rixton of west end garth fell in readily with scheme together two men left club a proceeded along piccadilly dead man chamber be in half moon street fanks resumed conversation from point where have be broken off have answered question capitally garth now a be working together will reply to anything like to ask barrister restored to sense of importance by thought of part be about to play in forthcoming interview with valet availed readily of opportunity of learning plan of detective fanks have hesitation in confiding to a foreseeing that garth must be necessary to elucidation of mystery wished to interest in case a much a possible be well aware that garth be not man to give up idea when once have fixed in head present idea be to investigate mystery of cousin death with characteristic wisdom fanks who never wasted person opportunity made use of new factor in case to further own end such economy aided frequent success in small degree what be plan asked garth taking advantage of permission a yet can not be certain of so far a can see at present include search examination of chamber valet conversation with landlady of red star visit to taxton on thames interview with dr renshaw why with latter gentleman because renshaw be too confidential with mr boazoph because be too conveniently on spot at time of murder for liking finally because renshaw have cut dried theory of motive of crime prepared on instant trust man think that conduct be suspicious accuse of anything a yet doe not look man to be feared said garth disbelievingly be very timid in giving evidence at inquest be one reason why mistrust dr renshaw be acting part be unable to say whether be mixed up in especial affair have suspicion a know never like to speak unless certain garth looked curiously at detective hint at guilt of mr boazoph said doubtfully do then must hold tongue there be doubt that negro committed crime in way that told of believe that acted a agent of third party not mr boazoph wish to find out that party to hang a accessory before fact ca hang perhaps not can imprison do think that mr boazoph know motive of crime fanks reflected yes think doe said quietly be belief that motive for be searching be to be found in past life of mr boazoph past be known to police be not be known for last twenty year only appeared in london twenty one year ago who be where came from police know more than do then how can motive be found in garth said fanks pausing touching other with finger have presentiment premonition rarely deceive in instance point to mr boazoph ask why for can tell more be sure that be going forward on dark path at end of path will find mr boazoph never thought that be so superstitious fanks regard a so assure here fanks became emphatic believe in instinct in presentiment garth walked along in silence rather inclined to ridicule apparent weakness of fanks however judged wiser to keep thought to merely asked question relative to negro be at loss about negro said fanks a know where to search for under circumstance think necessary to follow clue hold in hand going of dead cousin to tooley alley to keep appointment how do know that be appointment learnt much from mr boazoph said that white man came first be asked for by black man be appointment wish to find out who made how can discover well hope to do so by searching chamber of cousin there must be letter sign whereby fellenger knew where to meet negro letter may have be destroyed possibly from knowledge of cousin character must think probable that must destroy letter making appointment said garth after moment thought if appointment be made within last month must think that letter be still in existence on what ground asked fanks eagerly well gregory used to read letter then drop into drawer of desk at end of month went through pile letter be worth nothing be destroyed so if letter making appointment be in existence will be in drawer of desk good be chance hardly hoped to have chance again yes chance again replied fanks good humouredly how many men burn letter for fortunate circumstance that cousin saved for month must be almost hopeless to think of gaining clue now there be more than hope provided that appointment be made by letter of course assented fanks gravely must always take into consideration question on side did strike at inquest that there be resemblance between doctor renshaw binjoy ca say that did renshaw be much older than binjoy wear full beard whereas binjoy be shaven clean still be burly have fine voice indulge in long word stately johnsonian dialogue surely think two men be one same have idea said fanks dryly strange a may appear a opinion be mainly founded on description may be wrong at event renshaw go to india next week if find binjoy in company of sir louis fellenger after renshaw departure will admit error otherwise well must get to bottom of matter have only seen of once said garth so depend altogether on power of description wo depend on nothing own eyesight for instance if see black man wearing green overcoat with brass button will have reasonable suspicion see assassin of cousin hullo what be matter for garth be leaning against iron railing of green park with look of dread on face by heaven fanks may be right about what about renshaw binjoy being one same man indeed what make think so asked fanks dryly because binjoy have negro servant who wear green coat with brass button chapter v red star advertisement greatly to surprise of garth detective appeared to be decidedly disappointed at announcement seem to be overpleased at what have told said in tone of pique make case easier to confess that think so be fanks reply will give reason after have examined cousin room at present must say that have puzzled fanks refusal to discus subject of negro did not at please garth especially a considered that discovery have placed solution of case in hand to protestation detective only reiterated determination to keep silent until room have be searched with garth be forced to be content although must not conceive reason of such extraordinary conduct ascended stair with ill grace be in place must follow out clue of negro without delay said a rang bell be in place must do a be doing take time to consider movement retorted fanks a door be opened venturing on further remonstrance garth walked into chamber followed by friend servant who admitted be light complexioned light haired young fellow who appeared to be thoroughly frightened first remark exposed reason of terror be afraid ca come in sir said to cousin of late master with backward glance police be here a spoke policeman made appearance overflowing with official importance prompted by fanks barrister at once

looked at fanks evidently saw order in face of detective for at once moved aside granted desired permission valet robert be astonished at sudden yielding entertained suspicion that there be understanding between policeman fashionably dressed young man who have be introduced a mr rixton at glance detective saw that have to deal with timid simple creature who might be trusted to tell truth out of sheer nervous apprehension discovery afforded satisfaction be much obliged to officer said garth slipping shilling into policeman hand will not stay long robert show into sitting room if please wish to ask few question terrified expression flitted across face of mild valet like well trained servant merely bowed preceded garth along passage fanks lingered behind maxwell said to policeman have

short space of time fanks be curious to see to learn reason of coming a might be that be indirectly connected with case a yet there be woman mixed up in matter with doubtful exception of mr boazoph from long experience fanks be sure that necessary element must yet appear seemed a though expectation be about to be realised be lady maxwell imitation of one real lady sir gave sov sir have business to take money said half smiling at maxwell definition of what be real lady must help sir said maxwell piteously must give to sir be ready to return sir if must come back well will see show into

surprise found barrister alone where be robert asked fanks sharply sent out thinking that must search room first wo do will want assistance call in at once garth nodded rang bell in few minute robert

clothed in moleskin trouser flannel shirt did ever see that disguise in possession ca say that ever did sir replied valet hesitatingly week before parcel came for sir gregory must not let open be about to do so when stopped think parcel contained clothes disguise why do think so because parcel be soft felt like clothes besides came from week co of edgeware road sell more workman clothes than anything else on what day did clothes arrive asked fanks idly on fourteenth sir be certain of date because sir gregory be taken ill in morning taken ill repeated garth at what time be taken ill at

sir have attack like of previous week when be reading paper letter be from woman supposed be sir judging from handwriting have sir gregory anything to do at time with particular woman robert grew even paler than usual placed hand on throat with nervous gesture replied with difficulty eye on ground not that know of sir said hoarsely fanks be satisfied that servant be lying made attempt to intervene on contrary signed to garth to conclude examination to let man go lawyer did forthwith be robert can go will remain here with mr rixton for few minute longer when servant have taken departure garth turned eagerly to friend well fanks what do think of think that there be woman at bottom of a usual mr boazoph younger prettier woman than mr boazoph will talk of later in meantime wish to see that letter advertisement what advertisement one in beorning post ' upset cousin on fourteenth in drawer doe stow letter garth went to desk tried middle drawer be locked a be other drawer used to place paper in middle drawer said garth see that be closed thought might be said fanks producing bunch of key so brought with good skeleton key will open lock be of special construction gregory be very proud of be key of desk garth be found in dead man pocket brought with in case drawer must be locked be right seems now let make search opened middle drawer revealed mass of letter in envelope in have come two men went carefully through pile in ten minute be rewarded by finding object of search envelope address of a have be stated by robert be in female handwriting contained three document two

minute ago well have made step forward here be slip asking for appointment here be cousin reply leaving question of appointment to first advertiser finally here be ingenious pictorial information indicating red star in tooley alley a meeting place sir gregory disguised in workman clothes bought from week co on day that first notice appeared kept appointment between six seven so walked blindfolded into trap of red star where met with fate assassin laid plan uncommonly well made one mistake mean to say that murderer be murderess no negro killed sir gregory be beyond doubt a said before be opinion that negro be inspired by third party ca see that address on envelope be in female handwriting certainly can doe not prove that woman inspired crime go too fast fanks perhaps do after may be mistaken that address be in feigned hand be written by woman if woman have nothing to do with death why must bait trap to lure man to doom again direction on cardboard star be in angular female hand address direction be in handwriting of elderly woman come now cried garth disbelievingly ca tell woman age from handwriting can tell that be elderly angular spiky letter be formed by woman who learned to write in early victorian day female handwriting have altered of late friend new woman go in for masculine handwriting a well a for masculine dress if girl of present day have written address must have be in bold manly hand a be bet five pound that be scribbled by woman over fifty may be so be deduction most of evidence in criminal case be circumstantial deductive thing make think that be woman there be great deal of useless mystery here man must not have troubled about that must have inserted third advertisement appointing time place woman ca resist touch of mysterious therefore devise silly cardboard star sends through post so betrays how can betray when there be address there be address there be postmark look at envelope garth picked up paper saw that postmark be taxton on thames why cried in astonishment be where cousin louis life yes be where dr binjoy life be more to purpose said fanks dryly did not tell be right to doubt that gentleman garth looked again

fool patience garth be not yet at end of discovery again searched drawer in many of there be nothing likely to attract attention in lowest drawer on right hand side garth made discovery be that of pretty girl photograph showed to fanks with laugh gregory always have weakness for pretty face remarked do not think that taste be good fanks looked reflectively at picture be that of girl just budding into womanhood with delicate face rather sad eye name of artist be not printed at foot a be usual be address of studio inscribed thereon nevertheless on back of photograph detective found writing startled garth cried eagerly give that envelope ah thought so what be matter asked garth astonished at excitement of usually calm fanks look at envelope look at back of photograph compare handwriting fanks placed side by side on desk on envelope be address of sir gregory in half moon street on photograph inscription ran a follows emma born died handwriting on be one same garth drew long breath by george be strange said after pause woman who wrote one wrote other there be shadow of difference between writing be right fanks penmanship be that of elderly woman doubt mother of girl be opinion also girl garth who be lawyer reflected frowned did hear that cousin be entangled with woman said with reluctance be many month ago in fact there be rumour of marriage asked gregory if be so received prompt denial for added garth looking at portrait there might have be truth in rumour never saw lady cousin must be very secretive when liked seventy four to ninety three just nineteen poor creature whosoever be be certain that treated badly may judge too harshly garth shook head with gloomy air knew cousin well said must have killed woman with unkindness looked at one back at photograph there be something sinister in fact that two article be inscribed in same handwriting writing on photograph recorded decease of pretty woman on envelope have lured baronet to death be possible that folly of sir gregory have come home to in so fearful fashion two men must not incline to opinion well said fanks after long pause must like to ask robert what know about woman very probably know nothing be not so certain about replied fanks when asked about woman about possible entanglement must hardly speak for fear told lie about be servile hound that fellow daresay did fellenger dirty work for must have in force truth from unwilling lip will go away after have seen said garth who be beginning to weary of matter wish to wait see girl girl what girl young lady who called morning to see robert maxwell told necessary lie that robert be out so said must call again afternoon at three be past three now said garth glancing at clock better may appear at moment maxwell have order to show in here then then will find out why lady must call upon miserable dog of valet in meantime bell have in will question if please wish to remain incognito robert answered bell so promptly a to suggest probability that have be stationed at keyhole face however be a vacant miserable a ever so even if have overheard fanks did not think that have sufficient brain to be dangerous valet waited mutely for order with cowed look on face rubbed one lean hand over other be uncomfortable creature in respect robert said garth in a mild tone a be possible be authorised by police to look over cousin paper have done so with assistance of mr rixton have made several discovery yes sir said man moistening dry lip do know taxton on thames sir never heard of startled by calm denial fanks bent forward to observe man face be satisfied by glance that robert have spoken truth have never heard of taxton on thames discovery puzzled detective did master late master know of interpolated not that be aware of sir never mentioned name to robert said garth solemnly denied time ago sir gregory be entangled with woman think again answer truly robert shifted from one foot to other looked uneasily at questioner then made evasive reply sir gregory be connected with woman at time of death said doggedly may be be connected with woman in valet started back with gasp how did hear of asked shaking in limb heard from one guessed from picture with sudden movement thrust photograph under eye of pale trembling creature after one glance robert recoiled with ejaculation of horror covered face with hand expecting revelation fanks waited watched come said garth quietly see that recognise woman name if please promised never to speak of must for own sake dare not let go mr garth broke away from lawyer before must reach door be in grip of fanks come robert said latter soothingly must make best of bad job know that be devoted to master at same time be dead be necessary that mystery of death must be cleared up on whole added fanks looking into eye of servant think advisable that must confess woman speak of have nothing to do with death of master be not asking that be inquiring name answer sudden imperiousness in detective tone made robert heart sink within be incapable of prolonged struggle forthwith answered with submissiveness know real name what did call emma calvert ah what did call robert valet looked at garth with look of malicious triumph called lady fellenger said slowly garth sprang up with sudden exclamation be stopped by fanks who rapidly questioned valet be emma calvert really truly wife of master yes sir be married quietly in hampstead church be in dressmaker shop master be very much in love with heard that be engaged to gentleman threw over married sir gregory before went to paris so rumour be right for once said garth shrugging shoulder well whether gregory be married single matter little to be not heir may matter great deal to case remarked fanks dryly perhaps robert can tell where emma calvert came from know master knew never told lady fellenger did not speak of past in presence where be now dead died in paris see that be telling truth died in how did die ca answer burst out robert in frenzy will drive mad night day have dead face before look at continued holding out trembling hand be wreck of what be once through death of emma calvert of lady fellenger two listener arose to foot what dark mystery be connected with death of woman must so move man in searching for one murder have stumbled upon did meet death by foul play asked garth sternly swear be not that did not get on well with master wearied of neglected be very proud impulsive one night after great scene well man well destroyed great heaven cried garth confirmed in worst fear suicide drowned in seine said robert in low voice a spoke woman appeared on threshold of open door robert gave one look at raised hand with cry dead moaned retreating from woman dead returned to life saw laid out saw buried be there there with cry fell on floor in fit others made attempt to assist be staring spellbound at woman be original of photograph garth held in hand chapter vii difficulty woman who have caused commotion stood in doorway looking on in surprise be dressed in semi masculine fashion now affected by sex serge gown short smart in appearance natty jacket of same material worn over black striped shirt tyrolean hat of brown felt face be oval waxen in pallor eye of dark blue hair black luxuriant look of determination be impressed on lip eye gave place to expression of surprise when saw robert fall on floor finally when eye met of fanks started shrank back maxwell peered over shoulder in gaping astonishment for quite minute there be dramatic pause be broken by woman who stepped forward addressed to fanks see how sight of terrifies wretch said pointing to man on floor will hear from other lip than mine how treated master wife wait gentleman till bring up friend to confront man with extraordinary word pushed back maxwell disappeared quite believing that spoke in good faith fanks made sign that must be stopped indeed be too dumbfounded by strangeness of situation to speak looked helplessly at garth that gentleman be if possible even more surprised than friend sudden appearance of presumably dead woman at once alarmed astonished knew not what to make of matter do believe that be emma calvert asked garth who be first to recover use of tongue emma calvert friend well then lady fellenger if prefer doe matter what call rejoined fanks with shrug seeing that be dead be not dead fanks again shrugged shoulder pointed to photograph card say that emma calvert be dead remarked valet say that emma calvert be dead how then can living woman be emma calvert lady fellenger ca explain said garth obstinately be sure of one thing that be original of picture must appear so said fanks looking puzzled yet upon word be most extraordinary thing ever saw in life garth for once see at wit end thoroughly mystified wait fanks wait explanation of woman hear story of friend in meantime let revive wretched creature be in kind of fit said fanks kneeling down loosening collar of insensible man get water garth maxwell go down see if woman friend be coming up may a well see business out direction be obeyed garth soon returned with glass of water while fanks always provided against emergency produced smelling bottle flask of brandy while thus employed be interrupted by maxwell with look of alarm on face well said fanks sharply where be woman friend know about friend sir be gone off fanks sprang to foot gone off repeated what do mean what say sir said policeman doggedly went down must not see asked constable at door said a have drove off in hansom look of mingled surprise distrust settled on face of fanks in moment guessed without much difficulty that woman have tricked felt small in own estimation at having be so neatly baffled be most humiliating moment of life attend to man with mr garth said roughly will see for blaming for simplicity caught up hat took out of chamber at street door looked up down ho must see trace of missing woman constable loitered on pavement distance away although be stranger to fanks detective accosted without least hesitation be le time for considering than for acting moment be precious moment lessened chance of tracking discovering woman fanks a rule be one of most self contained of men rarely losing self control cool temper at moment must have sworn freely at want of caution have let possible witness in case slip through finger hoped that there be yet time to retrieve fault officer said walking quickly up to constable did see lady come out of yonder door yes sir policeman upstairs just asked about went away in hansom five minute ago see drive off like mad be near at hand just at elber so to speak sir did hear what address gave cabman what do want to know for sir asked policeman in gruff way be business not yours retorted fanks unused to being thwarted by member of force be fanks detective be here on business quick man address a maxwell have hinted that detective be upstairs policeman at once believed statement saluted respectfully did give perticler address jest said piccadilly promiscus what part of piccadilly demanded fanks hailing hansom jest piccadilly more sir repeated officer do know number of cab sir there be occasion of to take of course of course muttered fanks testily can describe hansom be there particular mark by can recognise well sir did note a have red white blue suncloth over roof with cabby a wore white beaver so to speak will do cried fanks jumping into vehicle have driven up way did cab turn to right sir down piccadilly cabby cried detective a driver looked through trap go down piccadilly look for hansom with red white blue suncloth be sovereign if catch be joe berners cab be said jehu drove off briskly with fare in fever of excitement fanks have enough to think about during drive material being amply supplied by woman who have so cleverly tricked what motive have brought woman to fellenger chamber for what reason have taken departure so suddenly be emma calvert dead if so who be woman who bore so extraordinary resemblance to if emma calvert be not dead be why have come to moon street why have robert fainted at mere sight of question presented to mind of detective found unable to answer of if discovered mysterious woman there might be chance of explanation failing woman there remained valet if one be missing other be ignorant fanks knew not what must do in so difficult matter a be height of season piccadilly be crowded with vehicle of description rate of progress be slow far very far ahead fanks thought that must descry noticeable suncloth described by constable of be not quite sure therefore remained in cab instead of alighting to make certain during block caused by congested state of roadway flashed into mind that have seen woman face before be doubtful if be so yet have uneasy feeling that be feature of unknown woman be familiar to a american say must not fix nohow only remained for to refresh memory with second glimpse at present saw chance of getting one despaired of finding woman of whom be in search hansom showed sign of moving on finding that must walk quicker than must drive fanks paid cabman jumped out raced along crowded pavement saw number of people whom knew paying attention to rushed along intent on getting to goal at length exertion be rewarded for by isthmian club saw wished for cab ahead be turning into berkeley square a throng be thinner in side street fanks secured hansom with likely looking horse followed in wake struck that might a well find out where woman lived therefore did not attempt to catch up directed driver to keep persistently on trail be only chance of gaining end with so crafty opponent then commenced long long chase cost fanks best part of sovereign followed to oxford street thence emerged into regent street passed through piccadilly circus down to trafalgar square after proceeding along strand cab dropped down arundel street to embankment went up through northumberland avenue cockspur street waterloo place again doubled trail in piccadilly fanks began to weary of interminable chase wondered where woman intended to stop still held on in dogged fashion determined to weary out adversary whom began to consider foeman rather foewoman not unworthy of steel therefore kept up chase on doubled trail to surprise found that cab have so persistently followed turned up half moon street stopped before chamber of fellenger good lord said fanks to surely have not be so great fool a to come to earth again where know will find be perfectly right in making remark for when jumped out ran up to first cab found empty fanks swore whereat joe berners grinned do serve y ' right said joe who be surly person never did a young gent must persecute innocent g on wi y ' fanks recovered temper on hearing speech be most humiliating to have followed empty cab for so many mile be rather amusing to be accused of being profligate when be ardently bent on doing duty detective laughed although joke be against question of persecution will bear argument friend said in laughing tone in meantime perhaps will tell what did with young lady picked up here why said mr berners told a be after for kiss ' such like so give sov to mislead got out of keb at end of street did told to drive on on for hour so while got away done added joe with grin have bin follerin ' h'empty keb ever since went up to berkeley square have acted according to light friend said fanks when realised how have be tricked blame same be not profligate detective lor said joe have done anything sir what have done be nothing to can tell in direction went ca sir bel have so saying joe berners drove off in high dudgeon fanks made attempt to stop for saw that woman have defeated only thing left for to do be to retire with best possible grace to end paid cab shrugged shoulder went upstairs again since woman have succeeded in escaping solution of problem lay entirely with robert then miracle on way up to chamber memory of face flashed across mind of fanks ah said with start remember now saw that face in crowd round red star on night of murder chapter viii mysterious parcel before fanks finally dismissed matter of futile chase asked question of friend constable did notice said if young lady have friend with mr fanks said other promptly be alone humph thought so meditated fanks a ascended stair accusing friend be myth well guess there be vacancy for fool be elected have lost once wo escape second time taxton on thames be london link of chain

gain information about in village link of writing connected with riverside town by following clue hoped to arrive at knowledge of identity with resolution entered chamber found robert restored to sensibility sitting on sofa with garth maxwell in attendance latter looked up eagerly a detective entered fanks have idea of letting inferior into method of working dismissed forthwith maxwell can leave room said sharply when policeman have taken departure turned to garth continued lost after friend gave slip with singular dexterity that going down to bring up witness be bosh told that story a blind to get out of room without suspicion who be asked garth at tale of failure fanks smiled grimly looked at valet doubt robert can tell that said significantly think be lady fellenger emma calvert

to say at present in face of can hardly bring to believe that emma calvert be dead robert swears that be said garth with shrug do do swear wailed man saw buried tone of wretched creature be so heart rending that listener believed that spoke truth detective placed portrait pasteboard star envelope containing slip of print in pocket beckoned to garth can do more good here said in low tone must

looked sir not hour ago ai got postmark stamp be addressed to sir gregory fellenger said fanks will open without further remark fanks did so therein be morocco case when be opened saw lying on bed of purple velvet long slender needle of silver garth must have picked out fanks stopped with shudder touch said there be death here what do mean mean said fanks hold in hand poisoned needle with cousin be murdered chapter ix vaud vaud here indeed be food for reflection that instrument with crime have be committed must come into detective possession be extraordinary that must have be left anonymously at room of murdered man be inconceivably audacious fanks at once returned to chamber closely questioned maxwell robert struck that latter might have have hand in placing mysterious parcel in letter box examined box hour ago sir said maxwell a told to look after letter there be nothing in then must have be placed in since while be in sitting room doubt said garth do know anything of robert sir lord sir never set eye on before left ten minute ago remarked fanks what have be doing since time have be with mr maxwell sir be with time maxwell yes sir replied policeman in great alarm came out into kitchen be together for chat then thought be near post time go to box found that parcel a knowed must be far off ran down stair explanation be perfectly satisfactory yet for life of detective must not help looking at robert with suspicion however a have not be out of maxwell company must not possibly have put parcel in box therefore fanks be reluctantly compelled to believe in innocence will do said at length drew garth away when again descended stair garth began to ask question fanks cut short must be alone to think out said in apologetic explanation go away garth let puzzle over matter by young lawyer be unwilling to do a be filled with genuine curiosity concerning needle however must suggest nothing saw that mere presence worried friend therefore obeyed request went off to meditate on own account a for fanks repaired to room with needle before sat for considerably over hour thinking what meant mystery be deeper than ever there be doubt that someone have left parcel in letter box within hour according to maxwell have not be there when last looked in according to robert have not be out of policeman company since left sitting room who then placed damning evidence of crime in box assassin assassin a have be proved clearly be negro few question to constable stationed near door have elicited fact that negro have gone up in fact man have sworn that have seen nobody ascend stair since time fanks returned from unsuccessful pursuit so scanty be fact have to go on fanks must not even build up theory be completely in dark seemed likely to remain so instrument be of silver length of darning needle while point be a sharp a lancet broadened gradually till when passed into slim ebony handle be for needle quite bulky in broad part poison be doubtless contained thence oozed drop by drop to deadly point fanks shuddered at sight of piece of devilish ingenuity infernal dexterity of thing gave idea must have be manufactured by scientific man mused touching slender silver line gingerly be too clever for amateur louis new baronet be man of science have succeeded to title can be that added breaking off abruptly must not commit crime in so obvious fashion much le leave mean used at address of victim nevertheless idea lured so far afield into so many speculation that finding led to nothing locked up poisoned needle put out of thought paid visit to new scotland yard here explained to person in authority that while have hope of capturing assassin of late sir gregory fellenger yet be bound to point out that expense of case must be considerable to person in authority replied by placing before fanks letter from messrs vaud vaud of lincoln inn field stated that have be directed by sir louis fellenger who be at present confined to bed through ill health to assure authority that wished effort to be made to discover murderer of cousin that must willingly bear cost of investigation communication concluded by requesting that detective in charge of case must call at office of lawyer at earliest convenience very meritorious of sir louis to save government expense said person in authority use what money require mr fanks be reasonable be reasonable will be a reasonable a possibly can be sir replied fanks in opinion case will be long expensive be most complicated matter ever took in hand more difficulty more glory said person in authority go on with case mr fanks act a please make use of resource have confidence in mr fanks if anyone can lay hand on assassin of sir gregory fellenger be man wish good day mr fanks dismissed in gracious manner fanks left room with intention of obeying forthwith injunction of vaud vaud before must depart be intercepted by crate communication from dr renshaw said crate with air of great importance called here afternoon with intention of seeing in absence saw stated that be leaving for india to night by p o steamer 'oceana before leaving wished to see speak with before leaving have to see speak with retorted fanks coolly must have arrested on suspicion if attempted to leave london without according interview have evidence on can arrest mr fanks have more evidence than be aware of crate if dr renshaw must have defied must have done so dare not where be now be still at great auk street where have be watched ever since night of murder when doe 'oceana leave dock to night at ten o'clock dr renshaw go down from fenchurch street by eight train be now quarter past five good will call at great auk street in meantime have to keep appointment have found out anything since saw last mr fanks have found out that there be woman in case said fanks reminds crate must go to paris by to night mail be busy with anything else mr fanks will be ready to start when please what be to do in paris fanks sat down at crate table wrote name date get certificate of death burial of emma calvert who died in paris last year committed suicide be passed off a accident be buried in pere la chaise know month of death can do without wire particular can get french police to help ask in office here for necessary credential authorisation spare expense have full power to draw money want after delivering necessary instruction fanks drove off to lincoln inn field presented card at office of vaud vaud be at once shown up to room of senior partner found a garth said dignified gentleman of old school be red faced white haired emphasised remark by waving pince nez spoke with of magnificence of dr renshaw be most lamentable business mr fanks said when detective be seated usually go home before five o'clock in interest of client sir louis fellenger remained on chance of seeing be glad to see came a soon a be able mr vaud only sent for to day wonder did not wish to see before there be necessity dear sir only heard from sir louis yesterday that be prepared to bear expense connected with investigation of case sir louis be ill believe mr vaud sir louis be never well sir said lawyer impressively be delicate man be given over to arduous science of experimental chemistry earnestness with prosecutes research keep in constant state of anxiety health suffers accordingly be now at mere hall attended by dr binjoy be dr binjoy with sir louis at mere hall at present moment certainly dr binjoy never leaf side of sir louis have greatest influence over though must say added vaud even influence of doctor must not prevent patient rising from sick bed to attend funeral of late baronet must have be fond of cousin said fanks pointedly on contrary cousin have not seen one for ten year more said mr vaud solemnly wish to speak evil of dead late sir gregory be certainly butterfly of fashion while present sir louis be man of science never got on well together therefore kept out of other way very sensible too said fanks dryly do happen to know if dr binjoy have be in london lately happen to know on best authority that of sir louis binjoy have not be in london for last six week sir louis have be ill for period doctor have not left bedside fanks made mental note of answer turned conversation in direction of crime know that fellenger died from poison from blood poisoning corrected vaud so saw in paper most remarkable case dear sir what took late client to locality why did submit to tattooing needle ca say be aware of motive might have induced dead man to have cross tattooed sir a matter of fact continued mr vaud late sir gregory be not on best of term be extravagant resented well meant advice saw a little of a of sir louis then be not intimate with sir louis can not say that be sir louis have led secluded life at taxton on thames have only seen once twice dr binjoy have never seen at be sir louis rich on contrary be very poor five hundred year only well mr vaud said fanks rising have to thank sir louis for offer to bear expense of case will do best to bring criminal to justice have clue mr fanks have variety of clue seem to lead to nothing do think that will be successful ca say yet hope so hope so too be doubtful very doubtful well good evening mr fanks do want money not at present will write to when do be right trust will succeed mr fanks in opinion be wasting time money crime be mystery for can see will remain mystery chapter x exit dr renshaw fanks have gained useful information from lawyer must appear that conversation have settled at least two important point in case of first be that sir louis must not have have anything to do with commission of crime leaving of parcel at chamber in moon street yet needle have be prepared by man learned in experimental chemistry a be special study of new baronet might be that be responsible for preparation of deadly instrument by death of cousin have gained fortune therefore might stand a motive for committal of crime sir louis have be ill for month have be confined to bed therefore must not have be in london on night of murder later on being still in bed must have deposited needle in letter box clearly case against louis broke down entirely a for binjoy also have not be in town for six week if be so must not be identical with renshaw in case suspicion entertained by detective must not fail to prove groundless then again fact that binjoy have negro servant habited like assassin also black man be highly suspicious binjoy might have instructed negro to slay have remained at taxton on thames in attendance on sir louis then what must be motive for perpetration of so terrible crime fanks sought for motive in first place noted that absence of louis from town on night be deposed to by binjoy in same way louis said that binjoy have not left taxton on thames for six week statement have be made to fanks by vaud must then appear that louis doctor be in collusion to obtain property of gregory by procuring death at hand of negro even theory failed to discover point out who be man who have called to leave parcel at moon street constable have asserted positively that negro have gone up stair if then messenger be not negro be binjoy sir louis mr vaud said that one be ill other in attendance thus case stood when fanks left office of vaud vaud felt utterly unable to cope with intricacy met on hand there seemed way in out yet in face of presumption that renshaw be not double of binjoy detective determined to follow up clue did not like way in doctor have behaved either in chamber of death at inquest be suspicious of apparent intimacy with mr boazoph therefore for own gratification went to great auk street to interview man to see whether suspicion have foundation in fact on arriving at house be unable to decide on next action before left again have determined what to do stupid looking man servant received fanks took into dull waiting room while went to inform dr renshaw of name of visitor in few moment returned conducted detective to back of house where found renshaw waiting for in company of man latter be dr turnor for whom renshaw have be acting a locum tenens lean little man with ferret of face sharp jerky way of speaking must have be exceedingly irritating in sickroom renshaw be more imposing in look than ever with habitual restlessness combed long brown beard with finger in badly lighted room fanks must not find out if beard be false so closely did renshaw resemble garth description of binjoy that notwithstanding vaud evidence fanks be on alert to discover if a truly believed two be one same ensuing conversation be likely to prove interesting in more way than one after being introduced to fanks acknowledging introduction with sour smile turnor arose to leave room be stopped by renshaw who evidently did not relish idea of facing difficult interview by proof a fanks considered of uneasy conscience pray depart turnor said in usual pompous manner have secret from trust mr fanks that see objection in adopting course certainly see objection replied fanks quietly let dr turnor stay by mean have nothing particular to say turnor who have resumed chair looked up at renshaw stared at visitor with pompous indignation then why be here sir demanded in more confident tone fanks shrugged shoulder really can not tell unless be because left message at office that wished to see did so in fulfilment of promise to communicate with before leaving london indeed so think of starting again on travel will like that much better than staying in london there be reason why must not like to stay in london said renshaw with angry glance reason in world can see be going out to india to bombay proceed to aden by 'oceana there exchange into 'cylde be really very good of to tell doctor said fanks ironically trust that will have pleasant voyage renshaw looked nonplussed trifle disappointed at coolness of detective be fank intention to bring about feeling for if renshaw have nothing to do with crime if be not masquerading under false name detective did not see that be necessary to make elaborate explanation seemed to fanks renshaw anxiety to bestow gratuitous information a to movement have root in design to mislead police notwithstanding assurance of vaud suspicion of renshaw revived in full force under clumsy diplomacy bent energy to get to bottom of matter to end affected indifference gave renshaw plenty of rope with to hang be to understand be free to go demanded stout doctor in highly dramatic manner suppose so be free country think friend knowledge murder jerked turnor a looked eagerly at fanks detective saw eagerness wondered hallo friend thought be in also however answered question in calmest manner be not aware that have made accusation against dr renshaw be suave reply have be watched cried renshaw watched like criminal say so said fanks imperturbably who be watching why have be watched two doctor looked at one from covert sign made by turnor to renshaw detective became convinced that there be understanding between guessed that sign hinted at conclusion of interview interpretation proved correct turnor rose jerked out apology mistake said little man told renshaw moonshine watching hope will catch murderer have little hope of said fanks dolefully have concealed trail too cleverly chuckled inwardly a saw two face brighten well well well will say no more mr fanks said renshaw in patronising tone deemed duty to let know go to india to night will not return to england for many year a propose exploring thibet good evening be delighted that fear be being watched have proved to be groundless fanks be not to be got rid of so easily wished to ask turnor few question for believed that little man knew about mysterious renshaw however made examination carefully a did not wish to startle pair rather to lull suspicion so that might more easily carry out plan have already decided upon next step be not in london at time of murder dr turnor asked replied doctor promptly if have be must have be summoned by mr boazoph a be renshaw went yes saw renshaw said fanks believe that be right in theory that crime be due to secret society what make agree with theory said renshaw quickly well drawled fanks keeping eye on men see ca find out meaning of tattooed cross must be work of society else must not have be obliterated if must only find out what that cross mean must hang someone renshaw wiped perspiration off bald forehead laughed in uneasy manner wish must help said know nothing about cross society what do say dr turnor nothing be away on night read about cross paper queer fanks saw plainly enough that pair be on guard that there be nothing more to be got out of only thing to be done be to watch wait progress of event with idea said goodbye took departure once outside made up mind that renshaw must be tracked anxiety to show that be leaving england appeared to be suspicious fanks concluded that did not intend to go a have so emphatically declared must be surprised to find that be binjoy after thought detective professes deal too much friend turnor be deal too eager must wonder if pair be in league however have thrown off guard now will play own game will find out owner of silver needle yet then will punish owner wonder added fanks with silent laugh wonder whether criminal will prove to be black white with peculiar remark went in search of detective whose duty be to guard house rated severely have let be seen said fanks have not more sense than to play fool keep out of sight remain here until send watcher report at yard detective much abashed tried to exculpate fanks must not listen to excuse hurried to new scotland yard picked out smart man instructed to relieve disgraced watcher to follow renshaw to dock then sir asked man then if renshaw go on board steamer will report fact to without loss of time be to come back here mr fanks will be at dock in disguise if see clergyman holding white handkerchief in right hand will see if be doubtful ask clergyman what time be will be safe a to identity off with send fool back to mr crate what be about to do mr fanks asked crate when man have gone learn if renshaw be lying not will see if board steamer at dock find out if have taken passage to bombay fact at present be much inclined to doubt if go on board steamer in case will follow a far a plymouth to make sure that doe not get off there if doe will know that have nothing to do with murder if doe get off at plymouth why said fanks rubbing hand will track to mere hall in hampshire crate looked astonished for must by mean follow thought of superior how do know that will go there demanded in disbelieving manner because if dr renshaw leaf steamer at plymouth under name will find at mere hall a dr binjoy chapter xi link in chain true to appointment garth called next evening at chamber in duke street only to find that fanks be absent that note be awaiting dear garth wrote detective have be called unexpectedly out of town will not return for at least three day visit at expiration of time prepare for surprise surprise said garth to a departed wonder if have found out about emma calvert if discovery have anything to do with death in tooley alley think a might must find answer to question be forced to restrain curiosity until such time a fanks must return in meantime out of curiosity called upon mr vaud to learn what that gentleman thought about position of affair mr vaud thought nothing about detective have charge of case in mr vaud opinion must be better to wait solution by of criminal problem a well a much more be expressed to garth by pompous lawyer must advise mr garth concluded not to let unhappy episode divert energy from business a to have precious little to do retorted garth with heat put much in way mr vaud be always hard up be aware of replied vaud ignoring beginning of speech be aware also that late client assisted several time because be necessary to said garth bitterly will tell what mr vaud have known then what know now about cousin must never have accepted help oh dear said mr vaud quite so sir gregory have many fault be saint mr garth pretend to be one still never drove woman to death do know what be saying mr garth do know name of emma calvert mr vaud lawyer paled pushed chair from table have heard name stuttered then have heard name of very injured woman mr vaud before other must reply knock came to door immediately afterwards opened to admit tall handsome young man bowed to garth placed paper before mr vaud will please excuse intrusion father look over said quietly son herbert mr garth said elder vaud again young man bowed rather resembled father in appearance there be sternness about manner be wanting in of elder gentleman be dark haired clean shaven with thin lip compressed mouth there be look of resolution hard work about did not recommend personality to pleasure loving garth however latter bowed smiled when introduced scribbled on sheet of blotting paper while herbert spoke to father still thinking on subject of discourse with mr vaud absently wrote name of emma calvert young vaud moved near while looking for special paper in doing so eye fell on name with ejaculation drew back turned a pale a father have done what do know of emma calvert demanded abruptly why do write down name herbert said father warningly almost imploringly will speak said herbert composure replaced by intense excitement what do knew of emma calvert sir garth looked up surprised know a much a robert valet of fellenger must tell scamp who served scamp muttered young man sir gregory be cousin mr herbert then cousin be scoundrel mr garth herbert leave room said father sternly son looked defiantly at father turned away without word at door paused addressed garth know that cousin be murdered mr garth said savagely be glad that met with death escaped must not escape punishment hated sir gregory bless man who killed left room in dumb astonishment garth turned to elder vaud for explanation old man have buried face in hand looked up when garth touched groaned aloud be sorry wrote down name mr garth said at length effect on unfortunate son be always terrible for what reason did not intend to tell a know so much may a well know herbert be in love with girl wished to marry be who introduced to sir gregory can guess rest can guess that cousin married girl took to paris where neglected drove to suicide know about marriage said mr vaud be glad that sir gregory did that justice also know of death sad very sad must have be pretty girl to have so strongly attracted two men never saw said vaud did not even know that herbert be in love with until eloped with sir gregory then son came with broken heart told all must have followed sir gregory to paris that fell ill of brain fever afterwards be ordered on sea voyage returned only six week ago heard of death of lady fellenger in paris did know that fellenger have married afterwards not at first discovered about marriage death in paris how know came back broken in health heart will never be same man again whenever name of emma calvert be mentioned consequence be a see garth rose to go be cruel story said sadly fellenger sin have come home to in terrible fashion good bye mr vaud then garth took leave withdrew to meditate on villainy of cousin have ruined two life half way along strand be struck by sudden thought if young vaud have known loved emma calvert must be man to identify woman who have presented at fellenger chamber believed emma calvert to be dead brought face to face with missing woman must see that be alive though will be difficult to find woman said resuming walk have given slip still may call to see robert again be being watched by maxwell so chance be that may find out whether be cousin wife ghost if be confronted with herbert vaud may arrive at truth will truth lead to detection of gregory assassin doubt thought of calling upon herbert telling about appearance flight of presumedly dead woman same reason have prevented from seeing hersham prevented visit said resolutely must interview fanks ask advice matter be too difficult for to handle alone having come to sensible conclusion went about daily business postponed moving in matter until return of fanks from mysterious journey appointment have be for previous night fanks have asked to wait three day a have employed one day in seeing mr vaud thought that must utilise second by interviewing mr boazoph for purpose called at red star be disappointed mr boazoph barmaid informed be out of town on business garth left tooley alley in meditative mood fanks have gone to country on business mr boazoph have gone to country on business wonder if same errand take there nothing further transpired on evening of third day garth presented at duke street fanks be within received in most amiable manner garth noted that friend looked weary ventured opinion that fanks have made long journey that day be about right said fanks indicating seat only got back three hour ago from hampshire have be to mere hall have be in neighbourhood of mere hall have also be to plymouth added after pause what have be doing there following friend renshaw alias binjoy mean to say that two be one cried garth jumping up do can prove by clearest evidence ever heard in life sit down listen garth resumed seat leaned forward with much curiosity to hear promised recital be well worthy of attentive hearing told that suspected renshaw to be binjoy in disguise said fanks description of one fitted other in many respect eagerness with renshaw tried to impress with fact that be going to india roused suspicion determined to see for if be really leaving england so disguised a parson went to dock renshaw have be followed there by emissary duly went on board p o steamer 'oceana assured of dismissed watcher took up running to plymouth how about passage oh fixed that up right how need not stop to explain may be sure kept watch on friend confident in disguise tried to get speech with be impossible a remained in berth whole time discovered however that passage be booked to bombay exchanging at aden into 'clyde at plymouth feigned to be so ill a to be unable to proceed further on journey rather than do so forfeited passage money got off then did not go to india after dear sir have intention of going to india followed ashore then be sorry to say that lost be not creditable to intelligence said fanks shrugging shoulder what did do best must saw local police have railway station boat watched must not leave plymouth by land water without knowing to make long story short be informed that stout gentleman somewhat like man be awaiting train at certain station went there saw renshaw interrupted garth indeed saw clean shaven man much younger in appearance than dr renshaw dressed differently from description recognised a binjoy to clinch matter followed to mere hall then be certain that renshaw be binjoy positive made inquiry in village be informed that sir louis be ill binjoy be attending of course said nothing for to tell truth did not know what to say will observe garth have proved that two men be one same negro did see be negro servant inquired about be informed that binjoy have brought no negro servant with doubt left behind at taxton on thames then idea be correct said garth negro committed crime at instigation of binjoy binjoy in disguise of renshaw went to red star to see that be accomplished now have got rid of negro of disguise so cutting off trace of connection with crime very plausible theory said fank shaking head motive motive why binjoy wanted louis to inherit property have great influence over louis what must benefit one must benefit other oh depend upon fanks be a say said fanks there be third person in woman emma calvert mr boazoph oh come now be out of town on business know business be at mere hall in hants saw there chapter xii intervention of chance be moment so before garth must quite grasp fact of new intrusion of mr boazoph into case when did so remarked that have doubt gone to mere hall to see louis fellenger fanks dissented in opinion went to see binjoy for what reason ca tell must be powerful reason must make woman seek out binjoy when have so carefully destroyed connection with renshaw have long have suspicion of mr boazoph removed dead body answered question in hesitating manner attempted to exculpate without being requested so to do also got rid of grain of gunpowder thing show that mr boazoph know more about matter than chooses to tell do think that know who committed crime must swear to said fanks with hesitation must have identified renshaw with binjoy else must never have sought out latter at mere hall do believe that mr boazoph inveigled fellenger to hotel by mean of advertisement then have killed how can tell retorted fanks know a much about matter a do will do mr boazoph justice to say that hardly believe must adopt course so dangerous to herself think that have anything to do with advertisement envelope be addressed in woman handwriting doubt handwriting may not be that of mr boazoph still be in way connected with binjoy be mixed up in crime mean that employed negro to commit look like yet continued fanks with frown evidence be too clear for to take view why clearer evidence more certain must be of truth fanks shook head from experience be inclined to doubt easily obtained evidence everything point to committal of crime by negro servant of binjoy for reason care to accept must seem that in case of trouble mr boazoph binjoy have provided for own safety by throwing suspicion on negro one thing be clear enough said garth impatiently negro killed cousin negro killed cousin not necessarily negro of binjoy garth looked puzzled be more in dark than ever said same here garth depend upon murder be bungling affair be cleverly planned cleverly executed scheme carried out by people who know what be doing a case now stand can not see way evidence in opinion lead to nothing if crate have matter in hand must arrest binjoy on suspicion hunt for negro servant a supposed murderer by doing so must make mess of whole business will arrest nobody at present save to perhaps crate will give opinion to nobody will watch wait put two two together when make four will pounce on assassin will take time patience money a said before case be delicate one be dealing with people who be a clever cleverer than be confess that outlook be anything promising concluded fanks with sigh can not guess who committed crime can not to appearance be negro be main point be negro of binjoy must negro be clever enough to conceive so subtle method of committing crime a mode of poisoned needle again must negro be in possessiondied of such information a must induce fellenger to permit use of needle whole mystery lie in cross tattooed on arm when discover meaning will be able to name assassin then why not see hersham suggested garth have similar tattoo mark on left arm may be able to tell what wish to know have appointment with hersham at room to morrow may learn something from on other hand may learn nothing what about emma calvert oh will find out about at taxton on thames may discover dead lady fellenger of paris alive at surrey village under name yet added fanks producing paper crate report prof that woman died in paris in be buried in pere la chaise if be so who be woman who appeared so strangely evidence of photograph valet prove that be emma calvert can only surmise that did not die that knowingly unknowingly woman be buried in place be only explanation can give yet for know emma calvert may have employed that negro to kill wicked husband be wild theory said garth why must woman lawful wife of cousin pretend to be dead submit to have identity destroyed by false burial if be alive can quite conceive that must have cousin killed out of revenge why pretended death to appearance be acquiesced in by fellenger ca answer question until wring truth from robert there be necessity for robert have found person who can tell truth oh said fanks looking up sharply person herbert vaud son of lawyer saw other day say so exclaimed fanks eagerly laugh at chance garth well here be chance may put on right track if solve mystery of emma calvert may unravel tooley alley enigma tell know omit detail begin begin flattered by interest taken in discovery garth related at great length extraordinary conduct of young vaud cause of such conduct a explained by elder vaud drew attention to fact that if confronted with missing woman herbert might be able to recognise a imposter a dead emma calvert fanks listened with closest attention did venture remark until garth have concluded story then drew breath reflected be most extraordinary said at length dare disbelieve in chance chance led to office of vauds chance made scribble name on paper chance drew attention of herbert vaud to name have always found that chance be best friend be beside point said garth impatiently what do say discovery may lead to something replied fanks cautiously will see herbert vaud after have interviewed hersham between two of may learn something likely to throw light on darkness of case be only on threshold of difficulty a yet garth rose to take leave agree with said future look anything hopeful will leave now a be tired after long journey fanks stretched be rather weary remarked yawning sha be sorry to go to bed come see to morrow will tell how get on with hersham garth added fanks going to door with guest do more detective business on own account will take time to exhaust information have brought when have arrived at conclusion regarding new evidence will tell what to do garth be quite willing to be guided by fanks advice more so a be entirely at loss how to proceed be waiting for more experienced head of detective to guide with quite sufficient to think about for next twenty four hour took departure left fanks to enjoy well earned rest appointment with hersham be for twelve o'clock next day punctually at time fanks took way up to acacia road st john wood where journalist have lodging certainly not very central position for man engaged in press hersham have be brought up in isle of wight beside sea amid green tree from effect of early association must not bear to be cooped up amid brick mortar where must scarcely breathe therefore have taken up abode in suburb where be certain of fresh air went to fro between fleet street st john wood on bicycle thus by little dexterity managed to attend to duty on morning planet yet to live comparatively rural life when fanks arrived at noon hersham for health sake be digging in garden on seeing detective came forward to greet visitor be slender handsome young man of eight twenty thereabouts with curly brown hair blue eye wore moustache otherwise be clean shaven usually face be pleasant smiling with high colour genial expression on occasion be rather pale there be anxious look in eye did not escape detective have seen same expression in eye of binjoy how be fanks said hersham with obvious effort at lightness see that be punctual to minute be glad of a ca give much time have engagement with editor at one thirty oh can explain business in hour replied fanks lightly wo take up more of valuable time than can help be astonished to get note frankly speaking be said hersham with uneasy look ca conceive what want to see about hope added with faint smile that be nothing in line of business be just point be in line of business to surprise of fanks young man gave kind of gasp without word turned led way into house behaviour be so different to usual manner that fanks suspected trouble with nothing incurable suspicion to go on wondered if agitation be in way connected with business have come about in plain word with tattooed cross with crime of tooley alley room into hersham ushered detective be simply furnished apartment of bright cheerful character furniture carpet wallpaper curtain be of light pleasant complexion two dwarf book shelf on side of fireplace be filled with well chosen volume while boxing glove foil on wall showed that taste of journalist be not exclusively literary excellent picture adorned wall photograph mostly of pretty woman be ranged on mantlepiece a whole room be remarkably bright attractive in of respect thoroughly reflected character of occupant with commendable hospitality hersham produced bottle of whisky two glass jug of water signing to fanks to help sat in chair near window waited for apparently unwelcome visitor to speak fanks did not open mouth hersham looked up to see cause of silence detective be staring at photograph on mantleshelf rather be gazing with astonished eye at one portrait be little wonder that did so for picture be that of young woman who have appeared disappeared so unexpectedly at chamber of sir gregory fellenger in half moon street for once in life fanks be rendered dumb with astonishment what be staring at asked hersham sharply detective pointed to picture who be that young lady asked in tone of intense curiosity see what business be of yours replied hersham to gratify curiosity may tell be girl be engaged to girl be engaged to be alive of course be said hersham half angry half amused why must be dead do know have seen why do ask will tell later on answered fanks tell be name of girl emma calvert never heard of emma calvert retorted hersham crossly name of young lady be anne colmer of taxton on thames yes of taxton on thames chapter xiii tattooed cross fanks be prepared for most surprise from experience be capable of controlling emotion thoroughly in instance however be so overwhelmed by unexpectedness of discovery that be time before must arrange thought plan of action coincidence of tattooed cross be extraordinary resemblance of portrait be still more so before must comment on fact hersham asked abrupt question why do speak of thing said anxiously what do know about miss colmer know nothing about miss colmer replied fanks quickly hold on minute good fellow have have what people call turn hersham accepted explanation with doubtful air pushed spirit towards detective accepting attention fanks poured out stiff glass sip two braced nerve set brain to work so that shortly be able to face unexpected situation for obvious reason did not wish to reveal too much to hersham yet under peculiar circumstance of case be forced to tell certain amount to gain end with least possible risk to plan be reduced to manufacturing plausible theory from fact within knowledge task be one of little difficulty succeeded fairly well in suppressing so much of truth a did not wish known that photograph took by surprise hersham said after pause why must take by surprise said other jealously have ever met with miss colmer have not met lady replied fanks slowly have seen one who greatly resembles so greatly indeed that thought person saw be original of photograph where did see person at paris in morgue seemed to fanks hersham changed colour on hearing kept feeling under control merely remarked in morgue case of murder doubt suicide by drowning afterwards heard that body be that of english girl called emma calvert purposely suppressed fact of marriage be buried in pere la chaise under name whether true not can not say of calvert can not wonder that sight of picture took for of dead woman must startle more especially a assure that original of photograph be still alive be engaged to be for purpose that came to see demanded hersham came to see about something else nevertheless before telling object of visit must like to have mystery of photograph explained how do know that can explain perhaps can perhaps ca on other hand perhaps can perhaps wo hersham bit lip took turn up down room appeared to be on verge of revealing something checked when about to speak at stage fanks wisely held tongue resolved to let hersham make first remark evidently young man have something on mind what something be fanks be determined to find out left mode of revelation entirely to host hersham be aware of hesitated faltered frowned ultimately resumed seat accepted situation have always looked upon a friend fanks said in hesitating manner have reason to believe that wish well dear fellow said fanks wondering what must be reason of appeal be perfectly right must do anything to prove friendship for then answer candidly did come here to ask about cross know be tattooed on left arm yes said fanks unhesitatingly did how did guess errand read report of inquest on body of fellenger remarked fact of poisoned needle tattooed cross be informed that have case in hand knew that have seen mark on arm so when wrote asking to see be not hard for to guess what wanted see be right congratulate on penetration dear hersham replied fanks coolly at same time see what speech have to do with former one about friendship can explain asked question about photograph to answer in satisfactory manner will be forced to tell something about family of girl to whom be engaged doe explanation concern late sir gregory fellenger yes have great deal to do with late sir gregory with

certainly one be emma calvert who committed suicide in other be anne colmer who be alive engaged to fanks considered for minute now begin to see light said in sober tone be right in assuming that emma be sister of anne be perfectly right be twin sister ah account for resemblance doe replied hersham with nod two sister be so exactly alike apart must not tell one from other at least so have be told oh then never saw two sister together did not never saw emma in life of course know sad story said fanks after pause anne mother told to know emma married fellenger secretly be driven to death by brutality now can see why reminded of friendship before telling truth said fanks sharply ca see why be engaged to sister of dead girl so thought that might accuse of killing sir gregory out of revenge well did have thought in head then coincidence of cross know fanks laughed took hand of hersham dear lad said have idea of accusing of crime engagement to miss colmer be proof that killed man who acted so badly towards sister therefore hesitate to tell know how emma calvert came to london how met with sir gregory how be loved by herbert vaud what cried hersham know that also know more than think hersham therefore if attempt to deceive will find out now go on with story want to deceive replied journalist must understand that only speak from hearsay if want tale first hand must see old mr colmer at taxton on thames hum said fanks remembering theory regarding directing of envelope contained cardboard star what kind of person be lady in question invalid said hersham promptly paralytic have not moved hand foot for year confound be matter nothing only information have upset theory never mind go on there be much to tell said hersham mr colmer be decayed gentlewoman whose husband died

attracted by title at event ran away with to paris became wife be married in london office registrar did not know said hersham emma told mother that be married did not write where well young vaud have attack of brain fever afterwards went on sea voyage on return crossed to paris to learn what have become of emma ascertained that be dead buried in way learned whole miserable history vaud returned to england to see fellenger before must meet with baronet be killed in tooley alley fate of emma be avenged by unknown hand be story fanks can make what use like of be wretched story replied fanks can now understand hatred young vaud bear towards memory of false friend can understand also how mistook anne for emma added fanks with emphasis can not understand why anne came to chamber of fellenger why ran away when saw hersham looked jealous frowned can not understand that said hated fellenger a much a did herbert vaud know why must go to room of scoundrel asked for valet robert whimpering pitiful dog anne might have gone to see to ask for particular of sister death well yes replied fanks thoughtfully that doe not explain why went away when saw can only surmise that did not wish to explain what brought there so tell tale of sister death to stranger there be more in than said detective remembering anne have be among crowd on night of murder will talk of hereafter in meantime let return to main object of visit show famous cross hersham made objection to request removed coat rolling up sleeve exposed cross tattooed on flesh of left forearm be st catherine cross size of florin fanks examined long carefully did get tattooed at school asked when hersham have resumed coat did not get done at have have ever since can remember have asked father often about can not will not give information will not most probably be sure that there be story attached to tattooing none know of father might be better informed must mother know have mother died when be baby strange muttered fanks pensively be strange that must have mark on yet be ignorant of significance wish must speak to father about wo tell anything have asked before have idea why cross similar to must have be tattooed on sir gregory arm by negro certainly not did not even know sir gregory wonder if father must tell know might might not do think that cross have anything to do with murder be investigating be just what do think retorted man be killed by mean of poisoned needle used to prick in cross similar to on arm insinuates that be mixed up in matter doe nothing of sort be as hersham be not content with friendly assurance think have something to do with crime said obstinately fanks looked at agitated face at trembling hand strange suspicion entered mind will tell do think said in abrupt tone think that have not told truth hersham trembled still more clasped hand together can not muttered shrinking away from fanks dare not chapter xiv fanks make up mind naturally fanks be astonished at confession be so conversant with character of young man that must not believe journalist be guilty despite coincidence of tattooed cross relationship of fellenger wife with anne colmer did not think for moment that friend have anything to do with crime nevertheless must appear from hesitation of hersham to speak openly that have knowledge if not of crime at event of circumstance leading to accomplishment be only construction must place on last outburst after what have said hersham think ought to confide in remarked after pause suspect in way yet refuse to aid ought to be first to help see how make out replied hersham with pale face never met with sir gregory heard nothing evil of life drove to suicide sister of girl to whom be engaged why must help ah cried fanks sharply then can help if choose certainly can not returned hersham doggedly have not slightest idea who killed fellenger can tell nothing yes can only refuse to why can not say have better be careful hersham will not find easy to deal with if rouse suspicion do threaten warn retorted fanks smartly be not accustomed to have offer of help repelled remark of few moment ago show that know something what be know nothing do speak if not for own sake at least for of miss colmer hersham stepped up to fanks with angry face how dare introduce name of miss colmer cried forbid to speak of worse for for called at chamber of dead man why did call there be at tooley alley on night of murder what be doing in place refuse to tell will ask hersham sprang forward grasped arm of fanks to prevent leaving room think of what be about gasped ask nothing hear nothing that rest with tell what know know nothing said hersham turned away with obstinate look good said fanks putting on hat now understand one will find out without troubling good bye may thank star that arrest on suspicion swear that be innocent know that else must have have in custody by time be screening person anne colmer for instance know nothing will judge of for retorted fanks left room in acacia road detective hailed cab drove to nearest telegraph office have occurred to that hersham might attempt to communicate with anne be resolved to checkmate move to end sent wire to head of rural police at taxton on thames instructing to delay if possible letter telegram might come to miss colmer thereby hoped to prevent hersham warning girl arriving at new scotland yard detailed man to watch hersham sent up to acacia road glance at bradshaw assured that to reach taxton on thames hersham must have to start from waterloo thither sent detective to keep eye on train therefore by letter by telegram by railway have stopped hersham from communicating with anne colmer after taking precaution saw crate be going to taxton on thames at three o'clock said be going to look for woman who directed envelope mr fanks fanks stretched out leg began fiddling with ring be just what be puzzling crate observed have told of conversation with mr hersham well unless be deceiving mr conner be paralytic must not have directed that envelope yet going by writing will swear that elderly woman penned address if not mr colmer obvious impossibility who wrote anne colmer said crate promptly for disguise must rather have adopted masculine hand mr boazoph if mr boazoph have be traced to taxton on thames must say yes if letter have be sent from mere hall must have said yes added fanks with emphasis a did not come from mere hall mr boazoph have nothing to do with taxton on thames be not inclined to suspect lady then there be nobody else there must be somebody else somebody else committed crime crate thought do think that negro sent that star asked feel perfectly certain that negro have nothing to do with star have proved conclusively that negro killed fellenger fanks smiled complacently must not be at surprised if found out that negro have nothing to do with murder said slowly be impossible mr fanks nothing be impossible in criminal case said fanks look here crate a know be not habit to give opinion before have thoroughly threshed out subject matter of case in instance will depart from rule must not be surprised if have already spotted assassin of sir gregory fellenger cried crate in admiration who be mr fanks man woman wall have ear crate will whisper name when case come to end if ever doe can laugh at congratulate at will now then fanks approached mouth to ear of crate whispered single name be opinion said slowly crate shook head mr fanks be to put opinion against yours think be making mistake perhaps be assented fanks carelessly case be difficult one be quite prepared to find out that be wrong same be confident that person named be guilty will bet five pound to five shilling be correct crate grinned took up bet behaviour of chief flattered must not have minded losing must not bring to agree with fanks a to name of guilty person for have theory of own in believed theory be diametrically opposed to of superior how long will be at taxton on thames asked fanks when little piece of amusement be concluded may be few day few hour month depends on what find out must interview anne colmer see mother make inquiry about binjoy negro servant doctor be at mere hall must go there to ask about negro rubbish a told before negro have never be seen at mere hall binjoy lived at taxton on thames be there must ask after mysterious black man afterwards can go to mere hall have reason for going one wish to find out why mr boazoph visited hall what about tattooed cross mr fanks oh will see that later on in meantime must pay visit firstly taxton on thames secondly mere hall thirdly isle of wight rev mr hersham humph said crate doubtfully from what say must think mr hersham junior must thwart plan if must have not least doubt of replied fanks dryly be being watched if try to thwart will at least have satisfaction of knowing by way do know anything about bombay be in india be said crate rather taken aback by apparent irrelevancy of question know anything about bombay mr fanks except what have seen in book must extend knowledge then for may want to go there in week so have going there anything to do with case demanded crate still very much astonished at turn conversation have taken have everything to do with case replied fanks enjoying perplexity confusion of somewhat slow moving mind dr renshaw did not go to india be crate next remark quite so renshaw having resumed real name of binjoy be now at mere hall in safety a think can lay hand on time ca lay hand on negro must do crate negro be in india mr fanks in humble opinion may be wrong be replied other see here crate dr binjoy must know that a be employed by sir louis to hunt down assassin must see sooner later if see new baronet can hardly help seeing 'fidus achates now although binjoy have a think destroyed trace of connection with renshaw yet can not quite alter personal appearance be rather noticeable may shave off beard so a to make look younger may even get rid of stoutness can not alter voice entirely change pompous manner must therefore guess may be struck with resemblance to renshaw in way for give credit of being clever will endeavour to account for resemblance know particular lie will stick to of one thing be certain will keep up deception that renshaw be in india by mean of prepared letter written to dr turnor be opinion crate continued fanks solemnly that binjoy have got rid of negro servant by sending to bombay from bombay negro will forward letter already written to turnor of great auk street may be wrong of course wish to act in hurry first letter see from india purporting to be from binjoy renshaw very day start for bombay to look for negro who be at present missing be content to stake professional reputation that will find there well be 'cute one mr fanks said crate in admiring tone must never have thought of that tribute of respect from crate put end to conversation for time being fanks went to chamber packed few clothes repaired to waterloo station detective who be watching there assured that hersham have not be seen on platform fanks went down to taxton on thames quite satisfied that have what american call inside running amused while in train by making note in pocket book with figuring out question intended to ask miss colmer notwithstanding assurance to crate be very doubtful if must be able to discover assassin of sir gregory for further went into case more intricate did become so far a must see at present moment person who have killed tooley alley victim have chance of escaping gallows that detective must do be to go on in darkness trust to stray gleam of light might reveal assassin at present must not see inch ahead of on arriving at taxton on thames drove at once to local post office a expected there found telegram police have succeeded in delaying be addressed to anne colmer ran a follows detective coming answer nothing there be name from context place whence have be sent

anything wrong dear asked nervously nothing mother be little tired be there be more than anne for day have not be at like can wonder at mother replied anne bitterly think of have happened last month

right path by telling be sure of wish must see married to ted dear said mother comforted by assurance must be such relief to mind be afraid will not be able to marry for considerable time dear ted be very clever can not earn enough for to live on wish to be drag on mother must wait until thing mend outlook be brighter must have married dr binjoy must not marry dr binjoy if there be not man in

money want to have nothing to do with fellengers family have cost dear enough already reference to dead emma made mr colmer weep anne have considerable difficulty in quietening however succeeded in end left mother to own thought while went out into garden for breath of fresh air moreover wanted to be alone for purpose of thinking over position of thing anne must not recognise if certain contingency arose mother must find very awkwardly placed evening be warm sky be filled with mellow light rendered languid atmosphere against tree stood out in bold relief twig leaf being sharply outlined against amber sky sound of distant laughter musical splash of oar came to ear of girl a walked slowly down path towards summerhouse low redbrick wall ran along bank of river a leaned over low parapet anne must see considerable distance to right left before boating house on opposite shore number of people be collected now then boat must shoot out into gleaming water bearing two three of away someone musically inclined have brought banjo anne must hear thrumming of string echo of latest music hall ditty altogether scene be not without charm be too much taken up with own trouble to pay much attention to pleasant picture spread out before quiet of evening brought peace to how foolishly have acted thought with shiver if have be wise must have left matter alone feel certain that mr fanks recognised a woman saw in tooley alley if find out will ask be doing there on night of murder what can say dare not tell truth may refuse to believe what say to acted for best be true good intention have led into position of danger may be wrong may be quite safe that man may never find if doe shivered again looked up river under glow of sunset sky water rolled broad sheet of gold flecked here there with dark form of boat to left anne saw skiff containing one oarsman coming swiftly down stream in half dreamy moment calculated that must pas almost immediately under wall then returned to self communings if ted be only here thought must like to tell have done ask how to act for own sake must keep silent for sake of mother must hold tongue oh be terrible terrible to know what know yet remain dumb be afraid of detective eye seemed to pierce through on day must find out may compel to speak if speak oh disgrace shame of why why be such thing permitted in world oh ted ted wish be here to comfort leaned head on wall burst into tear anne be not easily moved be unusual thing for to thus give way to emotion be only girl after system be strung up nervously excited by knowledge of secret knew must like to have confided in someone if only to relieve overburdened mind shrank from consequence of such step word from murder in tooley alley put thought out of mind still leaning head on arm wept bitterly meanwhile single oarsman rowed steadily towards red brick wall be evidently point for be making soon came abreast of shortly came under anne raised head at sound of splash of oar to behold very man of whom have be thinking be ted hersham chapter xvi unhappy lover hersham brought boat under wall with sweep before disembarking looked up to anne with anxious expression on face did get telegram demanded hastily telegram repeated have received telegram from thought so said journalist laughed in savage sort of manner what do mean demanded anne noting how haggard looked be anything wrong more than like to say be answer at moment seemed to anne that presentiment be about to become true waited with vague terror for next speech ted did not open mouth for minute being fully occupied in making fast boat prior to landing in spite of importance of interview desire to prepare anne for immediate coming of fanks did not hurry executed task with utmost deliberation on part girl held peace not until lover have taken in arm to kiss passionately did speak then led to summerhouse out of sight of mr colmer at window broached subject be uppermost in mind ted asked in low voice be there danger there be great deal of danger from what quarter from worst of quarter fanks have found out ah sat back suddenly face turned pale with apprehension be here hersham nodded sent telegram to warn not to answer question did not receive guessed must not replied lover with nod fanks visited to day left with intention of coming down here to see sent wire then fancied that might manage to get delayed at office here did not dare to go by waterloo a made sure must have station watched in dilemma there be nothing left for to do to come down on bicycle did rode to warby boat house left machine there came on to warn anne considered for few minute how be that mr fanks found out asked anxiously saw portrait in room what be doing in room came to question about cross tattooed on arm did tell anything nothing what must tell be quite unaware how cross came to be there with regard to recognition of how be that went to chamber of dead scoundrel went to get photograph of emma be in possession of late husband why did wish to get photograph have writing on back may implicate person in trouble of death think added pointedly that can guess name of person

stick to case until have assassin of sir gregory in jail god forbid ejaculated anne with shudder amen to answered hersham oh anne dear anne continued taking hand how wish must end fly to end of earth dear said gently have others to think of besides ourselves must never do to desert at present moment besides there may not be so much chance of discovery a think know be certain of nothing said hersham with sigh only dread one thing lest fanks must force into betraying that must rather hide trouble about ted returned anne dryly think mr fanks will find more than match need not have come to prepare for be quite ready for gentleman a soon a chooses to call will be very soon be in village now want to see for reason came here in boat be foolish ted said anne quickly must let see else will suspect that know something about matter must be aware dear that have own safety to look to oh groaned hersham how be to extricate from mess think will leave to time have to comfort dearest drew towards without must not be able to move one step at present be dark dreary let hope that there be brighter day in store be certain that there be said anne have great deal to endure before peace come must go through valley of humiliation to reach promised land well said ted emphatically when do reach think must go to america there to commence new life be use trying to construct new one here out of ruin of old that will see replied anne with sigh god know have have great deal to endure since death of poor sister let for moment banish gloomy subject talk of how be getting on with work hersham smiled kissed saw that be striving to lighten burden have be laid upon be grateful for kindness same found difficult to put trouble out of sight memory seeing that be so insistent that within next half hour might be called upon to defend from dangerous charge alone a be in summerhouse be afraid to speak openly lest bird of air must carry to fanks undesirable news must please ruin under circumstance hersham agreed with anne that be best to let affair connected with case of tooley alley remain in abeyance until be compelled to take action in meantime unhappy pair went hand in hand into fool paradise of make believe hollow joy there be something pitiful in playing with happiness will be very poor love said hersham somewhat later in conversation be afraid that will miss luxury to have be accustomed anne laughed kissed silly boy said kindly luxury be of cheapest kind a well know besides can face poverty with brave heart with mother be afraid will not live long sighed anne be growing so weak have long long fit of silence poor mother have have hard life think ever got over death of emma doe know anything about other matter very little kept a much from a must indeed must never have heard of death at have not be for herbert vaud might a well have held tongue said ted angrily fact be that since emma death illness have not be quite right in head returned comparatively well a know journey to paris to inquire after lady fellenger unsettled again talk of lady fellenger said anne with shudder why not sister be lawfully wife of sir gregory know that same hate to hear name of family yet said hersham meaningly be fond enough of louis again anne laughed must not be jealous of friendship for louis ted be good fellow in way be never in love with a be with liked binjoy pompous doctor did like hated hate still flashed out be evil genius of louis if matter only concerned dr binjoy must not keep silent bear burden be doing have to bear with said softly know that dear there be thing men woman have to face singly such thing be coming interview with mr fanks wanted to see so a to disarm suspicion may entertain still wish to take part in conversation why asked ted with frown ca leave to fight battle must in case replied anne be dear good fellow ted allow heart to govern head be very true be reverse with anne not so far a be concerned ted be a weak a water with if see hard to other people must set down to severe training have have in school of adversity be only girl in year be woman in experience be dearest bravest woman in whole world said hersham fondly kissing hand if happiness come to in future will be through will do what say hold tongue darling be sure that can cope with fanks know a have only seen once cross sword will soon learn strength have large stake to fight for remembrance of will make desperate well said ted dolefully can not turn back now enemy be within gate must fight v victis may well say said anne bitterly 'woe to vanquished indeed come let go to house see mother must say nothing to about conversation know a much a be good for health will not stand great shock in case observed hersham a strolled up path must not let see fanks trust ted forewarned be forearmed mr colmer be delighted to see ted for be great favourite with invalid have suspicion of what have brought down in so unexpected manner chatted to young man in most cheerful of spirit meanwhile anne gave lover cup of tea cut sandwich time be straining ear to catch fall of knocker on front door moment expected to bear crash must announce arrival of detective a minute went by nerve became strained to utmost pitch ted saw what suffered in presence of mr colmer must say nothing old lady went chattering on there be something cruelly ironical about situation at last hersham must bear suspense no longer making excuse to mr colmer drew anne out into passage there placed hand on shoulder be afraid said anxiously be afraid of coming interview with man yes said anne shivered colour have left cheek suddenly appeared older more haggard why be afraid because of visit to chamber thing doe other thing concern yes concern visit to london on night heaven where did go before anne must answer sharp knock came to door drove blood into heart looked at one for now felt that danger be on what must happen within next hour where did go on night asked hersham hoarsely to tooley alley to red star hotel anne anne saw anne nodded yes said steadily saw chapter xvii two against one on arriving at taxton on thames fanks have taken up abode at royal arm hotel be intention to make inquiry about sir louis fellenger dr binjoy negro servant of latter ignorant that have be thwarted by hersham have also intended to interview anne colmer without loss of time before must see even hear from lover intercepted telegram proved conclusively that girl knew something hersham did not want to reveal in absence a fanks supposed of warning hoped to take at disadvantage in mood took way to home so far a detective must see future plan depended almost entirely upon information expected to obtain from girl within next few hour in supposition lay irony of situation being in frame of mind astonishment may be conceived when on door of briar cottage being opened saw before man whom thought be at moment in london for minute be unable to speak recovered to ironically congratulate hersham on dexterity in evading machinery of law in reality fanks be angered have too much good sense to give way to bad temper be in opinion useless to make bad worse so have stolen march on hersham said sardonically be doubtful of honesty in london be still more so now how did manage to dodge trap laid for by knowing where be laid said hersham sullenly guessed must have railway station watched so came down here on bicycle very ingenious idea have doubt warned miss colmer not to answer question yes said hersham defiantly have done so a did not receive reply to telegram guessed that have intercepted message in way have arrived now when be too late to see miss colmer to warn came down here at risk of own safety oh remarked fanks taking note of injudicious speech be a much a to say that risked being arrested by know that be wrong friend deserve punishment for trickery have evidence against have sufficient to ensure arrest on whole hersham said detective must advise to help otherwise will arrest within hour take choice before hersham must answer question anne appeared at door with pale face determined manner at once intervened in conversation placed between two men there be necessity to threaten mr fanks said quickly come inside let discus matter calmly be sure that mr hersham will agree that be best course journalist nodded sullenly two men passed into house conducted by anne led into room window of looked on to road here when be seated addressed more particularly to hersham be wrong to speak a did to mr fanks said meaningly there be reason why must conceal anything be perfectly willing to tell know be not much to afford gentleman information in power will regret if do anne said hersham warningly will regret if interposed fanks really understand why must act in childish manner have always be friend yet treat though be bitterest enemy be trying to trap if conscience be clear think need be afraid of being trapped retorted fanks seems useless to hope for sense from perhaps young lady may be more amenable to reason can depend upon to help mr fanks said anne calmly hersham rose to foot with agitated look on face will leave to reveal what think fit declared at same time wash hand of consequence may result with significant look at anne left room fanks gave parting warning a passed through door have better stay here hersham said a may want to see again whether stay go can lay hand on at moment be having watched questioned hersham fiercely yes be having watched may thank that be placed in so unpleasant position now then will go to london stay here hersham hesitated for moment then biassed by look from anne compromised will stay in village said passed through open door leaving detective with miss colmer strange to say fanks be by mean at ease with woman more so a mistrusted promise to tell knew have deceived by flying from chamber in moon street might again mislead with false report if have anything to conceal ready acquiescence hinted that must not tell secret detective be far more distrustful of craft than of foolish behaviour of hersham might combat obstinacy with more le success to deal with diplomatic person like miss colmer required dexterous use of intelligence possessed fanks therefore prepared for duel of word weighed expression information during ensuing conversation well mr fanks said miss colmer coolly must congratulate on cleverness in determining identity thought when left in sir gregory chamber must be able to elude altogether be wrong seems have found out now that have done so may ask what want to know want to know great many thing said fanks emulating coolness question be whether will consent to answer question can judge for ask what question will will answer to best of ability added pointedly before begin let ask one question do suspect have anything to do with murder of sir gregory ca answer until have replied to question miss colmer judging from readiness to afford information fancy that do know something of matter be right do know something of matter can not promise to tell who killed sir gregory know that be murdered no more even information gained from newspaper fanks made reply to remark whereupon miss colmer continued why do think that know anything about crime never met sir gregory why did come to room of sir gregory replied fanks connect with murder because of visit if know story of poor sister know why came to half moon street said anne coldly be to ask servant robert for portrait of emma have be taken from by sir gregory have seen that photograph miss colmer did want back for picture because have writing on back what writing do mean asked girl sharply fanks produced celebrated envelope from pocket be writing said whosoever wrote that also wrote on back of photograph of sister perhaps can tell who be scribe miss colmer looked earnestly at envelope shook head never saw that writing before said decisively yet can see that post mark be of village so appears nevertheless can not name writer can not understand why show to well miss colmer said fanks disappointed with answer when find out who wrote envelope will know who killed sir gregory be sorry can not help mr fanks see that think envelope came from house assure that be wrong mother considered sir gregory villain because of treatment of poor emma did not wish death if came here to find assassin have wasted time know nothing about matter then what be that hersham did not wish to reveal nothing wished to deny have be at chamber of sir gregory on day lest must think have something to do with murder oh said fanks disbelievingly did hersham wish to deny also that have be in tooley alley on night of murder anne became pale at directness of attack took refuge in plain denial be not there said obstinately on night at time pardon saw must have be mistaken think not yours be not face must easily forget thank for compliment said anne in case be afraid be unmerited be not at tooley alley on night if doubt can ask mother said fanks after moment reflection will not ask mother yet a matter of fact detective be well assured that mother daughter have prepared alibi in case of discovery not being ready to analyse matter by reason of lack of information certain that anne must persist in denial wisely postponed discussion until more fitting occasion therefore on face of accepted anne assertion merely remarked that hersham be foolish to induce to conceal what have better have be told to anne replied promptly must forgive mr fanks said know that hated sir gregory for treatment of sister fancy that unlucky visit might implicate in matter have told reason went there so must blame excuse a see fit will do at present said fanks significantly will ask why ran away from on day be afraid of why did not know never saw before saw portrait said miss colmer frankly gave one to ted mr hersham told that be detective when saw in chamber guessed that have case in hand be seized with panic fear lest must suspect to be mixed up in crime for reason fled how did trace be wrong of to go miss colmer said fanks not replying directly be naturally suspicious of flight suspect now not since have explained visit ask how traced first from marvellous resemblance to dead sister secondly from post mark on envelope a told writing on envelope portrait be same see connection yes see connection now mr fanks have told know be there other question wish to ask yes where be photograph taken wanted in village be sister possession be be only photograph have of negative be broken there be picture of sister in existence after death mother wanted picture a guessed that might be at sir gregory chamber went up for did see in sister possession before went away with sir gregory yes took from here when went to london be there writing on back then anne reflected moment said there be writing on then do think sister wrote on back of portrait before committed suicide if writing on back of photograph be same a on letter rather envelope think wrote be not sister handwriting can not think who wrote mr fanks be entirely ignorant of needle to say fanks took departure from briar cottage in very puzzled frame of mind before leaving told miss colmer that must call again next day when got back to hotel asked how much of story must believe came to conclusion that not one word of be true be a far off discovery a ever chapter xviii on twenty first of june up to present time visit of fanks to taxton on thames have be complete failure have be thwarted by hersham more than suspected that have be tricked by anne saw mean of obtaining information likely to lead to elucidation of mystery enveloped death of sir gregory fellenger be in very low spirit that detective returned to royal arm after good dinner somewhat cheered sat down with pipe to consider what must do next have hope of obtaining information from hersham anne colmer a for reason of declined to speak fanks thought must put on right track if pleased saw mean by must force to speak openly in spite of threat must arrest of a have not sufficient evidence to do so unable therefore to force to flatter into plain speaking be completely baffled in effort to solve enigma in direction for time being be at standstill in dilemma left decision regarding future movement to chance in expectation of hearing something of value to plan strolled into tap room of hotel here hoped to find village gossip to gather from idle talk information concerning sir louis fellenger dr binjoy negro servant however there be one in room save bent crooked old man with pair of keen eye be seated in corner of settle with tankard of beer before with garrulous complacency introduced a simeon wagg parish clerk of taxton on

thames on bicycle there be plenty of time for to come down before nine o'clock a old man said after nine o'clock good wheelman must easily cover distance between london taxton on thames in two hour again mr boazoph have sworn that murderer have be arrayed in green coat with brass button description matched that of negro who have so nearly run over wagg on london road time date corresponded then negro have be dismissed next day have be smuggled out of way by master on whole fanks thought that matter looked rather black against stout doctor proceeded with enquiry did dr binjoy discharge servant did sir louis weel theer naow said aged one taking pipe out of mouth blamed if knaw who did give t ' kickout muster fellenger be ill be ' hed bin fur week t ' doctor be wi ' be ' niver saaw

muster fellenger be ill be ' t doctor kep in t ' sick room did one iver saaw for daays did from information seemed to fanks a though there be understanding between sir louis doctor old creature who represented village opinion be quite sure that dr binjoy have be in attendance on fellenger on night of twenty first yet fanks knew by personal observation that binjoy under name of renshaw have be in tooley alley must not have returned to taxton on thames on night a house in great auk street have be watched yet fanks have proved beyond doubt that renshaw binjoy be one same person be possible that sir louis be telling lie to screen binjoy from consequence of being in town be possible that two have employed negro caesar to commit crime then have smuggled out of way say to bombay so that must not betray in word be fellenger binjoy guilty of murder of cousin of former seemed impossible yet a sir louis be employing fanks to hunt down assassin be hard to believe conversation of simeon wagg only introduced new perplexity into perplexing case there be nothing more to be got out of old clerk so fanks retired to bed in very melancholy frame of mind did not know way to move in midst of such contradictory information night brought counsel next morning fanks arose with definite object must return to town advertise for negro caesar must have left bicycle somewhere so if advertised for negro in green coat with brass button might find out something with whom bicycle have be left must be able to give description of negro who have arrived departed with so fanks hoped to learn if black murderer of tooley alley be same a servant caesar of dr binjoy regarding shielding of doctor by louis fellenger detective resolved to leave question until went to mere hall saw two men together be afraid that crate will have to go to bombay after said fanks to a left hotel did not go at once to town a wished to see hersham anne colmer also be desirous of having interview with mother half way down street met with journalist who saluted in rather sullen fashion be just about to call on said hersham wish to go to town by midday train if have objection can go a soon a please retorted fanks be not so much good to that care to keep here need not make so infernally disagreeable fanks said young man tartly have told know so have miss colmer a to have own opinion hersham certainly think that have secret between will not share with doe not concern ah have secret then yes have be private business have nothing to do with death of titled scoundrel must like to judge of for said fanks coldly however daresay will find out wish to know without assistance hersham came forward laid hand on arm of detective say fanks observed earnestly know be not treating well must make allowance for natural fear feel at being brought into contact with law know something must like to tell to ca make up mind to do so yet still give word of honour that if ask again next week will tell will place life liberty in hand good heaven man cried startled fanks mean to say that be concerned in murder be not when tell will see why did not speak before give week to make up mind will give week said detective briefly without further speech hersham took leave in abrupt manner evidently relieved to be so dismissed on presenting at briar cottage fanks be at once admitted be shown by servant neat handed phyllis into different sitting room from one have seen before in large chair by window looked out on garden old lady be seated be dressed completely in white lower part of body be swathed in shawl of chinese crape face be pale careworn eye be red rimmed a from constant cry open bible lay on lap from raised eye a fanks entered have little hesitation in guessing that be mr colmer paralytic mother of living anne dead emma must excuse rising to receive said in low sweet voice be unable to move hand foot doubtless daughter have told of affliction daughter will see presently fanks bowed there be silence between for few moment glanced round neatly furnished room at picture photograph among must not see one of dead emma at elbow of mr colmer on small table stood pile of photograph at have evidently be looking prior to entrance fanks surmised that portrait of emma might be there be anxious to discover one if possible a anne have denied that there be photograph of sister in existence save one have sought at sir gregory chamber fanks thought that if must find in pile at mr colmer elbow must be able to convict anne out of own mouth expose falsity of motive gave for visit cast about for mean whereby to accomplish purpose will excuse mr colmer said rising from seat be excellent picture of bay of naples have crossed over to other side of room to look at picture so found standing by small table held sundry picture in turning away pretended to stumble so knocked over table photograph thousand apology said fanks in confusion stooping to pick up looked in vain for face sought made discovery startled not little last photograph picked up off carpet be one of mr boazoph chapter xix defiance of anne colmer before fanks must remark on strangeness of discovery door opened anne entered room with characteristic quickness recognised photograph in hand of detective at once came forward signed to to be silent at same time spoke to mother mr fanks have be shown into room by mistake said hurriedly so with permission mother will conduct into next room a please anne know best accepting permission anne drew fanks quickly into passage led into apartment have seen on occasion of last visit still held photograph in hand at looked anxiously a signed to that must take seat fanks placed in comfortable armchair miss colmer took up position opposite to prepared for difficult conversation a be natural from late action made observation on picture of mr boazoph see that recognise face said anne coolly doubt wonder how photograph came to be in house do wonder be to hear truth from miss colmer certainly there be reason why must tell lie man woman looked directly into one eye look of mutual distrust passed between be fanks who first took up unspoken challenge think must tell lie if there be anything to be gained concealed by said detective dryly be not far out there returned anne coolly be above petty moral doubt in such circumstance in instance mr fanks have nothing to gain to lose by telling falsehood saw mr hersham morning added abruptly irrelevantly yes have to thank for alteration in demeanour have persuaded to tell have done so no have postponed confession for week what foolish weakness muttered anne with sigh wish have told morning do why because may find out wished to hide before can brace mind to confession love edward hersham dearly mr fanks can see fault weakness of character a plainly a can entreated to tell at once consented yet see when come to point feebleness make shrink from ordeal hint at danger to hersham may ask if be connected with committal of crime may not mr fanks edward can tell truth for in week be foolish be not guilty fanks be at once piqued delighted with woman be so clever so inscrutable that must not help respecting for first time for many day have met with woman with mind of man felt that must need intelligence to beat on other hand be not unprepared to expect defeat in place of victory what must say miss colmer if told that have found assassin of sir gregory asked craftily must at once congratulate doubt be quick response mr fanks be not yet successful else must not come to see must be astonished at seeing photograph of mr boazoph know seems do mother doe not know under name what do mean miss colmer made immediate reply compressed beautiful lip tightly together looked out of window see that will have to make confidant of sir said slowly although recognise claim to demand explanation pardon miss colmer said fanks with utmost politeness law give right by visit to half moon street where murdered man lived implicated in matter can see by hint of hersham that know more than choose to tell a be deputed to search out truth can call on to reveal know made confession yesterday be truth be truth so far a went ah then there be more to tell yes said anne after pause there be more to tell not yet not yet fanks leaned forward looked into eye miss colmer said in low tone tell who killed sir gregory know swear know see here mr fanks cried suddenly know truth have inkling of truth may be wrong fervently trust that be wrong still be doubtful very very doubtful ca tell of suspicion might get innocent person into trouble be alluding to hersham decline to say by advice mr hersham be about to tell know can not take word out of mouth must never forgive wish to lose love then mean mr boazoph refuse to speak will leave if ask further question said almost fiercely nearly discovered what think be truth in chamber did not know that be there went up to half moon street to prevent truth being discovered if must failed because be present fanks sat up alertly have given clue be truth to be discovered in half moon street asked eagerly anne moistened dry lip turned away face yes believe be murmured hope will never discover be so moved that fanks thought be about to faint with considerable dexterity left question alone for time turned conversation toward subject of mr boazoph have not yet told about portrait said gently will do so now said anne recovering nerve mr boazoph be mother sister be aunt oh said fanks considerably astonished then how be that mother doe not know name of boazoph because only know sister a mr bryant understand said fanks rather bewildered matter be easy of explanation mother be gentlewoman although keep shop be very proud of birth blood behaviour of sister nearly killed can therefore guess what must think of aunt mr boazoph did know that kept notorious hotel in tooley alley be so well known to police a be fanks looked at woman in astonishment be so strange to hear speak in manner of own flesh blood anne noticed astonishment faint blush crept over cheek see what be thinking of mr fanks know aunt have told about unhappy life believe be more to be pitied than blamed like hersham said link dryly yes like mr hersham retorted defiantly aunt made unhappy marriage with man far beneath name be bryant not boazoph so mother only know sister by name bryant lost money be set up by of friend in red star in tooley alley there from shame at fall called boazoph when died aunt carried on business daresay know rest of life fanks nodded suppose mr boazoph visit occasionally a mr bryant said inquisitively come once twice in year for mother sake see approve of mr boazoph misguided life be not what must call friendly with yours be indeed unfortunate family said fanks bluntly with le of usual courtesy sister driven to death by dead scoundrel aunt one of most notorious woman in london mother paralysed lover mixed up in murder anne lost temper at brutal speech be just what fanks wished to do why have made inherently gentleman must never have thought of taunting poor girl with crime folly of family have not desired to get better of in instance desired to make angry took way unworthy way must be confessed with burst of indignation anne rose to foot always understood that be gentleman mr fanks said bitterly see be mistaken if think to trap into helping by insulting family be mistaken will tell nothing now perhaps may force to help said fanks looking very wicked be afraid not in what way do hope to accomplish so impossible task why said fanks keeping eye fixed on face by arresting lover dare not dare dare anything look here miss colmer be growing tired of being in dark rather than remain in longer will resort to strong measure in way of know hersham be mixed up in crime if wo be persuaded to tell must be forced to speak out if only to save hersham from being tried for crime will arrest do so will only be loser by so rash action fanks walked to door good day miss colmer will do a say blame will lie at door anne said nothing very pale very determined stood looking at fanks admired for way in be fighting privately considered that if way to truth lay through anne colmer there be small chance of being discovered made one more attempt to induce to speak come said pleadingly be advised save hersham by telling truth know truth only guess guess may be correct one let know what be wo speak not for world be plain that knew must not reveal so fanks shaking head left room when be out of door anne broke down falling into chair burst into tear yet have idea of yielding for better worse die be cast if hersham be arrested at door must lie ruin disgrace of life truly be powerful reason made anne conceal truth at expense of lover liberty might be of life a for fanks went off to station caught train to town have gone to taxton on thames full of hope of success left beaten on point by woman sole chance of learning anything further lay in advertising for negro in chance that hersham must confess next week anne colmer be a silent a sphinx same fanks have not done with young lady chapter xx green overcoat may be here mentioned that fanks have intention of arresting hersham at present time have threatened to do so in order to induce anne to speak out having failed thought no more about matter journalist be being watched must be arrested at moment so fanks be quite at ease on score slightest false step hersham must find within wall of jail up to present time fanks have not collected sufficient evidence against to warrant magistrate authorising imprisonment confession of next week might bring about intervention of law till then fanks left hersham under eye of watching detective devoted to searching for mysterious negro who have worn green coat with brass button may seem strange to reader so astute man a mr fanks must advertise for negro when be confident that only negro connected with matter be in bombay apparent riddle will be explained when mr fanks receives expected answer to paragraph in morning planet appeared two day after left taxton on thames read a follows ten pound reward will be given to person who can inform advertiser of whereabouts of black man dressed in green coat with brass button twenty pound will be given to anyone who can give information a to movement of said black man on night of twenty first of june last between hour of six nine apply messrs vaud vaud lincoln inn field can not be said that advertisement be masterpiece of composition clumsy wording be due to crate crate not being scholar have written in fashion fanks commented on prolixity to author on morning of appearance must have shortened that advertisement considerably said smiling never saw so roundabout request for information what doe ' matter replied crate growing rather red ai scholar mr fanks did best must if fish bite sir be want hope fish will bite crate said fanks fretfully if not know what will do never have be so unlucky a over case everything seems to go wrong with if can find anyone who saw negro on night of murder hear strange thing about mr boazoph dr binjoy about miss colmer hersham though to be sure such information may run into blind alley by way did mr garth call to see in absence twice sir deuce muttered fanks with frown wonder why be so anxious over case think can tell that sir think can guess what be about to say retorted fanks however let hear theory well may be wrong said crate modestly seems to that mr garth be anxious to find out that sir louis fellenger be concerned in murder of cousin because because want to inherit fellenger title property a next heir finished fanks smartly exactly sir what do think of theory there may be something in crate replied fanks thoughtfully of course mr garth come into fellenger estate on death of present baronet added emphatically know that negro actually killed sir gregory so louis must only be associated with case a accessory before fact therefore must not be hanged even if case be proved against where must mr garth be then in such event estate must probably be thrown into chancery while sir louis be undergoing imprisonment must not come to garth for year idea be good one crate see how must benefit friend crate scratched chin suppose that mr garth be lawyer enough to know that said grudgingly must risk neck for mere chance of such thing ah now be on track mr garth may be anxious to prove case against sir louis think killed sir gregory oh know who think be guilty mr fanks same agree with must not be surprised if garth turned out to be real criminal garth be negro guess have own idea about negro mr fanks detective smiled rose from seat guess have mr crate be improving friend be beginning to see further than nose must not wonder if made something of yet so suspect garth with becoming modesty good deal of emphasis crate asserted that did moreover said that if permitted by superior officer must have great pleasure in proving case against barrister to fanks assented readily enough prove case by mean crate said dryly agree with in least same be always open to correction one thing only ask must tell do discover a wish to cross trail crate assented to without demur fanks departed to duke street where changed clothes for more stylish one of rixton thence went to athenian club a expected found garth in smoking room lean lawyer looked so haggard worn out that fanks wondered if there might not be more in crate theory than appeared at first sight rejected idea almost a soon a crossed mind be confident that true assassin of sir gregory be that revelation come later in meantime greeted garth with customary coolness sat down beside with view to learning have transpired during absence be waiting for here asked lighting cigarette not exactly replied garth with hesitation hoped that must come in here sooner later wished to see at present be waiting for herbert vaud really do expect shortly garth looked at watch ought to be here now what do wish to see about asked fanks eyeing companion keenly anything about case garth nodded yes young vaud knew emma calvert wish to learn if be really dead can set mind at rest on point said fanks coolly emma calvert be six foot below soil of pere la chaise woman who appeared at cousin chamber woman whom robert said be be anne colmer twin sister of dead woman anne colmer be engaged to ted hersham be have be down to taxton on thames have found out family history have found out who wrote on back of photograph who directed that envelope said fanks gloomily have not discovered anything yet about do think that anne colmer wrote be certain from personal observation anne colmer did not did mother impossible mr colmer be hopeless paralytic then who wrote be just what have to learn be further in case than be when saw last have discovered anything have hoped to have learned about emma from herbert well said fanks with sigh know about herbert vaud be aware of identity of emma calvert be not in direction must search only chance of finding out truth lie in discovering negro saw advertisement in beorning planet ' anybody who can give information be to call at office of vaud vaud see thought best that must receive information said fanks seeing that be solicitor of sir louis hope that something will turn up be doubtful be very doubtful at moment waiter brought in telegram to mr barrister opened uttered ejaculation of surprise after pause handed telegram to fanks queer be said fanks looked at message ran a follows can not see to day have to wait in to see fanks about advertisement h vaud humph said fanks rising briskly to foot be strange must be here with stranger still that advertisement must be answered so promptly told vaud to write to scotland yard must anything turn up will save journey can come with if like must call at room first said fanks by way friend added turning sharply on garth know anything about very apropos telegram good lord how must think that sent be matter let get on there be time to lose a matter of fact fanks did not like look of thing at be naturally suspicious of telegram fitted in so very neatly with subject of conversation that thought garth might know more of than have chosen to say moment reflection convinced that suspected lawyer wrongly garth did not know that be coming to athenian club therefore must not have made arrangement fanks dismissed matter from mind allowed garth to come with to room in duke street picked up photograph placed in pocket garth saw face of picture whistled think that person have anything to do with asked anxiously person have to do with present matter said fanks smartly ca say if person have anything to do with death in tooley alley be only taking portrait on chance may be wrong however will see not word must fanks say until arrived at lincoln inn field here found herbert in father room with apology have to take place of father to day mr fanks said young lawyer who looked ill be not well deputed to see after matter touching advertisement said fanks eagerly yes man turned up morning in answer to be waiting in next room say that know about negro be in search of good let have in mind friend mr garth being present hope not at replied herbert coldly that lie more in hand than mine show in man who came about advertisement added to clerk who entered gentleman in question entered dried up little man brisk keen eyed with horsey look about glanced sharply at three men pulled forelock proceeded to ask about reward want thirty pun said calmly oh retorted fanks want ten twenty two reward be separate must not add together can tell of whereabouts of negro can tell movement know about so ought to get reward will get ten twenty said fanks now no more talk what be name berry jawkins be barman at eight bell public on richmond road ho ho muttered fanks thought a much on twenty first nigger came riding bicycle about eight o'clock came into bar have drink wore green coat with brass button after have drink asked if might wash face sent out to pump in back yard washed came in then gent said little man with emphasis got surprise can tell kind of surprise demanded garth with astonished look why sir that nigger be no nigger at be white man a white a make white man said fanks producing portrait from pocket white man with smile moustache very good looking sort of feller added barman explained how be wait moment said fanks be that man saw berry jawkins started back in surprise moment set eye on photograph fanks have thrust under nose gum here be start said mr berry jawkins be very identical person who washed at eight bell how did come to know of sir suspected for time said fanks do recognise face mr vaud herbert looked at face countenance reflected astonishment of berry jawkins of garth why exclaimed young solicitor starting back be ted hersham chapter xxi eight bell although fanks quite expected revelation be nevertheless rather astonished at unexpected confirmation from bicycle ride of hersham to taxton on thames to thwart design on anne colmer fanks have deduced certain suspicion hesitation of journalist have confirmed suspicion frankly speaking have reason to connect hersham with negro have be satisfied from evidence of simeon wagg caesar dr binjoy servant have not be away from surrey village on fatal night failing real negro someone must have personated black man from behaviour of hersham fanks thought might be person in question random shot have hit bull eye be quite accident that have done so expected a much said fanks again restoring photograph to pocket book told garth be right to trust to instinct discovery explains extraordinary conduct of hersham in what way will tell later on in meantime let hear what man have to say turned towards berry jawkins a spoke waited for to speak barman looked rather downcast when did open mouth be to revert to subject of reward be poor man gentleman said in whining tone hope mean fair about thirty pun mean fair about twenty pound man said vaud sternly heard what mr fanks said oh yes heard fast enough retorted berry jawkins hold with reward added together make thirty pun doubt do then reward be not to be added together said fanks have better tell know mr berry jawkins will look into matter then will get reward ah 'd go back on well d ' y see sha tell anything fanks shrugged shoulder have desire to quarrel with man to waste time in arguing only way to induce speech from obstinate creature be to pay money after have earned fairly enough detective therefore advised herbert vaud to fulfil term of advertisement be accordingly done mr jawkins found richer by twenty pound though must have be thirty pun said obstinate creature there ai chance of getting what be fair out of aristocracy be radical be go want to have political opinion man said fanks sharply come to point be coming to grumbled berry jawkins on night of twenty first be in bar business be bad that evening gentleman there be not blessed soul in bar just about eight o'clock thought a how might shut up when door opened in came black man said `` ve left bike outside want drink of scotch cold ' s mind twigged that be nigger when spoke saw a be gent by peculiar refinement of jawing a be business said nothing till asked to wash face then told to go round to pump in back yard 'tho '' s gent like will want hot water ai gent s `` m only poor strolling christy minstrel ' s then laugh seein ' a be lying

murder description of negro in green coat brass button 'that be man ' s hold hard berry jawkins say nothing till see a there be reward ' so wait wait till in morning paper see reward of thirty pun twenty pound very well gent will say twenty tho ' to mind ought to be tenner a s see reward come up to get have got said jawkins slapping pocket tho ' not amount did expect now having told go hoping will catch that black white nigger hang for think be aristocrat hate being natural enemy having heard history fanks let berry jawkins go a there be reason why must be detained first however found out that mr jawkins be always to be heard of at eight bell in capacity of barman man having left room fanks turned towards garth herbert to see what thought of revelation have be so unexpectedly made returned gaze garth be first to break silence well said in low tone so hersham be culprit after pardon garth think that have proved yet what do say mr vaud can say nothing replied herbert coldly have opinion in matter a father be absent be attending to case by desire personally speaking must not lift one finger to discover assassin rather punisher of gregory fellenger hated then said fanks quietly hated still hate even though be dead wonder at speaking in way mr fanks replied fanks with certain pity in tone wonder father told mr garth here story of emma calvert mr garth repeated to know hate very memory of dead scoundrel can wonder at said herbert again loved did not love might have grown to do so in time came with lie money to drag away from married certainly drove to suicide if have not met with death by unknown hand must have have to reckon with for baseness must have killed perhaps herbert vaud opened shut hand convulsively know what must have done said in thick voice be dead so what doe matter if have way assassin of gregory fellenger must go free may go free after said fanks quietly have not yet solved problem of death have proved that hersham be disguised a negro said garth impetuously have proved that hersham be disguised a negro replied fanks making correction with point have not proved that be that be negro who killed cousin in tooley alley if did not why be blacked up on very night murder be committed must have have reason for so masquerading have doubt have reason have doubt that will explain reason to when see on face of think that be negro of tooley alley why not said garth impatiently look here fanks skein run out a clean a whistle hersham have cross tattooed on arm death of cousin be caused by similar cross being pricked on arm hersham be engaged to anne colmer tell that be sister of girl emma calvert who committed suicide in paris a victim of sir gregory envelope making appointment come from taxton on thames anne colmer come from same place life there hersham be disguised a negro on very night of murder at very time murder be committed what be more reasonable than to suppose that hersham be inspired by anne colmer to kill man who have deceived sister there in few word have motive of crime way in be carried out oh there be doubt in mind that have real man at last be must arrest hersham without delay if be in place must do what intend to do said fanks quietly take time to consider matter admit that have made very strong case out against hersham there be one important particular have overlooked what be asked garth seems to that there be not link missing that come of being too confident can see missing link mr vaud young lawyer reflected for few moment in composed careless manner then looked up professed inability to amend case a set out against hersham fanks shrugged shoulder at lack of penetration explained theory negro who be in tooley alley have moustache said slowly a be proved by evidence of mr boazoph hersham on contrary a negro white man have moustache a have be proved by story of berry jawkins might have be false moustache said garth still sticking to point be not false moustache retorted fanks shaking head if hersham intended disguise must have worn beard moustache must disguise little for sake of argument will grant that moustache be intended a disguise if so why did retain when washed black off face if be part of disguise why did wear a black white man be sure that hersham wore own moustache not false one again added fanks with afterthought saw hersham shortly after murder within two three day in fact then wore heavy moustache can trust when say be not false one if then hersham be tooley alley negro who have agreed committed murder how did manage to grow moustache in so short period thing be impossible finished detective one point alone assures that hersham be guiltless of crime mr boazoph may have made mistake suggested garth remember did not see negro go out saw go in however mr boazoph be too clever woman to make mistake of sort black man who committed murder have moustache friend masquerading a christy minstrel have one against evidence of mr boazoph can place evidence of berry jawkins one contradicts other evidence conclusively prove that hersham have hand in commission of mysterious tragedy thing said herbert suddenly mr garth couple fact of murder with name of miss colmer a friend of family protest against know mr colmer know daughter be certain that of unfortunate people have anything to do with death of scoundrel nevertheless envelope contained appointment of red star in tooley alley a rendezvous bore taxton on thames postmark mr colmer daughter live at taxton on thames what of sir louis fellenger medical friend lived at same place might a well say that new baronet committed crime so a to succeed to title estate one theory be a feasible a other very true said fanks in desponding tone be a much in dark a ever at present moment can build up theory on anything for instance might say that friend garth here killed cousin deuce cried garth aghast be startled said fanks keenly watching effect of speech on young man wonder at merely say to show how slow must be in condemning hersham see how must bring in stammered garth be easy enough be heir failing sir louis know purport of tattooed cross might have killed cousin have sent appointment from taxton on thames to implicate sir louis in matter so have removed two people between title at one sweep want title possibly not want money look so afraid garth think committed crime be doubt a innocent a mr herbert here if have committed crime must not deny said herbert gloomily must glory in causing death of scoundrel if fellenger have not be killed by negro in tooley alley mr fanks might have have to arrest a cause of death a be revenge have be taken out of hand same end have be arrived at be glad blackguard be dead here argument ended fanks went out arm in arm with garth of be sorry for unhappy herbert vaud of be more puzzled than ever over case a yet evidence have failed to throw least gleam of light on subject chapter xxii mr boazoph receives shock shortly after conversation at lincoln inn field fanks took leave of garth be rather weary of lawyer company moreover found third person hindrance to free speech wished to induce from with whom conversed in own heart be perfectly satisfied that garth be connected in way with crime for test applied in office of vaud vaud entirely satisfied nevertheless be not so certain that garth must not be pleased to learn that cousin sole person who stood between fellenger estate be implicated in affair on ground therefore excused to barrister walked off by intent on own business garth who be suffering from bad attack of detective fever be not over pleased at being thus dismissed still thought best to obey friend so departed to think over aspect case have now assumed in fact intended to do little detective business on own account if possible wished to surprise fanks by unexpected discovery there be now three different people following three different line of action with respect to case so be to be hoped that one of at least must run down assassin of sir gregory fellenger unless indeed failed on principle too many cook spoil broth on leaving barrister fanks took way towards tooley alley be intention to see mr boazoph to try experiment on astute lady from demeanour fanks believed that landlady of red star knew more about case than chose to confess that be anxious to screen man woman who have done deed of belief wished to make certain mr boazoph received detective with customary composure be quite prepared for visit a knew that connection with case be too patent to escape vigilant eye anticipating trying conversation directed fanks to be shown into private sitting room braced up to confuse baffle one must have guessed landlady thought from amiable manner in received almost declared enemy be positively genial in conversation demeanour fanks augured ill from well mr boazoph said mildly suppose be wondering what brings here indeed be doing such thing mr fanks came to find out what know about crime congratulate on perspicuity mr boazoph what do know about woman raised eyebrow shrugged shoulder know nothing at replied gave evidence at inquest heard well well there be nothing more to be said beg to differ with mr boazoph there be great deal more to be said not by said mr boazoph obstinately closing mouth if think that be going to assist to find out who killed wretched man be very much mistaken strange said fanks in musing tone meant to reach ear same thing be said in almost same word by anne colmer what do know about anne colmer more than can guess for instance know that be niece of mr bryant with start instantly repressed looked to in hard fixed manner disbelieving smile on lip mr bryant repeated who be mr bryant if know be sure speak plainly hate epigram so do be such bar to intelligent conversation well mr bryant be lady of birth who married beneath mr bryant be bully sot spendthrift lost money by fast living when became poor friend for strange to say unpleasant person have friend set up in hotel be ashamed to stick own name over door so cast about for perhaps can tell what that other name be what singularly obstinate person be said fanks shaking head believe be use wasting time in discussing fact be sensible mr boazoph admit that be mr bryant mr bryant sister of mr colmer of taxton on thames dressmaker decayed gentlewoman know never heard name really said fanks with gentle pity then must inquire of mr colmer of taxton on thames how be that sister mr bryant be notorious mr boazoph of london be fiend what be mr bryant alias boazoph be most unhappy woman woman rather to be pitied than blamed ah said fanks drawing long breath of satisfaction so admit identity at last can hing else wish poor sister to know be mr boazoph think that live on money left to by late husband doe not know keep hotel be woman who have be mentioned so often in paper in connection with thief rogue detective yes admit that be mr bryant sister of mr colmer who told niece anne have business to do so very probably must not help forced to speak how doe not matter extracted truth out of mr bryant call mr boazoph flashed out woman relieve of presence a speedily a possible what do wish to know wish to know agreement made with dr binjoy regarding crime who be dr binjoy come now mr boazoph let have argument have time patience to endure one assure know more than think can force to speak if so choose must rather not choose if be same to let conduct conversation pleasantly if possible know that dr binjoy be same a dr renshaw indeed how can prove very easily followed dr renshaw on presumed journey to bombay tracked to mere hall at bournemouth mr boazoph quailed shrank back man knew so much that did not know where stood for moment did not know what to do unable to deny identity of renshaw with binjoy admitted good said fanks in satisfied tone be getting on agreement made with man made agreement with then why be here on night of murder be accident for reason of own dr binjoy whom met at taxton on thames be in habit of changing name when in london usually stayed with dr turnor who be old friend of did work when turnor be absent when found out murder sent for dr turnor be away dr binjoy came under name of renshaw be astonished to see did not know that be in town oh have reason to go to mere hall to see mere hall stammered mr boazoph saw at mere hall saw with own eye can not deny have wish to deny retorted mr boazoph with asperity yes be at mere hall went there to warn binjoy against indeed doubt binjoy assured that have baffled by pretended journey to bombay yes said that did say that have sent negro caesar to bombay in place mr boazoph drew back gasped holding tightly on to arm of chair know that said in alarm know great deal more said fanks grimly in fact more than suspect know assassin then know that caesar killed sir gregory jump to conclusion mr boazoph said fanks noting tone of relief in made remark know that caesar killed sir gregory fellenger know that dr binjoy must like to think so man man cried mr boazoph with hysterical laugh do think that have anything to do with crime why not man be killed in house called in doctor who be dearest friend of present baronet be to binjoy interest that sir gregory must be got out of way again mr boazoph seemed relieved then suppose that binjoy instructed caesar to kill sir gregory caesar have nothing to do with commission of crime then who be black man who killed baronet be black man be said mr boazoph angrily saw enter room saw white man disguised a negro enter room mr boazoph bounded to foot what cried do mean to say that black man be disguised white man yes do say so although daresay be news to mr boazoph stamped foot be news to tell thought that caesar killed sir gregory at behest of dr binjoy when entered room hoped to keep fact from because did not wish binjoy to get into trouble say that caesar did not commit crime so have upset idea altogether now mr fanks tell truly that if negro did not kill sir gregory know name of assassin fanks looked puzzled evidently spoke in good faith must not believe wondered if be right whether negro of dr binjoy have killed baronet after did recognise a caesar black man who came here on night asked how must never saw caesar in life know that binjoy have negro servant that smuggled off to bombay that be friend of sir louis fellenger therefore thought negro be instrument binjoy made use of to kill sir gregory do know anything about tattooed cross mr boazoph asked fanks going on tack woman fell into chair a pale a sheet of paper mention of tattooed cross have most powerful effect on mind stared thunderstruck at detective not word must utter for at least two minute when spoke voice be thick unsteady what do know of tattooed cross muttered know that sir gregory let disguised man tattoo cross on left arm that needle used be poisoned now can tell why sir gregory let cross be pricked on arm ca tell doe that mean that wo tell mean that ca tell gasped mr boazoph did not know sir gregory fellenger do know anyone else who have cross tattooed on left arm asked fanks preparing for great stroke why do ask muttered in terrified tone because man who have cross tattooed on left arm be disguised negro be man who killed sir gregory ah heaven oh edward hersham moaned mr boazoph fell upon floor in faint chapter xxiii confession of hersham when fanks saw mr boazoph lying at foot first intention be to wait until recovered later on changed mind when have placed in hand of servant went home full of thought dark surmise seemed to that case be centring in ted hersham that whole situation depended on right reading of tattooed cross riddle mr boazoph knew something about cross knew something about hersham what be fanks must by mean make up mind seemed to that in exploring depth of mr boazoph mind have found still lower deep be puzzled what to think confound woman thought meditating over pipe said that must find at end of path lead to discovery of mystery seems that be right screened binjoy for reason can not discover will now attempt to save hersham lest must fall into clutch why must take trouble for two men what doe know about tattooed cross doe binjoy know about also be who made obliterating mark ca think hersham guilty yet thing look black against said fanks rising disguised man who slew in tooley alley hersham be two different people proved that conclusively to garth what be to be done now be difficult to decide at first almost resolved to return to mr boazoph urge confession again thought best to wait until heard what hersham have to say might be thought that hersham confession must throw light on relation to mr boazoph hint of anne colmer terror of hersham fainting of mr boazoph be of piece fanks felt confident that beneath perplexity lay key to riddle be not that have clue be in reality quite bewildered by multiplicity of clue so bewildered that did not know clue to seize first at length came to conclusion that must be best to wait till saw hersham heard what have to say afterwards to follow up clue placed in hand by fainting of mr boazoph will write to hersham remind that promised to see in few day tell truth said fanks going to desk if reveals be certain that confession will contain information that mr boazoph wrote warned against be confident a said that must do if tried to save binjoy must certainly try to help hersham reason for doing one be a inscrutable a reason have be for acting in way did towards binjoy further went into case darker grew in sheer despair fanks wrote reminder to hersham did nothing more for next few day meditate over tangle in found involved meditation led to result when hersham called on at duke street chamber in three day detective be at wit end how to proceed however be delighted to see hersham a have doubted whether young man must fulfil promise now that have come to do so there might be chance of seeing gleam of light fanks did not tell journalist what have discovered concerning movement on night of twenty first a wanted to see if hersham must confess a much if did so such frankness must confirm belief that young fellow have nothing to do with commission of crime if on other hand hersham concealed proven fact fanks intended to force into confession by revealing what have heard from berry jawkins by result must be guided in future movement ensuing conversation be likely to prove a interesting important a have held with mr boazoph be glad to see hersham said in gentle tone a hope what have to tell may throw light on darkness of tooley alley crime can throw light on cursed thing said hersham gloomily be only here to exonerate from what what do mean why must ask that said angrily be not who suspect of killing man decidedly not think killed fellenger a told before believe have anything to do with then why did have watched demanded young man ask that of yourself said fanks coolly roused suspicion hinted that knew something thwarted with regard to anne colmer cast mind back to first conversation man will say have reason for acting a did if have told truth at first have become ally instead of enemy must not have have trouble for suspect of being murderer have done so finished fanks must have be in cell long e'er held tongue because be afraid of said sullenly if be innocent there be reason to be afraid of be innocent yet be afraid of yes be dreading to tell what be about to reveal why so circumstance may so close round innocent man continued hersham not heeding interruption that must seem a though be guilty think fanks innocent men have be hanged e'er now because circumstantial evidence be strong against true enough replied fanks suppose be natural that must be afraid man must run risk of putting head into noose if must help say that circumstance be strong against be circumstance hersham bit lip turned wan face on friend place life in hand mind said hoarsely will be safe there replied fanks getting up fetching decanter of brandy from sideboard nothing will induce to believe that have anything to do with commission of crime will swear to cried hersham stretching out shaking hand certainly if will comfort here friend drink tell what know may help to nab person have eye on hersham drank brandy have found out who killed fellenger fanks shrugged shoulder think so said who can tell may be wrong be man woman asked hersham quickly sha tell be sha tell friend will tell for quieting of fear that be not whom suspect now sit down again let hear what have to say hersham resumed seat obediently began recital confessed exactly what fanks expected must confess what fanks already knew detective listened to twice told tale with keenest attention thereby hoped to learn new detail have be overlooked by zealous berry jawkins about beginning of june said hersham in hesitating voice be engaged on series of paper for beorning planet ' on street music to gain information required thought must be excellent plan to go about street of london in guise to get at root of matter told editor must burnt cork face go with street minstrel approved of idea did so how be dressed in great coat with brass button also wore brown boot now can see why be afraid to tell be dress negro be looking for wore yes said flank perplexedly know see why must have be afraid to tell can explain movement on night be exactly what ca do said hersham face growing dark understand will explain on night of twenty first intended to go out in street in disguise before doing so told office boy that if telegram came for be to bring at once to expected wire about six o'clock told boy must be in strand near st clements church from whom did expect telegram from anne colmer that day have received letter from saying that be greatly worried about something what be did not tell said that if wanted must wire be then to come down at once to taxton on thames go on said fanks greatly interested in introduction of anne name well blacked face went out with genuine nigger to sing play about six little after be near st clement church there office boy came to with telegram why did expect telegram at six because be in office about five have not come then thought might come after left so appointed st clement church a meeting place where boy might find obeyed what be in telegram request must come down to taxton on thames at once yes there be reason why must not thought that anne be in trouble went down at once on bicycle why did not go by train must have be easier not for be in habit of running down to taxton on thames on machine be only two hour run have machine in town yes have left at shop in strand where usually leave though sometimes ride on to office in fleet street on occasion be in strand a soon a got telegram left troupe went off on bicycle did wash face not at time be in such hurry so anxious to learn what be matter with anne did not think of doing so rode along until be recalled to spectacle must have presented by laughing guying of boy then thought that might startle anne determined to wash did not immediately on way to richmond have accident tyre of back wheel be punctured air escaped be over hour mending then have to go slowly did not get to richmond till after eight o'clock went into hotel called eight bell have drink wash then came out white man to astonishment of barman went on down to taxton on thames got there shortly after nine o'clock did nearly run over man a neared village yes did said hersham in astonishment how do know will tell later on replied fanks smiling about result of trip to taxton on thames hersham face fell there be result said in low voice when arrived went at once to briar cottage asked for anne be told that have gone up to town by five o'clock train gone up to town repeated fanks be curious why did go up to town after sending wire to bring down ca say returned by night train be at station to meet asked why have gone to town refused to tell merely said that have sent wire shortly before five o'clock that have found occasion to go up by five train can conjecture what took to town will not tell fanks said nothing be meditating on strange story told to by hersham on stranger conduct of anne colmer mystery concerning young lady have begun in chamber of sir gregory seemed to be thickening fanks be puzzled gloomy chapter xxiv clue of handwriting on concluding recital of movement on night of twenty first of june hersham looked anxiously at fanks to see what detective thought of matter latter made immediate comment whereupon journalist impatient of silence made first observation have told said now what be opinion let think for minute two replied fanks holding up hand must consider thereupon thrust hand into pocket strolled to window where stood looking absently at adjacent chimney pot hersham eyed with continued anxiety did not dare to interrupt so that fanks have ample time to reflect over strange story have be related to have heard main fact of before from berry jawkins corresponded entirely with narrative of journalist still additional evidence concerning anne colmer disquieted fanks not little behaviour be strange to say least of far more suspicious than of hersham why have sent telegram to withdraw lover from london at very time of committal of crime why have so to speak nullified that telegram by going to town almost immediately after have despatched such conduct be decidedly suspicious looked a though be implicated in matter in underhand way why have behaved in so mysterious fashion why have refused to reveal reason for so acting to hersham so far so good there remained greater mystery be anne colmer herself who have instructed hersham to confess to fanks yet must have known that very extraordinary conduct must need explanation must explain fanks thought not recalled conversation with how have refused to speak lest evidence whatever be must be detrimental to innocent person clearly innocent person must not be hersham for have established innocence in eye of detective then if person in question be not hersham who must be mr colmer dr binjoy anne caesar missing negro not first thought fanks decidedly not first for mr colmer be confined to room by paralysis must not take active part in business scarcely second for anne must have reason to screen doctor at least reason that fanks must even guess at if third seeing that mr boazoph be aunt might be so motive might be that anne desired aid to carry out scheme of revenge against destroyer of sister a to caesar fanks have quite settled in own mind that negro be innocent that personality be being made use of merely to screen chief actor actor in tragedy result of fank meditation therefore resulted in having increased suspicion of mr boazoph behaviour at time of discovery of murder visit to mere hall fainting at mention that hersham be probable criminal thing be suspicious now probable visit of anne colmer to aunt although such visit be not yet proved clinched matter interest of fanks now centred in mr boazoph addressed again to hersham in hope of learning something tangible likely to connect more intimately with niece in london at taxton on thames be right to act in way indefinable instinct have placed on right path wish have told of before said to hersham a resumed seat must have saved lot of trouble did not wish to tell be afraid to speak lest must inculpate be sure movement on fatal night must appear very suspicious to what be opinion of now same a before be satisfied that have told truth hersham be not whom suspect then who be asked young man eagerly will tell later on replied fink in meantime must answer few more question be not yet quite clear on point how did obtain disguise oh be miss colmer suggestion deuce be said fanks rather startled at admission yes told of idea to disguise in order to obtain thoroughly realistic description of street music of who make asked how thought must dress in half laughing way advised to take binjoy servant caesar a model did certainly thought suggestion good one caesar be rather oddity in way dressed with mixture of vivid colour be so dear to black race when off duty usually wore red neck scarf brown felt hat black trouser long green coat with large brass button quite noticeable garb in fact have several of quaint garment have brought one to anne establishment to get yellow velvet cuff collar sewn on to on promise must not keep more than fortnight anne lent coat wore for purpose strange said fanks thoughtfully so wore very coat of man whom suspected in first instance did be odd now that mention fanks considered did anyone suggest disguising a negro for street music business be own fancy be suggestion of dr binjoy oh be humph be beginning to see daylight why think think nothing at present said fanks quickly matter be in too crude state observation be hardly true for fanks be beginning to think that affair of green coat looked singularly like conspiracy be unwilling to communicate suspicion to hersham because of necessity included anne colmer therefore passed matter off a before mentioned nevertheless thought doubtful that disguise be result of accident binjoy must suggest idea of blackening face that anne must induce hersham to dress up in very clothes of caesar thing seemed suspicious quite impossible to understand must guess binjoy object presuming binjoy have designed murder be to avert suspicion from servant by throwing on hersham what fanks must not see be why anne must act a did when hersham be lover surely did not wish to implicate hersham in matter if must be presumed that be connected with of fanks be by mean sure yet fanks be honestly puzzled to understand action so at variance with position with usual sense therefore abandoned subject for present re addressed to examination of hersham did know dr binjoy did disliked greatly think liked added hersham smiling for be successful rival with miss colmer yes fancy that old man fell in love with anne wished to marry asked to be mr binjoy four five time in fact like impudence be however anne told that be engaged to sent off with flea in ear think liked better for triumph said fanks dryly have doubt must do best to injure fanks do think designedly induced to act a duplicate of caesar ca say look suspicious being at red star on night of murder under assumed name be still more suspicious same have managed business so cleverly that can bring nothing home to do think that designed murder of fellenger so a to get estate for sir louis action bear that interpretation said fanks scratching chin have proof a yet may find out at mere hall be going there next week wish to see employer sir louis tell have done at same time intend to observe binjoy by way added detective did like sir louis hersham shrugged shoulder so so replied be dry stick wrapped up in scientific study pass most of day with binjoy in laboratory making experiment tall stout fellow be not at like dry a dust savant humph said fanks twisting ring tall stout creature dr binjoy be also tall stout yes so be negro caesar trio be fat healthy humph said fanks again wonder be impossible what be impossible something came into head what be doe not matter will doubt prove impossibility at mere hall suspect sir louis such suspicion did cross mind a sir louis be employing to hunt down murderer must hardly act in such way never mind at present moment hersham tell if have written to father about tattooed cross have not done so yet see how father can help be of opinion said fanks dryly be firm conviction that whole secret of murder in tooley alley lie in explanation of tattooed cross look so scared hersham suspect father must think not said hersham fiercely fanks laughed indulgently in nowise offended with indignant tone adopted by young man indeed rather admired for being so ready to take up cudgel on behalf of parent nevertheless stuck to point a be determined to fathom meaning of tattooed cross saw one be so likely to help to interpretation a rev george hersham vicar of fairview isle of wight must do a ask said write to father must know why have that cross tattooed on arm believe father have anything to do with said hersham angrily however a insist on will go home see if tell will tell if refuse a have done before in case will come down to fairview see a please said hersham with feigned air of indifference real vexation will do best can do more be angry old fellow wish to vex either father must see that be important must know meaning of cross will go see mr hersham yes before end of week will content yes replied fanks in turn now before go just tell if received letter from mr boazoph if have brought with now be strange that must have guessed said hersham in astonishment did get letter from mr boazoph brought to see what thought of quite slipped memory till spoke of here be came yesterday from fairview from fairview repeated fanks making attempt to take letter hersham held towards be sent to address yes care of father who forwarded on to see for did mr boazoph know of address in isle of wight be odd added hersham staring at fanks how did get from miss colmer have never given london address to miss colmer have reason for not doing so so mr boazoph knew of address without telling said detective stretching out hand for letter queer if be not mistaken by jove what be matter wait wait said fanks in great excitement let read letter first word here be discovery what discovery asked hersham staring at letter fanks paid attention to be already devouring communication from landlady of red star ran a follows dear mr edward hersham come see at once important business in meantime hold communication with man who call fanks will explain when meet yours louisa boazoph wish have shown before said fanks be so anxious about what have to confess that forgot fanks be important must think so must see at once tell what say may find key to whole business in conversation do think mr boazoph have anything to do with for answer fanks got out photograph of dead emma calvert envelope have contained red star pointed out handwriting on to hersham see that said eagerly handwriting on back of portrait that on envelope be same a on letter true enough said hersham examining three object closely what of only that mr boazoph addressed envelope enclosed red cardboard star lured late sir gregory fellenger to death on evening of twenty first of june chapter xxv at mere hall hants fanks be rather astonished when learned that mr boazoph have contrived lure have drawn fellenger to death have given landlady credit for more cleverly concealing scheme that must have carried out plan so compromising in so open manner seemed to to be height of folly nevertheless be pleased that have discovered who have directed fatal envelope be still more pleased that mr boazoph have sent for hersham if possible intended to learn reason for seeking interview to ascertain why have fainted at intelligence that hersham be likely to be arrested for committing crime true report of conversation fanks have doubt that hersham must repeat faithfully to might afford clue to mystery at present moment fanks be convinced that landlady of red star must unravel riddle if chose be resolved to force to do so here element on fanks have not calculated came into play a instructed by detective hersham duly called at red star only to be informed that mr boazoph be dangerously ill must not see reported to fanks at first detective deemed illness excuse to postpone interview more especially a dr turnor be medical man in attendance mistrusted turnor a much a did binjoy thought that former have persuaded mr boazoph to relinquish idea of seeing confiding in hersham such confidence might prove a fatal to turnor a to binjoy if so there be doubt that turnor have compelled mr boazoph to hold tongue lest must compromise thus fanks argued out situation sought tooley alley to ascertain if mr boazoph be really ill merely feigning at order of turnor view of sick woman showed plainly that be wrong mr boazoph be laid on bed of sickness incapable almost of speech fanks concluded promptly that there be chance of learning anything until recovered result of last interview have shaken terribly be thoroughly worn out with nervous prostration turnor more like ferret than ever eyed fanks complacently seemed relieved that thing be going so badly for case fanks questioned must learn nothing definite for if detective be clever doctor be cleverer defeated fanks on point indeed carried war into camp of enemy suppose be right in ascribing illness to sir said with sly smile seems that patient fainted at last interview have with did said something startled be very wrong of mr fanks mr boazoph be woman of delicate organisation sudden shock might bring about death have weak heart be sorry to hear so sir retorted fanks gloomily counted on gaining information from do think will soon recover not for time said turnor in satisfied tone presume wish to learn something from relative to case have in hand be quite right do wish to learn something relative to murder took place in hotel if mr boazoph can not tell what wish to know may be able to do so dr turnor spread out hand in deprecating manner dear friend said what can know about case a much a dr renshaw must tell retorted fanks fixing turnor with keen eye dr renshaw told nothing because knew nothing have own opinion about dr turnor really thought be satisfied that friend have nothing to do with matter went to india know be sure went to india dr turnor oh yes will be soon be at bombay got letter from at aden where changed into 'clyde doubt said fanks affably expect will hear from when be settled in bombay certainly renshaw be great friend be sure of that confide secret to one work in unison what do mean by working in unison mr fanks said turnor drawing up think need afford explanation dr turnor be playing dangerous game sir insult sir be possible to insult dr turnor sneered fanks will make prove word said turnor with rather pale face there will not be much difficulty in doing at proper time ferret of man eyed fanks nervously savagely do think have anything to do with matter of sir gregory death burst out will tell that when return from mere hall be fank reply mere hall repeated turnor betraying be reason fanks have mentioned name what do know of mere hall be just what wish to ask what do know of mere hall sir nothing nothing merely repeated word in very singular fashion doctor little man turned away with scowl will defend from insinuation said in stifled voice if suspect say so suspect of what asked fanks innocently speak in riddle turnor pointed to woman lying on bed perhaps mr boazoph can solve said perhaps can retorted fanks with equal coolness trust will not be to disadvantage when answer come can look after mr fanks said turnor left room without detective making effort to detain fanks be suspicious of turnor from connection with so called renshaw conversation went long way towards confirming suspicion however a wished to go to mere hall follow up binjoy clue have time to attend to turnor matter nevertheless on leaving tooley alley sought out crate instructed to look after doctor find out financial position said fanks what kind of practice have how life what kind of character bear about very well mr fanks said crate noting instruction down what about mr boazoph keep eye on must recover so far a to see mr hersham to journey to taxton on thames let know can write wire at pretty maid inn damington be near mere hall ai sir quarter of mile away will stay there time to watch binjoy sir louis fellenger do suspect mr fanks if remember name mentioned must not ask that crate underling be abashed said more turned conversation to subject of garth what be to do about sir oh said fanks dryly think be guilty so will leave to neglect interest to look after business tell crate man be innocent have own opinion about then keep to opinion mind instruction well will tell one thing sir said crate mr garth have left town say so said fanks frowning did not say that be going away where have gone to ca tell that sir lost will tell where have gone be to taxton on thames did expect must go there doe not matter have hand full without thinking of garth leave to in meantime goodbye be off to hampshire fanks arrived at damington about five o'clock put up at pretty maid inn a have done before when following binjoy in disguise of parson thanks to cleverness in making up one at inn suspected that be same man landlady genial soul with plump person kindly face quite ideal landlady of dickens type welcomed without suspicion a gentleman come down for fishing detailed gossip of neighbourhood be especially conversant with affair of sir louis fellenger nice gentleman said mr prisom rather melancholy given to hard study ai good for young man come here take glass with kind word smile always doe dr binjoy come over with said fanks oh yes sir be sorry to see that doctor ai well lately look pale mopey like seems a if have something on mind what do think have on mind mr prisom well ai for to say sir must think a be sorry sir louis did not get on so well a might what make think get on well said fanks pricking up ear be way look at one said mr prisom reflectively say dr binjoy be going away though what sir louis will do without know dr binjoy going away murmured fanks rather startled now what be for mr prisom must not tell must only say that doctor be departing from mere hall day week that be reported in village that have quarrelled seriously with sir louis though of course added mr prisom may not be true must see to thought fanks wonder if sudden departure have anything to do with murder be case of thief falling out must keep eye open after resolution asked landlady if be well acquainted with fellenger family must think so said mr prisom with pride knew that poor young man who be murdered in wicked london a well a know noble gentleman wild ah sighed mr prisom just like father did know sir gregory father did know sir gregory father echoed mr prisom contemptuously do know nose on face sir late sir francis be playmate yes may well look astonished sir be truth be daughter of steward at mere hall be brought up with late sir francis almost like brother sister must tell many good story of finished mr prisom with nod smile must do so said fanks returning smile be fond of story fact be be wondering if must find motive for murder in family history of fellengers many great family have secret if divulged might lead to trouble might be that mere hall folk secret have to do with tattooed cross if proved to be so then fanks thought there might be chance of penetrating mystery of sir gregory death family secret death in tooley alley be widely apart there might be connecting link between at present hidden from gaze at event be worth while examining mr prisom hearing story fanks resolved to do that evening in meantime left garrulous landlady went out for stroll in direction of mere hall be not intention to see sir louis on evening rather to wait till morning nevertheless have desire to look again at splendid mansion of fellengers more to pas away time than with ulterior motive in calm twilight strolled along soon left village behind way lay through flowery hedge bright with blossom of summer under influence of hour beauty of landscape fanks quite forgot that be at damington for purpose of unmasking murderer from dream be rudely awakened brought back to real life a sauntered along swinging stick saw man ahead whose figure gait seemed to be familiar in clear brown twilight must see fairly well so appeared must man be looking at for figure made pause jumped over hedge fanks wondered at for have noted that figure be that of gentleman at event someone other than labourer with usual suspicion a much out of curiosity a anything else fanks jumped over hedge also whereupon stranger began to run across field by time fanks be thoroughly convinced that something be wrong so gave chase at once with chuckle of delight at excitement of adventure across green meadow raced fanks saw man fading into dim twilight redoubled sped so did fellow in next field fanks found that be gaining fugitive sprang over hedge with fanks close on heel when detective landed must see nothing of stranger backward glance showed that man have doubled be running along beside hedge next instant fanks be following on trail although mysterious figure made greatest effort to escape fanks drew closer then accident brought race to end for man stumbled over clod rolled on grass next moment fanks panting for breath stood over detective peered down to see who be have caught to surprise recognised garth chapter xxvi mr prisom story what deuce be doing here asked detective angrily why did run away when saw a to being here replied garth sitting up wiping face came down to watch cousin of whom be suspicious ran away because on catching sight of in twilight took for louis fellenger oh for what purpose be down here have told suspect that cousin through medical friend be concerned in murder of sir gregory fanks frowned garth having got on foot walked on together wished that garth must leave case to resented presence of young lawyer on spot where be staying asked abruptly at pretty maid inn suppose be there also a be only comfortable lodging in village yes be there now a have dropped across may a well go back to supper have intended having look at hall on second thought will go back with to pump mr prisom know mr prisom very well said garth be old servant of family see what can learn from may learn nothing on other hand may learn great deal be well acquainted with father of late baronet be well acquainted with mother with father of present baronet in what way do expect to help well will tell want to find out if there be anything in family history of fellengers likely to have induced sir gregory to submit to tattooing be member of family know of reason said garth mr prisom belongs to generation before replied fanks be possible that may know something of course be only fancy on part still drowning man clutch straw be clutching at may learn something garth shook head knew history of family there be nothing must recall likely to touch on subject of tattooed cross mr prisom received with great dignity in hour be seated at well spread table did justice to viand set before during progress of meal chattered about case while be thus conversing fanks elicited important fact concerning sir louis know why must suspect cousin said in reply to remark of garth mr vaud told that sir louis binjoy be at taxton on thames on night of murder first be ill second be in attendance true enough replied garth frankly same proved that binjoy be masquerading in london on evening of twenty first yes be strange that sir louis must say that binjoy never left side suppose suspect cousin on account by mean suspect cousin because be in london on night fanks leaned back in chair stared at barrister what be that say cried be sir louis in tooley alley on evening oh wo go so far a louis certainly went up to london on night found that out from mr jerusalem who be mr jerusalem be housekeeper of sir louis at taxton on thames when came in for title brought here saw yesterday inadvertently admitted that much how did get out of well be fluke be old servant of family like mr prisom met while out walking recognised made promise not to tell sir louis be here what excuse did make none said garth coolly will tell secret fanks mr jerusalem like hate sir louis be foster sister of mother desire to see in place of scientific cousin indeed said fanks eyeing garth in strange manner have done anything likely to forward interest in respect suppose mean to hint that must like to clear sir louis out of path by accusing of murder said garth coolly well be about right mr jerusalem connects absence of sir louis from taxton on thames with death of sir gregory saw report of inquest know recognised a think description of binjoy servant caesar by putting two two together told yesterday that be firm conviction on slightest of proof remember louis killed gregory by mean of black man humph said fanks thoughtfully must see lady if dislike sir louis binjoy why doe stay in service of former garth shrugged shoulder one must live said mr jerusalem have very easy time of with cousin when mother died be a poor a rat father got louis father to take mr jerusalem into service have be there ever since oh will not tell cousin that be here concluded garth with satisfied nod mr prisom may suggested fanks may be sure that good deal of gossip go on between inn hall how long have be here about three day then may be certain that cousin know of presence in village if have danger to fear from will take measure accordingly like mr jerusalem garth ought to be true to salt ca help retorted garth sulkily must willingly keep house for if have house to keep a have not stay where be what do think of suspicion do yours point in same way did not replied fanks promptly discovery of sir louis visit to town on night put quite different complexion on case same can come to conclusion until see spy of yours be spy said garth gloomily did not drag information out of creature thought that be doing good turn by betraying cousin think that if killed gregory ought to suffer let have property what do think asked fanks with keen glance want to build up life on ruin of man be bad foundation know believe that wish to get cousin into trouble be wrong must help louis to escape if must there may be necessity for have proved nothing against a yet hardly think that man who have committed crime must put down money to hunt out thereby lose benefit gained by wickedness garth believe sir louis be such guilty fool however will give opinion when see question mr jerusalem will tell cousin that be here certainly there be nothing to be gained by concealment only place honour in hand of jerusalem creature make accomplice however be ready to bet that sir louis know be here through mr prisom garth made reply stating that be weary went off to bed detective left alone thought over what have be told found unable to come to conclusion did not like way in garth be acting same believed that lawyer have ill intention towards cousin despite crate opinion to contrary young man laughed a thought how have picked up trail of garth when have be lost by astute crate be afraid that crate will never make success of detective business thought fanks lighting pipe agree with about garth agree with garth about sir louis certainly be strange that sir louis must have feigned illness shielded binjoy then have gone up to town on night what deuce be medical friend doing there dr turnor know believe that sir louis be alone with binjoy in great auk street house be odd to say least of wonder if negro be actual caesar binjoy sir louis in disguise at event be hersham for young man have exonerated clearly enough h be will reserve decision a to mr jerusalem story till see sir louis perhaps secret of crime be to be found at mere hall after said fanks getting on foot with emphatic stamp secret be connected with tattooed cross wonder who can tell about at moment a if in answer to query door opened mr prisom came in to clear away dinner thing a rule left duty to parlour maid a garth offshoot of great fellenger family be dining under roof must let one attend to looked surprised when saw that garth be not in room at once fanks explained absence of friend mr garth have retired to bed said a be very tired will go myself soon a country air make sleepy at present must like to have chat with mr prisom mr prisom smiled in expansive manner expressed honour felt at request adding that dearly loved chat better thought fanks a cleared away dish will be more likely to tell want to know in few minute table be tidy mr prisom at fanks request have brought in knitting guessed that must talk better with needle clicking in active hand herein judged wisely for thus employed mr prisom must gossip for hour provided have good listener suppose knew mother of mr garth said fanks plunging at once into history of fellenger family miss eleanor ah did be proud young lady did care to play with even a child because be daughter of steward be proud fellengers except sir francis be sir gregory father yes there be sir francis eldest merry one mr michael father of present baronet sir louis be proud too then miss eleanor who married mr garth liked sir francis best of concluded old lady with sigh there be look in eye a said made fanks think that have be in love with gay baronet in old day be bonny man sir francis fellenger resumed never maid what have smile for many kiss did take without asking laughed mr prisom oh be merry blade sailor have way be sir francis sailor asked fanks suddenly be captain in navy before came into title said mr prisom then settled down married miss darmer shropshire lady died poor soul when sir gregory be born be five week after death that sir francis be killed by being thrown from dog cart sir francis be sailor asked fanks abruptly suppose when went to sea came home middy have anchor ship true lover knot such like thing tattooed upon skin just have replied mr prisom laughing have quite fancy for sort of thing told learnt how to do in japan learnt how to do echoed fanks leaning forward in excitement yes yes very clever be at drawing such picture on skin will never forget how angered mother be when sir francis master francis be then insisted on pricking blue mark on arm did do demanded detective little expecting what must follow did sir mark of remains to day mr prisom drew up sleeve of left arm fanks bent forward saw tattooed thereon cross be then about to unravel mystery of tattooed cross have puzzled for so long chapter xxvii mr prisom story continued fanks restrained joy at important discovery be afraid lest mr prisom must cease to speak must think that revelation be of consequence to that must have same symbol a possessed by hersham a attempted on sir gregory appeared to hint at owning certain significance what significance might be now set to discover why did sir francis choose cross to tattoo on arm mr prisom asked a old lady pulled down sleeve can not say mr fanks fancy be because must draw cross better than anything else see be st catherine cross with four arm wheel at least be what sir francis called be st catherine cross said fanks recalling mark on hersham arm perhaps sir francis attached meaning to do know if tattooed anyone else with same symbol at remark mr prisom suddenly desisted from occupation not only refused to speak taxed fanks with trying to fathom meaning for ill purpose why must come down here ask question about sir francis fellenger asked with troubled look why do wish to know thing there be help for if fanks wished to learn truth must have to tell real purpose of visit then out of love for memory of sir francis might do what must to aid to discover person who have murdered sir gregory resolving to risk on casting of die spoke out boldly to point yet approached old lady with certain amount of caution have important reason for asking question said in earnest tone will tell reason shortly first say if regretted death of sir gregory regretted because be son of father did not care over much for be bad man mr fanks very bad man loved father a old playmate a one who be always kind to mine son ah mr prisom shook head sighed know that be murdered yes never found out who murdered be trying to find out now may be able to help to do so help said old lady in frightened tone who be sir name be fanks a know mr prisom what know be that be detective anxious to learn who killed sir gregory know nothing of murder sir be simple old body can not help in way oh yes can mr prisom can help by relating know about tattooing what can death of sir gregory have to do with old story of man treachery woman folly more than think whole secret of death lie in explanation of tattooing come mr prisom must tell know mr prisom thought for moment then made up mind will do what can said who be concerned in tale be dead gone so long a doe not hurt living see reason why must not gratify curiosity must ask not to repeat what tell unless be absolutely obliged to do so be good spreading family scandal a have appealed to to help to revenge murder of old playfellow son will confide in fanks assured mr prisom that must be a reticent a possible about forthcoming history must not use unless compelled to do so satisfied on point mr prisom commenced at same moment fanks took out note book to set down important point other person who be tattooed said mr prisom be madaline garry fanks whistled softly made note in book only thought struck explained madaline garry be also tattooed with cross yes sir madaline jane garry be daughter of old captain garry retired naval officer who lived in damington knew very well a used to meet on term of equality in parish work jane be quiet one madaline be flighty girl fond of admiration dress attracted attention of sir francis be thought at one time that must marry however did not do so brought home lady from shropshire to mere hall still madaline must have be fond of for let tattoo on arm cross similar to one of mine saw one day while be changing dress remarked said sir francis have pricked on arm a sign that be engaged to that be like wedding ring warned against sir francis mentioned lady of shropshire to whom be said to be paying address laughed at said sir francis must marry 'if doe ' added ' will know how to avenge ' did know that have cross on arm also oh yes told never expected to marry sir francis did harm ca say same of madaline acted badly towards say that sir francis be good man added mr prisom in hesitating manner be good to certainly must have married madaline garry did go about tattooing girl be in love with be not in love with rejoined mr prisom with dignity only let tattoo because be schoolgirl old playfellow knew better then madaline be grown woman when loved marked with cross suppose be to bind to not that did much good for shortly afterwards married miss darmer in rage at desertion madaline took up with old admirer luke fielding be name married almost on same day that sir francis led bride to hall did ever forgive said did replied mr prisom with hesitation have doubt of at event be stopping at hall within year of marriage how be well see sir in nine month after marriage mr fielding died leaving madaline with money little child about same time lady fellenger died at birth of dead sir gregory somebody be wanted a nurse madaline asked sir francis if must come be poor see wanted money although after death of husband be living with father at first sir francis must not let come feeling ashamed like doubt in way prevailed against went to hall a nurse to heir what about own child took also by permission of sir francis oh be child of madaline son yes son that of sir francis be born almost on same day insisted that son must come to hall also so sir francis agreed in end madaline garry nursed heir be late sir gregory did assented mr prisom till sir francis be killed a told five week after death of wife body be brought home buried almost immediately after funeral madaline disappeared with child be never heard of again have doubt that by time be dead how long ago be since disappeared asked fanks twenty eight year sir where child went know for have money poor soul be sorry for sister captain garry captain garry died soon after madaline be favourite child never held up head after disappeared when captain died miss jane went to relative in scotland heir sir gregory oh dr binjoy got nurse for fanks glanced up in astonishment dr binjoy repeated be here of course be sir replied mr prisom with slight shade of surprise be at birth of madaline child sir gregory afterwards when father of sir louis died asked dr binjoy to look after son who be sickly doctor agreed have be with sir louis ever since yet now be about to part seems strange doe sir said mr prisom ever since dr binjoy have be here with sir louis have got on badly think be chemistry kept together for character be quite unlike one like sir louis yes like dr binjoy not though have known for so many year be lover of madaline garry also must have nothing to do with be glad be leaving sir louis be binjoy friendly with sir gregory ca say sir think have much love for because be heir kept sir louis out of property oh doubt binjoy wanted sir louis to have property so that must get share of money think so sir said that dr binjoy be always very gay used to go to london to lead fast life who said that did ever go to taxton on thames mr jerusalem told know be housekeeper of late mr garth after death went to keep house for sir louis at taxton on thames when sir louis came in for property brought here be native of village oh yes be school friend of mine though never liked over much believe be in love with late mr garth at event be devoted to son wonder left to keep house for sir louis a poor young mr garth have money suppose have to do best must for in fanks opinion love of mr jerusalem for late mr garth explained why be so anxious to benefit son did not indicate why must hate sir louis mr prisom next word enlightened on point be more strange pursued mr prisom because mr michael father of sir louis treated mr jerusalem very badly yes almost a badly a sir francis did madaline garry wonder sir francis be not afraid that madaline garry must avenge for treatment said fanks now satisfied a to cause of mr jerusalem hatred for sir louis think be afraid replied mr prisom rising rolling up work ca explain what said to in other way what be said fanks eagerly be at hall one day shortly after death of lady fellenger said landlady saw in study be grieving greatly for death of wife also told how pleased be at birth of heir while be talking madaline entered spoke about something then nodded to went away a door closed after sir francis looked anxious 'nancy said turning to always called 'nancy said mr prisom in parenthesis said in flutter like 'if must chance a die anything go wrong about son remember that cross tattooed on arm if want further proof look in desk ' just then be interrupted did not say more never saw again added mr prisom with emotion for be brought home dead day week can understand what meant sir said mr prisom rising can only say from look gave door that be afraid of madaline what meant by cross desk know more than do be wrong in thinking madaline must harm child for be what thought be sure for went away week after death with own sir gregory grew into fine young gentleman though wild very wild after speech mr prisom exclaiming that be close on ten o'clock left room fanks sat meditating over strange history have heard far into night already saw connecting link between story of madaline garry tragedy of tooley alley chapter xxviii sir louis explains outcome of fanks midnight meditation be that resolved to devote entirely to following clue afforded by mr prisom story of tattooed cross dead father have chosen symbol of st catherine martyrdom for unknown purpose murdered son have perished while same emblem be being tattooed on arm for reason have wished to be marked in such way murderer have taken advantage of wish to inoculate blood of victim with deadly poison if then fanks must learn significance of cross might be able to fathom mystery of death question asked be whether must find out truth concerning cross in study of late sir francis warning dead man have given to mr prisom seemed strange to detective that be dictated by fear of madaline garry felt sure a have passed away have foregone vengeance must seem that warning be useless nevertheless fanks resolved to see desk referred to by mr prisom to search for evidence hinted at by sir francis also for reason of own reader may guess wired to hersham at fairview vicarage to seek explanation from father relative to cross tattooed on arm tale of reverend hersham might show why special symbol of sir francis be figuring on skin of young man who have nothing to do with fellengers mad freak after concluding first part of scheme by despatching letter fanks proceeded to second walked to mere hall to see desk referred to by mr prisom garth have refused to accompany detective to hall gave reason for such refusal be good going said wish to see cousin if a think know that be here there be longer reason why must stay in damington will go up to town by midday train leave to find out if have anything to do with crime well a know know great deal more besides think be necessary for to stay said fanks dryly will follow up clue afforded by malice of mr jerusalem return to town by mean if want anything to do just join crate in watching red star hotel in mr boazoph lie ill garth promised readily enough much to amusement of fanks a latter be simply throwing into society of crate in order to afford person chance of learning connection if of garth with crime be assured in own mind that garth be innocent be willing to afford crate innocent amusement by setting to find mare nest of own imagination when garth therefore departed fanks smiled in own quiet way went off to solve more difficult riddle awaited at mere hall when be nearing hall woman stepped out of gap in hedge almost in front of be dressed in black silk dress with lavender coloured shawl over shoulder wore also bonnet of grey velvet made quaker fashion close fitting over ear be not at dress that fanks looked be staring at most malignant countenance ever saw in life be pale thin lipped hair eye eyebrow be of light sandy hue have stealthy observant way with made fanks mistrust on instant like apparition arose from ground laid one thin hand on breast to detain one moment mr fanks said in perfectly unemotional voice must speak to before go to mere hall why must demanded fanks with stare how be know name mr garth told name errand oh cried fanks remembering garth excuse for retiring to bed on previous night so be mr jerusalem be name wish to tell wish to hear nothing said fanks roughly mr garth have business to speak about what be there between that must act in underhand way without telling said be going to bed last night instead of that sneak out see there be wrong replied mr jerusalem still without trace of emotion mr garth did not come to on contrary be who came to at inn while be talking to mr prisom came out of bedroom to see for few moment then went away why did not tell about meeting asked fanks angrily because asked not to wished to take by surprise if have heard of midnight visit might mistrust a be a be mistrust still well mr jerusalem will waive point know accuse sir louis of murder be to betray master whose bread eat that have sought meeting be just why be here be quiet reply hate master because father michael fellenger treated ill know about mr jerusalem ah said woman coldly see employed time with mr prisom to good purpose well can understand hate sir louis must gladly see francis garth sit in place for purpose have concocted story against sir louis have concocted story tell truth sir louis dr binjoy went up to london on night of murder although now pretend that one be ill other attended sent out of house on night suspected watched discovered do know why pair went up to london continued grasping fanks by arm to kill sir gregory do know why killed sir gregory to get money for scientific experiment do know how killed sir gregory ask about poisoned needle yes made use of scientific knowledge to slay man whose money wanted who put advertisement in paper ask mr boazoph know doe said fanks disgusted with malignity perhaps know about tattooed cross know about tattooed cross said mr jerusalem daresay madaline garry can tell madaline garry do know be still alive know be still alive see sir louis mr fanks said woman stretching out lean hand tear mask off lying face of dr binjoy who loved madaline garry ask where life what evil have worked with aid more fanks must have asked with sudden movement eluded detaining hand before must recover from astonishment be far down road to village gliding like evil shadow into sunny distance fanks thought of following on second thought pursued journey to hall sir louis binjoy first muttered afterwards mr jerusalem madaline garry despite belief in evidence of mr jerusalem be obviously dictated by malignant spirit caught wondering if be really right if after sir louis be guilty moment afterwards rejected idea a be incredible that sir louis must commit crime then offer reward for detection of assassin still fanks admitted to that if sir louis be not frank must find difficult to come to decision touching innocence guilt on sending in card at mere detective be admitted into study of sir louis fellenger here found not baronet old acquaintance dr renshaw who advanced boldly introduced a dr binjoy in place of wearing thick brown beard be clean shaven face looked young fresh coloured smooth for rest be a tall burly a ever a unctuous in speech to complete resemblance between doctor of tooley alley there lurked unmistakable look of anxiety in grey eye be impossible to think how hoped to deceive so clever man a fanks by so slight change in personal appearance evidently thought fanks knew nothing of truth for came forward with bland smile prepared to carry on comedy dear sir said binjoy with magnificent pompousness card be brought to sir louis have be busy in laboratory be rather untidy in consequence deputed to receive pray be seated fanks smiled slightly sat down while dr binjoy rendered uneasy by silence carried on difficult conversation presume mr fanks that have come to report doings to sir louis touching unfortunate death of friend predecessor in title may ask if have clue to assassin oh yes said fanks quietly will be pleased to hear dr binjoy have hope of arresting right man binjoy turned grey looked anything delighted indeed unprejudiced observer must have said that looked thoroughly frightened controlled so far a to falter out question a to name of guilty man fanks mentioned name of renshaw thereby reduced listener to state of abject terror renshaw be innocent sir said doctor tremulously must be here to defend be in india at present at bombay received letter from dated from aden how strange said fanks innocently dr turnor got letter from also binjoy saw that have over reached bit lip need discus renshaw no longer said coolly let talk of other matter till sir louis enters by mean said fanks let ask dr binjoy what be doing at dr turnor in great auk street on night of twenty first binjoy went pale again stammered out denial be not in town on night protested be attending on sir louis who be ill never left house at taxton on thames oh yes did went up with sir louis prove prove gasped binjoy with white lip can prove by mouth of mr jerusalem saw leave saw sir louis return alone lie lie be not lie know be time to have done with farce dr binjoy know who be know about impersonation disguise know why called renshaw traced to plymouth saw disembark followed to place now have binjoy stared wildly for moment at seeing mask of lie fall away from then sank back in chair with shiver moaning cry be lie lie be must gasp be not lie said voice at door fanks turned to see sir louis be not lie repeated baronet binjoy be renshaw went up with to town on night of twenty first if want to know who killed cousin mr fanks there be assassin chapter xxix dr binjoy protest silence ensued after astounding statement have be made by sir louis during time fanks narrowly observed personality of speaker baronet be tall rather stout young man with round face destitute of beard moustache be shabbily dressed in old tweed suit wore spectacle shoulder be slightly bowed a from constant bending over desk appearance be rather that of studious german than of young englishman fanks from hasty observation judged to be of sensible reflective nature man must not make so terrible accusation unless be able to substantiate on point binjoy arose to refute accusation of quondam pupil man said pointing unsteady hand at baronet be lying hate because know secret for preservation seek to destroy if fall fall also if be guilty be doubly so let speak admit that sin be mutual admit nothing of sort retorted sir louis coming forward tell story will tell mine mr fanks can judge between have better be careful louis said binjoy with attempt at bravado hold in hollow of hand will see said fellenger coldly be seated mr fanks before leave room will hear story decide a think best refuse to be accomplice of man longer louis implore fellenger turned deaf ear to voice of charmer sat down near fanks to whom addressed for sake of binjoy concealed truth out of pity for held tongue when strives to make accomplice in crime when attempt to blackmail by threatening to inform of doings on night of twenty first of june prefer to forestall let know worst of be listening to conversation sir louis said fanks be replied baronet coldly know what mr jerusalem think know how binjoy have be lying to be sick of living on verge of precipice over man housekeeper threaten to push at cost will hear truth so far a be able to tell to ask what question like mr fanks will answer when fail doubt worthy doctor there will come to aid shield if possible at expense will say nothing said binjoy wiping lip only desire be to save from consequence of falsehood wish harm just hear cried louis in mocking tone must believe that friend there threatened to blackmail last week by saying must denounce to police well binjoy here be representative of law can now speak give full power to do so binjoy did not accept challenge sat back in chair to listen to forthcoming conversation to defend if necessary well sir louis said detective have heard accusation denial of dr binjoy until hear story attach value to binjoy drew long breath of relief can defend said in defiant tone can prove to that louis lie will have ample opportunity of doing so replied fanks coldly in meantime will hear what sir louis have to say must begin at beginning said louis quietly that man binjoy be doctor in village of damington when father died leaving orphan for mother have died year before asked binjoy to look after have done so broke in binjoy be reward be reward for trying to blackmail said fellenger dryly did best to ruin to put bad thought into heart a to gregory wealth own poverty see here mr fanks added louis turning to detective be man of science be devoted to work wanted money title must not have lifted finger to obtain either did not like gregory be brutal wicked boy when be playmate together treated like dog never saw for year never corresponded treated other a relative for did not wish evil did not desire death least of did desire to rob of title land do believe sir fanks looked at open face of young man glanced at scowl rested on countenance of binjoy drawing own conclusion replied quietly believe sir louis proceed if please binjoy pursued louis be always lamenting be not owner of fellenger estate now that be hope to make pay large sum of money to purchase silence what doe threaten to accuse of said fanks of murdering cousin under disguise of negro caesar be innocent mr fanks a hope to prove to be trapped by man accomplice dr turnor ah murmured fanks while binjoy scowled be sure that ferret have something to do with matter of that will judge for said fellenger have heard of mithridates mr fanks detective be rather astonished at apparently irrelevant question having knowledge of ancient history said that have heard of monarch be king of pontus be who lived on poison exactly accustomed to taking poison for so long that in end most deadly have effect on always thought that be fable wanted to see if be right for purpose tried experiment on dog inoculated animal with weak poison gradually increased dose whether be successful doe not matter have nothing to do with story may tell with aid of binjoy prepared very powerful vegetable poison for final experiment with impregnated needle oh said fanks now be beginning to see be ordinary needle be not ordinary needle replied fellenger in first place be silver in second be hollow in third be filled with deadly vegetable poison of told prepared by dr binjoy prepared by of said binjoy savagely let take share of guilt be not guilty mr fanks can judge of for when tell what know retorted baronet well mr fanks prepared needle placed in case for least prick with meant death by blood poisoning intended to use on dog when animal be sufficiently saturated with weaker poison to admit of experiment being made may be sure sir be very careful of needle placed in cabinet dr binjoy have access to cabinet have not contradicted binjoy yes have possessed key a well a retorted sir louis sharply did not said doctor obstinate in denial lie binjoy found with opened one day day anne colmer be with be so angry oh anne colmer knew about needle said fanks ca say said fellenger while be living at taxton on thames miss colmer sometimes came to house be angry at binjoy for opening cabinet in presence a there be lot of dangerous drug in touched none of growled binjoy oh said fanks sharply then admit that showed miss colmer cabinet of poison binjoy scowled grew shade paler a saw that have over reached however said nothing lest must make bad worse with significant glance at fanks baronet resumed story one day in middle of june said fellenger found needle missing binjoy told have given to turnor did not say that exclaimed binjoy wrathfully said that missed one day when turnor be in laboratory thought that might have taken a proved did not know no more than who took will see said louis be ill at time when binjoy hinted that turnor have determined to go up to london get again rose from bed of sickness went up to london on evening of twenty first be necessary that must have gone up said fanks must not line to dr turnor have done probably preparation of poison be secret when heard that needle be in turnor possession be afraid lest must analyse preparation went up to town with binjoy post haste to recover again haste may appear strange to mr fanks know how jealous men of science be of secret at event went up to town that evening do deny that binjoy deny retorted binjoy gloomily mr fanks tracked to plymouth know that be renshaw do may ask dr binjoy why took false name binjoy pointed to friend be to save ungrateful man said in tragic voice when saw at red star found out that be sir gregory who have be murdered foresaw how might suspect a cousin of dead man mr boazoph sent for dr turnor came instead of leaving turnor with louis have be to red star before mr boazoph knew a renshaw wore false beard how be used to go up to london to enjoy said binjoy apologetically did not want rumour to creep down to taxton on thames concerning movement be why adopted false name disguise did know of said fanks turning to louis do now did not then said promptly when arrived in town went with binjoy to dr turnor house in great auk street turnor denied possession of needle shortly afterwards message came that landlady of red star wanted turnor must not let turnor leave room a felt sure that have needle thought that might make away with went in place have disguise on when went out of house put on outside explained renshaw alias binjoy did not tell secret a be always so straight laced might have objected to enjoying must certainly have objected to disguising going under name said louis coldly like such underhand doings did not know that went to red star a renshaw when came back have gone ah murmured fanks account why did catch house be not watched till binjoy came back did return to taxton on thames yes returned without needle turnor denied having felt very ill got into bed at once be mr jerusalem in house then yes binjoy a afterwards learned have sent out be part of trap wanted to make out have got rid of woman so must go up to town kill cousin when did hear of cousin death next day turnor came down said that binjoy must not return a be being watched by detective quite so turnor told about cousin death did then said that if did not hold tongue pretend have not left taxton on thames night must be in danger of being accused of crime what must do mr fanks saw danger held tongue yes said fanks can see why be afraid be in dangerous position be in trap retorted louis ca see mr fanks gregory be killed with poisoned needle have talked about needle to many people many scientific men knew be experimenting with be in turnor house at very time that crime be committed be thereby able to prove alibi indeed turnor told that needed money swore that must deny have be in house that must denounce a murderer of cousin if did not give cheque must hing be afraid circumstance be too strong for must have told police in face of turnor denial in face of binjoy treachery in luring into house at very time of murder dreaded lest must be arrested condemned on circumstantial evidence negro binjoy servant be smuggled off to bombay by binjoy to close trap more firmly on be lie said binjoy sent negro away to bombay to avert suspicion feigned voyage to plymouth for same reason ordered caesar to meet at plymouth sent to bombay in place know did said fanks doubt did that when lost in town after disembarked well see mr fanks said louis that be innocent held tongue lied about binjoy because be afraid of circumstantial evidence might be brought against thanks to binjoy turnor be in trap be at mercy have told because binjoy tried to blackmail last week now what do say say sir louis believe that have told truth be innocent of crime question be what doe dr binjoy say say that there be not one word of truth in whole story said doctor with scowl chapter xxx letter from hersham senior upon hearing untruthful obstinate denial of baronet story fanks wheeled round chair until directly faced that of binjoy at sullen creature looked sternly shook emphatic forefinger in face now look here dr binjoy renshaw choose to call said sternly believe that sir louis have spoken truth about matter have not least doubt that accomplice turnor lured into tooley alley crime with to belief have nothing to do laid trap fell into unluckily for for wise resolution to confess doings on night to have doubt that must have blackmailed did not want to blackmail said binjoy in low voice did not lure into trap on contrary when found out that be cousin who have be murdered did must to save to draw suspicion on to feigned voyage to plymouth made use of false name sent off caesar to bombay closed mouth of dr turnor what more must expect to do quite believe that did thing for why because wished to rivet chain more securely on victim when found that be in possession of property resolved to get money wanted out of in order to lead debauched life in town oh yes doctor quite believe changed name assumed disguise while in london did not wish that scampish renshaw of red star must be identified with respectable dr binjoy late of taxton on thames now of mere hall in hampshire can understand can understand that designed murder so sir louis must become possessed of money intended to spend did not design murder said binjoy in hoarse voice swear know who committed crime when be called in by mr boazoph be a ignorant a anyone gregory fellenger have be murdered only acted a did because saw how dangerous be that louis must be suspected be in neighbourhood lured there by did not lure there that must be at turnor house so near to tooley at time be quite accident be accident dr turnor came down to taxton on thames threatened to blackmail broke in louis know nothing of what turnor said did be

to come hear confession admit be afraid to speak before for villain have laid plan so skilfully be afraid tale must not be believed now scamp have be caught in own trap be glad of same be not sure that killed cousin why not circumstance seem to point to having done so doubt time ago thought have spotted person who have executed crime from opinion be not inclined to depart evidently binjoy know about affair possibly may be brought in a accessory before fact can see for that man be rank coward have fainted man of timid nature must be brave enough to commit so daring crime then face within hour of such commission sir louis have not yet caught assassin then why arrest binjoy because know who be guilty wish to force into confession just send servant with telegram will tell to ask if there

arrived at mere hall there be question of arresting guilty man binjoy be dangerously ill suffering from attack of brain fever what with doctor ill in country mr boazoph ill in town fanks began to grow uneasy if principal of case be rendered incapable of confession in manner did not see how be to arrive at solution of riddle be two day meditating over next move in game mr boazoph know something said fanks to dr binjoy know more if be ill incapable of confession what be to do there be answer to question later on detective hand be full in elucidating mystery of tattooing asked baronet if knew anything about fancy sir francis have for pricking cross on arm of woman whom loved never heard of said louis did not know much about uncle francis still le about cousin son gregory be afraid be singularly unamiable family mr fanks for seem to quarrel have quarrelled with garth not exactly get on well together used to come see at taxton on thames be afraid thought scientific prig indeed hinted so much fanks laughed at remembering how garth have made use of word attributed to by sir louis however did not explain reason of laughter asked baronet about madaline garry to also received denial sir louis knew nothing about lady connection with late sir francis thing be before time said shaking head if want to know about family secret ask mr prisom at inn believe be perfect book of anecdote regarding fellenger family have asked said fanks quietly told great deal not wish to know be there anyone else well there be mr jerusalem said sir louis have walked off intended to tell since referred to where have gone know on day met went off never came back ca say be sorry a feel from description bore ill will perhaps on account of way father treated must ask mr prisom to tell that story need to do replied fanks know that mr jerusalem hated be enough must have intended to bolt day met thought must have waited with amiable intention of assisting into trouble wish knew where have gone perhaps will come back let hope so now that binjoy be ill hate must like to know what can say about by way there be question wish to ask why be when be afraid of being implicated in crime that offered to supply money for to hunt down criminal well be binjoy idea see thought that have completely destroyed trail likely to bring across track so said must still further avert suspicion if offered that reward did so to tell honest truth if have not intended to confide in in order to stop blackmailing of messrs binjoy turnor must not have risked doing so by way be going to arrest atrocious little scamp not yet binjoy be ill can not have warned mr boazoph be in same plight will let wait have idea that be in danger when time come will pounce on if necessary though hope will not take fit also can get nothing out of binjoy mr boazoph while be ill may not need to do so may find out truth when letter come from hersham wish must come said fanks want to know why have same symbol on arm a on arm of mr prisom madaline garry speak a if madaline garry be still alive mr jerusalem say be be why want to trace mr jerusalem might help to learn where can find madaline garry clue to mystery of cross lie with else added fanks be hidden in desk of late sir francis remember told parting word to mr prisom two day after long expected letter came from hersham not only from one from father be enclosed also content caused fanks surprise yet half expected to read what did be beginning to guess mystery filled dr binjoy mr boazoph with such fear after must be able to discover truth without although testimony must be necessary to confirm dear fanks wrote hersham when read enclosed will be astonished a be have not yet recovered from shock of learning truth a will see mystery of tattooed cross be greater one than ever can give assistance be told in enclosed letter particularly asked to be written for can not say if will solve tooley alley riddle have certainly invested life with mystery will not rest until solve can write more for head be in whirl tell what think of enclosed believe ted hersham a suppose may still sign enclosed be letter from rev george hersham to effect that ted be not son that be relation to be bachelor wrote mr hersham adopted ted from motif of pity desire to cheer lonely life nearly twenty eight year ago poorly clad woman came to door be starving carried infant in arm gave succour procured work after time grew restless wished to go away in time have become fond of child in end offered to adopt to consented rather to surprise though indeed did not seem at time very much attached to babe however gave child went away with little money have given afterwards received letter from in london then stopped writing for year have never heard anything about child now son ted be marked with cross on left arm when adopted woman never told why have be so tattooed knew nothing of woman history save that name be madaline garry chapter xxxi secret be revealed on receipt of mr hersham letter fanks sought out sir louis showed communication have told baronet that have heard from mr prisom for without permission must not hope to examine desk of late sir francis if did not do so must not be able to discover secret of tattooed cross therefore for gaining of end also with belief in fellenger good sense made confidant finally placed letter in hand louis read carefully knowing have gone before understood partially nevertheless be puzzled a to real meaning of affair looked to fanks for explanation what do think of asked fanks when baronet gave back letter in silence can understand think be very difficult to understand said fellenger with shrug of shoulder madeline garry went from isle of wight be starving met with good samaritan who took in afterwards sought london left child behind to be adopted that child be friend edward hersham story be plain enough be so far a have related have cross of st catherine tattooed on arm why must child of madaline garry be marked in way perhaps uncle marked child seemed to have have passion for tattooing why must sir francis mark child of fielding there be something so significant in tone of detective sir louis looked at intently what saw in face prompted next remark think hersham be illegitimate do asked indeed be opinion returned fanks why be sir francis afraid of madaline garry because have done wrong why did marry fielding almost on same day that uncle married miss darmer why did sir francis tattoo child with favourite cross answer to question be to mind to be found in fact that child of madaline garry be also child of sir francis fellenger feel convinced that hersham be half brother of man who be murdered at tooley alley seems likely assented louis nursing chin with hand how can establish truth of statement there be two way one be by asking binjoy may know a be in attendance at birth of gregory at of hersham may tell truth a be delirious there be chance of getting information from second way be to find out madaline garry force to own up only person who know where be be mr jerusalem who have vanished if find mr jerusalem may find other woman at present be impossible also quite impossible see what can do do remember what mr prisom said about desk in study of late uncle yes alluded to secret in connection with desk be to be used for benefit of gregory must madaline garry attempt to revenge exactly well must examine desk fancy sir francis dreading anger of woman whom have wronged wrote out full account of sin of reason why tattooed cross on arm of child if can find paper sir francis plainly hinted be in desk may discover why cousin be murdered can not conceive what mean will know soon enough replied fanks trifle sadly have very shrewd idea of what will be outcome of search if thing be a think will not be long before run down assassin of sir gregory have instinct more than instinct that clue to mystery have eluded so long be about to be placed in hand will be pleased for own sake will be sorry for yours why what do mean understand explain mr fanks replied fanks shaking head may be wrong wish to cause unnecessary pain let examine desk if be wrong better for worse for case if be right have rather learned truth without intervention come sir louis let seek study of late uncle do know where be oh yes said sir louis leading way have be shut up since death know cousin be not man of book so did not use a for be always in laboratory in old wing if sir francis left secret paper in desk will be there still unless added louis with afterthought unless be taken away by woman feared if paper have given madaline garry power to revenge on heir of old lover must have used power then mr prisom might have interfered by acting on last request of sir francis nothing of have happened so be sure that if paper be in desk will find if find will learn truth about tattooed cross consequently discover motive prompted murder of cousin after speech detective went with sir louis to study of late sir francis fellenger sir louis unlocked door entered into long disused room have be shut up for many year atmosphere be dusty musty with chill smell of decay fanks opened shutter strong sunlight poured into apartment illumined dusty carpet on foot made mark gleamed on old fashioned furniture cumbersome comfortless such a be used in early day of victorian era to satisfaction of detective revealed mahogany escritoire drawer pigeon hole brass handle key massive rusty be still in lock louis turning over with harsh creak threw open heavy sheet of mahogany covered writing cloth be lined with dingy green cloth ink stained dusty on there rested paper pen ink evidently paper have be arranged before desk have be closed left to many year solitude fanks bent down unlocked drawer one after other contained nothing mass of newspaper everyone of examined carefully without finding writing referring to cross there be also bundle of old letter musty account ancient record of ship store diver expense doubtless remnant of fellenger naval day in drawer found sea shell seaweed mounted on cardboard while willow repository contained picture small chart nowhere must discover paper to sir francis have referred in last long conversation with mr prisom well be not in of said fanks rising with look of disappointment wonder where can be perhaps there be secret drawer suggested sir louis be not unlikely doubt paper must be hidden in such receptacle out of fear of woman believe be right sir louis let look for secret drawer if there be one will find have be at sort of work before have idea how to go about fanks made vain boast for after hard search of hour more after sounding with knuckle measuring with tape stumbled across hiding place contrived in thickness of wood at back of desk herein be paper yellow with age fanks drew slowly out for be so fragile with time that thought must crumble in hand carrying to strong light of window read carefully while sir louis waited for revelation of content face of detective paled when read glanced pityingly at baronet when finished perusal be paper hoped to find said slowly clear up most important point of case told mr fellenger that content must give pain read for why do call mr fellenger asked louis quietly will find answer to question in paper replied fanks passed to baronet after pause sharp glance at detective fellenger took thin yellow sheet read slowly be what read in faded handwriting of sir francis have deceived madaline garry be father of child born to about same time that heir gregory be born madaline wished to marry for reason need not explain here be unable to do so married luke fielding be supposed to be father of child be not so boy be mine when wife died madaline insisted on coming to hall nursing gregory for obvious reason must not refuse must have revealed truth have disgraced family have not yielded to wish came to hall with own child nursed that of late wife be afraid that must change child so that son must enjoy what rightfully belonged to half brother be twice nearly sending away on account of fear threatened to disgrace by revealing truth so let stay to avert danger one night tattooed on left arm of son gregory cross of st catherine have already tattooed on arm of madaline of nancy prisom must child be changed die truth can be ascertained by tattooed cross child marked with cross be son heir gregory fellenger other be brother edward son of myself madaline garry hope in way that will prevent madaline from revenging on a feel sure intends to do signed francis luddham fellenger on reading extraordinary document louis felt room whirl round be fain to be seated fanks turned silently towards received back paper paper robbed young man at one sweep of title property louis recovered smiled faintly understand said in low tone sir gregory enjoyed title estate wrongfully hersham be rightful heir yes madaline garry fulfilled vengeance put child in place of real heir after death of sir francis took away son of lady fellenger be why came to hall to be nurse wanted child to enjoy property owing to tattooing father being alive must not change child when sir francis be killed did so therefore secured title for son now understand why parted so readily with hersham so that must be adopted by vicar of fairview be not child that of rival in affection of sir francis can see so can added fanks with hesitation can guess how discovery affect certainly replied louis calmly will have to give property up to cousin who now go by name of hersham assure will not mind loss so much a seem to think a told care nothing for money everything for science oh believe mr fanks be quite content to surrender title estate go back to taxton on thames a plain louis fellenger can contest matter will not contest matter believe that paper to be true found together proved beyond doubt by evidence of cross tattooed on hersham left arm that be rightful sir gregory owner of estate let have will not raise one finger to prevent enjoying what be rightfully own besides like hersham a may still call be good fellow used to meet at taxton on thames let marry anne colmer take up position will make much better baronet than left room went downstairs again to library in there louis asked fanks question have be in mind for time say mr fanks said what make say that tattooed cross clear up mystery of tooley alley well said fanks someone must have known story have told to sir gregory be why allowed cross to be tattooed on arm see why person who told story assured that only chance have of keeping property be to be tattooed with mark sir francis said be on arm of real heir oh understand now who be person who told sir gregory secret of cross tattooed on arm ah said fanks tell name of person will tell assassin of son of madaline garry who wrongfully bore title name of sir gregory fellenger chapter xxxii mr boazoph tell truth immediately after great discovery fanks received letter from garth informing that mr jerusalem be in london located at red star mr boazoph said writer be much better be now permitted to leave bed rather fancy to disappointment of turnor must want to get information out of mr boazoph now be time to do so result of communication be that fanks resolved to go at once to town interview landlady see want to get something out of mr boazoph said to louis want to tell who killed sir gregory do think know that think have known along retorted fanks can take from fellenger recognised negro when entered hotel on night for reason mean to discover have held tongue intend to force to reveal name by threatening to arrest hersham in event of refusing to speak will tell in order to save hersham think so for more reason than one see fainted when told must prove crime against young man may be that know how hardly have be dealt with by madeline garry therefore may be anxious to save further trouble how must learn story of madeline garry changing of child objected fellenger from anne colmer who must have learned from dr binjoy believe be at bottom of whole affair say that killed gregory can tell who did how can prove well person who killed gregory must have known that story of changing of child so a to induce to let cross be tattooed on arm dr binjoy must have told that person dr binjoy must have supplied that needle dr binjoy friend be at bottom of whole devilish affair forget madeline garry might have told murderer about changing of child think so madeline must not have be likely to reveal anything detrimental to son on face of must not have obtained access to poisoned needle suspect binjoy a accessory before fact will see mr jerusalem force to tell where to find madeline garry though to be sure have pretty good notion of where to find a be what do know who madeline garry be think so speech of mr prisom put on track may be wrong so will say nothing a yet be clever in guessing thing mr fanks perhaps can tell who killed gregory well said fanks looking straight at questioner might even go a far a know for certain who be assassin have shrewd notion will have doubt set at rest on point when see woman in town will interview mr boazoph take down confession make sign will act in same way with binjoy with anne colmer with robert valet of dead man with turnor accomplice of medical friend do think be in be more than certain be said fanks in confident tone well mr fellenger will come up with see last act of comedy will stay here with mr crate keep eye on dr binjoy must write befalls at red star do really think that will find truth in house be certain of believe tragedy will end a began in red star in tooley alley hope will go a wish added fanks with gloomy air have have end of trouble with case although think see daylight at last must not be too confident whole proving of theory lie with mr boazoph having thus settled plan fanks left crate at mere hall to look after dr binjoy repaired to town immediately on arrival took place about noon sent for garth questioned concerning mr jerusalem having received satisfactory reply entrusted special commission to lawyer with detective went to red star short conversation with fanks so astonished garth that went on errand have to do with such conversation in state of great surprise little nervousness at red star fanks inquired for mr jerusalem be confronted by dr turnor ferret looked rather disconcerted a detective appeared tried to dissuade from seeing mr boazoph a wished to do be yet weak urged think will be wise of to talk with a yet care how weak be said fanks grimly intend to talk to to too what can have to say to demanded turnor with attempt at bravado will tell that after have seen mr boazoph mr jerusalem be reply know doings on night of twenty first dr turnor be aware of attempt to blackmail sir louis fellenger after speech fanks went upstairs to room occupied by mr boazoph at door met with mr jerusalem looked at in expressionless way spoke in usual cold unemotional manner first question be of fanks visit to mere hall did find out truth sir asked found out truth not particular truth wished for replied fanks who disliked woman immensely master be not guilty then who be guilty if be not will reveal that in few moment mr jerusalem may tell know about madaline garry tattooed cross also about mr louis fellenger woman drew back for first time since fanks have known expression of surprise flitted across face said mr louis said to herself how much doe know know most of circumstance led to murder in house retorted fanks moving towards door now with assistance be about to learn rest at event truth will be bad for louis fellenger muttered mr jerusalem if be to benefit must not move step a be added throwing open door come in mr fanks ask mr boazoph to tell story related to morning fanks nodded without saying word entered apartment in spite of warm weather there be fire burning in grate beside crouched mr boazoph be seated on carpet warming thin hand at blaze turned face a detective entered be astonished at change wrought in by illness face be lined drawn with pain hair be falling about ear in rough mass looseness of dress showed how emaciated have become poor creature be shadow of notorious woman who have defied police for so long at first glance fanks saw that death be written on haggard face if there be anything to be learned from wreck there be time to be lost in hearing nemesis have claimed at least one victim for death of sir gregory fellenger rather edward fielding have come here to see die mr fanks asked mr boazoph with faint smile hope be not so bad a replied fanks gently for pitied exhaustion of poor creature may get better mr boazoph shook head think not said quietly end be coming fast care life have be none so happy that must wish to live be anxious to die be anxious to make reparation for crime with start mr boazoph looked at other woman who still stood at door what have told asked in hoarse voice have told nothing replied mr jerusalem coldly know be impossible muttered mr boazoph with shiver can not know who be there to tell be told by dead dead what dead by dead lover on whose son avenged betrayal mr bryant shivered looked up angrily not that name be not mr bryant can give name if like said fanks pointedly will say mr fielding madaline garry woman rose to knee with effort parting tangled mass of grey hair looked at fanks in terrified manner madaline garry be dead said in low voice died when married luke fielding neglect
