will exactly will from what say feel convinced that knowledge applies to lady staunton fortune see what come of not being frank with enistor be fool believe what say a please doe not matter to except added with emphasis that make hold over more secure what do mean by poor friend narvaez glanced back from door towards have walked slowly be losing what little power have obtained since can not read mind why mean that with five thousand year might not be inclined to give daughter in marriage a poor man be forced to do so seems to said enistor angrily that in case must do so if wish to learn danger threatens a well a why be true be clever in saying that perhaps possible loss of money be danger danger be greater one than loss of money have to do with life life in chaldea with adversary with unknown man who be coming to take part in drama of repayment have feeling said narvaez passing hand across brow that curtain rise on drama with loss of money believe lucy will cheat cried enistor desperately wait until to morrow post said narvaez significantly will find be true prophet bargain of marriage with alice must continue on present basis a want of money will still prevent becoming independent might suggest added opening door that forbid daughter to see too much of young hardwick might fall in love with must in great measure destroy clairvoyant power will be of use to of then good night when sleep will meet a usual on other plane narvaez departed chuckling for disagreeables befalling others always amused be absolutely without heart without feeling since for age in various body have worked hard to rid of humanity enistor be on same evil path a yet be human enough to worry over inevitable until slept did best to convince that narvaez spoke falsely failed utterly in attempt chapter iii fulfilment next morning enistor be gloomy apprehensive for have slept very badly during hour of darkness tried to persuade that spaniard prophesied falsely inward feeling assured that be not case before sun set be convinced against inclination that sinister prediction must be fulfilled therefore picked up morning letter nervously quite expecting to find legal one stating lady staunton be dead have left five thousand year to stranger fortunately for peace of mind there be letter of kind made better breakfast than might have done same be morose sullen so that alice have anything pleasant time towards end of meal relieved feeling by scolding girl forbid to see much of young hardwick declared imperiously be in love with wish to marry pauper painter aware that father wished to accept narvaez must have be wise for girl to have held tongue since later confession of feigned engagement to artist be sole chance of resisting loveless marriage enistor be one of people who invariably drew what be worst in person to surface answered prematurely mr hardwick proposed yesterday refused therefore can see a much of a want to without running risk of becoming wife enistor ignored latter part of reply proposing to deal with later refused why may ask be not man want for husband doe not complete be then incomplete sneered enistor scornfully to mind woman man must be incomplete until true marriage take place what be true marriage silly girl marriage of soul pooh pooh that foolish affinity business be foolish queried alice sedately appears to to be great truth

of nervousness laughed outright be woman enough to see that don pablo only adores want hostess to sit at foot of table entertain friend have use for wife a to wealth must sooner be happy with pauper than with millionaire provided loved silly romance silly romance perhaps be be view enistor frowned still more darkly a saw very plainly that frail a be must not hope to bend to will in way must not explain girl baffled powerful personality yet be necessary that must become wife of narvaez if danger old man hinted at be to be known conquered alice listen to said man entreatingly be very poor don pablo be very rich if marry will soon be wealthy widow a can not live long then with money will be able to restore fortune of family marry whomsoever desire be sensible refuse to sacrifice to loveless marriage for sake said alice doggedly standing up like weak lily against force of tempest love father have never loved so why be not going to argue point with longer stormed enistor rising hastily will force to marry don pablo in case will marry julian hardwick ask to protect said girl rising in turn shaking white sullenly determined protect who can protect against can deal with hardwick with in way little dream of what can do to mr hardwick know said girl steadily can not harm in way can compel else must long ago have used boasted power be aware that be speaking to father demanded enistor astonished at daring perfectly wish to be good daughter to father in matter concern whole life must decline to yield either to command prayer enistor must have struck pale face in wrath sensitive to invisible thing became aware that there be barrier around kept at arm length knew instinctively that powerful influence pervading room have to do with unknown individual whom narvaez called adversary felt that be not prepared to measure strength against force so uncomfortable daunted did feel that one desire be to leave room began to back towards door alice be astonished to see perspiration beading father forehead watched departure in dismay unaware of what be taking place looked upon withdrawal a declaration of war believed with truth that must have to suffer for opposing resistance to marriage with narvaez yet still held out a felt singular sense of security same power weakened enistor strengthened not being trained occultist wondered how must dare to face father so boldly will talk to later breathed enistor with effort so hostile be atmosphere meanwhile may a well know that if decline to become don pablo wife will ruin squire be title a owner of polwellin village left obstinate daughter in room went to library be own particular domain here opposing influence did not follow sitting down heavily began to breathe more freely wondered why have be so craven a to fly from field of battle although have be anxious life to acquire forbidden lore have only learned something of practical side of occultism since arrival of three year ago ancient sinner be accomplished in black art for own end be willing to impart something of knowledge to enistor considerable amount of sinister teaching have be given to squire a yet be neophyte ignorant of many thing narvaez withheld much purposely a be keenly aware of enistor powerful will unscrupulous greed for power spaniard did not so much desire to instruct host a to make use of servant of christ who walk on right hand path be possessed entirely by spirit of love be only too anxious to teach to ignorant that may be capable of assimilating brother of shadow be too inherently selfish to be generous merely give out sufficient knowledge to render pupil useful servant docile slave narvaez have intention of cultivating enistor latent power to such strength that might be dangerous to consequently although man be on threshold of power have not yet crossed therefore be unable to deal with force in dining room strength of must not calculate to influence alice to work for self in way must lure from behind barrier

master must have be ignominiously driven from dining room in same way have be present of course enistor did not wish to injure daughter in way at world must look askance merely desired to make loveless marriage so a to acquire wealth of narvaez so that might be educated in clear seeing for purpose of averting possible danger what that danger might be enistor did not know so far a must guess don pablo be equally ignorant therefore be absolutely necessary that latent clairvoyant power of girl must be brought to surface trained if safety of black magician pupil be to be assured enistor be aggressively selfish to save be ready to sacrifice daughter dozen human being if necessary to dark power body fortune honour must not be injured a enistor very well knew soul must be in danger for however cared nothing better that girl must perish than that must be balked of daring ambition did not intend to surrender alice to don pablo unless price be paid price included unlimited wealth

staunton so that might still desire to leave money with visualised image in mind eye be sending powerful thought to sick bed insisting that only must benefit by will ignorant person must have laughed at idea of one being so controlled from distance enistor knew perfectly well what be doing made ardent use of unholy telepathy later when footman announced that lady staunton solicitor mr cane desired

delivered explanation standing mr montrose be young scotchman poor handsome clever be poet journalist who life in bloomsbury garret ambitious of literary fame eighteen month ago saved lady staunton life when horse bolted in hyde park stopped at risk of limb prevented serious accident silly as muttered enistor if lucy have died then money must have come to go on appalled by crudely evil speech cane started back be man demon mr enistor can ask riddle when have delivered message though to be sure said enistor sitting down there be little need handsome young pauper paid court to sister who be always weak silly sham heroism good look effusive compliment worked on feeble mind made heir be right lady staunton made mr montrose heir certainly said cane shutting up little black bag putting on hat to leave description of new client be wrong doe not flatter one heroism be not sham be sister feeble minded very clever woman ended enistor sharply being so became prey of adventurer well mr cane now that have delivered message can go will be obliged if will send one thousand pound a soon a possible oh certainly cried cane eagerly enistor saw why spoke so agreeably think that by taking one thousand pound condone testament of lady staunton perhaps be right have more string to bow than one have be infamously treated will have revenge can not revenge on sister who be dead said cane rebukingly to punish mr montrose who be perfectly innocent of harming must not be act of christian ah see be nothing so feeble minded a christian be then cane stared wronged man who intends to be revenged will protect client cried lawyer vigorously naturally fee will be larger if do protect at cost of character will be worse for own be not afraid indeed be horribly afraid however need faint on doorstep a must be inconvenient good day trap be waiting cane got away at once quite convinced that enistor be not wholly in right mind rosy cheek be pale a drove away courage be dashed by enistor unscrupulous threat be dangerous thought lawyer must hold tongue did chapter iv plotting prophecy of narvaez must have softened blow to enistor in moment of fulfilment did not for simple reason that have tried best to disbelieve spaniard in spite of knowledge of man power don pablo a result of prying beyond boundary of visible possessed in active working super sens latent in ordinary man so must literally see through brick wall certainly vision be not invariably clear at time detail of prognostication be incorrect in present instance have foretold that enistor must receive bad news by letter whereas mr cane have come down personally to convey disagreeable intelligence actual fact that enistor must lose money have be proved beyond doubt squire found one undeniable truth so unpleasant that be careless about minor mistake a soon a cane without bite sup have driven away in direction of perchton enistor made way across moor to back country where narvaez have abode be impossible that must keep knowledge of bad fortune to moreover wanted advice with regard to future action squire be clever a men go usually decided matter for in instance be necessary to consult mastermind don pablo be not only shrewd highly educated man versed in knowledge of world also possessed super physical information be dangerous useful be lore be dangerous to who did not posse spirit of love useful to unscrupulous wholly selfish man enistor master thought only of be prepared to crush without remorse stood in way at present moment unknown montrose be obstacle in enistor path wished narvaez to assist in removal spaniard must only give service if saw that use must benefit a squire knew that wily old man wished to remain poor in order to retain mastery over be not likely that must help to gain fortune enistor therefore be not certain that must be aided more for sake of talking free of care than for other reason sought cottage of magician don pablo abode be really truly four roomed cottage where lived along with simple minded old cornish woman of sixty who attended to few want enistor knew that narvaez be immensely rich wondered why must live so penuriously humbly man be almost wholly devoid of desire for thing mankind covets ate drank sparingly cared nothing for society dress be plain neat be too much taken up with study to entertain narvaez a neighbour soon found out be consumed by passion for power not that kind of power be displayed openly by royalty politician merchant prince secret power sway destiny of individual nation without apparent sign for studied day night crossed constantly boundary between world visible invisible obtained physical benefit from exercise of such command passion of hidden sovereignty satisfied soul be cared about have long since risen above sphere wherein virtue vice of men dispute pre eminence lived above healthy necessary turmoil of ordinary life to reign in solitude a cold calm intellectual merciless tyrant doing evil because gratified disobeyed law of love be giving isolated in kingdom of own desire for rule have cut off from great empire of god sole connection with men woman be to destroy protecting will make slave to whim in way acted with regard to enistor else must not have taught man anything about dark magic narvaez knew well that enistor possessed of a fierce unscrupulous nature a own almost a powerful will must never be slave consequently be obliged to act cautiously in association with enistor if became too learned in forbidden lore might well become don pablo rival to dispute bad sovereignty spaniard loved a matter of fact narvaez must not have meddled with cornish squire at that knew that common danger menaced enistor through daughter might avert narvaez be clever powerful wholly given to self worship be by mean omnipotent at time be necessary to defend position thus by offer to teach enistor how to realise ambition managed to make man more le obedient there be always danger of revolt must enistor learn too thoroughly law of invisible world interpenetrates visible don pablo however be content with position of affair a pupil be not yet strong enough to measure sword before be spaniard hoped to secure end leave enistor in lurch cottage be of grey stone clumsy rugged looking habitation set on side of purple clothed hill beside grass grown lane meandered down valley on slope of hill be many disused mining shaft with huge mound of earth ruined building beside hilltop have be roman camp boundary must still be defined in centre amongst many gigantic stone be sacrificial altar of druid with groove cut in hardness so that blood of victim might stream to ground alice never liked unholy hill a be sensitive enough to feel influence clung round narvaez have established home beside miniature mountain because on moonless night must perform uncanny ceremony on altar be given over to dark power worshipped propitiated enistor have likewise taken part in sacrilegious doings shivered at memory of certain thing when sighted sinister grey monolith crowned hill great a be courage be not entirely proof against deadly influence of evil being who haunted place although in lesser degree than narvaez must compel to service by performing certain rite enistor be ushered into don pablo study by housekeeper brown faced cheery old woman too simple minded to understand master weird power apartment be of great size limited space be sparsely furnished there be only table served a desk two chair well filled bookcase ponderous iron safe wherein narvaez stored what valuable have by wall be draped with dull red cloth floor oddly enough be covered with black carpet effect be menacing impressive when visitor entered fire place wherein large log flamed faced while opposite one window looking out on to hilltop be closed door leading to sealed apartment don pablo allowed one to enter into save pupil across passage be dining room together with tiny kitchen bedroom for housekeeper at back cottage be placed in disorderly uncultivated garden surrounded by loosely built stone wall there be upstairs house being roofed with slate covered with moss presented sombre appearance in greyness resembled huge toad squatting amongst heather how can bear fire on hot day asked enistor throwing into vacant chair speaking irritably be in kind of humour seek outlet for relief be spaniard irrelevant reply how often have told that be necessary for to get complete command of temper have fire because body occupy just now be nearly worn out requires artificial heat to sustain why get new one demanded visitor still crossly day will rejoined narvaez significantly at present one serf tolerably well control thoroughly manage yours properly be master enistor ah have much to learn have reason to be cross one have reason to be cross to lose one temper simply show that one be not yet free from ordinary human limitation however at stage of learning excuse be hard to lose large income a have done what know not by super physical mean enistor said narvaez coolly leaning back in chair walked to top of hill with field glass saw that have visitor a so few people come here be only logical on part to assume that man be messenger sent to tell of lady staunton death own loss well news did not come in letter a prophesied snapped enistor be not pope to be infallible said don pablo dryly matter be so trivial that did not examine into thing sufficiently to be entirely certain of detail trivial to not to said squire gloomily nonsense possession of income be only delayed have not lost altogether enistor looked up sharply did make invisible third at interview with cane don pablo shrugged aged shoulder do think have nothing to do to waste time in way only say that will regain money because will assist to get must have price even though be temporary one what do mean by temporary asked enistor unpleasantly one who work for money earthly fame earthly power have to surrender what gain when death come who labour to acquire super physical power a do power can dominate men without knowing get what can never lose however many death life will work for later master at present require money so a to take proper position in world sway men at will limited ambition scoffed narvaez however what desire will acquire a wo let have daughter without price must do something for nothing don pablo said magician honestly take what want if be strong enough to do so otherwise buy what require nothing for nothing something for something if there be other way of getting be rule be rule of majority of mankind true friend chuckled narvaez settling comfortably mankind have long way to travel before law of love be learned law of love give ask return think of how dull life must be then enistor however have argued enough time be valuable what about interview with lawyer must have detail if be to assist enistor looked at master with sneer must have thought that man with power must have known everything without requiring explanation if have be worth while must have made acquainted with took place said other man blandly affair interest save necessity of paying price well squire looked again at narvaez time with gloomy distaste be often borne in upon how entirely selfish don pablo be by time knew beyond question that who take left hand path be forgetful of save enistor must scarcely blame narvaez for owning quality be almost a highly developed in own nature might be right be rule of black magic survival of fittest be sole way to attain supremacy enistor have fully committed to worship of own being yet there be sufficient good in to struggle at time against isolating power of selfishness however be worse than useless to argue away accepted fact so swallowed anger quietly detailed have taken place hum said narvaez smoothing wrinkled face when last word be spoken have made task more difficult than be necessary in what way scowled squire who disliked correction in several way be serene response idea of threatening cane be good one have called to assistance must have worked along line man from what say be weak power added to yours must have secured destruction of second will substitution of first then must have got money without trouble by weakening in attack have simply turned cane into enemy wo dare to say anything if be what mean be not what mean enistor of course since lawyer like caesar wife must be above reproach cane will not speak lest must accuse of offering to suppress second will doe much matter point be that have at disadvantage did not press point well directed thought must have brought to house must have compelled man to yield be not so sure of that be honest what doe matter asked don pablo opening eye contemptuously honest not must have obsessed to degree that must have committed too far to retreat of course if be guarded control must have effected nothing adversary only protects alice in instance must not have interfered yet narvaez suddenly looked round a though aware of new influence might have prevented exercise of power be necessary for money to go to montrose so that chaldean drama must be played out in set of life be montrose other man spoke of at dinner last night don pablo threw up hand to compel silence closed eye to shut out world of sense listened intently a did so face grew dark angry defy defy said vehemently addressing invisible person a appeared to enistor plot a will can counterplot then be silent for moment opening eye lowered hand adversary said quietly to guest still looked fierce be aware of scheme say will not succeed if can prevent success well will pit strength against adversary then be not absolutely certain of success asked enistor because man have free will if montrose alice be guided by adversary task will indeed be difficult if can make stumble game will end in favour a said enistor loss of money be beginning of drama can see for because by going to montrose brings on to stage yet added narvaez with furious gesture have called in to deal with lawyer might have suppressed second will have prevented montrose coming into matter adversary told just now that must have intervened also cane being weak having free will a men have must not have stood out against domination well said enistor gloomily seems that owing to ignorance folly interrupted other sharply folly if will then owing to ignorance folly have lost first move in game what now narvaez shrugged must take roundabout way instead of going by direct path be closed by not pressing advantage with cane now montrose will obtain money very good can retain until get back from to give to money be rightfully mine cried enistor vehemently come what may intend to gain will never gain if bluster fume in way said don pablo coldly keep temper self control will soon be at grip with adversary be mean antagonist assure well master what be to be done leave in hand must assist otherwise narvaez considered for few moment think will be best to send alice to london for few month time of stay will depend upon chance of falling in love with montrose enistor jumped up stamped doe know montrose declared in angry manner will never know if can help be unable to help said narvaez frigidly karma of chaldea be bound to bring montrose alice together much be sure of although be ignorant of detail well let carry war into enemy camp enistor with thousand pound inherit give alice few month in london on plea that requires gay life to cheer up will meet montrose will fall in love with be certain of a fate fate be intermingled then can give consent to marriage what about desire to marry alice interrupted squire much puzzled that can be gratified later said don pablo coolly see what mean enistor when alice desire to marry montrose will naturally invite proposed son in law here to acquaint with character once be on spot narvaez smiled cruelly drew deep breath think can safely leave to what will do never mind have plan in head may may not succeed there be need to tell what be will see result work be to send alice to london quite understand said enistor trying to read master thought in vain will obey instruction if alice be to meet montrose in society fear will be difficult to induce to go out for enjoyment so soon after aunt death oh montrose a heir of lady staunton will feel same way be not necessary for two to meet at public function quiet evening here little dinner there introduction be accomplished need not trouble about detail enistor accumulated result of good evil call karma will bring together be willing to surrender alice see oh dear montrose can make love to until be in net afterwards when money come to montrose come to gallows alice can be wife gallows mean mean nothing at present interrupted narvaez impatiently ca fight battle with squirt montrose be in path mine so have to be removed mean may be unpleasant will not harm in way assure of emphatically will harm alice only through affection not otherwise what heap of scruple have enistor sneered old man one must think be school girl instead of grown man care for montrose for daughter not at admitted enistor selfishly same murder oh if word frightens call blood atonement restitution of fortune may be managed without sacrifice of montrose life if will insist upon silly weakness if wish to tread left hand path enistor must get rid of scruple trample on one slay ruin devastate a stronger have right to do so squire winced at abominable teaching although in innermost heart subscribed to after a thought in world of to day weaker be still prey of stronger be only carrying out more thoroughly what one did in lesser degree without further pang gave in to necessity of montrose being removed by legal death hanging will involve commission of murder by said suddenly perhaps said other man ambiguously have better wait see enistor ca waste time in arguing down scruple if ca face thing leave matter alone deal with future danger remember that only alice can describe what that danger be must become wife to be trained a clairvoyante did want to love hardwick because said passion must destroy power said enistor irrelevantly what about love for montrose wo that do harm unfortunately will sighed narvaez vexedly ca prevent blossoming of love great law of karma be stronger than be can only deal with free will of warp nature if possible think have better go now have much to do enistor scowled at imperious tone tried a often did to match will against of narvaez suddenly came to that must find easier way out of difficulty reduce don pablo power over by acting in ordinary selfish way sanctioned by custom one moment said testily have money be true legally there be chance of getting from if becomes son in law will be able to keep income in family quite so assented narvaez indifferently if want money for family to build up enistor fortune a county people suppose mean suggestion be excellent montrose can take name along with wife will be great in land where will be leave to say want montrose to be great in land suppose that have brain to become so alice will probably allow to handle income will use for own advancement eh why not advancement a head of family will mean theirs probably if wish to waste time energy cash in building up decayed race montrose may have own idea to carry out may not include consent to possession of family purse complete ownership of money make stronger than be stronger than be will see enistor laughed at idea very likely when be too late probably will see wo be pleased with what do see however be business not mine can return to spain learn what wish to learn in other way teaching be giving narvaez sneered with obedient son in law possessed of five thousand year will not want teaching squire looked a alarmed a self confident man well must have scarcely counted upon attitude being taken by master want teaching more than want money confessed uneasily can have if will permit to carry out plan said don pablo acidly polite otherwise must be satisfied to sink back into ordinary rank file of humanity fee for teaching super physical knowledge be possession of daughter a wife therefore idea of securing handling of money by forwarding marriage with montrose doe not meet with approval can take choice a will be pleased to observe coerce in way ca cried squire with sudden fury let leave at rejoined spaniard amiably enistor stamped swore under breath bit nail angrily while narvaez smiled in hatefully bland manner certainly marriage of montrose alice must bring back money to family might not here egotist saw danger put into own particular pocket lady staunton heir might be self willed obstinate foolish there be knowing what quality might posse likely to thwart proposed father in law scheme must prove to be recalcitrant enistor recognised that marriage must only make matter worse must gain by teaching fortune must have bartered substance for shadow to have money must be good to acquire secret lore must be better to have must be best of must have for certain if agreed to allow narvaez to take command for teaching must make minor god while five thousand year even if got be doubtful must not even make millionaire remind said tempter smiling a hatefully a ever of as between two bundle of hay with help repeat can have money teaching teaching money enistor opened shut hand drawing deep breath thinking profoundly exactly on condition that marry alice agree enistor came to decision swiftly understand be to have free hand obedience other man nodded not knowing how fatal to be that sign of acquiescence at moment stood at cross road free to choose good evil fierce greed led to take left hand path down dark guide beckoned to destruction with little chuckling laugh narvaez received victim allegiance turned to work then in same tone of voice made exactly same remark a have made when enistor first hesitated think have better go now have much to do enistor thus abruptly dismissed returned home pondering deeply on way by time be sufficiently infected with cynicism of narvaez to accept situation to do what be necessary to turn alice into decoy for montrose whether bird must be lured into don pablo nest must not be sure a cane might warn client of danger enistor now saw how very foolish have be to make man enemy comforted with idea that little lawyer must not dare to speak in face of possible accusation of having offered to suppress second will also even if did speak montrose being in love must never listen to on whole therefore enistor felt confident on reflection that fortunate young man must appear at tremore then must be left to malignant device of don pablo narvaez that evening at dinner enistor abruptly announced death of sister loss of money good fortune of mr douglas montrose listened quietly to alice regret then informed that must go to london for month in very short space of time girl demurred ca go out into society when aunt lucy be dead said there be need for to go into society said father who anticipated objection can stay quietly in town enjoy in small way place be rather dull for so young girl a be question be who can chaperon seeing that aunt lucy be dead mr barrast can father said alice eagerly much flushed for prospect of escaping from that gloomy house be delightful who be julian mean mr hardwick sister met at perchton last christmas so did oh remember frivolous little fool of woman with more brain than sparrow yes can go to if will have will be very glad said alice eagerly be fond of very good enistor rose deliberately then be settled chapter v meeting having settled that alice must go to london in singularly short abrupt conversation enistor refused to discus matter further ran up to town within next four day not so much to appear at sister funeral duly attended a to get promised thousand pound did not meet montrose since purposely kept out of young man way in spite of cane suggestion that there must be meeting enistor instructed by master decided that must be best to let montrose fall in love with alice approach in character of proposed son in law of course squire have doubt what affection of young people must be engaged a narvaez predicted fulfilment of prophecy concerning loss of money have considerably strengthened faith in spaniard power with cane squire got on much better a be anxious to obliterate for obvious reason bad impression have made on little man enistor pretended that have only acted a have done to see if cane be honest professed quite willing to be content with scanty inheritance whether solicitor believed not be impossible to say feigned belief behaved with extraordinary civility to enistor cane even went so far a to pay thousand pound out of private account so that squire must not have to wait for winding up of lady staunton estate by acceptance of money be tacitly understood that enistor must not contest will cane drew long breath of relief when receipt be given there certainly be chance that second will must be upset lawyer did not wish for public action to be taken lest mention must be made of visit to tremore for even though visit have be authorised by dead woman vague threat of squire might come out in open court cane be quite innocent of wishing to destroy will must deny possible assertion on oath knew well that however guiltless man may be there be always who quote smoke without fire proverb therefore cane be sincerely glad to have matter settled without dispute for very reason have given enistor cheque on private account when squire departed little man felt that danger be at end enistor arrived back at polwellin in very good spirit a for many long year have not handled so large sum of money being of luxurious nature bought many unnecessary thing spent on considerable sum must have be used for better purpose however on sprat to catch mackerel theory set aside certain ample amount for alice season in london acting part of fond father told that be to spare expense to have wanted in matter of clothes jewellery enjoyment girl be secretly amazed at sudden kindness on part of usually neglectful parent being young being woman gladly took advantage of opportunity to purchase pretty thing in selection of frock hat feminine frippery have benefit of mr barrast taste little woman congratulated on having so lavish father will like amy when know better hardwick have said to alice when subject of chaperonage be broached will soon grow tired of sole idea in life be chiffon will be delighted to introduce into particular set of frivolous kill time wastrel with nature alice will never meet man at house likely to appeal to a husband be perfectly true a in spite of youth miss enistor be thoughtful girl who wanted more food for mind than endless round of bridge party whist drive cinderella dance theatre visit coupled with airy gossip about person that mr barrast be only too pleased to chaperon tolerably pretty girl of good family who be possessed of plenty of money did best to give guest amusing time what julian prophesied soon came to pas alice grew weary of dainty little woman frivolity willow nature be like industrious bee living with butterfly be darling said mr barrast when alice have be week in charming house in han crescent quite nicest thing ever met good look clash with mine be so satisfactory be be not good looking said alice soberly of course not good looking be word one applies to man be lovely in moonlight misty kind of vapoury way babbled other think look charming in mourning madame coralie have such good taste wish must marry julian dear be just sort of romantic head in cloud darling love julian must not suit must suit julian said miss enistor decidedly have arranged to be brother sister mr barrast sighed dull relationship frederick live together something in same way of course be husband be wife although know why ever married go own way to blue book politics vestry meeting horridly dull thing while go mine seeking for heart will understand be dangerous quest mr barrast said alice seriously mr barrast pounced on guest with many kiss chilly darling why call amy a have asked to again again well then amy must not let young men make love to will dear there be something about draw in spite of poor dear after mean anything wrong know alice platonic friendship be delight be dangerous word between married woman unmarried man dangerous quest dangerous word dear talk a if be one hundred forty year of age cried mr barrast petulantly have lived much alone have thought deeply amy oh dear must think always wrinkle one dreadfully to think know frederick think just look at one must take to be grandfather like mr barrast very much said alice quietly did for master of house be only person to whom must talk sensibly run away with then mr barrast reflected do that after frederick be rich husband though know why married must have married have be poor mr barrast screamed in pretty playful way of course not darling what odd thing say frederick attraction lie in money brain be clever know be too much taken up with politics to look at other woman be so satisfactory be so poor when met be glad to marry be sure make very good wife alice ended mr barrast in injured tone so need raise eyebrow in nasty sort of way only meant know what mean be sure to be something to do with dr watt hymn a be that sort of girl wish be so particular about mourning dear a then must take to heap heap of place where one can have really good time will go to hurlingham afternoon now ca refuse have set heart on going to hurlingham be little use alice refusing a mr barrast be one of desperately persistent people who always get own way miss enistor who have be fond of aunt lucy really wished to go out a little a possible that be anxious to escape from gloomy tremore attention of don pablo must never have come to live with butterfly however hostess be so kind alice be so young contrast between london life cornish life be so great that really did enjoy immensely besides there be always frederick to talk to tall grave man with iron grey hair who treated pretty young wife in most indulgent manner be a amused with willow frivolity a richelieu must have be with prank of kitten there be really harm in dainty little woman in spite of platonic philanderings never gave frederick serious cause for rebuke one can not be angry with morsel of thistledown be best description of mr barrast always charmingly dressed delightfully vivacious floated from house to house in frolicsome fairy kind of way dullness fled when mr barrast entered room be strange that so airy nimble witted woman must be sister of stolid giant like julian with serious view of art life be very fond of amy barrast although flouted advice told frequently that be a dull a tomb witticism have picked up from american admirer hardwick came several time to london while alice stayed in han crescent always returned to beloved west country a frivolity of sister circle be altogether too much for by time have accepted role of miss enistor brother two be most confidential be tired of alice asked julian after particularly frivolous luncheon rubbish must bore one of

mechanically by doctor side dreaming of alice of love existed between considering have met for first time hour so previously seemed ridiculous even in dream to think that have such tender feeling for something in deep of own nature be struggling to surface to assure that dream be truth much a valued be company wished away at moment that might puzzle out meaning of strange intuition be impossible just now said doctor quietly wish to come to house a have much to say something to show montrose be startled a often be at eberstein speech know what be thinking about be that so strange well be really have extraordinary penetration sometimes be quite afraid of be never afraid of replied eberstein shaking head with benevolent smile think montrose reflected for few moment be true be not afraid doctor smiled approvingly be right fear must prevent aiding in way need aid more than guess remember what bible say friend quietness confidence will be strength faith peace of mind be so hard to get

to lest must faint on hard uphill journey be not good enough even to approach gate sighed young man so think standard of goodness be not kept on earth in heaven friend however eberstein broke off to hail taxi can talk of thing when reach house get in young man did so be followed by master who told chauffeur to drive to bloomsbury eberstein lived in unfashionable district not withstanding fact that practice lay largely amongst wealthy aristocratic people many of doctor patient wondered why did not select better class neighbourhood eberstein never gave information on point yet known character might have revealed reason to ordinarily shrewd person very easily man be greatly given to helping poor needy not so much proverbial ragged pauper of slum although helped also when necessary a poor curate badly paid clerk shabby governess struggling lady such like person who have to keep up sort of appearance on nothing money sympathy medical skill be wholly at service of who must not pay fee received from rich patient went to ameliorate suffering of self respecting who never complained showed pauperism a little a be possible eberstein made boast of philanthropy never even spoke of many good work be perfectly natural for to go silently attentive about work of master christ a knew must act in other way without going contrary to whole being to feed hungry to clothe naked to teach ignorant to comfort desolate for purpose be in world in one of exploring expedition eberstein have found montrose dying in garret have set on leg again in sympathetic brotherly way have not offended young man pride more than that have supplied food for starving soul a well a for starving body by explaining riddle of life in perfectly reasonable way have entirely changed montrose outlook protege have be puzzled by absolutely unselfish conduct not understanding from inexperience that return be demanded for great gift a limitation began to expand through teaching began to comprehend finally accepted eberstein a kind of angel in flesh sent to help in hour of need philanthropist be so unaffectedly sincere so reasonable sympathetic that rescued man grew to love with reverence rare in younger generation doctor restored faith in human existence here be said eberstein alighting from taxi dismissing can now have undisturbed hour for conversation doctor admitted into quiet house with latch key a servant be in bed be never kept up late by considerate employer since recognised that required necessary sleep so two men entered hall ascended stair betook to large room at very top of mansion eberstein kept entirely to not even seeing friend therein much le patient therefore be with surprise more curiosity that montrose stepped into apartment closed door after then uttered exclamation of pleasure soft exclamation for atmosphere of place suggested church what wonderful room breathed montrose staring round how holy scarcely knew what caused to utter last word unless be unusual look of spacious room everything be white wall carpet ceiling even light radiated from two large lamp with opaque globe table few chair bookcase sofa be of white wood with silken cushion like mound of snow drapery veiled volume window be also hue of milk yet there be suggestion of winter in colourless expanse for air be warm atmosphere so charged with perfect peace montrose felt quite at home room felt expressed eberstein might have be chapel of holy grail never brought here before said young man feeling that dark garment be blot on purity of surroundings although have known for three year more le no assented doctor seating before table indicating chair for guest be not necessary be necessary to night must not have brought here have not be why night of night persisted other wonderingly have met miss enistor montrose be more bewildered than ever what have got to do with with with anything ask said eberstein looked steadily into eye of montrose ask murmured guest mechanically compelled to speech kind grey eye on level with own little distance away poured a seemed such flood of light towards that montrose voluntarily closed own yet be not dazzling light need have frightened enfolding steady radiance bathed whole being in luminous splendour until felt that be partaking of peace of god passeth understanding tide of glory lifted up higher higher beyond gross envelope of physical body until felt soaring without wing into embracing sphere of glorious music expressed in colour in ocean of rainbow hue floated aware that be using super physical sens to view super physical scene on descended with swiftness of thought golden cloud more brilliant than noonday sun dissolved away to reveal form of young girl clothed in floating white drapery face be fair hair corn coloured eye deeply blue figure majestic graceful anything more unlike elfin beauty of alice can scarcely be imagined yet knew beyond doubt that be alice in shape have worn in clime under alien star soul flowed out to blend with soul in one flame of unity there be barrier between montrose strove to break through try a might must not even in heaven world despair seized when found that invisible barrier withheld from beloved on side seemed equally desirous to come to held out arm in vain longing on face face be look of appealing love baffled by impossibility of meeting heart to heart then shadow grew up between swiftly shadow menacing dark of yellow skinned man rather like chinese from whose throat ran stream of blood who man be montrose must not tell even though have recognised alice in different guise enemy montrose felt that wounded creature be enemy grew larger larger until blackness of be part blotted out splendour of girl blotted out also atmosphere of colour music radiancy until montrose sinking downward in gloom opened physical eye to find seated in chair opposite eberstein only single moment have elapsed for journey have be a swift a of mahomet to seventh heaven mounted on al borak seemed to have be away for hour discrepancy be to montrose impossible to reconcile even though grasped confusedly fact that have be in fourth dimension say where there be time now know what alice enistor have to do with said eberstein in quiet impressive tone in one way faltered still bewildered young man yet do in can be certain of be that be mine undoubtedly be yours be hers then why must not come together shadow of sin came between parted sin that committed five thousand year ago explained doctor patiently then self willed centred must not wait striking

a if word have be placed in mouth montrose replied softly love enemy bless that curse do good to that hate pray for despitefully use persecute eberstein bowed stately head such be law of love rubbing eye to make certain that be entirely awake montrose sought for interpretation quite understand there be need for to understand further friend much enlightenment have be vouchsafed through mercy of god for rest must work walk by faith seeing a in glass darkly obeying great law of own free will so that unselfish love may cause hatred to cease whose hatred that of man sinned against only with aid of blessed one eberstein made sign of cross can prevent son of perdition from descending into abyss who be son of perdition enemy whom christ love a love task be to make channel through grace of blessed one can freely pour for salvation of erring soul oh think how glorious be that must be permitted to be instrument of christ in mighty work know how to go about work exclaimed bewildered man watch pray

montrose can not command a man have free will with even logo doe not interfere christ stand at door of heart will not enter unless invite entrance only by doing what ought to do will spirit of love enter sup with what be to do demanded montrose desperately ask own heart say nothing time be not yet ripe for to say anything watch pray come doctor spoke in more matter of fact tone be growing late go home sleep be becoming exhausted tell eberstein if be right in what think pleaded montrose earnestly know intuitively that met miss enistor in previous life loved a love now when come together for first time in incarnation have feeling of being friend oh what do say friend be too weak word of being lover if understand rightly sin committed by have parted that sin have to expiate before can come together again be case ask more now with aid of blessed one must work out salvation in fear trembling indicate enemy will forgive for alice sake cried young man with impetuous generosity must forgive for own how can when know why be enemy will know when be necessary must know montrose passed hand across brow stood up slowly be bewildering difficult very bewildering very difficult answered that question earlier in evening talk in circle to do so be waste of time good night question be trembling on montrose lip refrained from putting with silent hand shake departed slowly accustomed to come go at will in house be more home to than habitation have known young man descended stair let out into silent square balmy summer night be brilliant with star charged with mysterious healing influence soothed relaxed weary nerve on side great city be yet awake alive with people one intent upon realisation of desire here isolated from roaring thoroughfare quadrangle be comparatively lonely dark a passer by be few light widely scattered central garden with tree shrub turf flower slept within rusty iron railing speaking now then a wandering breeze woke leaf to sigh whisper hurrying step of wayfarer measured heavy tread of policeman murmur of distant life montrose heard thing without hearing a be a without seeing stared at silent cat gliding through shadow walked along wrapped up in own thought seeking mechanically room bed notwithstanding accession to considerable wealth fortunate youth have slightly changed mode of living enjoyed better lodging better clothes more nourishing food be free from obligation of compulsory work to exist still lived in unfashionable bloomsbury quiet inexpensive somewhat recluse life not seeking to enter what be known a society with good look undeniable talent newly acquired wealth must have be welcome to gay throng who flutter in sunshine of pleasure there be nothing in montrose responded to such aimless allurement once twice friend have taken to house that where butterfly gathered on particular night eberstein have induced to dine at mr barrast entertainment of kind bored montrose immensely only presence of alice have aided to endure willow chatter of hostess artificiality of surroundings after event in eberstein room have startled awed so that be still greatly moved by what have taken place when reached modest lodging a common sense told thinking must not help a thought spun in circle always brought back to same point that point be meeting with alice weird feeling contact with personality have aroused in belonged to life in way must not quite put into word belonged to hers be together yet apart what parted be impossible to say a vision have not indicated in detail especial sin what have led to commission of sin soon must know more eberstein have assured of therefore must be best to wait for knowledge have be given light enough in darkness of path to take next step light revealed alice waiting for to come to be only too willing to do so a feeling that loved deeply grew with overwhelming swiftness when knew what be in heart knew what be in hers then next step must be taken what might be where must lead to montrose must not say however doctor have given necessary instruction for moment in phrase watch pray to watch for dawning love in alice to pray that might be worthy of such love seemed to be task very delightful task must be therefore montrose knelt down prayed with clean heart possible blessing might befall girl that if be god will might become husband to cherish protect then went to bed in peaceful frame of mind sleep came to almost immediately before eye closed felt that alice be near knew that in wordless manner alice spoke to have much to learn there be pain in learning whispered be together to suffer together suffering doe not matter said montrose a in dream be together chapter viii love young dream after storm come calm when trouble have endured for season peace descends to refresh exhausted soul montrose have suffered great deal during five twenty year of present life be time that must enjoy rest ever since must remember dark cloud have enshrouded with fainting heart have groped way through gloom meeting with eberstein have be end of sorrow beginning of joy for doctor have bidden raise eye to hill made glorious by rising sun with legacy of lady staunton dawn have

across sky alice alighted from taxi at park gate leisurely walked up broad path towards round pond preferred to meet douglas here rather than in han crescent house because mr barrast must always have be interrupting girl be sufficiently in love to think that two be company three nuisance a matter of fact acknowledged to herself be a deeply in love with montrose a obviously be with though of have

education one must think be couple of old married people sitting side by side in stiff manner said montrose with vexed laugh must like to be sabine carry away by force perhaps will have to do so said alice thinking of don pablo father will never consent to becoming wife montrose looked amazed anxious why not there be nothing against character position said rapidly a have inherited lady staunton

chapter ix warning mindful that premature engagement might lead to gossip montrose beloved acted with great discretion gave vent to ardent feeling in private behaved prudently in public certainly young man paid many visit to mr barrast house be markedly attentive to visitor be natural that bachelor must admire pretty maid so people merely remarked indulgently that evidently montrose be falling in love with miss enistor little knew that inevitable have already happened in scandalously short space of time mr barrast with shrewdness did credit guessed that couple understood one better than must admit even did not guess how far matter have gone must have be annoyed have really known truth not because of private engagement for simple reason that have not be admitted into confidence of lover a be saw led to believe that montrose be conventionally approaching guest with view to marriage quite approved of intention therefore welcomed to house made use of money be only right thought that must pay for kindness in forwarding aim payment took form of mr barrast plundering montrose on occasion frederick supplied with ample fund for frivolity mr barrast always wanted more than must reasonably obtain cleverly got what desired from douglas a lover be in deep mourning for lady staunton aunt of one benefactress of other did not take much part in gaiety of waning season same mr barrast made montrose give concert ticket box at theatre used freely for herself friend a on occasion usually left alice to entertain donor in han crescent house young man be quite willing to be lavish in direction indeed be in others also for supplied butterfly with flower scent glove similar trifle woman like to have woman like to pay for alice did not object at outset to generosity a be necessary to keep mr barrast in good temper in end protested against such wholesale robbery will ruin mr montrose if take everything give said to amy two week after momentous agreement in kensington

amy whether admit deny what state be case have right to say so like mr montrose admire word word word love look at in glass dear think colour tell truth what if doe ah then admit that be right alice saw that be useless to fence with mr barrast who be much too clever to be deceived far too dangerous to be tampered with yes be in love with mr montrose why not say with douglas tittered little woman douglas if plea dear question be if plea be blind asked mr barrast dramatically be fool do think that during past three week have left that nice boy together without guessing truth age age ago never ask for ticket give to to get out of way ended butterfly justly be not complimentary to mind mr well then douglas giving box at theatre said alice petulantly why take flower glove because want such thing retorted mr barrast coolly if be foolish enough not to take present from see why must not be glad that have come to understanding dear a wish to know if be in earnest if be merely flirting if be flirting then think be very horrid of have heart heart can be broken flirt said mr barrast uttering lie with greatest composure if be making fool of nice boy will take off hand be well mother to alice

understand one really how sly be have said anything wished to say then have proposed yes alice contented with affirmative did not trouble to give date of proposal mr barrast understood that have taken place within last day so even displeased be quite immoral for to be so hasty exclaimed because idea of montrose adoring alice not be annoying hurt vanity girl smiled wondering what hostess must say if knew that proposal have be made three week previously be in love see there be sense in thing dear have only known month of course love at first sight believe in thing oh amy what about romeo juliet be only thing in play think juliet be at respectable if have lived in london instead of verona must never have allowed to visit mr montrose must have behaved properly what do call proper behaviour on part well must have spoken to first douglas idea of propriety differs from yours amy thought be best to tell father that wished to marry before speaking to must do le snapped mr barrast still ruffled have written to mr enistor two day ago have not yet received answer have for wrote to father at same time asking to consent to engagement oh will consent quick enough father be sniffed little woman owes great deal for bringing back that lost money to family if be nice suppose be nice though julian doe like at expect will give bracelet muff chain do really mean that interrupted alice opening eye very wide of course why must mean what say how rapacious be amy what nasty word when be only sensible what be use of men if give thing douglas will give want dear after brought together diplomatic remark cleared air banished frown from mr barrast small featured face of course did saw that two be meant for other moment set eye on one advised to get back aunt money by marriage did certainly did admitted miss enistor dryly not thinking necessary to explain that loved montrose for alone what said have come true amy douglas desire to make wife if father consent oh bother father cried mr barrast vigorously what doe consent matter when have hooked rich man be vulgar amy said alice wincing be romantic ca deceive mr montrose be rich must marry without sixpence so will rejoined mr barrast caustically have sixpence remember be glad dear have played card well frederick will be pleased like mr montrose immensely great deal be glad doe said alice soberly say anything until hear from father amy be with difficulty that miss enistor induced little woman to be silent for mr barrast be so immensely pleased with what took to be own cleverness in bringing matter to favourable issue that wanted to trumpet news over place there be word now of impropriety hasty wooing for alice let butterfly think that match be quite of own making butterfly spread sheltering wing over happy pair did not tell frederick a frederick be wholly occupied with politics did not see what be going on under very nose with many mysterious beck smile significant look little woman managed to intimate that be fairy godmother of particular lover whose romance be rapidly progressing towards fulfilment thus made everything safe in respectable way for montrose to be constantly invited to dinner to be left alone with alice more frequently than must have met with public approval have not be courting young man gratitude showed substantially took form of several piece of jewellery guardian angel be pleased to accept everything went a merry a marriage bell pending reply of enistor to montrose letter came four day after alice have remonstrated with mr barrast for shameless looting mr enistor have written not only to montrose to daughter with regard to proposal when two came together on particular evening let one know immediately that fatal missive have be received luckily mr barrast with merry party have gone to empire music hall must not return until late montrose a usual have provided box purposely having done so to rid of inconvenient third frederick be at house so must not interfere douglas have alice to in large drawing room mr barrast for sake of propriety have made promise to await return have supper therefore everything be nicely arranged when quite alone lover sat together on sofa looked into one eye now said alice breathlessly letter not just yet replied montrose taking in arm remember have not seen for forty eight hour oh foolish boy alice have excuse for calling so although liked foolishness displayed immensely dropped on knee holding waist in arm said manner of delightful thing only interrupting speech to kiss again again again what babbled need not be reported a talk of lover however pleasing to be extraordinarily silly when repeated to others splendid glamour of love be over pair what douglas said sounded sublimely sensible to girl while look of alice be of goddess to adorer yet montrose be common sense young man miss enistor only tolerably pretty girl misleading passion of love excused regarding other a divinity certainly did so be a foolishly happy a antony cleopatra be in day of power like famous lover must have regarded world a well lost for love really cried alice at last recovering reason first be natural since be woman must be sensible think be very sensible indeed other people must not think so why trouble about other people replied montrose reluctantly getting on foot there be other people be alone in world indeed think will be unless father consent sighed miss enistor not that there will be loneliness with beside added darling then kiss embrace before settling down to more prosaic conversation tell dear what doe say to much same a writes to douglas expect alice took letter from pocket be not angry a expected must be say nothing about don pablo desire so say be happiness if approves of be quite willing that must marry if approves of echoed montrose reading paternal letter over alice shoulder quite so suppose doe approve try to cross bridge until come to douglas why must father approve now that evidently have given up idea of marrying don pablo have father asked down to tremore yes said montrose producing letter in turn how clever of to guess that dearest did not guess a might have seen if read father letter properly said alice quickly say that have asked down intends to ask down know oh here be invitation remarked young man waving letter mr enistor say that before can consent to place future in hand must become well acquainted with invite to tremore for visit of one month in four week hope to give decision alice disconsolately replaced epistle in pocket watched lover put away communication doe sound very promising oh think doe said montrose hopefully see what else must say if entertains at idea of marrying be only natural that must wish to know what kind of husband be likely to be to adored daughter oh said alice ironically doe father call that twice call that in letter doe mean girl assured montrose in troubled way father endure one society little love exists between fault be mine douglas a be

when meet will in way guess meaning humph will certainly accept father invitation to see spaniard hardwick also understand position urged alice anxiously yes think do same want to assure positively that love one else there be need to tell what already know returned girl in calm positive way be made for one darling caught in arm know hope father will think a do mean well said miss enistor with sigh of relief must not ask down to tremore be at interesting point in interview that lover be interrupted footman opened door to announce dr eberstein when gentleman entered room servant promptly retired montrose came forward with look of amazed inquiry be reflected on face of alice young people be astonished by unexpected appearance of doctor thought be still in paris eberstein cried douglas a friend shook hand with arrived in london to day why did let know there be need to be necessary that must quite understand one before came on scene eberstein looked from one flushed face to other

doe cried alice vehemently nothing douglas must say do must ever make doubt must believe in alice if world be against said young man decisively that be good hearing observed doctor pleasantly union be strength one know that doctor said miss enistor rather pertly perhaps replied few practise wonder why have come here to night be because need seems to be sunshine at present moment love one devotedly think that mr enistor be well disposed towards engagement oh interrupted alice with frightened look in eye how do know that father be aware of engagement letter received to day time montrose interrupted there be note of awe in voice believe know everything eberstein know that be invited down to cornwall so that mr enistor may judge if be man must choose to be son in law how do know said alice startled make afraid eberstein took hand gazed directly into eye be sure that make afraid asked gently why alice felt momentary fear vanish in unaccountable way trust even though have known such short time remember have only met once miss enistor loosened soft reassuring grasp leaned back in chair do trust said girl promptly have be kind to douglas be that sole reason alice stared at doubtfully be only reason can give one good man kind friend must have saved douglas life a did perhaps perhaps yes said doctor enigmatically advised friend here to keep lady staunton money interest in may not be so philanthropic a imagine to be doctor said montrose indignantly how can talk so hush eberstein threw up hand want miss enistor to speak what can say trust be sure there be good reason why douglas must keep aunt money must not have advised to keep otherwise if father pointed out that must have enjoyed fortune that wish montrose to keep so that can make use of money through what then still must believe in trust persisted alice steadily father doe not want fortune eberstein smiled slightly oh assure doe not have said nothing about a to doubting doctor doe not know will day then may doubt remember when doe try to turn against have foretold possibility of such warning say will trust good accept assurance montrose believe in now a always have done said young man eagerly understand why be talking in way though understand many thing at present said eberstein dryly when do pain will come with knowledge necessary pain go to cornwall meet mr enistor while sun still shine will not see when dark cloud obscure light then will be at side will come to cornwall asked alice quickly when need arises will arise eberstein looked from one to other quietly yes need will arise what need demanded montrose bewildered enough for day be evil thereof said eberstein serenely that also applies to good be well with a yet so enjoy passing moment draw from peace necessary strength for conflict gold must be refined in fire must be cast into furnace yet be not afraid same god who saved shadrach meshach abednego will save be of afraid ended positively arm in arm lover stood glanced at one a doctor spoke be not afraid declared simultaneously spoke truth behold then said eberstein solemnly how great be love can cast out fear over made holy sign chapter x in cornwall be august when alice returned home a soon a father learned that have become engaged to montrose sent for now that mouse have entered trap there be need for girl to remain in london spend money mr barrast be sorry to lose companionship of miss enistor not only because liked a much a one of willow nature must like one for more selfish reason with alice departed montrose although did not go immediately down to cornwall scarcely came near house in han crescent thus mr barrast be deprived of many present loved to receive however have done very well made best of loss since girl visit because of montrose love making have not be unprofitable to mr barrast be very affectionate when alice departed made promise to return when became mr douglas montrose alice readily consented for though amy be vain selfish yet fact that love romance have taken place beneath roof made girl regard a most excellent friend same be not sorry to return to cornwall a be weary of frivolous london life in railway train alice became quite depressed be coming back to dreary tremore to father uncongenial society perhaps to unpleasant attention of don pablo on latter point be reassured by father letter although have not quite consented to marriage with montrose must not consent until have seen young man yet in face of half approval certainly must not allow to be troubled by don pablo certainly spaniard have great influence with squire of polwellin might not be inclined to surrender girl whom desired to make wife douglas a alice reflected must soon be on spot must deal with narvaez if old man became troublesome on whole therefore even though matter be trifle unsettled alice concluded that new life must be better than old at event must not be quite so lonely be something of course dr eberstein have predicted trouble also have agreed to come down when trouble arrived comforted girl not little a have greatest confidence in montrose friend why must scarcely say a knew next to nothing about mere look let alone touch of hand be enough to make feel strangely brave happy if don pablo be evil dr eberstein be good yet why one must be other that alice must not tell doubtless a douglas have suggested eberstein must have enlightened on point have not done so beyond warning that must count upon help in trouble be surely coming have said very little therefore two young people have to walk by faith very bravely did so at perchton be nearest station to polwellin alice quite expected to find father waiting for since little a loved must surely be anxious to see how looked after long absence mr enistor be not on platform alice with rather forlorn feeling alighted from compartment in london have grown accustomed to love attention so neglect of present moment brought on depression again that vanished in trice when strong hand took small bag be carrying strong voice sounded in ear here be at last said julian brightly have be waiting for nearly hour alice oh julian took hand to press warmly be so glad be here be feeling quite dismal because father have not come to meet thought must be yesterday asked if intended to come to perchton a said that have time came in stead left painting how good of not at be

gladly settled in very comfortable vehicle while julian went back into station shortly returned with porter box be duly placed on motor julian stepped in beside girl word to chauffeur sent splendid machine humming down narrow street like giant bee then two have time to look at one julian approved of girl appearance love have made blossom like rose be le ethereal than have be sad look on delicate face have vanished also a mr barrast have attended to frock have introduced to madame coralie girl be singularly smart attractive a regard clothes smile be on julian face a looked at went away duckling return swan said oh what doubtful compliment said alice gaily be then rather be ugly duckling dear be never ugly duckling what mean be that have turned from fairy into pretty nymph be better said miss enistor graciously a motor whizzed out of town began to climb long winding road to moor be improving julian ask how have enjoyed there be need appearance speaks for alice laughed do think that look be due simply to short season of pleasure in london well not exactly rejoined hardwick in stolid way in fact seeing that have be staying with amy expected to look more fagged than do amy make toil of pleasure be certainly very wearing woman to live with be dear said miss enistor warmly have be most kind be right about feverish pursuit of pleasure said with after thought amy never rest never let one else rest be worse said julian grimly looked at sideways yes mere london pleasure can not account for happy look well let know who be let know who be repeated alice blushing looking prettier than ever do mean think know what mean be in love at last like woman alice did not reply directly to remark be very angry julian asked laying timid hand on arm dear be not angry at be brother sister know long ago discovered that be right a to proposal be wrong must do for be to accept situation of future husband if don pablo insisted upon marrying presume can now resign position ended hardwick gravely be called douglas montrose said alice still evasive very pretty name for prince charming yes father mentioned to that young man have written to also mentioned that montrose be fortunate person who have inherited lady staunton money so amy got own way a knew must inveterate matchmaker be amy alice opened eye widely did guess then not so much guess a know replied hardwick composedly amy wrote about desire that must become mr montrose be pleased of course amy told how deeply loved man must not tell that for certain pouted alice doubtfully be not so sure of woman be proverbially clever shrewd in anything have to do with love making however seems be right bright eye crimson cheek tell a much may a well confess that love douglas admitted alice boldly love already have asked father consent to marriage will give without doubt alice be happy way of getting back lost money oh money money cried petulantly talk just a amy talk julian a if cared for money love douglas if be pauper must marry father have not jumped at chance of getting back money a seem to think wo say yes wo say no must say something remarked julian with shrug nothing refuse to give decision until know more about douglas hardwick nodded be natural sensible so young man be coming to tremore to be put through pace how clever of to guess that be in few day oh how anxious feel julian so much depends upon father will consent be sure alice with disposition a have must choose one really good man for husband alice laughed trifle bitterly be strange considering prospect happy state of mind goodness badness matter very little when one be in love julian matter at to father so long a marry rich man be good thing for douglas have plenty of money for only in way will thing run smoothly for of otherwise feel certain that father must still insist upon marrying don pablo humph said hardwick meditatively question be 'must don pablo marry dear girl be supposed to be in love with said

together for one moment hesitated next decided not to speak julian must not understand evaded direct answer to question by truly feminine subterfuge must rather judged douglas for without looking at through eye will be here in few day then can give opinion well said julian in usual stolid way perhaps be right after calm acceptance of situation became silent while two young people have be talking car have pursued way towards tremore steadily swiftly along winding white road glided with spreading man land of purple heather on side how alice loved vast moorland sprinkled with grey block of granite tumbled steepness of black cliff far stretching space of gleaming ocean life giving wind breathed across limitless land for moment wondered how have ever endured narrow muffling london street with twice breathed air garish light like thing of life great car swung untiringly along landscape widened out at turn of road felt a though have come out of stifling cavern into spacious world flung out hand in ecstatic greeting to majesty of nature reborn through love into wider consciousness girl seeing hearing now embraced appreciation of much to have be formerly deaf blind sound seemed sweeter colour more vivid life dearer there be feeling of spring in autumnal air alice felt that wished to dance sing generally rejoice out of sheer lightheartedness be made one with nature exclaimed thrilling to beauty of land sea doe shelley say something like in 'adonais never read poetry replied julian stolidly to mind poet only say in many word what journalist say in few what pagan sentiment cried miss enistor gaily how untrue oh there be tremore assuredly be grey house looked more sinister than ever in pale sunshine placed dark spell on alice for a motor car breasted hill gay spirit left

alice brightened oh be sure will how nice of to say that be not bit jealous believe be annoyed because be not dear girl laughed artist julian how can say such thing replied absently then added in markedly irrelevant manner hope father will be glad to see mr enistor may have be glad certainly did not appear at door to show gladness alice box be taken into house julian departed in car declining to enter on plea that father daughter must have much to say to one alice did not seek to stay felt chilled by absence of welcome sombre atmosphere of big house beaten space of ground upon stood seemed to isolate from warm laughing world of vivid life entered with feeling that be descending into vault did greeting of father tend to dissipate impression of dismay received in library with cold kiss without rising from chair well alice how be looked at keenly a stood by table white frozen into silence stay in town doe not appear to have done much good oh feel right said girl with effort to be true self look right snapped enistor rather disappointed after money have spent certainly must have more healthy appearance h be think understand paused moment then added bitingly new lover have disappointed be that alice roused to offer protest douglas be can wish father hope for sake that be can wish if be will certainly not allow to marry there be always don pablo to at speech alice did wake up colour flushed cheek don pablo if be to believe julian have fallen in love with rose penwin did know hardwick be such gossip said enistor coolly a to falling in love narvaez be much too sensible man admires girl for beauty have given several present of jewellery at don pablo age one can object to job trevel can job trevel doe more gossip sneered enistor artist friend appears to have informed accurately of situation matter nothing to to since neither of have right to interfere with don pablo like dislike be one love alice thought said moment ago that be too sensible to fall in love squire shrugged shoulder meant in silly way of boy girl narvaez love be of deeper more spiritual kind admires rose a beautiful girl adores a soul want adoration said alice wearily for seemed hard that usual wrangling must begin moment returned home prefer adoration doubt well have objection so long a approve of young man doe what want what be that must restore money aunt left thought did not care for money father care very much indeed for money although have never emphasised fact only because have did even consider possibility of marrying must much prefer to be narvaez wife however will see when young man arrives meantime have better lie down a seem to be worn out by journey be waste of money to send away alice bit lip to keep back tear breathed prayer eberstein must help to throw off deadly influence of house even a did so relief came felt wave of vitality run through body weary languid sense of utter desolation left colour returned to cheek brightness to eye strength to whole being enistor saw statue come to life in place of wan weak girl beheld living breathing woman very much alive stared amazed what have come to demanded startled puzzled love said alice quietly love life instead of hate death enistor quivered since knew that first mentioned force be at war with dark master chapter xi spider fly alice returned to home with feeling that be entering hostile city atmosphere of house be inimical charged with disintegrating force strove to break up scatter protective power that power came from dr eberstein be now perfectly certain in own mind a have experienced help so plainly when arrived before visit to london enistor have so dominated with cold cynicism cruel insistence that have almost entirely conquered will have be like bird in coil of serpent only absence have enabled to regain freedom in surroundings charged with deadly evil girl have recovered youthful spirit be rightful heritage unifying influence of montrose love have strengthened considerably therefore when fear again threatened to control have be able to assert on reflection felt positive that attempt must have be vain have not mentally appealed to eberstein why have thus called upon for help scarcely knew a be ignorant of matter connected with occult did know be that doctor have always soothed with serene strength when be in presence half unconsciously have wished for to be beside when insidious evil overshadowed tremore have surged round to paralyse control eberstein have not come power have like impassable wall have fenced in from danger hint that such help be obtainable in such manner be enough for girl persistently particularly dwelt upon eberstein powerful personality whenever uncomfortable feeling assailed swiftly imagined that be close at hand to defend also constantly visualised image of lover knowing that be willing to lay down life for safety in lesser degree filled with life strength if enistor on daughter return doubted that visit to london have done her good have reason to doubt afterwards alice recovered a by magic brightness of eye rose of cheek went about dark house gaily hopefully busy with domestic affair always cheerful merry even to extent of singing while at work might be thought that enistor be glad to see how girl have recovered spirit have benefited by change in place of showing satisfaction gloomed glowered in high displeasure there be le chance than ever of gaining authority over complained to narvaez when on visit to magician cottage nearly controlled before left for london now resisting strength have increased tremendously be not own strength that defends replied don pablo quietly then be strength of love awakened by montrose might have known master who have such mean of obtaining knowledge that there be that risk when let go to mr barrast be not omnipotent omniscient answered old man dryly great a be power there be still many thing beyond control implied a much when told that present situation be outcome of past know law of karma law of cause effect law of 'as ye sow so will ye reap ' governs evolution of present creation knowing so much must not be surprised that be mastered by a be being sooner later alice be bound to come into contact with enemy who be dr eberstein douglas montrose alice told how have met eberstein how much liked gave hint that be enemy how must seeing doe not know retorted narvaez sharply eberstein be white magician against whom warned week ago be coming down here soon a prophesied must montrose also come be together in chaldea five thousand year ago there engendered cause have to be worked out in flesh to day why do blame for alice going to london have gained strength by going there meeting men must have warned warned a much a must snapped narvaez acridly sharp must not prevent inevitable alice have to meet loss of money under will left to montrose be mean used to bring together must do being impotent under karmic law be to so arrange matter montrose might be brought down here along with dr eberstein have managed now come tug of war be by mean satisfactory pupil enistor a have again again to explain matter already know then take eberstein have already declared war by bringing montrose alice together great law did that eberstein declaration of war be help that be giving alice to withstand influence strive to bring to bear upon for moment a saw nearly relapsed into former condition when returned from visit intuition told to call upon guardian eberstein help came innocence protected before now have more powerful protection of love from montrose in personal sense in impersonal way from eberstein be very powerful yes grinned narvaez with look of hate in cold blue eye follows right hand path of love have universal power behind on left hand path of hate posse only portion of power in case seems impossible to conquer said enistor irresolutely satanic pride of don pablo rose in arm against insinuation eberstein will find mean adversary snarled will fight fight to last already fly in person of montrose have walked into parlour oh so be spider yes will devour montrose if can already have made plan started work by paying attention to silly rose penwin thus arousing jealousy of trevel see never mind what see interrupted narvaez impatiently leave to do what intend to do then eberstein will not find easy to save montrose in spite of power if have more power than ca understand cried don pablo exasperated montrose alice have free will eberstein can guide coax can not command if two yield to self then triumph if renounce then fail be of good cheer be yet so strong a to have entirely conquered animal self will fight in for existence what have to do be to play courteous host to permit engagement of alice montrose then leave rest to be only one of many conversation enistor have with master while awaiting arrival of guest must not quite understand situation narvaez declined to explain further than be in opinion necessary enistor knew be that montrose be to be trapped in way that don pablo courting of rose penwin with gift have to do with trapping contented with knowledge man be markedly amiable to daughter alice felt nervously surprised by unusual attention ordinarily indifferent father paid formerly have with reason dreaded sinister influence emanating from now seeing in demonstration of affection sign that truly loved regretted possible misjudgment in many way attempted to show appreciation of miraculous change from blame to praise on whole found domestic life at tremore unexpectedly pleasant nevertheless nature of father daughter clashed at odd moment be only by constantly acting part did not truly feel that must keep thing smooth more than ever did alice long for arrival of montrose so that must display true nature exercise true love enistor unnatural complaisance extended to hardwick a now that be aware of artist rejection did not forbid visit julian guessed that squire merely tolerated simply came to tremore on occasion to aid alice since knew that be something of alien in home host be always pointedly agreeable so strange to say be don pablo dark dour old man for hidden reason appeared to take great interest in artist a have formerly neglected in way julian be puzzled to know why must be thus honoured not liking narvaez did not reciprocate belated amiability always escaped with alice on to moor when be possible trained to observe beauty of nature opened eye to more glorious world of form colour alice accepted such behaviour with sisterly thankfulness looked upon a large comfortable newfoundland dog able to protect please therefore young people found life very pleasant be sunshine for moment a eberstein have predicted that more glorious sunshine must come with lover arrival alice knew very well never forgot that cloud must sooner later overshadow summer sky although must not see in quarter must arise vague feeling however intimated that disaster must come with montrose that belief in love must be severely tested nevertheless looked forward to arrival knowing that eberstein must follow shortly in doctor have most implicit confidence assured that sorrow descended upon lover eberstein must guard help in way also there be julian upon whom must rely in hour of need suspense indeed be unpleasant alice fought with prayer high thinking girding a be with armour of light against time when dark power must assault citadel of being in innocence be ignorant save from hint of eberstein that assault be intended at length came golden day when douglas be to arrive alice rejoiced to receive letter stating that young man must leave london by early morning train at five o'clock at half past three must be at perchton there julian be to meet in friend motor car have again procured so that montrose might be with alice a speedily a be possible enistor indeed mindful of don pablo injunction to be courteous have offered to send carriage alice anxious that swifter method must be found to bring lover to longing arm have accepted offer of julian did not go to perchton station waited mile beyond polwellin village in green nook beside high road for happy moment hardwick have purposely arranged to bring lover to tremore a be anxious for sake of girl happiness to see what be nature of man have chosen to be husband deemed that must discover same more easily when alice be not present apparently reading of montrose character be satisfactory for when car came swirling round corner alice saw that two young men be chatting together a if have known one for year of course when alice be espied waving hand on green hill above nook car be stopped on dusty white road equally of course montrose jumped down to run like deer up ascent in moment be in fond arm heart be beating against heart neither must speak so full of joyful emotion be moment guessing julian told chauffeur to drive on with astonishment couple saw motor slipping round bend of road through village up towards tremore bearing portmanteau of montrose be alone in purple world amongst gorgeous coloured bracken be vivid with autumnal tint sun be just sinking glory of rainbow hue bathed in opal light be one of nicest fellow ever met said montrose when first surprise at julian prompt action be over be so sensible knew wanted to be alone with at first opportunity julian be always considerate said alice gaily call julian mr barrast brother said montrose jealously dear took by lapel of coat looked into dark eye of course call by christian name told about julian in london how proposed to how refused how be now like brother sister there be need to be montrose stopped mouth with kiss say word be fool said penitently remember what said in town hardwick be brick really true honest hearted fellow like immensely have so much to talk about alice that need not waste time in discussing hardwick even though be so decent alice quite agreed with sentiment so two started to climb hill on way to tremore talked way of near dear matter so necessary interesting to lover so dull when third person overhears went over meeting in han crescent recalled what have said what have replied explained how have be hungry for precious moment of meeting punctuated enthralling conversation with frequent kiss a magical light died out of western sky conversed on graver subject have to do with vague thought of evil coming to montrose explained how have seen eberstein shortly before leaving london sent for yesterday said young man fumbling at breast gave said be necessary for protection protection echoed alice with sudden qualm stared at small golden heart swung on thin golden chain montrose have produced unexpectedly why must want protection douglas ah can not truly say be so accustomed to obey doctor implicitly that did a asked wear amulet round neck have always reason for what doe alice remember dear said plainly that sunshine must not last for ever ended montrose gravely there be to be period of sorrow know murmured alice nestling close to lover side with dr eberstein help will come out of darkness into light once more know what mean added after pause why must sorrow come have idea that have something to do with meeting in former life alice that have enemy to encounter conquer don pablo very likely think so although be not sure montrose spoke dreamily remembering wonderful vision warning of eberstein must watch pray dear for more le be moving in darkness will aid held up talisman glittered in sunset ray how can golden heart help asked alice disbelievingly only see exterior dear hold montrose made sign of cross on breast portion of host a dr eberstein told be therefore powerful against evil called amulet rightly must have said reliquary look dearest then most wonderful thing happened two have reached shade of wood surrounding tremore have halted on verge in spot where sunlight must not penetrate a alice stared at golden heart blazed a star with far more brilliant light than have ever seen before in flash of thought knew that interior sens have be opened by mightiest influence on earth be looking through sheath of metal at very host in supernal aspect radiant glorious wonderful holy oh breathed in hushed voice bowed head reverently what be asked lover in surprise for expression be angelic do not see light be brighter than sun no whispered nervously seized hand like child seeking for comfort of mother touch where be light be gone now alice passed disengaged hand across brow disappeared when touched when held up that heart shone like marvellous star of splendour then montrose understood have seen power murmured with trembling hand restored reliquary to breast for moment what alice have seen shook to core of being how glorious to be able to see through veil even for single moment why must not when be said 'blessed be pure in heart for will see god ' like child clung to one on border of dark wood be time before must proceed sacred light felt be yet around must act a shield against evil that did so far a alice be concerned be certain for while walking under yew amidst heavy darkness sense of protection be unusually strong not so montrose for even though carried reliquary be le sensitive to helpful influence than girl who be more attuned to spirituality might be that with preponderance of earthly desire placed more in touch with lower plane than with higher undoubtedly felt strongly tremendous pressure of evil around when two halted on verge of beaten ground barren of herb flower house of hate bulked largely silent black brooding menacing alice how can live here demanded montrose grasping hand tightly feel also whispered that sense of doom dread feel power that rends tear part asunder disintegrating force of chaos be necessary for creation before cosmos cosmos of love can be formed unconsciously gripped hand with crushing force so great be emotion stirred douglas hurt cried girl writhing oh forgive descended to commonplace tenderly kissed pained finger feeling of dread be so strong that forgot what be doing there kissed hand twice be better darling alice laughed be child said advancing towards house lover sighed be child think afraid of dark there be darkness where god be dear think of god light come be nearer to great spirit of love than be said douglas peering nervously into gloom then made effort to throw off still persistent influence of evil let get into lamplight come then said alice stepping into porch laid hand on handle of door immediately a by magic retreated from finger portal swung wide to reveal enistor on threshold dimly seen in what light still radiated from fading sunset over heavy tree top heard voice explained genially knew that guest have arrived welcome to tremore mr montrose thank sir oh thank replied young man reassured by reception warmly clasping hand extended to a did so strong feeling of repulsion possessed mind with overwhelming force be must do to prevent from wrenching hand away not that there be need for action on part for enistor actually translated thought into swift doing loosened grip to stand back with startled look without doubt same repugnance at same instant of time obsessed older man le self controlled have be unable to prevent unfriendly action in twilight man strove to see face of other be impossible to distinguish clearly in shadow met a shadow be alice who broke spell of confused hatred a in spite of clairvoyant faculty be apparently ignorant of thunder in air be sure will be glad to have tea douglas be in library father yes muttered enistor regaining self control by powerful effort with one word led way into lamplight douglas followed arm in arm with girl feeling for meant to must have escaped immediately from grim house unseen owner in mellow radiance flooded library enistor beheld slim delicate man with dreamy face of poet scorning that stripling must cause even momentary dread despising a one of enemy indicated by narvaez squire became good naturedly tolerant during tea time behaved courteously proved to be genial hospitable host montrose be markedly silent a repulsion increased immediately caught sight of dark powerful countenance also in heart there lurked uncomfortable fear that enistor be in position to injure in inexplicable way be not physical fear for montrose be brave man hateful influence seemed in way to paralyse why must be so be naturally unable to guess desire to fly neighbourhood of implacable foe be so strong that took strength to resist desire for ignominious retreat for alice sake did so resist a gracious presence enabled to bear strain with equanimity therefore a have be trained by eberstein to control feeling drank ate in quite conventional manner alice still ignorant of hatred with father lover regarded one presided over what be outwardly merry little meal chatting laughing in smiling whole hearted way a though have not care in world a indeed have not for moment fear will feel dull here mr montrose said enistor formal cold oh father what compliment to dear be quiet folk at tremore must admit like quietness said montrose smiling must much rather be here than in london of course with alice be paradise ended enistor cynically have usual stock in trade of pretty phrase lover delight in well must see what can do to amuse be usually busy alice can be guide to few sight of neighbourhood can ride horse bicycle drive in carriage dog cart there be tennis lawn at back of house golf link in perchton then can go sketching on moor with mr hardwick alice job trevel will take out fishing mr sparrow vicar of polwellin will show church cromlech rocking stone other such thing a be something of archaeologist can have music bridge conversation in evening stop stop interrupted montrose now more at ease a saw that squire be endeavouring to make agreeable must require six month to do thing will enjoy immensely especially if will introduce to senor narvaez what do know about asked enistor sharply frowning alice hardwick must tell seems to be very interesting man unusual character be original assented enistor quickly so much so that doe not choose to know one however a be very good friend daresay will be able to induce to meet here will find very interesting indeed ended squire significantly stared hard at montrose wondering if guessed how spaniard regarded young man having nothing to conceal quite innocent of don pablo enmity towards met squire gaze with forced friendly smile like interesting people said amiably hope do also mr enistor a friend dr eberstein be coming to perchton shortly will be pleased to welcome friend of yours replied elder man in formal way then rose to leave room felt that have done enough a host for time being wished to be alone so that might send mental message to narvaez about new arrival will excuse until dinner time mr montrose alice will entertain when squire departed alice did best in way of entertainment found difficult to banish thoughtful look from lover face pleading fatigue young man soon sought room assigned to pondered over odd distaste sight of enistor induced must not account for wished that eberstein must appear to elucidate problem across mind flashed insistently question of ahab hast thou found o mine enemy deadly answer of elijah seer have found thee much a loved alice felt that situation be uncomfortable perplexing quite beyond human explanation chapter xii small beer chronicle emphasis of soul be always right say emerson meaning thereby that immediate feeling individual have for one at first sight be hint from divine within a to whether must be friend foe subtle impulse be never felt again a self interest custom gradually blunt spiritual perception who cross other path behave a worldly circumstance bid naturally so for whenever desire of animal self come into operation more latent power of higher self be obscured therefore be wise man who accepts emphasis of soul a guidance in choice of friend in doing of deed because men influenced by selfishness follow lead path in life becomes much more complicated than need be hear blatant trumpeting of desire not still small voice of conscience not being particularly metaphysical montrose be ignorant of safeguard did not heed warning of danger given at first meeting with enistor schemer better informed accepted knowledge that here be foe to be wary of must have be surprising have not done so a apart from hatred sprang into lively being at first touch of hand narvaez have spoken plainly moreover montrose be detestable person who have secured lady staunton fortune to regain allow spaniard to execute dark design enistor masked hatred under fine show of courtesy behaving with such apparent sincerity that douglas be entirely deceived a day slipped by there be change in gracious attitude of host grew to like to admire to enjoy companionship be little to be wondered at a enistor being well read well bred must make extremely agreeable when chose to do so for obvious reason did so choose so did away with mysterious repulsion of first meeting that became only dim memory to montrose at end of seven day visitor persuaded without great difficulty that enistor be most excellent man agreeable friend one likely to prove ideal father in law alice be relieved to see that two men got on so well together more than ever decided that have deceived with regard to father true character have think bridged gulf between explained one sunday morning when with montrose be descending hill to polwellin church father never got on well until came dearest father character take time to realise be prompt reply look stern be of reserved nature when one come to know have sweet kernel for rugged rind at first did not think must get on well together be mistake be ripping fine chap a good a make do like father for own sake for mine asked alice doubtfully for sake rejoined young man positively seeing that be here to rob of dearest treasure think be behaving wonderfully h be murmured alice not wholly agreeing with valuation be so sure father look at in different way from what do naturally be different kind of love from what said quite expected to find father bear tyrant instead of being be delightful in way think be quite fair to perhaps girl be still undecided have altered much since came douglas have brought best out of be more human same stopped abruptly well then same nothing said alice abruptly passed swiftly into church where further speaking be out of question much to relief what have meant to say did not say be concerned with uncomfortable under current of thought regarding father surprising attitude owing to relationship between be difficult to judge impartially yet alice wished to do so if only to satisfy own conscience remembering man lifelong indifference coldness utter want of consideration girl left that aggressive amiability be assumed for purpose what that purpose might be must not conjecture unless have to do with recovery of fortune now knew have not lost with equanimity even if marriage with douglas took place be hard to see how father hoped to benefit knew from experience that did not hold with altruism filial sentiment made strive to please on forced assumption that in spite of appearance really did love somehow must not convince that such be case be acting affectionate father a be acting affectionate daughter yet did not think that believed in more than believed in be very difficult very disagreeable be useless to discus matter with montrose for reason have ended conversation by entering church young man father have become excellent friend must never believe that enistor be anything what presented to be in fact douglas have told very plainly that have misjudged father own surface thought implying that such be case inflicted pang intuition scouted idea of misjudgment a one human being adjusting to human being knew how to act a child striving to understand parent be quite bewildered finally decided that only thing to be done be to accept situation a father wished to be accepted if only for sake of peace quietness squire be willing to permit marriage be doing best to be agreeable to future son in law nothing else mattered for moment having arrived at sensible conclusion alice compelled to attend to service be by mean interesting one a there be want of warmth colour about reduced whole to monotonous repetition of fine phrase vicar be thoroughly good man earnest sacrificing with so moral temperament that entirely failed to understand sinner not understanding be unable to give sympathetic help practical experience of temptation teach must scold wrong doer with great anger box ear so to speak not because be bad tempered man for simple reason that must not see sin from wrong doer point of view a mr sparrow said again again did not want to run away with neighbour wife did not desire to drink too much to cheat to swear so why asked plaintively must parishioner desire to do such uninviting thing by inborn obtuseness missed aim a invariably attempted to bully ignorant wrong into becoming enlightened right without necessary explanation naturally genuinely tried to help resented process robbed of self respect gave logical reason for doing other than crude desire bade therefore while remained member of church accepted ecclesiastical scolding stolidly a part of burden of life be called upon to bear because must not help bearing others took refuge in beer shop rejected authority also there be few who joined nonconformist sect of democratic type where congregation controlled preacher turned out if view be unsatisfactory to narrow understanding result of thing be chaos mr sparrow lamented that have to deal with such stiff necked people yet have be able to explain reasonably what taught have possessed tact to coax instead of bullying must soon have reduced whole parish to order a matter of fact in one way vicar be better than religion not that religion be not true helpful because knew only externally taught by letter rather than by spirit in first lesson read about angry jealous god of jew in second declared everlasting love of father who sent beloved son to suffer for child naturally congregation must not understand such contradiction mr sparrow did not explain because did not understand therefore on sunday be rather failure while on week day be highly successful fisherman wife must comprehend parson who helped in small need talked kindly to shared joy a well a sorrow what must not comprehend be priest who tried to bully into seeking vague state of existence to appeared to be vapour moonshine wanted proof at least reason got neither in sermon mr sparrow told who listened drowsily that if be black with sin must go to hell if kept innocently white must arrive in dreamland heaven made provision for grey people a majority of congregation if not whole belonged to third category being particularly good particularly sinful alternative did not interest much in church adopted various attitude said certain word sang certain tune went through set ceremony with vague idea that be necessary somehow to arrange matter for vague future when montrose came out commented on orderly behaviour utter ignorance of what meant though of course added truthfully there be who understood more than rest still what clockwork ceremony oh douglas liturgy of church of england be very beautiful most beautiful mind of man can conceive admitted readily what can be more glorious than litany includes possible petition that mortal can offer said understandingly nothing can be more helpful mr sparrow read beautifully response be made correctly oh yes missed living spirit be word repeated parrot fashion by majority say of present what can vicar do douglas know how dull people be be child more le stupid said montrose with conviction can grasp very little since mr sparrow teach to love god love neighbour be doing that can do must colour greyness of sermon must speak in parable a master did then must arrest attention idea if put picturesquely must stick in mind man will forget series of admonition if stated baldly will certainly remember if connected with story perhaps said alice doubtfully mr sparrow be really good man be that rather irrelevant observed young man dryly quite admit that be good man be not fault that church have lost esoteric knowledge be reserved for intellectual who wished to believe with head a well a with heart be only sample of many parson intention be of best doe not speak with conviction to mind be true believer urged girl rather distressed be sure be everything be genuine kind replied lover trifle impatiently lack that wisdom come from logical reasoning on thing discourse about can religion be proved logically certainly only when one know esoteric teaching church have church have lost eberstein have taught much of to during last three year there be few question connected with religion bible can not answer in at least reasonable way go to mr sparrow will assure that question ask be mystery into must not pry what be result alice be sure ca say answered good humouredly result be continued montrose growing more vehement that whenever man begin to think leaf church from sheer inability to gain information be needed to reconcile what be taught with common sense only people who think who be christian because happen to have be brought up christian remain in church accept emotionally blindly be told on ecclesiastical authority that when examined be authority at to thinking man inner teaching give perfectly reasonable logical explanation prof that exoteric teaching be true believe that church set forth save one word 'eternal before one word 'hell then know why believe can defend belief in most positive manner so that man with common sense must admit logic of argument think if parson knew of teaching gave out how church must be thronged people be not irreligious nowadays there never be time when men woman wished to know about truth more anxiously than do to day go to in authority be given stone in place of bread why will not parson take teaching can not say change nothing teach outwardly save horrible doctrine of eternal punishment give back to in rational convincing way faith be gradually losing yet church go on blindly repeating same thing sunday after sunday until have lost force inner teaching must revive that force if accepted church must be able to fulfil true mission be to lead civilisation a be child will not stay with pain be forcing most advanced soul to try understand problem of existence understanding esoteric teaching give a have proved church must be teacher not pain come from ignorance fisherman woman must only be bewildered if sought to understand problem of life in way do of course because be at higher point of evolution what be be only pain drove to acquire further knowledge a pain will drive in future life what mr sparrow teach be right be satisfied with bread desire cake what maintain be that vicar must know more then must do more good with simple instruction by luring on to think d e f a well a b c however be good man doe best according to light be well daresay be interesting man when talk archaeology because be hobby be sincere oh douglas be sure mr sparrow religion be sincere be sure be assented montrose quickly understanding be so limited that be unable to make religion interesting believe alice that since met eberstein learned what religion really be find most interesting thing in world know little a yet a learn slowly still be beginning to grasp great scheme of present

don pablo gave detail what old beast said montrose if be that fisherman 'd screw neck put such idea into job head cried alice rebukingly be angry enough a be worse for don pablo dear so left matter be of le importance then than became afterwards chapter xiii further small beer chronicle when young people went to church enistor took opportunity of paying visit to narvaez effort to keep up appearance of friendship for man hated be not easy squire wished to unbend in society of one who knew true sentiment also greatly desired to learn what be don pablo plan regarding restoration of fortune for spaniard did not seem to be moving in matter at valuable time be being wasted since enistor be anxious to get rid of montrose a speedily a possible thought be just a well to suggest that scheme might be must be completed a soon a must be conveniently managed master of tremore wanted to handle coveted income wished to see daughter married to narvaez finally desired to learn nature of danger at don pablo hinted so frequently of course marriage with spaniard by making possible training of alice clairvoyant power must soon disclose last enistor walked leisurely over moor to where evil mount with crown of monolith be indistinctly outlined against grey sky a be now autumn heaven have lost summer azure earth have be stripped of flowering splendour wandered through ruined world where red brown yellow of dying bracken be veiled in chilly mist ground be sodden herbage be dripping wet cry of bird sounded mournful a though be regretting passing of warm weather that enistor must see prostrate body of man lying amidst fantastic colour of moorland seemed to be so much in keeping with general air of decay sadness that did not even start when bent over still form did utter ejaculation when looked at white face recognised julian hardwick why artist must be here in unconscious condition enistor did not pause to inquire be above man of action a be necessary to revive hardwick hastened to fill cap with water at convenient pool chill of fluid on white face flushed with returning life when enistor loosened collar shook body julian opened eye languidly in half dazed way murmured something about hint squire acted upon by searching artist pocket soon found what looked for drink of generous liquor revived hardwick so speedily that be soon able to sit up talk heart be weak said in stronger voice buttoning collar enistor be frankly amazed why always look singularly healthy because be big well covered with flesh be natural must think so mr enistor heart doe do work properly be why live so much in open air talk so much be exhausting hardwick took second drink of brandy a heart quickened began to look more like old self be right now assured helper can manage to crawl to lodging lie down for time got on to foot stretched languidly always carry brandy on chance of attack must have used brandy have not be here to help said squire bluntly if be liable to such seizure must not venture to wander on lonely moor by perhaps not be rarely become so incapable thank very much for being so kind will go home now then enistor made effort rather amazed let take home hardwick be not fit to go by hardwick be a amazed a man who made offer did think must bother about in way said weakly then straightened with effort thank same can manage giving preserver friendly handshake moved along path meandered towards polwellin squire stood looking after thinking that might fall again require further assistance tall figure moved steadily through mist apparently possessed of sufficient vital power to reach haven of home in safety then squire thoughtfully resumed way to don pablo cottage wondering at discovery have made hardwick looked so strong well be so massive imposing in appearance that one must possibly have guessed that heart be weak enistor did not wonder at alone wondered also at own kind offer to go out of way to help one in distress be rather weak thing to do reflected not at action of narvaez must approve same enistor resolved to tell spaniard if only for own glorification don pablo be seated by huge fire in sinister study with paper in hand covered with odd sign hieroglyphic with usual serenity murmured welcome pointed to chair did not speak further for moment enistor employed time in trying to read inscrutable face be seamed with thousand wrinkle made quite inhuman by passionless look of cold steady blue eye shortly old man laid paper aside with sigh of satisfaction what be doing asked enistor curiously have be casting hardwick horoscope be unexpected reply for satisfaction of own curiosity gave day hour of birth smiled in cruel way think will be pleased at what have to tell telepathic message passed swiftly from one trained brain to other enistor nodded in surprised manner may die at moment said squire translating don pablo thought well be very likely found unconscious on moor short time ago be not dead questioned narvaez with unusual interest oh revived with water brandy have in pocket also offered to see home why demanded other coldly well seemed weak how often have told that other people trouble concern enistor if choose to waste power on assisting weaker person will lose much force better employed in own gain be not quite so hard a be snapped squire sharply not quite so wise mean be unmoved response however pardon weakness on occasion a want hardwick to die yet do wish to die at last word implied that did be part of plan to get fortune desire also mean that will secure daughter a wife see there be need for to see said narvaez tyrannically do what tell will be well do mean to kill hardwick there be need for to move finger horoscope show early death from natural cause having found unconscious leave to guess what cause will be have need to guess hardwick heart be weak exactly organ of body be healthy have not sufficiently strong heart if must get fresh supply of vitality must be powerful long lived man do intend to give vitality sneered visitor narvaez chuckled yes will see that splendid body walking about filled with strenuous life day soon body walking about enistor stared keenly at mocking cruel face must say speak very strangely speak a speak what mean to say say rejoined don pablo enigmatically let change subject a be busy errand only came to get taste of young prig out of mouth waste time why ca rely on own strength be not going to have here draining particularly when body have at present be so frail act courteous host give young fool a much of daughter company a desire rest can be left to when be going to move in matter when time be ripe when choose how often be to tell that be impossible to hurry thing corn take time to grow rose take time to unfold everything in visible invisible world progress inch by inch step by step nature a must know by time be tortoise not kangaroo there be reason why came said enistor accepting rebuke with meekness foreign to nature that fisherman trevel well be annoyed because give girl jewel waken ambition to be something better than domestic drudge annoyance extends to intention to kill said enistor dryly advise to be careful master trevel be dangerous dangerous narvaez spoke with supreme contempt know what be yet talk of danger to from ignorant boor must guard in hundred way if so chose ended narvaez deliberately choose wonder what mean may wonder threatened men live long content with proverb now go be busy without word enistor rose walked to door there paused to say few word not complimentary to narvaez said with black look of suppressed rage treat like dog snarled weaker man be careful that bite like dog trust a little a one else be always on guard said magician mildly stared in cold sinister way at pupil enistor felt wave of cruel force surge against force struck with dull stunning blow of hammer twisted nerve so sharply that for dogged pride must have shrieked with pain a be writhed grew deadly pale sweat beading brow showing what agony suffered hour seemed to be concentrated into one long minute during narvaez held in vice of will made suffer torment of damned beat dog when bite said unemotional voice go enistor conquered by supreme pain crept away in silence a door closed heard master chuckle like parrot over piece of cake squire returned painfully to tremore cursing for having be fool a to defy man possessed of super physical power twice before have done so time don pablo have inflicted torment man more learned than ordinary hypnotist simply used in greater degree will suggestion one employ hypnotist can make subject believe that have toothache have taken poison by insisting with superior force that will so believe narvaez more learned in law govern creation compelled enistor in way to feel torment of heretic on rack without resorting to ordinary necessity of casting subject into hypnotic trance if enistor have concentrated will must have repelled suggestion have not terrific power of concentration age of exercise have given don pablo be in presence of powerful influence directed by equally powerful will therefore have weapon with to fight dark master in fury enistor wished that must make narvaez suffer in same degree knew that must never hope to do so even if became possessed of knowledge of concentration of more powerful will than be human spaniard knew of way must baffle attack sole consolation enistor have to pacify wounded pride be that there be disgrace in mere mortal being beaten by superman narvaez in minor degree be god very evil god worshipper who did not obey felt very speedily what deity must do enistor have wish to measure force with so powerful being again for rest of week left magician alone devoted to entertaining guest be impossible to induce narvaez to act until chose to act must be done be to obey instruction behave agreeably to montrose so that visitor might be lulled into false security never be there so amiable host a squire never be there so genial companion douglas became quite fascinated with personality transcended own young man be so much weaker than host that latter wondered why narvaez did not compel to surrender fortune by putting forth resistless power have enistor guessed that montrose desire to do good to love one nullified evil spell must have wondered le at same time enistor must have understood how not having unselfish love in own breast lay open to assault of magician a treated others so be treated realisation of golden truth must have enabled to defy narvaez suggestion mere fact that wished to exercise same might over right free lance law prevented understanding how to defend from more accomplished devil don pablo be a much devil a there be possible to be one since wholly obeyed instinct carefully fostered of hate selfishness enistor be very minor devil indeed a have too much of milk of human kindness in a yet to equal rival superior fiend in determination to act comedy thoroughly enistor went to great length of asking vicar wife to dinner a mr sparrow have never before be invited to break bread under squire roof be extremely surprised by unexpected honour at first be minded to decline since enistor never came to church never took least interest in matter connected with parish mr sparrow pointed out that desire for company might be sign of grace that if went might entail reformation of host also dinner be sure to be good must wear new dress in decent society very rarely have opportunity of doing urged in way having certain amount of curiosity of own regarding splendour of big house mr sparrow sent acceptance in neat oxford calligraphy squire gave to daughter told to order dinner see that be good one said enistor genially sparrow be a lean a fasting friar wo object to decent meal for once be lent of confounded church feast be no answered alice very much puzzled by unusual behaviour why do ask mr mr sparrow to dinner thought did like be couple of bore be rather dull here for montrose must get what society can to cheer up think douglas be very well satisfied with company retorted girl rather nettled by implied slight two bore a call certainly will not amuse very well ask hardwick also be bore montrose like julian be very well father have be since found on moor fainting will send invitation will ask senor narvaez said father sharply uneasily for body still tingled with memory of don pablo reproof sha submit to ordeal of enduring so dull set of people complimentary to said alice dryly then regretted retort be sure wish to make thing pleasant for douglas of course wish to stay here a long a like said enistor with emphasis must not quite understand see that everything be all right dear want dinner party to be success rather amazed at way in usually selfish father sacrificed alice consulted housekeeper made preparation for rare festivity when evening came parson wife duly arrived at heel followed hardwick who have willingly accepted chance of evening in company of alice whom loved a sister montrose who appealed to a unusually agreeable decent fellow squire welcomed guest cordially took mr sparrow in to dinner be faded colourless woman with washed out appearance markedly accentuated by gauzy grey dress wore alice in delicate pink frock set off evasive beauty to great advantage looked like fresh sunrise beside wet misty autumn day douglas must not keep eye off hardwick be equally pressing in attention must not over tax strength julian said alice when found at dinner table between artist mr sparrow who have escorted thereto oh be right now replied hardwick better worse than ever be be surprised when father told be greatly grieved julian seems so strange that big man such a be must be so delicate must see doctor have seen several can do good said artist sadly in way be healthy so there be nothing to cure lack be what can not give be new supply of life force if be vitality want hardwick said montrose speaking across table must consult dr eberstein who be coming down shortly to perchton be wonderful in many way be certain must do good can not breathe more breath of life into man than what that man already have said mr sparrow in tone of sad rebuke god alone be able to do therefore murmured mr sparrow in equally sad tone must pray for strength mr hardwick be told to do so thought be spiritual strength what more do want replied lady forgetting exact point under discussion let watch pray lest fall into temptation dear murmured vicar in undertone for felt that conversation be too professional for occasion quite so said mr sparrow taking hint did not open mouth for time save to eat drink same watched for opportunity to lead conversation towards such religious topic a husband be interested in be to be done with view of surprising squire with extent of husband knowledge now have managed to enter big house did not intend to go out again in hurry enistor be valuable parishioner if must be brought to defer to mr sparrow much must be done with with money table looked charming with snow white napery on glittered crystal silver while dinner service be thing of beauty scarlet golden autumn leaf decorated board mellow light of many wax candle well cooked food delicious wine impressed vicar wife greatly even felt little angry that heathen a squire surely be must posse luxury while mr sparrow capable of being bishop in opinion be content with unlovely surroundings plain viand prepared in anything inviting way by one servant not content be wrong word to use put up with ascetic living while wicked meaning mr enistor lived on fat of land be enough to shake faith of christian lady in fairness of thing truth to tell mr sparrow in spite of anxious faith frequently doubted if world be governed justly husband did that bible told to do in way of living uprightly unselfishly therefore must certainly long before have sat under own fig tree possessing beef land according to promise a be be a poor a rat rather a church mouse seemed to be more ecclesiastical comparison clearly there be something wrong somewhere in way in mundane matter be ordered meantime squire have started mr sparrow on archaeology a best way of keeping off theology parson be talking eagerly about certain red granite heart inscribed with weird sign have dug up on hill where roman camp be to be seen near cottage of spanish gentleman explained precisely know said enistor indeed knew hill very well in way of mr sparrow must scarcely have approved there be druidical altar there went on clergyman eagerly have doubt many dreadful sacrifice took place there in old day heart will be delighted to show if call at vicarage mr enistor doubt have to do with terrible rite earlier than put in montrose unexpectedly heart be symbol of atlantean race a cross be symbol of aryan hieroglyphic on mean doubtless sacred word 'tau aum be sacred word of present people tau aum atlantean echoed sparrow much perplexed what do mean must take too long to explain sir dr eberstein who told about thing be best person to consult wish to consult one said parson drawing up believe heart to be symbol of druid symbol of atlantis rather insisted montrose very land on be be part of great continent of atlantis mere fable sir be thinking of myth plato mention be myth actual truth mr sparrow atlantis did exist be overwhelmed by flood will find mentioned in bible absurd name of atlantis be not mentioned in holy scripture there be proof that what plato say be true much proof that a far back a archaeologist can go civilisation of egypt be in full swing where did that civilisation come from grew up in valley of nile certainly beginning be brought to valley of nile by highly civilised race remember be egyptian priest who told plato about atlantis knew because egypt be colony of mighty continent there be colony in central america will find vast ruin of city described in book by desire charnay civilisation of mexico peru destroyed by spaniard be last remains of splendour of atlanteans where did hear mr montrose asked squire quickly from dr eberstein can ask for yourself when come down must like to meet said mr sparrow primly think that will agree with single word say then why ask asked montrose very naturally to confute sir what know of early world be contained in genesis there be mention of atlantis there although there be of egypt what about chronology of bible have be proved mr sparrow a archaeologist must admit that civilisation of egypt extends further back than date given in genesis a beginning of world what do say to must say great deal retorted parson whose archaeological knowledge be always struggling with religious belief be not time place to say more when dr eberstein who be authority for startling statement arrives will be happy to thresh matter out with will be intellectual pleasure get few opportunity of sort down here be very probable said hardwick nodding parishioner be good sort not very learned have need to be learned mr hardwick let fulfil daily task be satisfied with position in have be placed if take advice said squire dryly there will be chance of rising in world why must try to rise demanded mr sparrow coming to husband aid well dear lady be said that common garden millionaire usually start pile with proverbial halfpenny if accepted husband ruling must never attempt to rise be divinely ordained that people must be high low rather hard on low people think one must be dissatisfied be only thing make for progress did promulgate extraordinary doctrine in village mr enistor replied squire glancing at parson who spoke why because of parishioner be very dissatisfied indeed mr trevel be hard up last winter prayed for money did not get told that did not intend to pray more a seemed useless what explanation did give asked alice anxiously be horrified at impiety miss enistor a right minded person must be of course murmured montrose ironically how dare ask for money when be hard up mr sparrow took notice of told that god thought required discipline that must not complain why must require discipline rather than millionaire asked julian may have more original sin in said mr sparrow floundering in bog getting quite out of depth well said montrose grimly if according to teaching mr sparrow start a brand new soul given set of circumstance over have control at outset with same goal of heaven hell at end seems to that one ought to start at scratch not at said parson doggedly illogical be rich be poor be clever be stupid be ill be well be divinely ordained so unfair urged julian seeing absurdity of speech what sir will clay say to potter what want to be really see why clay must put in mr enistor who liked to see parson driven into corner especially when clay have nerve be divinely ordained repeated mr sparrow piously must not murmur regard mr trevel a most impious person for daring to rebel when prayer be not answered told that said wife only laughed bitterly expect murmured montrose poor soul will give money in morning said mr sparrow will only confirm in disbelief on contrary will restore faith remarked squire coolly a will show that prayer be answered after mr sparrow have nothing to say after although greatly longed to preach sermon to present not being in pulpit feared lest statement must be contradicted by ribald people therefore wisely held tongue on religious subject for rest of evening on way home however made one scathing remark to wife be atheist jane just kind expected to find under roof of man who doe not come to church chapter xiv preparation on morning of third day after dinner montrose received letter from dr eberstein saying that be arriving in perchton same evening at once young man decided to see friend at watering place stay there for night be anxious to tell doctor how enistor character have be misunderstood what agreeable man be to live with also asked squire if must bring back eberstein for few hour visit to enistor heartily agreed schemer be looking forward to meeting man if be simply man not something greater whom narvaez called adversary confident of receiving support from don pablo squire be anxious to come to grip with opposing power wished to thwart plan suspense of delay in decided action being taken chafed enistor considerably wished to arrive at desired conclusion a swiftly a possible narvaez advised waiting enistor rejected advice have not inexhaustible patience of master alice suggested that a hardwick be going on day to perchton to consult doctor about health douglas must accompany artist a usual have borrowed rich friend motor car when message be sent to replied that must be delighted to have montrose with to avoid necessity of car climbing hill to tremore douglas went down to polwellin with medium sized bag containing what necessary required for night absence alice walked with left bag at hardwick lodging where car be to arrive time during afternoon be already long after midday having to get rid of hour of waiting girl proposed that must call on dame trevel said must help douglas reminded of course must have seen on morning after dinner when told mr sparrow must give money be wrong of not to keep promise vicar will think that be like one else say much do little think vicar will think anything about matter said alice candidly mr trevel be heretic in eye simply because wo believe blindly against better reason there be great want of logic about priestly authority with teacher of exoteric knowledge be 'obey be damned be something like reported motto of french revolution brother will kill ' mr sparrow be good man douglas admitted long ago that be good man dear good man with limited understanding can do more harm than bad man there be other way of teaching child than by boxing ear until be stupid with pain think dame trevel must like to be called child said alice with amused laugh dear majority of human being be child longer live more see that be child in many way although a eberstein be widening limitation be beginning to grow up child montrose spoke half to half to companion what else instead of cake toy want gold land power pleasure whether deserve not clamour for just like child become cross when thing go a wish slap bad naughty table have hurt baby in shape of anything impedes getting what desire good lord how can man be angry with man when know that enemy be child to know one must be more than child do call child asked alice pouting at very door of dame trevel cottage montrose bent to kiss very charming child who will never be put into corner by talk a though be only wise man in existence yes assented montrose laughing speak a though be judge of earth instead of being denizen la rochefoucauld say that go in alice let get interview over have overmuch time mr trevel received visitor in clean little room poorly furnished fairly comfortable be gaunt old creature london born london bred so did not speak in cornish way indeed thanks to authority of school board local dialect be fast disappearing girl idly remembered at moment how ordinary be wording of rose penwin fisherman lover sight of dame trevel seated in big chair suggested name a absence of west country shibboleth in speech suggested thought of younger generation whose dialect have be so to speak wiped out old woman be glad a usual to see nursling highly approved of handsome young man who be to marry a polwellin knew by time hope will be sunshine with two said mr trevel when visitor be seated that will live to see child child playing about knee dear with alice beside be bound to be sunshine replied douglas heartily be angel ah young sir men always call woman so before marriage what do call afterwards that depends mainly on woman fancy said montrose dryly wife can make husband chooses silk purse out of sow ear retorted miss enistor saucily douglas understand one nurse there will be cause for quarrel wish must say same about lad girl have set heart on marrying sighed dame trevel laying down knitting removing spectacle be more fault than though rose be flighty piece wo listen to reason said alice shaking head wisely doe woman ever listen to reason inquired montrose with shrug from man wo from woman will be cynical have talked to rose without success ended alice turning to nurse so have dearie then told to mind own business a if be business to see that lad got decent wife there be real harm in rose cried alice hastily be not saying there be why must take jewel from foreign gentleman make job wild understand woman be fond of jewel suggested douglas why not if get in right way snapped mr trevel ungraciously rose be to marry lad want visiting that old gentleman taking

marry love by father wish swear never by own will december may have pretty match must be marry douglas one else nurse father may say do be dour gentleman be squire said mr trevel shaking head not pleasant to cross never treated mother well faded like delicate flower blown upon by cold wind to dearie behaves cruel in way of rent for bringing up doe mean to said alice distressed driven to defending father although knew only too well high handed method with tenant who must not must not pay out of fullness of heart mouth speaketh quoted mr trevel in sour way if doe mean why doe do do what say will turn out bag baggage if pay rent cried old woman excitedly how can when fishing be bad job ca earn enough to keep thing going make trifle by knitting wo boil pot winter approaching too oh what be to be done montrose glanced at alice handed piece of paper to speaker pay rent with use what be over to buy food coal mr trevel grasped banknote with vivid spot of colour on faded cheek must scarcely speak in excitement what be oh what be answer to prayer said alice rising looking solemn prayer why be fifty pound note oh sir ca take such large sum of money from be not from said montrose hastily be merely instrument god sends money because asked to help tear fell down worn old face told passon a be no use praying moaned regretfully well see be take own time mean in end

advised alice gently well do seem worth dearie if sends may turn rose into reasonable girl be at present mr trevel be about to put away treasure trove when hesitated must take miss alice yes of course must take mr montrose be rich can well afford to give to rich have said douglas quietly be given to a steward of christ to dispense according to will did not say priggishly although to ordinary man of world way of regarding wealth must seem priggish nine people out of ten must have considered speech a one made for effect alice be tenth knew absolutely impersonal way in lover looked at money with joyful tear dame trevel showered blessing on young couple when left house be happy woman for rest of day even prospect of rose behaviour rousing job jealousy to extent of leading to serious trouble ceased to cause anxiety for moment angel have come left gift behind old woman resolved to go to vicarage confess with penitent tear that have be wrong to doubt efficacy of prayer do really regard a christ steward asked alice when two be on way to julian lodging more from curiosity than because doubted yes thought knew well enough to believe so darling of course when be wife will use money to make comfortable will have even luxury of life must share good fortune with le fortunate people why not sell have give to poor suppose there come stage when one doe that mused montrose more to than to girl have not yet reached that point know what poverty be in most sordid aspect wish to undergo experience again most can do be to share paused then went on in doubtful manner expect blessed one knew that young man who have great possession to whom said that be miser be perfect in way loved money bible doe say so insisted alice quickly be reading between line dear if christ give one wealth to administer a steward must be use of steward nullifying office by getting rid at one sweep of what have to administer be hard saying in case alice must ask eberstein what think about matter besides dear hesitated closed lip well asked girl curiously nothing answered douglas a alice have answered on previous occasion there be puzzled rather pained look in eye a spoke word car be already standing at door of julian lodging julian be already in vehicle while montrose bundled in beside alice stared at artist laughed at healthy look for seemed to have entirely recovered from experience on moor what fraud be julian talking about heart being weak said in jesting manner look big strong healthy eye be bright colour be ruddy be picture of samson julian nodded gaily feel like samson to day said tucking rug about companion leg own sometimes a at present must jump over moon at other time must knock down with feather how strange said girl thoughtfully man be queer animal cried douglas lightly

spinning along winding level towards watering place julian a alice have noted be full of life chatted great deal about thing that also asked montrose question about teaching of eberstein since curiosity have be aroused long since by of apparently odd thing young man said so simply serenely be not first time that have conversed on subject of reincarnation kindred association julian be not prepared to accept what termed theory of successive life a gospel wanted physical proof for super physical knowledge a montrose assured be absurd when be able to leave body consciously enter into unseen world will be given positive proof regarding truth of reincarnation law of cause effect be termed karma by eastern teacher until time come must accept law on logical ground since alone explain

woodland stone throw away where tree be being tormented by blustering wind pondered over problem must find answer thereto after pause eberstein advanced laid kind hand on shoulder reading thought pitying perplexity teaching be meant to stimulate mind said impressively therefore hint be given rather than full explanation pupil have to use brain to expand hint into necessary knowledge in way progress a what gain by system of instruction be thoroughly learned must not be case if path be made easier think christ taught in way mention mused montrose remember how many of saying puzzled for

only instruct in parable give hint by doing last roused spoke to into puzzling out meaning give example four gospel be filled with example to take one instance when people asked 'who be son of man ' jesus replied little while be light with ' if people must have connected saying about light of world with speech must have grasped fact that spoke of be son of man be light of world quoted eberstein sadly from st john gospel though have done so many miracle before yet believed not on before montrose must comment on speech alice entered room flew like homing bird to nest in arm looked weak very pale with dark circle under eye have general appearance of debility for moment did not notice doctor must only weep on lover breast mindful that be not to ask indiscreet question douglas must only

to sleep yet alice looked at two men in bewildered manner rest doe seem to have done good feel a if have walked mile do think that what suffered from darkness last night have exhausted yes replied quietly be hour of gethsemane now be feeling better light be around again life force be rebuilding strength look into eye instinctively obedient alice did so already through doctor hand felt warm current passing up arm into body when met steady grey eye magnetism of life power be giving tingled throughout entire frame brightness returned to eye colour of health flushed cheek nerve ceased to thrill with pain muscle grew strong in silent astonishment montrose looked at rapid transformation be taking place under eye from colourless statue girl warmed into rosy life when eberstein dropped hand sprang to foot to stand in shaft of sunlight have broken through heavy cloud of autumnal day oh feel have be born again to more splendid life cried in ecstasy looked a though be transfigured certainly be case oh thank doctor thank thank how did do yes how did do asked douglas also intensely curious suppose must call case of hypnotic suggestion smiled eberstein putting explanation in

alice radiant with unusual life smiling like goddess of spring thing be wonderful because thing be god manifest in many thank child alice be silent for moment breathed inward prayer of profound gratitude be echoed in thought of lover then descended to earth apologised for absence of father went to see if don pablo be better will be back to luncheon be message sent up to room quite understand said eberstein nodding gravely of course don pablo be old man have not much strength must give to said alice rejoicing in glorious vitality must can not because don pablo must refuse to accept help from must will not because must turn such strength to evil purpose alice nodded shivered be not good man hate must pity be not good be true be because be dominated by lower self for a for men god have nothing everlasting love be enemy remonstrated girl perplexed feel that be enemy doctor what of doe not great master tell to love enemy standard be impossible to reach said montrose quickly if act in own strength be thing be possible with god only in strength do conquer think of narvaez a bad for by doing so angry thought add to burden of evil bear send thought of love pity to refresh struggling soul animal force be striving to overwhelm be sorry for in one way murmured alice at least think that be sorry have reason to be think truly be said eberstein dryly because read letter of commandment comprehend spirit can not very well explain to to montrose a limitation be yet great ask to pity man to hope that may grow better oh will do said douglas readily there be great room for improvement be there in narvaez a in in alice in enistor who can afford to throw stone at one montrose flushed trifle at implied rebuke never dreamed of defending a looked upon doctor a oracle to be listened to obeyed with reverence eberstein smiled approvingly when noted how young man curbed thought word then changed subject by commenting on impressive look of house commanding situation alice be gratified to hear tremore praised hinted at uncomfortable atmosphere of place always feel a though be battling against depression here doctor room furniture be so sombre house have own psychic atmosphere come from saying doings of who live in explained visitor can not say that influence of beautiful place tends to calm spirit montrose agreed when first came here felt that be kind of battle ground full of tumult war so be invisible force of good evil strive here continuously a can feel sense also alice a be more le clairvoyant yes know admitted girl with nervous glance round room evil be stronger than good fancy at present be case must change condition make house centre of holy power to bless instead of curse will have to keep out of place then observed douglas abruptly will be difficult a be friend of squire quite so said eberstein calmly came here to aid mr enistor a well a to help alice be being wrongly guided by narvaez a if mention of name have evoked presence squire made appearance unexpectedly did not look pleased a don pablo have refused to see for first time during acquaintanceship enistor therefore returned in somewhat gloomy frame of mind smoothed brow assumed company manner when greeted doctor knew well enough that guest be adversary so often mentioned by narvaez knew also how law of love eberstein obeyed prevented hostile treatment therefore felt safe indeed rather contemptuous since be unfettered by scruple did not care what mean employed against aim of doctor might be yet downfall of narvaez on previous night must have warned against over confidence must have done so have not man be so besotted with intellectual pride eberstein knew of satanic attitude gave sign of knowledge beyond pitying glance at enistor powerful face when shook hand have beautiful place here remarked lightly be just admiring position when came in be well enough trifle lonely said squire rather ungraciously still can amuse by showing family treasure be many how do feel alice asked turning abruptly to daughter anxiously wondering if be aware of information have given on previous night hope be better oh be quite well now father dr eberstein have done good have excellent bedside manner interposed eberstein quickly a did not wish alice to explain too much have cheered up miss enistor be well have fit of blue last night must not listen to what have to say to in library senor narvaez be there always make uncomfortable protested girl in troubled way be full of fancy alice retorted enistor in acid tone a narvaez have fainted might have remained to help however be just a well retired to bed slept for long time a be not quite last night well added with assumption of benevolence a montrose be away from be natural must feel dismal ah young men doctor steal heart of child exhibit shame in doing so said eberstein humorously cupid be ever robber mr enistor then gong thundered invitation to luncheon proved to be truly delightful meal alice with recovered strength be filled with joy of life douglas seeing in such good spirit be very merry in turn a to doctor made so entertaining in talking of be going on in great world enistor unbent considerably silently acknowledged that adversary be better company than narvaez by end of meal squire doctor be on best of term not for many long day have such gaiety reigned at tremore after luncheon alice douglas stole away after fashion of lover who desire solitude to express feeling freely enistor be left alone to entertain guest conducted doctor to library to show certain black letter folio be of great antiquity great value eberstein charmed with treasure of library with spacious room revealed to be mean judge of book furniture ancient manuscript more than ever enistor felt that debonair gentleman be not to be feared became uncommonly friendly with wish must come stay here for week doctor said impulsively be such pleasure to meet one so well read well informed on subject a be flatter responded doctor cordially must be delighted to accept invitation may do at later date meanwhile have business detains in perchton for short time have society of senor narvaez added with keen glance hear from mr hardwick whom met yesterday that be most entertaining hardly word to be used said enistor composedly wondering why reference be made be learned serious see why learning need necessarily involve seriousness knowledge must make one happy happiness show in gaiety enistor fidgeting with parchment frowned do think that knowledge must make one happy why not if knowledge be rightly applied in what way to help others le learned why must be demanded enistor defiantly why must not be countered doctor swiftly what be use of hiding one light under bushel be strange sentiment from doctor implies vanity a if wished others to see envy light well suppose must be source of gratification to one be narrow mind find gratification in possessing what person lack will find explanation of real meaning in saying what surprise in text light so shine before men that may see good work glorify father be in heaven be father who doe work father therefore must surely receive praise who be father in greater sense god in minor degree ego be part of god through minor power greater power work to be glory mr enistor daresay know something of thing know great deal said squire

of weakness eberstein tolerant argument only strengthened belief judging disciple of love by own limitation enistor assured that if doctor really possessed power must make use of to gain what wanted squire be not very clear in mind a to what eberstein really did want nevertheless believed that to secure end must long since have exhibited capacity to enforce obedience on enemy far from doing even threatening doctor have merely talked ethically enistor scouted such chatter since must not indeed must not believe that power of love be stronger than even a strong a power of hate fact that narvaez have be reduced to impotence when exercising evil will must have warned squire that have to deal with overwhelming force shut eye to such plain revelation persisted obstinately in believing that be superior to gigantic power of good be simply case of will be persuaded though one rose from dead enistor declined to believe evidence of own eye there be nothing stop progress of one so much a

understand narvaez be anything philanthropist although have succeeded in convincing hardwick of kindly nature generous disposition miss enistor have doubt be borne in upon that for own mysterious end don pablo be acting comedy might in case of job certainly must turn into tragedy regarding julian legacy alice have wish to interfere so far a rose be concerned thought must be just a well to warn

since be popularly reported that younger man have stolen promised bride of older one lat um be said one of men stretching out arm to prevent montrose again falling on don pablo seemed inclined to do yes let be panted alice clinging to lover be mad will tell father how have insulted insult shrieked narvaez crawling up with expression of fiend wonder think one can insult montrose broke away from alice gripping narvaez firmly shook like terrier shaking rat wicked wretch how dare will kill if insult miss enistor further lat um be growled same man who have spoken before um be bad fur sure um be

murmured alice with white lip dragging douglas aside for young man fury be overpowering again yes will go be not master of while little reptile be about oh toad word failed montrose walked hurriedly away with alice after shaking fist at narvaez threatened to kill will remember that shouted spaniard after threatened in presence of witness montrose walking swiftly home with alice paid attention to cry turned to girl with white face of suppressed anger dilated nostril why did let twist neck growled be old man apologised alice shivering old beast be age to protect from being punished will tell father narvaez will never enter again into tremore wo come near again in hurry will warrant after shaking be dangerous dangerous said girl trembling violently there be meaning in what did heard how called on men woman to witness that have threatened will do more than threaten if dare to a much a look at again douglas be dangerous keep away from want to have anything to do with be old a say ca thrash life out of a must like to come alice will be right soon have done with narvaez have cut own throat be dangerous be dangerous be girl must say think since dim feeling that future evil must come out of present evil haunted in way must not explain have two overheard what narvaez be saying seen what be doing douglas also might have deemed man dangerous gave money to men woman who have witnessed affair told to remember threat of montrose be old man love miss enistor a daughter whimpered don pablo yet life be in danger will get police to protect a be young ruffian have almost killed with feeble gait tottered into cottage there smiled grimly when within four wall rubbed hand be first act of drama now for second chapter xviii night before enistor be furious when be told how narvaez have insulted daughter for although have little love for girl yet family pride rose up in arm against such behaviour don pablo be useful to a knew great deal about super physical law squire desired to know also in be being instructed same spaniard have proved to be hard master moreover have talked much about recovery of fortune have done little towards enabling to be regained then again narvaez have be struck down in moment of triumph by stronger force than possessed that made out to be le powerful than claimed be in one word enistor be beginning to consider don pablo to be something of humbug certainly there be pain to must subject pupil when so chose be a enistor knew mere hypnotic suggestion must be nullified by opposing will narvaez hitherto have possessed more dominating influence since capability appeared to be shattered by intervention of higher power might be that must not inflict further hurt squire wondered if must make dark master suffer by taking unawares while force be weak determined to do so if must if only to be avenged for series of petty insult to have long be subjected why narvaez must behave in such crude animal way to alice girl father must not think a have over stepped mark gave enistor opportunity of becoming openly hostile enistor be selfish unscrupulous there be that in resented treatment to alice have be subjected perhaps germ of good to eberstein have referred be sprouting with unexpected swiftness be a may enistor sought moorland cottage breathing out fire fury against former friend narvaez refused to see when enistor sternly angry sent word by old housekeeper that must break way in take consequence still refused however improved upon former message by sending intimation that must receive squire on following afternoon with enistor be fain to be content a by breaking in must only cause scandal for alice sake be not to be thought of master of tremore be very proud man must not bear to think that family name must be made subject of police court gossip when returned home believed more than ever narvaez be fraud a have not even attempted to inflict usual pain by suggestion man be getting so old that be losing nerve shortly must not be worth considering whether a friend foe having therefore lost magician dark assistance enistor decided to try to recover fortune in own way alice shaken by don pablo conduct have retired early to bed montrose be seated in library with host over after dinner coffee tobacco be still seething with anger since squire have taken matter into own hand must hing look on after full discussion of affair enistor insisted that must be shelved have talked enough about said in peremptory tone promise that narvaez will not enter door again to morrow will explain opinion to then can go hang for with regard to desire to marry alice surely after what have taken place sir must never think of possible marriage cried montrose glowing with wrath let alone fact that have tacitly agreed to alice becoming wife certainly refuse to think further of narvaez a son in law said squire stiffly in spite of wealth a regard possibility of making daughter wife rest with entirely young man laughed rested reddish hued head against back of chair if rest with matter be soon settled said with relieved expression in eye thought that squire be talking in remarkably sensible way that depends upon how reply to question be about to ask said enistor dryly inherit fortune of sister yes douglas sat up aware that conversation be becoming serious have not spoken about matter before sir must have know now that ice be broken between never in way did seek that fortune be surprise to when will read by mr cane so understand from mr cane absolve from fortune hunting since knew nothing of lady staunton intention do think be quite fair of to leave money away from own family be rather difficult question to put to man who have benefited mr enistor let remind that by marrying alice bring back fortune to family think not wife benefit alice be prepared to be banker said montrose uneasily to give what be rightfully own retorted squire with curling lip thank for nothing wo do until sister met be always intention to leave money to to restore position of family in county want fortune hold to a be poor man be not for base ambition seek income for sake of going into parliament helping to govern want power want great sphere to work in without money be condemned to stay in cramped neighbourhood eating out heart quite understand that with such ambition feel need of money mr enistor with alice permission be willing to give reasonable sum desire to forward aim enistor did not appear to be overcome by generous offer even thankful for same take nothing a gift claim right whole fortune of sister certainly ought to have willed to understood from alice that be quite agreeable that lady staunton must do what wished with own said montrose slowly tell alice everything montrose accepted small legacy said nothing about matter a there be nothing to be done until came now enistor fixed dominating gaze on douglas ask to let have money by deed of gift in return will marry alice be to live on will allow five hundred year in return for five thousand montrose laughed at boldness of demand sir can not do what ask then be fortune hunter after said squire bitterly be not douglas sprang to foot with hot blood making red cheek so far a be personally concerned care for money although deny that be glad day of poverty be over money have be given to in trust to help others can not be false to trust enistor waved hand disdainfully be only young man talk why must help others let look after think differently dr eberstein have taught differently dr eberstein said other with sneer be visionary if be to be son in law must allow to advise have always acted on own responsibility during life said montrose sharply will continue to do so dr eberstein know so much about thing not of world be always glad to hear what have to say do what tell certainly in thing have to do with spiritual welfare a regard earthly affair take own way still admit ended young man frankly that in instance eberstein advises to keep money naturally can do what like with money will be useful to ambition taunt be so puerile that failed to disturb montrose eberstein have ambition save to do good be rich enough to execute plan without aid from can not do what like with a think although be always willing to take advice be of best be not child mr enistor one who have gained experience through bitter trial may add that eberstein teaching inculcates self reliance individual judgment so that man may learn to stand alone be dreamer a be however care nothing for teaching in way have heard condition surrender fortune to marry daughter otherwise must leave house never see alice again give three day in to make up mind make up now said montrose resolute calm money have money keep with without consent alice will be wife a please replied squire frigidly polite have heard determination from will not swerve in three day can talk about subject again meanwhile let thing go on a usual conversation terminated in what might be called armed neutrality to remain in house on footing be by mean palatable to young hot headed man a douglas truly be first impulse be to leave tremore do battle with enistor from distance second to stay where be give alice safeguard of presence must depart might be that enistor must coerce girl into obedience thereby causing unnecessary suffering montrose loved alice too well to submit to such sorrow so swallowed pride said nothing about conversation a be sufficiently controlled to appear at ease alice have not faintest idea of what have taken place perhaps if have observed father sudden change towards lover from geniality to chilly politeness might have be enlightened insolent conduct of narvaez have made nervously ill be too languid to take much interest in one anything so matter remained much a usual although visitor felt that atmosphere of big house be insistently menacing sinister eberstein must have told that condition heralded breaking of storm eberstein watchful silent stayed at perchton saying nothing thinking much meanwhile polwellin seethed with gossip first item have to do with sudden illness of hardwick who be said to be dying one regretted news a artist be favourite in neighbourhood in have lived so long doctor from perchton came to see sick man mr sparrow always help in time of trouble visited bedside hardwick be grateful to see be too weak to take much interest in body soul be simply fading out of life thing of world be losing interest for departing spirit second item concerned quarrel of narvaez montrose have be reported by who witnessed with many addition be freely stated that montrose have threatened to murder spaniard for insult offered to miss enistor gossip said that if did must only be forestalling job trevel who be equally bent upon doing for foreign gentleman puzzled simple villager to understand why don pablo must return to miss enistor when have left to philander with rose penwin arrived at conclusion that be bad lot nevertheless because stranger be rich scattered money freely there be few who spoke in favour majority be hostile since mere presence of narvaez seemed to irritate be with into quarrelling even though there be cause to do so undoubtedly man have evil influence inhabitant of polwellin must not have be displeased to see male ate leave place then mr montrose must marry squire daughter job must make rose wife must mean wedding festivity plenty to eat drink in way gossip talked rumour grew so that shortly whole village be infected with uneasy fear a to what must happen seemed a though influence of dark house on hill have descended upon polwellin perhaps have perhaps have be guided in descent by man who dealt with supernatural thing in cottage squatted like toad amongst heather to same cottage enistor repaired next afternoon to keep appointment found narvaez looking older more withered than ever crouching over fire moody broken up peevish altogether unlike ordinary serene self at first glance squire decided that master be quite helpless sat down with glow of pleasure to take upper hand pleased immensely to show narvaez that also have will that also must bully that former relationship be now reversed latent cruelty in enistor rose to surface at sight of helpless tyrant late under dog now intended to bite worry a top dog have done well sir said enistor shortly what have to say for narvaez whimpered crouched still lower over fire be old man moaned very old man old scoundrel mean how dare insult daughter yesterday be against also do want to see montrose murder must serve right if did get murdered snapped squire with contempt be of use in world can see did not think so once muttered don pablo humbly be true because believed to be clever man now know that be fraud laying claim to power never possessed have felt power snarled narvaez savagely admit have why because have trained will must concentrate to compel to feel what wished be thing of past great power that laid low other night have broken will be no longer able to control be true be true have have shock great shock so if put forth will continued squire mercilessly must make endure pain inflicted on when disobeyed must have mind to do so at moment set example a did to so wish to do to daresay narvaez straightened trifle of old fire sparkled in dull eye be not yet so feeble that can not defend if necessary can not control certainly a adversary have scattered weakened will can prevent from hurting well will let off time said enistor sneering yet wondering why must show mercy after don pablo teaching let off let off screamed spaniard fiercely try if dare to measure power against mine shattered a be can gather together again remember then take care take care enistor felt qualm wondering if narvaez be so weak a pretended to be there be look in rekindled light of steady eye made doubtful of ground bold a be felt that must be rash to advance therefore retreated skilfully by changing conversation immediately be wrong to think that eberstein struck down other night be higher power who told that eberstein show how broken be narvaez when know that man have be trying to convert to way of thinking yes yes be brought very low very low indeed muttered don pablo with groan if eberstein tried to convert have succeeded very well since be only remains of power that prevent from giving pain agree with what eberstein say retorted squire tartly talked usual weak christianity of benefiting one neighbour instead of one why not take advice asked narvaez looking up with former keen glance benefiting one self have brought to if follow teaching also may come to depth be strange thing for to advise narvaez very strange must not advise if dreamed for one moment that be disposed to take right hand path power of self be too strong for enistor age after age have dominated so eberstein told time have broken bond have indeed said narvaez in strange tone staring into fire ah will please eberstein of course lose pupil gain one stand alone said enistor proudly answer seemed to satisfy don pablo chuckled hope will be able to stand alone against montrose now that can not aid have fortune remember will keep have given three day to surrender lose alice for ever mention of name cried squire lashing into fury make wonder that thrash for daring to insult cried narvaez voice broke be old man besides can still help montrose have secret can use against what be secret enistor hand have raised to strike fell by side montrose be already married be lie ask young friend if be lie talk about having insulted daughter enistor what about insult of married man coming to woo girl in so shameless fashion squire frowned be too astounded to speak for few moment during don pablo eyed curiously when did speak be again to deny truth of amazing statement beyond fact that montrose will not give up money must be mine have nothing against be well bred gentleman very well bred to pose a bachelor sneered narvaez contemptuously believe man be honest will have to prove what say narvaez do hear since be shouting so loudly can safely say that do prove what say oh certainly send montrose here to night can give absolute proof that statement be correct will come with said narvaez sharply if come will refuse to give proof in way montrose will be convinced that can prevent from marrying daughter to put thing straight may be willing to give up money even then cried enistor furiously ca allow to marry alice must be bigamist be affair hers said don pablo cynically what want be money do not at price of seeing daughter life ruined pooh what doe ruin matter to be bent upon following feeble christianity of eberstein feeble be too strong for other night be not narvaez raised to full height seemed to recover trifle of former dominance must have dealt with adversary alone power summoned to aid overwhelmed however be not to point man collapsed again into weak condition do what tell about sending montrose here at eight o'clock evening can prove that be married man if like can get through threat to expose to alice to give money will deal with said enistor angrily have to do be to prove statement can come alone when return will explain what say believe that be married think montrose will believe chuckled narvaez then waved thin hand go now enistor be tired order about in arrogant way shouted squire have not power to do so will be tired enough when montrose have done with can tell perhaps will threatened to murder to keep secret may do so care body be very old weak will be glad to get new one to work more evil remember how be warned on night when go away go away cried don pablo in shrill voice of anger eye flamed viciously know more about warning than do despise do hear despise a on night when alice soul have be loosened from bond of flesh shook fist in air enistor did not argue longer went away with contemptuous shrug of shoulder be more than ever convinced that narvaez have little power left same wounded snake might strike in hopeless rage so be not wise to tempt man too far besides on way back to tremore squire be filled with rage against douglas for tricking to think that young scoundrel be married yet came down to make love to alice eberstein must have known that montrose be not free yet also have kept silent so much for christianity professed be with black face angry heart enistor returned home found that alice lover have gone down to see hardwick in polwellin therefore nursed wrath until returned lost nothing by delay even then squire did not immediately attack young man since girl be present after dinner a decided must be able to bring montrose to book for monstrous behaviour alice must scarcely eat retired early from table julian be at death door a told father doubted if mr barrast to whom have written must arrive in time to take last farewell with squire permission returned to dying man accompanied by housekeeper enistor did not object a rather liked hardwick be sorry to hear that be passing out of life at so early age put matter out of mind when alone with montrose saw narvaez to day said abruptly tell that be already married swears that can give proof montrose sprang up almost too startled to speak be mad to say so mad not declares that such be case what have to say say why such accusation be not worth answering have never looked at woman until met alice a to being married young man paused with angry bewildered look thing be preposterous cried indignantly preposterous not narvaez declares that if go up to to night at eight o'clock will give proof oh will montrose glanced at watch be twenty five to eight now will go at once will arrive at don pablo cottage shortly after hour mention then well what then demanded squire grimly will force lie down throat raged montrose who be quite beside with anger unable to speak further left room hurriedly be narvaez liar enistor asked must find reply chapter xix morning after after breakfast disastrous news came from two quarter concerned don pablo julian hardwick while squire daughter guest be ending meal housekeeper rushed into room with agitated face to announce evil like class be delighted to be bearer of bad tidings counted upon making sensation assuredly did enistor have scarcely raised eyebrow at unceremonious entry when burst into voluble speech

death moment door be closed enistor turned to montrose with frown what do know of asked imperiously alice started spoke before lover must open mouth douglas can not possibly know anything cried indignantly what do mean father mean that montrose be last person who saw don pablo alive ca be sure of said young man very pale very quiet certainly called on don pablo shortly after eight o'clock to question concerning lie told about left time before nine perfectly well death be a great surprise to a to mr enistor hope police will take view sneered squire returned here after nine went straight to bed when might have guessed be in library waiting for report be too upset to give report said montrose shortly oh quite believe that douglas father cried alice imploringly a must not yet understand precise situation what doe mean mean so far a can judge that montrose forced lie down narvaez ' throat a said must very thoroughly do accuse of killing man said montrose hoarsely yes said squire looking at with grim directness then deny absolutely what say declared other vehemently a said before left narvaez in room shortly before nine o'clock after have confessed to that what mentioned to be untrue what did mention to father questioned girl terrified at furious look of two men be with julian until eleven when returned home have gone to bed douglas came to tell about julian father did not say that anything have happened nothing have happened then so far a know said enistor quickly dear saw don pablo yesterday told that montrose be already married married married alice started back picture of dismay be lie cried douglas fiercely passed round table to take in arm swear be lie dear when father told after dinner went at once to narvaez confessed calmly that have spoken falsely so a to prejudice chance of making wife have be younger man must have thrashed life out of a be told opinion then left quite unharmed swear that never laid finger on returned here shortly after nine o'clock to go to bed be too indignant at what have be said to seek out father explain enistor laughed coldly be very neat story do believe alice girl clung to lover believe of course believe douglas must not tell lie not even to save own neck neck be in danger said montrose haughtily know so much about that other day threatened to kill narvaez for insult offered to alice many people heard threat a know to demand explanation of lie daresay be lie left house breathing fire fury against narvaez when returned be to retire to bed without word of explanation now hear that man whom regarded a enemy be dead murdered evidence in favour of having killed narvaez be very strong purely circumstantial evidence said montrose turned paler than ever when realised position innocent men have be hanged on circumstantial evidence before now said enistor coolly although on face of admit innocence father how can think douglas must murder one ah have not belief in that have alice indeed be true said montrose bitterly have always be hostile to although for time masked feeling now seems that without shadow of proof believe to be murderer shadow of proof echoed squire tauntingly upon word think there be much more than shadow of proof threatened narvaez so did job trevel interrupted alice defiantly be probable that job murdered don pablo probable scarcely possible said father coldly however will send for perchton police strict justice will be done until truth come to light montrose must lie under suspicion leave alice never never never cried girl with arm round montrose neck be innocent wholly innocent enistor stepped forward wrenched daughter from young man obey alice command cried imperiously so far have have own way now time have come for to have mine go to room stay there until look into matter a to faced montrose who be quiet pale a still a statue must order out of house that justice must be done mean to have arrested on charge of murder mean to explain whole circumstance to perchton inspector let deal with matter retorted enistor haughtily meantime if try to escape will be taken in charge at instance by polwellin policeman understand understand that be bent upon destruction mr enistor need have fear being perfectly innocent will not attempt to escape oh douglas douglas will disobey enistor dragged back daughter forced to door go to room tell montrose clenched hand on seeing girl loved so roughly handled must hing against authority of father with one last sorrowful look alice disappeared enistor followed leaving unfortunate young man alone with misery wicked atmosphere of house seemed to bear down upon with such force that must almost feel physical pressure probably be imagination a be not sufficiently clairvoyant to see hear feel unseen in agonising moment when seemed that be being swept away by flood of evil thought turned swiftly to eberstein in man hoped to find aid even a dwelt on doctor assistance line from one of psalm flashed insistently into mind vain be help of man be phrase became vividly aware by sixth sense that salvation must only come from great power of love a manifested in lord of compassion so intolerable sense of peril seized that almost unconsciously cry for help issued from lip oh christ breathed audibly lord help lest perish might have be that intense agony of moment opened interior sens for became conscious that glorious light not of world be enfolding in radiance welled so believed from golden heart on breast a if stored up sacramental power be issuing forth to do battle with dark influence be a may montrose became aware that gloom be receding that evil be being baffled that be growing stronger by virtue of higher force to resist terror pressing in upon radiance clothed a with garment gradually died away found standing in common light of day peaceful holy uplifting feeling remained knew innocence knew also with profound thankfulness that god must make innocence apparent to others trouble prophesied by eberstein have indeed arrived very terrible be behind cloud environed shone sun of righteousness glory must sooner later dispel gloom having arrived at knowledge in way be wholly unable to explain montrose left tremore descended to polwellin here walked straight to post office sent wire to eberstein asking to come over at once must have gone to perchton instead that did not wish enistor to put threat into execution have arrested by village policeman a be became object of suspicion to fisherman wife news of narvaez violent death have travelled swiftly from ear to ear montrose be apparently looked upon a criminal evidence of who have heard threat against man be too clear to admit of doubt already accusation have be spread broadcast judging from horrified look met montrose gaze on side have be tried condemned without loss of time in spite of sustaining power felt heart sink with purely human fear be with feeling of relief that met vicar face to face from more educated man at least hoped to have justice mr montrose said vicar who looked more solemn than ever be certainly more stiff be wise to walk through village just now why must not asked young man defiantly well there be rumour rumour said mr sparrow removing clerical hat to brush bald head with nervous hand senor narvaez be dead a know be said that be responsible why must be insulted miss enistor other day in presence threatened to kill understand of course be not believer in guilt added parson quickly a from what have seen of think for moment that must shed blood of human being thank said montrose simply extended hand sparrow took with flush on parchment face be rubbish a have said burst out with very human wrath a be staying at tremore undoubtedly will be able to show that did not see senor narvaez last night be on tip of montrose tongue to confess visit something perhaps common sense prevented from incriminating instead question sprang to lip to be extremely anxious to get answer what about job trevel there be said vicar quickly rough hot tempered man like job be much more likely to have done deed though god forbid must accuse one unjustly yet job certainly hated senor narvaez on account of rose penwin uttered many threat against when news came of murder mr montrose at once went to see dame trevel remembering job enmity tell that job went out fishing last night early have not returned therefore can not be guilty then who can have murdered narvaez be hard to say of course lived in lonely situation have much wealth if rumour be to be believed will see when police come from perchton must be here soon believe that mr enistor village constable have gone to cottage to see body meanwhile mr montrose advise to return to tremore wait until learn more senor narvaez be favourite yet be dangerous for to walk about amongst rough parishioner a seem to think that be guilty montrose be coward yet did not see necessity of courting danger when benefit must be derived from such foolhardiness bowed head accepted warning thankful to think that mr sparrow did not believe to have committed crime hardwick be dead said sadly yes yes yes be world of trouble mr montrose have just seen body poor fellow look asleep rather than dead strange that must die on very morning when tragic event take place polwellin be such quiet place nothing of moment ever happens here yet now have two death one from natural cause one by violence never rain pours have much to do much to do now go back to tremore dear young friend rest assured that god will prove innocence in own good time have sympathy wife sympathy be good man be good woman mr sparrow said montrose deeply moved assure will not forget how be standing by pooh pooh of course stand by so will mr enistor there be absolutely ground for rumour against save unhappy threat must keep temper mr montrose must keep temper rather hard to do when lady be insulted said douglas dryly of course quite so if have be mr sparrow now must have forgotten calling still must fight enemy of evil feeling even against who strive to harm good day good day hope for best montrose climbing hill to tremore must have smiled on other occasion at mr sparrow fight between human failing divine command to turn other cheek to smiter did not smile a be very grateful to man for advocacy thought highly of for standing up so boldly against public opinion sparrow be limited in many way have considerable fund of common sense used to best advantage followed master a best knew how be very close to in present attitude be one few men must have assumed in face of such hostility montrose determined that when innocence be assured must repay vicar in one way meanwhile have to deal strenuously with very disagreeable situation after midday enistor returned requested interview with guest in library young man appeared looking haggard anxious be very natural considering dangerous position in stood also be angry at not seeing alice for by enistor order be not allowed out of bedroom housekeeper being on guard douglas insisted that must be permitted to have conversation with girl have right to keep apart said montrose indignantly until clear character have said enistor coldly think that be guilty ca think so why even mr sparrow whom say be narrow minded doe not believe that killed narvaez mr sparrow doe not know of visit to cottage last night doe one daughter perchton inspector came with several policeman have examined cottage body mr boyce who looked after thing for narvaez declares that someone called last night must not say who be perhaps job trevel job went out fishing last night early have not returned rose be with mother day night neither of two can be guilty from open threat be said that struck blow rather broke man neck be not strong enough to do said montrose looking at hand rage can make one strong said enistor coolly a have reason to be in rage seeing that narvaez told what believe be wicked lie may have handled too roughly did not handle at how dare say so dare too far montrose may suffer a be have proposition to make to only alice know of visit to cottage last night alice because love will hold tongue be willing to do so also if will make over fortune by deed of gift to straightaway narvaez lawyer from perchton came with police a seems dead friend have left money to hardwick for reason be vain gift a hardwick be also dead however be not point what mean be that lawyer can make out deed of gift to day can sign then will hold tongue if refuse asked montrose seeing placed perilously between devil deep sea will then tell how visited narvaez last night need hardly inform that action coupled with previous threat will bring within reasonable distance of hangman noose montrose nodded swallowed a mouth throat be very dry see danger same decline to give money then must take consequence be ready to do so give credit of not believing in guilt must scarcely compound felony know what must do what must not do said enistor coolly a know little of character be in power to hang hanged will be unless surrender money think ended man with sneer that dear friend eberstein can aid in dilemma what do think think nothing about rejoined montrose decisively have wired to dr eberstein to come over have not yet put in appearance interrupted squire with harsh laugh never will disagree when know of peril will come know of peril without telling if be wonderful man have made out to be however be unprofitable discussion question be will give money to save neck said montrose obstinately will give until six o'clock to decide squire calmly then if still refuse will inform inspector about visit to narvaez last night will mean immediate arrest subsequent punishment will mean first undoubtedly may escape second trust in god to prove innocence age of miracle be past said enistor with shrug left library to again interview inspector montrose remained where be wondering why eberstein did not come over to help at least reply to wire enistor taunt be surely true for young man have sufficient knowledge of eberstein wonderful power to be certain be aware of have taken place with ability to procure super physical knowledge probably knew who have murdered narvaez so must surely come to rescue hour passed shadow began to deepen without information montrose began to feel spirit sink again tried to invoke helpful power have aided before without success felt desperately angry against squire for behaving so wickedly resented hate directed against hate only cease by love a eberstein have said how must love even tolerate man who be bent upon encompassing destruction montrose asked question several time without getting reply be well nigh in despair when interruption came be none other than unexpected appearance of alice oh dear dear cried hastening across shadowy room to throw into longing arm have be broken hearted over must not get out to see father came time ago said must try to persuade to give up money what do say montrose asked softly give up give up what doe miserable money matter care nothing for money a well know eberstein told to keep obey in a obey in thing why have come to help sobbed girl trembling will come will do something have confidence in remember how prophesied woe said that have to learn to walk alone ca believe that one who have helped so much will desert in hour of need depend upon alice will be well what have got here be bible offered book have be trying to find comfort in ca ca everything seems to be against eberstein said that must be replied lover gloomily have proved true prophet however can only wait let father do what want to do refuse to buy safety by giving up money why not because surrender must be tantamount to admitting guilt since job can prove alibi know who murdered narvaez know own innocence be prepared to face worst then then faltered alice with white lip there be danger that may be condemned oh douglas if father reveals visit evidence be so strong against why not hide until can find out truth must have sneak away like cur cried young man in high anger be innocent therefore can meet accuser with calm mind evidence be so strong pleaded alice again if can only get time to learn truth there will be chance of proving evidence false how can get time must hide meanwhile will see dr eberstein search for person who be guilty oh if julian be only alive moaned alice clasping hand must help be dead dead have friend to help in way have god eberstein who be servant of god said montrose tenderly dearest must have faith so must besides even if did hide know of place where must be concealed do said alice eagerly thinking that speech be sign of yielding there be cave in cliff distance away from jetty where boat go out for fishing must guide there must take provision candle something to drink there must wait until thing grew quiet with dr eberstein must find out truth cave must be discovered have thought of one know of cave at least fancy so found one day by chance one must ever think of looking for there must never think have taken refuge in cave dear ca admit guilt by running away if father will destroy be true enough undoubtedly enistor must press on charge a strongly a possible montrose wavered might be reasonable to gain delay muttered oh wish eberstein be here to advise a if in answer to speech one of servant entered with telegram proved to be from doctor montrose opened when maid have left room found message rather cryptic also unsigned save by initial e ran matthew x twelve word look up text alice said young man eagerly girl luckily having bible with rapidly skimmed over leaf took book to window to read small print in fast failing light when persecute in city flee ye into read slowly must have continued verse that lover stopped with gesture be twelve word said folding up telegram rest of verse doe matter so eberstein want to fly wonder why looked woefully disappointed take advice said alice eagerly glad powerful opinion backed up always obey know yes same did not think must tell to sneak away seems to be cowardly seems like admitting guilt said in london believed in dr eberstein say same now douglas be alice decided answer know more than do about thing a prophesied that must have trouble do what say montrose frowned bit lip for faith in doctor be being sorely tried never expected to get advice coinciding with of alice idea of flight be opposed to sense of manhood same there be sense in being heedlessly rash undoubtedly eberstein must have powerful reason to telegraph a have done alice watched changing face eagerly inwardly prayed that might yield saw safety for present in flight finally with sigh took face between two hand kissed will go to cave murmured winced at such resignation to what regarded a ignoble course two put plan into execution at once stole away across moor into gathering night after certain preparation in space of hour alice regained room be apparently innocent of what have taken place douglas be safe in unknown cave with scanty store of food wine few candle gone said enistor furiously then be guilty after chapter xx unexpected a montrose have stated to alice flight be looked upon a tacit admission of guilt up to moment enistor have not be quite certain that douglas be culprit a young man have never given impression that be one likely to proceed to such extremity sudden disappearance must only mean that have done so therefore enistor very naturally concluded that montrose have be infuriated by don pablo bitter tongue into revenging hastily probably now regretted that haste whether did so not mattered little to squire that master of tremore knew be that enemy be now at mercy intended to take full advantage of opportunity first step be to inform perchton inspector of fatal visit to cottage then very speedily hue cry be out for mile round police explored country there be doubt in one mind a to actual truth threat of montrose presence at cottage at time when crime have taken place now unexpected disappearance thing showed that douglas none other be guilty person next day one be searching far wide for criminal enistor be so vindictive that offered reward must ill afford for capture of unfortunate young man did to gratify hatred have existed for many incarnation also because believed that when montrose found be impossible to escape gallows must make over wrongfully inherited money to alice once alice be in possession of income father felt convinced that must be able to handle same be very plausible plan enistor worked hard to carry out a alice have come gone in space of hour absence have not be noticed save by housekeeper squire be far from suspecting that daughter have organised flight selected hiding place a to housekeeper be quite on side of lover since did not believe for one moment that nice young gentleman like montrose have so vilely murdered don pablo therefore procured food wine candle montrose have taken with also promised to hold tongue in spite of temptation alice trusted be right to do so for woman be perfectly staunch moreover girl be glad to have one to whom must talk freely during dark day saw little of father remained in bedroom praying constantly for safety of lover be terrible ordeal for one so young delicate friendless alice felt that be being supported by master of love out of sorrow must come enduring joy mr sparrow came to see narrow minded grey woman proved to be unusually sympathetic husband must bring to believe that douglas be guilty in spite of evidence to contrary for loyal support alice be duly grateful of course vicar wife be excessively aggravating with platitude did not give much comfort be for best must not murmur at rod be for good that suffer cut dried phrase dropped incessantly from mr sparrow prim lip wrought on alice nerve to extent sometimes must have screamed knowing that grey woman meant well appreciating defence of montrose girl controlled feeling accepted exasperating condolence a genuine assuredly be longed for presence of dr eberstein wondered why did not put in appearance yet remained absent silent not even sending letter to comfort in trouble still alice have such belief in man that did not resent apparent neglect same faith be being sorely tried job trevel did not return according to mother have gone away in boat to fishing ground at six o'clock on evening of murder one therefore must suspect that have anything to do with matter polwellin folk wondered at absence rose must give explanation a death of patron caused so much grief that took to bed there be chance now that must go to london appear on stage beyond possessing jewel few article of costly clothing have benefited little by don pablo sinister friendship must not even have name mentioned now that man be dead dame trevel mr penwin hoped that rose must marry job settle down gaudy bubble blown by narvaez have burst disappointed beauty have to do best must therefore two old woman looked forward to return of job a best thing must happen to put crooked straight a weather have be stormy be presumed that job have be driven for shelter into distant cove whence must come back in due time polwellin be quite excited over tragic event have taken place village be in ferment over possibility of person that gaining reward offered by squire although acre of moorland be searched fugitive must not be discovered be over forty eight hour before first clue be found that clue came from quarter least expected also be given to man who most wanted to learn whereabouts of montrose on second day after commission of crime enistor be man mr sparrow be person who put into communication with individual who afforded desired information most wonderful thing have happened mr enistor said vicar entering library on afternoon of second day age of miracle be not yet past dear friend enistor scowled did not like to be called dear friend by parson a thought man be as be quite sure in own mind that miracle be rubbish told mr sparrow a much be palestine to be gulled by such thing live in scientific era in very godless era said vicar in tone of reproof only hope that wonderful thing have happened will convert who believe in almighty being to more reverent frame of mind be hit at squire who be looked upon a atheist by mr sparrow enistor did not take up challenge what be miracle mr hardwick be alive what squire must not feel startled at announcement ah thought must be amazed said mr sparrow complacently be work of god oh hang platitude talk rubbish why told that hardwick be dead did saw lying dead on bed mentioned to mr montrose that looked a though be asleep might be case of suspended animation continued mr sparrow brushing bald head thoughtfully something of cataleptic nature may be well well well go on there be nothing further to say mr enistor presumed dead man revived morning be now a well a be sent for immediately by landlady called to express astonishment have telegraphed for perchton doctor who deposed to death will be amazed to learn what have taken place wonderful wonderful wonderful be doubt case of catalepsy a say growled squire turning to desk again good thing for hardwick that be buried alive now can enjoy narvaez fortune have good time hope will be good man seeing that have be raised from dead like lazarus not that mr hardwick be bad indeed always thought that have sign of grace about well well resurrection give text for next sunday thought must be pleased be not pleased be not sorry retorted enistor hardwick be nonentity be nothing to thought be friend mr enistor asks to see saying that be sure will come down to at once presumes too much have quite enough to do in searching for scoundrel who murdered dear friend believe did said sparrow decidedly mr montrose be not man to shed blood did said squire grimly broke man neck if did not murder narvaez who did not job trevel who be other person who uttered threat be great mystery sighed vicar putting on hat like confounded resurrection of hardwick why deuce must stay in next world after taking trouble to go there be not much use in one so far a can see question not decree of almighty said mr sparrow rebukingly there be speaking to deaf adder may see miss enistor to comfort offer up prayer in present sorrow yes be moping in room behaving like fool offer up what prayer like wo do good be folly in getting engaged to young criminal have brought thing to pas mr montrose be innocent said sparrow obstinately in due time god will prove innocence wish softer heart mr enistor good day worthy parson stalked out of room to seek alice console enistor did not resume work immediately have to do with disappearance of montrose a be writing to perchton inspector before entrance of sparrow with wonderful news work have seemed very important now enistor felt inclined to lay aside seek lodging of artist certainly be wonderful that hardwick must recover after have be lying dead a doctor insisted for so long time undoubtedly be case of catalepsy enistor felt curious to see man who have be so nearly buried alive sister be due next day to see about funeral enistor laughed when thought how frivolous little woman must be surprised disappointed also might be a being next of kin must have enjoyed narvaez ' money have brother really passed away be very strange after moment hesitation squire put on cap walked down to polwellin must see for have taken place must question hardwick concerning what have seen during trance for trance be squire felt sure recovery in opinion be perfectly natural one there be quite crowd round lodging hardwick landlady be recounting feeling when dead man have come to life certainly looked a though have sustained shock seemed rather disappointed that there be to be funeral enistor listened grimly to incoherent explanation then pushed way into house sought artist sitting room found hardwick dressed in usual clothes presenting unusually vigorous appearance face be more highly coloured eye be full of fire moved about with swift grace of panther alert vital impetuously wonderfully alive enistor stared in amazement at sight never have seen before so splendid powerful man one so charged with life force dying seems to have done good hardwick observed dryly look like replied other although spoke in usual mellow voice squire pricked up ear looked at inquiringly tone be more imperious than ordinarily used by hardwick have in dominant crushing quality startled visitor two men stared hard at one hardwick took up position on hearth rug leaning easily against mantelpiece while enistor took possession of deep arm chair near window door be closed a be window so be quite alone entirely free from observation eavesdropping squire felt that in spite of hardwick late cataleptic trance artist be more alive than be since wave after wave of powerful animal vitality seemed to emanate from fill little room then enistor cried out with sudden terror have reason to do so nerve in body be aching with agony muscle be twisted with pain force ran through frame like fire excruciating insistent terrible must not rise from chair must not even move finger lay where be inert helpless with devouring flame tormenting to madness indeed enistor wondered why did not go mad with frenzy of pain while hardwick smiled on quietly calmly unwinkingly like avenging god after one cry miserable man uttered other felt that must be useless to protest in weak human way be in grip of tremendous force a helpless a fly in claw of spider think will taunt more with loss of power said hardwick suavely be fraud be will have be shattered eh how do like dear friend again there came surge of biting fire caused perspiration to break out on enistor forehead who who who be stammered squire brokenly be beginning to have inkling of appalling truth for well knew that only one man if man be must exercise such devilish power think can tell that narvaez exactly magician withdrew intense gaze loosened victim from bond of torment then sat down quietly smiling bland think have have enough proof enistor feebly moved limb wiped forehead with pocket handkerchief mouth be so dry that must scarcely speak thankfully poured out glass of water from carafe be on table a drank delicious sense of freedom from pain passed through knew that man lounging in chair be curing what have hurt have have enough proof gasped enistor setting down empty glass be don pablo in hardwick body yes be very well satisfied with new suit of clothes said other looking at limb complacently hardwick retiring soul left earthly vehicle in good order organ be sound blood be of best whole mechanism only needed extra vitality be able to supply how can get vitality asked enistor rather nervously for sight before be enough to shake ordinary man to core of being never mind know how to tap source of life use what will hardwick must not do that being ignorant therefore died from sheer lack of vitality lucky thing for a gave chance of replacing worn out body with very splendid instrument did kill hardwick there be need to kill ego have be drawing soul back for long time knowing that must soon die made arrangement accordingly so a to enter body then lie to lure montrose to cottage be lie in interest said narvaez hardwick coolly be necessary that montrose must be there so a to be inculpated in death do understand now why insulted alice so that montrose might publicly quarrel with oh squire turned pale a began to comprehend infernal ingenuity with magician have wrought out scheme then montrose be not guilty man more than be insult to daughter be comedy to deceive public a to montrose feeling towards behaviour when called to taunt be part of same comedy think played part excellently well enistor must have be afraid to say what did suppose be now convinced that still have power if not leaned forward to fix other man with eye be quite convinced enistor cowered in chair be narvaez true enough to to adversary whom disguise can deceive rest of world will know a julian hardwick when montrose be disposed of friend can then marry alice a arranged be not averse to becoming hardwick wife so there will be difficulty over be still rich a made over fortune by will to hardwick inherit own money have sent for lawyer who will come see to morrow to arrange about transfer of property when late body be buried think ended narvaez hardwick pensively that will follow corpse of benefactor to grave grace own funeral laughed much amused where be hardwick soul stammered enistor who felt hair of head rising with natural terror of human for superhuman purging baser quality on astral plane said other carelessly wo stay long there a be such pious as will probably get share of heaven before long be not interested in have done harm in taking body be useless to be useful to oh narvaez hardwick rose stretched be splendid to have so magnificent vehicle in will live year year gaining wider wider knowledge to extend empire great power that struck down warned hold tongue snarled magician with look transformed kindly face of hardwick into semblance of fiend leave to deal with power higher lower a case may be have held own for century against be about to become pupil of adversary a suggested when taunted in cottage yet adversary have greater power than have be lie shouted narvaez hardwick imperiously what struck down be much mightier power choose to name told that before hold to enistor can give kingdom of earth at what price enistor shivered at look on other face know price must give alice for wife must obey in way can not instruct unless do now that montrose be in power have to pay back life took from in chaldea can force to give up fortune refuse dare not refuse if want to save neck be guilty narvaez hardwick laughed contemptuously might have guessed that pupil of adversary must be bold enough to commit murder be full of silly scruple know who killed then be fool said magician roundly job trevel be man enistor started from chair impossible job be away in job be at cottage on evening when died interrupted narvaez hardwick grimly sent for rose penwin to come see time after eight knowing that job must follow contrived to let know by impressing message on foolish brain really be going out in boat at six be about to start when felt compelled to come to cottage saw rose on moor followed by time have drawn montrose to cottage so a to incriminate know mean used after have confessed that have told lie about marriage went away saw rose to talk nonsense rouse job jealousy went with to gate kissed there did mind a be old man have promised must go to london next week job be waiting for at gate having seen enter cottage then sprang on broke neck after rose ran away job returned to boat have not come back yet said enistor horror struck at callous way in narvaez hardwick detailed wickedness will fear lest truth must come to light must be hanged for murder rose know for own sake will hold tongue so see that montrose can not escape can offer defence must be hanged go to offer life on condition that surrender fortune then hang pardon if will care in least be bound to by stronger bond when money be gained a julian hardwick will marry alice train a clairvoyante will go to spain where have home a narvaez a julian hardwick inherit think have managed everything very cleverly yes faltered enistor awed by power frightened by unscrupulous cruelty of strange being have disappeared narvaez hardwick frowned know that know where be have searched searched without success have not yet be out of door fool have mean of searching other than in physical cried man wrathfully have be looking for from other side be a easy for to use astral body a physical one adversary have placed veil round can not see where be still alice know be certain of will want to see follow then deal with man a will have placed at mercy be bound to say that must not have be case have not killed in chaldea friend adversary must have interfered may interfere now said enistor rising slowly can not montrose owes life of robbed can do what like where be can not tell a be protected so far evil karma be too powerful for protection to continue must work out fate follow alice will lead to be sure alice doe not know narvaez call hardwick fool else will be considered lunatic will be shut up for one alice doe know much be aware of assisted to fly know where be hidden now think be have to see about can go enistor pride revolted at being ordered about like dog wish must speak more civilly hardwick said scowling spoke civilly to when thought have lost power did jeered other bend brow at will make suffer have done much for expect repayment nothing for nothing be rule of left hand path 'd like to kill oh dog be showing teeth be take care have shown what can do if want to be shown further enistor winced at thought of again enduring that cruel pain then obey go away watch alice so that may unknowingly lead to montrose burrow when be found come to again good bye enistor gnashed teeth at insult hurled at being in grip of greater force than have within there be nothing for to yield departed with gloomy face to carry out order narvaez in splendid body of hardwick rejoiced with unholy glee be winning cried exultingly winning along line chapter xxi choice enistor returned to tremore in black silent rage wishing heartily that must find one with whom to discus position in found there be one a mere statement that narvaez have taken possession of hardwick body must be scouted by most credulous there be thing must not possibly be believed be one of present generation be too material to entertain for single moment so wild idea enistor knew a master have warned that ran very good chance of being locked up a lunatic if even hinted at astounding truth thus squire dabbling in unholy matter have isolated from fellow creature at moment felt deprivation keenly there be nothing must do shut up in library think over position be not pleasant one by own act in previous life have committed to bondage be treated like slave who have right of own what fool have be to doubt narvaez ' power since again again have received proof of on evil hill beside druidical altar have seen with other than physical eye terrible elemental creature don pablo must evoke whom controlled by powerful will doctor must have told that be case of mere hallucination brought about by hypnotic suggestion of certain weird ceremony squire knew better there be way of entering invisible world interpenetrates visible sphere narvaez by century of study training have learned how to open door have flung wide to pupil must not be closed again a enistor did not know necessary conjuration in showed man how impossible be for ignorance to cope with knowledge of don pablo now that magician black art have secured new body perfection of assured valuable instrument for many year wherewith to rule on physical plane enistor saw painfully clearly that must be more of slave to than ever have to obey narvaez a have ample proof of how man must enforce will by inflicting torment for first time therefore squire began to consider how must escape from thraldom ruefully confessed truth of significant text way of transgressor be hard have enistor be master instead of slave must not have troubled about saying being at beck call of merciless tyrant wondered why have be fool a to take left hand path so far a must see there be chance of retracing step yet have one great hope with own eye have seen powerful lord of dark face struck down in moment of wicked triumph so there be doubt that power of good be infinitely greater than power of evil be in enistor mind to seek out eberstein ask for assistance doctor knew a much about unseen a narvaez perhaps more since be in communication with higher plane than magician must reach undoubtedly eberstein always bent upon doing good must willingly give aid price demanded must be renunciation of revenge price squire felt that must not pay especially now when montrose lay at mercy death in chaldea might overlook since be more le to conception of physical brain figment of vision money montrose unjustly withheld must not be given up a enistor needed desperately to forward plan for success in social political world therefore did not seek out eberstein a price doctor must ask for giving aid be too great when squire came to conclusion heard faint regretful sigh startled not little there be one in library door window be closed yet sound be quite distinct enistor ardently wished that be sufficiently clairvoyant to see who be present in fanciful moment wondered if guardian angel have taken departure seeing that be hopeless to induce to turn from evil to good idea be ridiculous a squire must see use in anything did not benefit rose to foot fully determined to find montrose give choice of life death if young man surrendered money must be permitted to escape if declined then uncomfortable death awaited at very distant date enistor felt quite virtuous in offering alternative a considered that be giving montrose chance of salvation man must be foolish not to accept a to narvaez enistor hoped shortly magician physically at event must remove from path if montrose must only act sensibly escape to australia america after giving up fortune then alice must marry don pablo go with to spain thus enistor must be left free from domestic relation with five thousand year to act a ambition urged of course girl must think be marrying julian for whom have great regard so failing fugitive becoming husband on face of be impossible narvaez in body of hardwick must have little difficulty in gaining end in way everything must be very nicely arranged must dispense with assistance of eberstein in insane egotism strengthened by wicked teaching of don pablo squire never gave thought to idea that be deliberately ruining innocent man be too imbued with iron rule of left hand path to flinch at such villainy considered that weaker must give way to stronger be only fair logical irony of thought be enistor a inferior to don pablo did not wish to submit to although strength of latter compelled to do so yet be exercising towards montrose very tyranny resented being exercised towards amount of argument must have convinced enistor that be illogical at afternoon tea alice made appearance looking anxious determined since faith in eberstein in great master of eberstein braced to face worst serenely thing be dreadfully tangled outlook be black humanly speaking seemed that there be possible chance of happiness for herself lover since doctor have foretold not only coming of calamity passing of same if bravely endured alice be perfectly certain in own mind that in mysterious way god must answer constant prayer for joy peace thus although be pale eye be bright steady behaved in calm reasonable manner a though everything went well with enistor marvelled at composure must have dearly loved to shake by announcing that knew have contrived flight of montrose must not do lest must place girl on guard therefore said nothing having arranged mentally to follow when stole out to seek hiding place there be news of young scoundrel said enistor unable to withstand gibe have concealed very cleverly douglas be scoundrel said alice steadily circumstance be against doe well to hide seeing how bitter be against lie set forth in bad english sneered squire be scoundrel a murderer be be not bitter against only wish to see justice done care nothing for justice father wish be to use accusation to force douglas to give up aunt lucy money be very impertinent speak truly enough main desire be to get money unless montrose surrender will hang will have to catch first said girl coldly said more for father be behaving so wickedly in opinion that found difficult to speak to with degree of civility enistor peered at from under strongly marked eyebrow scowled in menacing manner occurred to that might have gone to see montrose during afternoon in event must assuredly not seek after dark therefore must not be able to follow to hiding place where have be last few hour asked acidly went to see rose penwin who be ill said alice quietly enistor bearing in mind what narvaez have stated started violently what did tell nothing what be there must tell one never know what silly girl like will say retorted squire reassured that secret of murder be safe what else have done saw dame trevel learned that job have not yet returned then a be told how julian have recovered from cataleptic trance called on must have gone to lodging immediately after left said enistor quickly well think recovery be wonderful yes mr sparrow said doctor be sure julian be dead so be little le than miracle that be alive well alice hesitated looked highly perplexed what julian be different from what be in way admit that alice have more strength be wonderful recovery expect case will be reported in lancet mean exactly replied girl reluctantly somehow julian be quite different liked very much a be always so good kind hesitated again then ended abruptly like now rather whimsical think said father tartly wondering if girl intuition have informed her of marvellous truth suppose be said daughter wearily may be reason julian illness have changed into something different used to be so happy when with now shudder in presence have same terrifying effect on that don pablo used to have be talking nonsense said squire roughly know be illness must not change one into other than be ca help impression same julian be good now be evil never wish to see again be pity said man slowly for now narvaez be dead montrose have proved to be unworthy of hand wish to marry julian hardwick alice started to foot never never never cried vehemently be capricious dear be willing enough to marry julian rather than don pablo of two evil chose least will choose least still if julian be least objected to marrying because be poor now that have inherited money of narvaez be good match for alice struck table so violently that cup rattled in saucer douglas be innocent douglas will be husband even when julian be own dear self must not have married after meeting douglas much le must do so now when have changed into something horrid enistor saw that sensed presence of don pablo black soul in hardwick body a must not explain must not be believed if did explain merely laughed at vehemence be silly girl to talk in way first like man then talk of change only exists in imagination be going mad may be said alice moodily have have enough to send mad will understand father love douglas intend to marry be final determination before enistor must argue further left room fearing breakdown when alone flung face downward on bed tried to compose mind be necessary that must do so a late at night intended to steal out with food for lover father a thought must never suspect must leave house when servant be in bed already housekeeper have made up bundle lay in convenient cupboard must have accompanied a chaperon that mistress declined such companionship montrose be nearer at hand than one suspected so be just a well that a few people a possible must seek hiding place alice nerved by love to walk lonely moor in chilly gloom intended to go alone in holding to resolve became more heroic than ever thought must be in heart perfect love have cast out fear must have faced army to succour man intended to marry dinner be quiet evening be quiet a enistor spoke little alice be not inclined for conversation indeed there be nothing to say a father daughter be silently hostile to one owing to squire want of paternal affection never have be friendly now that wished to ruin life by handing over montrose to police alice felt that hated father eberstein must have told that be wrong to do so even in face of excellent reason eberstein be absent silent so in dark hour girl have to fight entirely unaided a matter of fact be being guided along dreadful path skilfully movement be being watched a thought be known to guardian clairvoyant power being in abeyance did not guess so far a be aware only strength of love for douglas enabled to battle against dark influence tried hard to sap strength when enistor retired to library alice excused on plea of bad headache went to room there sat in faint light of solitary candle sending loving thought to lonely lover in cave under cliff nine o'clock struck then ten be not until eleven that house became dark quiet stolen visit to library assured that father have gone to rest so thinking that be well girl put on warm cloak with hood took basket to leave by side door housekeeper have left unlatched in ten minute be through darkling wood on bare space of moor did not see that father be following with skill of redskin on trail enistor have watched waited pertinaciously have little difficulty in getting on track be stormy blowy night with mighty wind rushing inward from sea alice struggled against blast incessantly on way to cliff now then there be lull must hear clamour of wave thunder of water hammering against rock in vast hollow of sky black cloud be hurtling across firmament at tremendous speed unveiling now then haggard moon full orbed yet with waning fire be walpurgis night when warlock witch must have be abroad rather than delicately nurtured girl made heroic by love enistor toiling after at distance wondered at strength of character have be far from thinking daughter possessed laughed grimly to think that unknowingly be placing lover within reach of gripping hand of justice amidst clash clang of elemental force girl on mission of love man on errand of vengeance staggered across waste land drenched by fierce rain buffeted by roaring wind occasionally zigzag flash cut through inky cloud subsequent thunder be almost lost in furious cry of sea wind great a be hate of enistor to enable to face such force greater be love strengthened alice to attempt task of high endeavour alice led father down to very verge of cliff halted there stone throw from coastguard station lurking in background squire strained eye to see did see momentarily clear silhouette against pale illumination of horizon where moonlight struggled to assert then big black cloud drove ponderously across moon when passed alice be no longer to be seen in way have descended cliff cold feeling of fear lest must fall be dashed to piece gripped enistor heart rather to surprise have never thought that possessed sufficient love for alice to make wince in way love be evidently latent in sent man pell mell towards lip of land to stay girl from rash adventure bending over to look into seething hell of water below bubbled boiled like witch cauldron enistor caught sight in fitful moonlight of tiny dark figure dropping down to unknown destination alice be safe a yet in spite of fury of wind wave scrambled down narrow track with sure footedness of goat not for nothing have adventured life in hazardous way during past year now nerve have gained came in useful when lover neck be in danger did not think of own at moment enistor heart be in mouth a saying be a lay on stomach peering down at daring girl then turn of path below concealed clambering figure from eye debated within a to best course to adopt be surprised to think that montrose be concealed so near to coastguard station great distance from tremore in very daring of selecting so dangerous hiding place lay safety a soon came to comprehend what alice with youth lightness must do enistor did not dare to attempt decided to wait until came up cliff again then must force to reveal exact spot where montrose lay hidden rolling into shelter of venturesome gorse bush grew near verge kept eye partly on light of not far distant station partly on place where girl have descended in way hoped to seize daughter to guard against being surprised by navy men although latter must be useful at pinch to arrest fugitive when alice be forced to reveal truth so enistor lay there rain beat upon wind blew thunder rolled overhead challenge to tumult of wave below meanwhile alice never suspecting that have led father to within stone throw of lover lurking place swung still further downward from point where enistor have lost sight of finally path be mere goat track excessively narrow dangerous terminated in small jagged hole very great distance up cliff from sand rock below be marked by bush must have passed unnoticed even by experienced climber girl have found during day in spring never thinking that must ever be required for purpose for be now being used speedily thrusting into rabbit burrow a might be called scrambled on hand knee along narrow passage until emerged into fair sized cave there saw montrose ready to greet with candle in hand soon put down to take in arm darling darling how brave be oh dear dear dearest must only cling to kiss feel that have reached heaven of embrace be trembling montrose lighted candle from stock have brought made sit down on block of stone fallen from roof wonder tremble when think of climbing down terrible cliff must not do again do hear must rather give up than expose to such risk might fall alice stopped protestation with kiss will not fall again again have gone down path out of spirit of sheer adventure will then not come when life depends upon coming there never be such woman a be cried douglas brokenly oh darling heart how can love when lurk here so shamefully be doing right dr eberstein said that be to fly when truth come to light can reappear will ever come to light questioned montrose uneasily everything be dead against must stay here for ever will not stay here for ever said quiet steady voice lover turned head with start to see eberstein standing little distance away calm benevolent encouraging a ever be alice cried out with natural terror at sudden appearance of man whom supposed to be mile away montrose thrilled with deadly fear of supernatural must scarcely speak how how did come here gasped holding alice tightly to breast in way know not replied eberstein smiling so kindly a to strengthen true physical body be asleep in hotel at perchton use now be one created for moment so may be seen heard to speak by for reassuring smile knowledge of eberstein goodwill lover must have be terrified out of life be be flesh blood stammered alice nervously in one way yes in way no knowledge of certain law have be entrusted to enables to materialise in way advanced to place one hand on girl shoulder other on of montrose can feel touch can not can feel hear see said douglas inclination be to kneel before master who manifested such power fear have departed now from alice be a if angel have come to kneel only to god said eberstein solemnly be great mercy that permit to come to aid moment be at hand will decide future future of before montrose will be placed good evil a choose so will be will choose good cried young man impetuously be not over confident lest fall warned master gravely one whom wronged in past have at mercy father questioned alice with gasp eberstein bowed head in chaldea killed montrose therefore owe life for life humanly speaking be in power for moment can hand over to officer of law be innocent of crime yes know that be innocent teaching of son of perdition whom know a narvaez have warped nature to gain money claim will place if can in shadow of gallows doe not know where be be peace master raised arm slowly what will be will be a love hate fear trust triumph in breast ascend cliff alone alone alice uttered shriek let go also ascend cliff alone repeated eberstein calmly daughter kneel here in prayer that good may triumph over evil may will of god be fulfilled may love of christ made sign of cross be with in hour of need with saving grace of holy ghost where have be there be gloom of cave faintly illuminated by candlelight motionless with lover clung to one montrose looking upward when movement came to breathed voiceless prayer then bent to kiss alice who have sunk on knee loosening clasp moved slowly towards entrance to cave did not seek to stay with folded hand looked at retiring form might be for last time a looked exaltation awe of solemn moment opened interior sens saw triangle of white flame showered on lover head purple ray of ineffable beauty shaped into cross a disappeared then drew inward to star radiant glorious shone in gloom a symbol of hope salvation to high splendour to power beyond to father to son to holy ghost proceeding from father through son did pray fervently not that earthly parent might be spared commission of crime not that lover might be saved that holy purpose of god unknown inexplicable might be fulfilled according to will to such height of trust in love save have ever compassionate mercy of christ raised weak faltering bruised soul chapter xxii right be might montrose be so accustomed to obey master that never questioned order to climb cliff leave alice alone in cave yet a straightened behind bush masked entrance wondered why such instruction have be given girl knew that enistor watched for coming so young man must only conjecture that eberstein wished to surrender to officer of law who be hunting for seemed strange in face of doctor telegram advising to fly for want of knowledge montrose be not in state of mind to reconcile apparent contradiction sole idea be to do what have be told to do even though a seemed to be case be risking loss of liberty life indeed with regard to last montrose believed that might lose otherwise than on gallows narrow tortuous path sloped upward abruptly with cliff soaring high above cliff dropping steeply below to unfathomable depth fortunately mighty wind roared inland from sea enabled to cling more surely to rocky face of precipice by slow degree crawled towards goal overhead in le degree than alice be young man accustomed to such perilous wayfaring only by persistent will power did manage to control nerve what with screaming of tempest above bellowing of water below nearly lost head tumult of sound stormy darkness only fitfully dispersed by gleam of moonlight dangerous position midway between heaven earth thing be enough to daunt bravest man that have be supported by unseen power montrose must never have succeeded in scaling that tremendous cliff yet did so painfully crawling upward inch by inch shaken like leaf in grip of wind stunned by uproar of great water at length after many hour so seemed to who have lost count of time reached summit cast breathlessly on wet herbage panting painfully sat up after pause then lightning flaring in dark sky showed tall figure rushing towards at very moment of onset wind swept clear face of moon to reveal in waning light enistor have found at last have now shouted squire stumbling towards victim with eager haste will not escape montrose have thought of escape must not have saved even have be so inclined be wholly spent with fearful climb be unable to cry out much le shape breath into speech yet with instinct of self preservation since be dangerously near verge of precipice rolled blindly to one side a enistor dashed heedlessly towards one moment saw big man reeling with extended hand to clutch capture in half light next enemy have disappeared over cliff cry hoarsely a realised that have underestimated distance cry be echoed by montrose who nearly lost what few sens remained to in horror of moment then flashed across bewildered mind that enistor be dead that there be chance of capture for moment striving to regain breath to control mind to master nerve that effort be insistent thought governed whole being utterly unmanned sobbed hysterically loss of self control did not last long by powerful exercise of will montrose succeeded in gaining mastery of being on hand knee crawled towards edge of cliff did not expect to see enistor a in impetuous rush man must have hurled directly into thundering wave broke far below in white furious foam in moonlight radiated strongly for time being against face of sea front montrose saw dark body half way down squire have fallen straightly for distance then have cannoned off one rock to strike against finally came to rest on projecting spur where senseless body remained hanging helplessly above boiling of witch cauldron below clearly distinctly montrose saw perilous position of enemy clearly distinctly knew that enemy must be saved remained with to allow enistor to die terribly since man first movement when revived must precipitate into hell beneath to descend effect rescue how must do so without rope lacking assistance young man did not know what did know thought burnt into brain be that enistor must be saved doomed choice lay with temptation be almost overpowering only enistor must depose to fatal visit to cottage if such proof be wanting montrose knew positively that must not even be accused much le arrested be aware of innocence yet enistor who hated must prove to be guilty hand over to unmerited death man must assuredly do montrose winced to think how name must be covered with ignominy how greatly alice must suffer why must save one who designed disgrace who desired death asked question then asked of god reply came either from from unseen felt a though guidance of higher power have be withdrawn that be left to choose unbiased uninstructed completely free then recollected how eberstein have said that good evil must be placed before how swiftly have declared must select good memory recurred to subsequent warning be not over confident lest fall be time of choice crucial moment decided if saved enistor saved only witness who must bring about condemnation if did not rescue man must be free to marry alice to enjoy money to lead peaceful life must peaceful life be built up upon crime for crime be to allow enemy to perish come what might arrest trial condemnation shameful death be impossible to hesitate longer enistor must be rescued must be man to do deed in frenzy of eagerness in deadly fear lest evil must overpower good montrose sprang to foot hurried impetuously towards light of coastguard station there be not moment to be lost so literally fell against door clamoured for admittance what be row what be row asked gruff voice a door opened violently coastguard appeared sir man have seen before recognised in moment have come to give up do what like about gasped montrose clinging to door wild figure ragged streaming with water only help to save enistor squire what be about squire coastguard laid down pipe to step hurriedly forward have fallen over cliff threw over cried men simultaneously swear did not what doe matter can arrest afterwards if choose just now want to save enistor body be hanging halfway down get rope lantern come assist must save montrose feeling new powerful life move to action rushed into darkness startled coastguard followed to see what have happened to arrest fugitive for whom whole country side be searching discipline prevailed in spite of natural bewilderment came to verge of cliff when montrose shouted with lantern stout rope young man be lying on stomach pointing downward to where body be plainly seen in moonlight coastguard recoiled in dismay be that squire cried one then be dead for certain tie rope round will descend said montrose feverishly be almost sure death sir declared other man more respectfully for if fugitive intended to descend upon such errand of mercy be impossible that must be guilty of murder death life be going retorted montrose hastily bound rope under armpit assisted by two men while slung one of lantern round neck now pay out rope let down gradually clinging dexterously to scanty herbage of precipice luckily storm be dying away wind have rapidly swept greater part of heaven clear of vapour in starry space above sealine moon shone out more strongly than usual so montrose have ample light to negotiate downward course coastguard peered over edge of cliff twisted rope round convenient rock measuring out gradually hardened men a be shivered a now then daring adventurer swung clear to hang like spider at end of slender line while cruel rock hungry water waited below for prey power have supported montrose before supported now felt singularly clear headed strong slowly surely dropped down face of precipice finally alighted gently on projecting spur of rock very cautiously looped twist of rope round enistor body knotting to for least mistake must have tumbled from insecure foothold a be spur trembled vibrated dangerously under added weight of montrose even though be greatly supported by line however managed to bind squire insensible body to then gave signal to be drawn up coastguard made sure that rope be safely attached to rock then hoping that must not give way under strain began to haul up two men with one arm round enistor who be bound more le tightly to by rope montrose assisted a best must with arm left free with foot be perilous journey two men above a well a montrose heaved sigh of relief when willing hand dragged rescuer rescued into safety notwithstanding immense strain to have be subjected young man still felt able to deal with situation have brandy asked nearest man a three of looked down at insensible body yes sir flask be handed over montrose knelt forced clenched teeth apart to pour down ardent spirit squire still lived for heart be beating faintly face be woefully scratched head be bruised mackintosh wore be ripped to shred by tearing rending of rock shrub have struck during fall that be alive be miracle so bluff coastguard thought a held lantern for montrose to do office of mercy respected young hero intensely for what have done a few men must have dared peril of such descent in stormy gloom of night did not know how truly heroic montrose have be in saving life of one who must condemn to shameless death for deed have never committed montrose did not consider action further being wholly occupied in aiding enistor to recover sens what have done have done there be more to be said better asked young man softly when enistor feebly opened eye to stare into pale face bending over what be matter murmured broken man faintly fell over cliff hush talk take brandy will be right soon think think back broken voice died away in drawl of exhaustion eye closed with last effort opened again enistor asked question who saved did voice expressed astonishment disbelief hatred whole gamut of disordered passion a comprehending sixth sense told montrose then sick man relapsed into insensibility help to carry to tremore one of said montrose rising looking at men who be staring curiously at in mingled light of moon lantern sooner doctor see better can take along with mate here sir said coastguard gruffly if go will be arrested for murder of old foreign cove a be innocent mind being arrested if two hand over to police understand that certain reward speak like sir broke in other man hastily gentleman what risked life to save a be hunting down ai murderer thank said montrose thankfully simply same be going to surrender meantime must take squire home men stared wondered admiring montrose more than ever since be risking liberty a have risked life to save man who be so bitter against one coastguard returned to station montrose other carried body of enistor on hurdle taken from near sheepfold to tremore took long time to cover distance across dark misty moorland a approached great house montrose little by little felt artificial strength have sustained so far ebbing away wondered why be leaving wondered what must happen when police took wondered if alice be still in cave finally broke down altogether on threshold of dark house when coastguard rang bell roused servant handed over two insensible men to be taken indoors like blood horse montrose have kept up pace until reached goal then have fallen into a unconscious state a of man whom have saved a sens left glimpsed glorious radiance round about saw smiling approving face of master knew that hand be raised in benediction soundlessly word of beatitude came to a soft refreshing a summer rain blessed be merciful for will obtain mercy after gracious saying knew more then montrose lost count of time from moment when sank in darkness before door of tremore until hour woke in own bed time have existence screened lamp illuminated room blind be drawn door be closed fire be burning in grate be clasping tender hand eye opened to see face of alice bending over with motherly look woman give to men in time of sickness be certainly night montrose thought dreamily probably have be carried to bedroom few minute since how have come so swiftly from cave be miracle in life of miracle did come after asked weakly girl uttered cry a lip moved thankful tear fell on pale face douglas do know alice yes know alice be all right strove to rise fell back be weak still said girl arranging pillow attempt too much dearest take strengthening drink be held to lip must see what be happening muttered montrose impatiently brain becoming gradually clearer father lie insensible at door with coastguard in charge father be in bed coastguard be gone douglas be last night came here last night impossible be night still dear one have slept for twenty four hour doctor said be best thing must happen after strain have undergone will soon grow strong be nurse have be watching for hour

to sleep montrose wilfully argued objected girl be firm finally finished bowl of broth closed eye again when be quite asleep alice left housekeeper to watch beside through night retired to own room for much needed rest anxious a be about many matter with regard to lover father weariness mental physical demanded due slept soundly until ten o'clock next morning first waking thought be for father after have learned present condition sought sick room of lover montrose be no longer sick be up dressed with healthy colour in cheek very bright eye ready for breakfast anxious to learn what have taken place during insensible condition even thought that might be arrested on very day did not daunt knowing innocence aware that have conquered selfish fear to extent of saving life of sole witness who must condemn felt convinced that in way did not know how thing must be made therefore went down to dining room with alice after making good meal accompanied to very own sitting room to hear explanation father be in danger of death say asked when be seated yes douglas fall hurt spine doctor doe not think that will recover however be sensible enough can talk what doe say asked montrose nervously scarcely word be why be so anxious to hear from took place after left cave coastguard told much can tell more in first place where did meet father in first place said montrose asking counter question be to be arrested for murdering narvaez while have be asleep wonderful discovery have be made character have be entirely cleared be job trevel who broke don pablo neck job mother said that

perchton inspector who saw rose forced to reveal truth now police be hunting for job be entirely exonerated although will doubt be called upon to state hour when left don pablo thank god for mercy said montrose devoutly be most amazing thing alice to think that last night nearly decided to let father die since alone must witness against expect be test that dr eberstein spoke of douglas know how father came to be on spot unless followed by stealth when came to see at cave montrose nodded doubt father suspected followed a say dear moment reached top of cliff rushed at making mistake about distance in gloom hurled over precipice saw that body be lying half way down be in mind to leave there oh what struggle have cried young man passionately only christ love must have nerved to save man yes yes alice fondled hand descent be very dangerous be not be thinking about be nothing doubt hesitation desire to save own life at cost of wonder hair have not turned grey to think that time thing be coming to point must proclaim innocence have let father die must have committed purposeless crime thanks be to christ loving powerful did a must be done by gave enemy life what moment of anguish be what bitter bitter moment young man wiped perspiration from brow alice drew head down on breast murmured over a mother murmur over child montrose really be child at moment a what have passed through

soothe console drawing sobbing girl closer to heart said what must death be gate of life be told dear alice made reply phrase did not tend to disperse grief be rather that of pity than of love although two be so much akin that one can scarcely be distinguished from other montrose wisely said more thinking truly that silence be more comforting than word remained silent for minute knock at door parted alice dried tear to receive card from incoming servant at once sad face lighted up with pleasure hope oh douglas dr eberstein have come exclaimed joyfully bring gentleman here at once at once when servant have departed girl turned to lover with air of relief doctor will put everything right feel certain of so do replied douglas confidently may even cure father eberstein be shown in at moment when door be closed walked over to montrose with glad smile to place two hand on young man shoulder have conquered son a true follower of blessed one have forgiven enemy in face of overwhelming temptation to act otherwise then mr enistor truly be enemy asked montrose hurriedly life after life have be enemy remember vision saw in london wounded man who came between girl love enistor eberstein

therefore let sorrow have passed through bind truly together for service to god how wonderful how wonderful gasped alice holding tightly to lover a if feared to lose again will there be more trouble trouble undergo when dwelling in flesh in many case will be able to avert since have much light more will be given dark karma of chaldea have be dispersed for ever thank god child that have be so wonderfully guided through mist of error into clear day of truth do thank said douglas reverently for so guiding be instrument used for god high purpose said eberstein with solemn look thank have be so honoured now must do a have be done by aid in salvation of korah enistor father how can do inquired alice anxiously must wait for arrival of son of perdition who wish to keep most unhappy soul in bondage then will love hate battle for prize result depends upon soul choice narvaez be dead said montrose puzzled narvaez be more alive than ever in body of julian hardwick oh alice recognised truth of astounding statement at once knew julian be different that be evil instead of good sensed narvaez black soul in hardwick body said eberstein simply be strong be ready for hour of strife be at hand let pray cried alice fervently two did pray with full heart while master strengthened selfless petition chapter xxiii eternal strife for three day enistor lingered on fighting inch by inch for life with obstinate courage doctor told that there be hope declined to believe in such croaking with pride will resisted coming dissolution of body therefore lived much longer than must have be case have be of le resolute nature night day alice housekeeper nursed by turn seemed grateful for attention although said very little to montrose wished to see dying man assure of forgiveness enistor declined interview narvaez hardwick also called with feigned expression of regret be forced to depart without seeing man wickedness have brought so low a to dr eberstein took lodging in village so a to be at hand at last moment waited patiently for summons to bedside will come assured montrose will surely come since last act of terrible drama have to be played by who have taken part in with exception of hardwick who have done share passed over alice narvaez have to face enistor for what purpose doctor answered rather irrelevantly extension of enistor life beyond what be natural considering injury be not permitted without good reason poor creature be taking part in tremendous struggle between little good have in enormous quantity of evil through ignorance have accumulated in other life be trying constantly to increase good while narvaez be putting forth wicked power to strengthen evil who will win narvaez asked montrose abruptly only god know issue of conflict son since enistor having free will can choose good bad left hand path right hand path be given same choice in way with power of love prevailed whether will prevail with miserable man depends upon can not tell master know so much know much know god alone be omniscient did not one of poet say 'we mortal million live alone be great truth greatly put soul must find god for through christ by power of holy ghost can be helped instructed by who like be humble servant of most high soul alone can choose whether to rise fall tell montrose much a enistor suffers physically be infinitely more tormented mentally night day day night strife continues between evil good in narvaez take part only enistor can elect side will win can not help asked young man distressed at terrible plight of whilom enemy have helped helped greatly enistor be constantly trying to understand why saved when must have must have condemned to shameful unmerited death be well nigh impossible for to grasp such self abnegation positive fact that acted a did be spar to cling prevents from sinking in troubled water of evil desire narvaez be bringing up against why smash narvaez must be against law of justice narvaez have right a one else have if chooses to abuse right will bring destruction on a be surely doing hate only cease by love so that can do be to offer narvaez assistance refuse to take with greater power poured through for selfless end by god of must use force render harmless such force must mean employment of power of hate influence be always same in essence becomes good evil a employ still if ended don pablo wickedness enistor must be saved can not tell can not be saved at cost of injustice to narvaez son by own act in life others have placed in power of narvaez must abide by choice still may want to escape if so truly hope that such will be case have only to open heart to incoming of christ mighty power of blessed one will sweep away narvaez like straw love be stronger than evil must prevail when election be made to use

light a by magic darkness vanished radiant tenderness of perfect love descended upon weary soul enistor face grew young bright with expression of joyful awe stretched out imploring hand of surrender remorse what beheld eberstein saw a head be reverently bent narvaez saw also for fell back slowly towards door driven into self created darkness by overwhelming glory of cross alice clinging to montrose murmured incoherently do see do see there with hand on father head lord of dark face have vanished lord of compassion have come in power like child who be weary dying man fell dead on pillow soul passing onward so gently that two young people scarcely realised that be over moment later presence be gone supernal light visible to save douglas faded away eberstein stepped forward silently to close tired eye may god lead to place of refreshment light peace said in solemn tone over body traced holy emblem of salvation amen murmured two who knelt by bedside away into night fled son of perdition baffled broken beaten despoiled of slave who be lost to for ever be eternal torment of self fly though man pursueth chapter xxiv dawn for six month after death of father alice travelled abroad with mr sparrow a chaperon companion strain to have be subjected demanded removal from surroundings so intimately connected with ordeal meanwhile tremore must be safely left in charge of housekeeper be with reluctance that montrose agreed to continental tour have be suggested by eberstein a parted for year from girl loved doctor pointed out that absence must make alice more self reliant since must have to deal single handed with sorrow unaided by lover sympathy companionship human being declared must learn to become centre of power depending on god alone for help since only in way can such one develop necessary strength to act a useful servant of christ be drastic training for young people at winced when eberstein fully convinced that flesh must be dominated by spirit at cost agreed to separation be final test of obedience great one alice selected mr sparrow to accompany for two reason first be sorry for childish woman who led so dull life wished to brighten grey existence secondly girl be immensely grateful to vicar wife for championship of montrose in face of strong evidence a to guilt desired to give tangible proof of feeling indeed asked mr sparrow to come abroad also met with refusal since must not see way to leave parish for so lengthy period however douglas induced good man to pay few visit in london during wife absence gave great pleasure to mr sparrow besides helped to widen view therefore be delighted to think that better half must chaperon miss enistor took unselfish pleasure in preparation for great event a to mr sparrow to journey abroad see with own eye very many thing have only read about be like glimpse of paradise drink of water to thirsty man left behind colourless life of scraping screwing of cutting contriving to enjoy comfortable day of ample mean constant novelty france switzerland italy germany mr sparrow saw wrote daily letter to husband concerning experience being blossomed like rose in sunlight of prosperity regained in great measure youth have be crushed out of by sordid care alice enjoyed naive delight of rejuvenated companion a much a did sight brought forth expression of pleasure in way amongst others be aided to forget late trial tour be complete success when two returned to england during early blossoming of spring be bubbling over with joy of life end of journey terminated in lover meeting be fit proper according to dictum of shakespeare sorely tried pair be married quietly in london mr sparrow came up to perform ceremony mr sparrow acted a one only bridesmaid while dr eberstein gave bride away then came pleasant wedding breakfast departure of mr mr douglas montrose to eastbourne for delightful honeymoon mr barrast be annoyed that have not be asked to great event since wooing have taken place in house soon got over pique sent present to happy pair together with letter in complained that julian exiled in spain took not slightest notice of douglas laughed over characteristic selfishness of butterfly wondered openly what must say if really knew weird truth alice replied that must never believe be extremely probable considering mr barrast limitation only hope that don pablo will leave alone continued mr montrose be just kind of man who must play malicious trick think must be permitted to do rejoined douglas thoughtfully narvaez be kind of super human criminal will be kept within bound by great power control world mr barrast be frivolous little woman who doe harm even if doe good so will be protected until be strong enough to endure suffering seems rather cruel that if one gain strength improves one character one must only grow better to invite sorrow can not become god in other way dear burden be always fitted to bearer what be demanded from strong be not asked from weak 'whom god loveth chasteneth ' know must never understand that text objected alice raising eyebrow eberstein explained to replied husband through ignorance one accumulates bad karma life after life be gradually paid off in such way a not to bear too hardly on who have to suffer until karma be of own making be paid off be unprofitable servant working so to speak only for ourselves since be to get rid of burden inconvenience that labour when one vow to service of christ desire to work a master did for humanity at large evil karma must be got rid of very speedily so a to leave freedom for work well asked alice when paused still not seeing clearly can not understand quicker karma be paid off sooner will servant of christ be free to do what want in service of master thus appeal be made by soul to god for such freedom be answered by payment of evil being concentrated in three four life whereas ordinarily speaking must be spread over hundred therefore at soul request trouble after trouble descends without intermission greater speed mean greater pain thus do see many people of blameless life suffering terribly humanly speaking unjustly chastening be only love of god drawing swiftly to by allowing at own request mind to pay off evil of past ignorance at one sweep so to speak instead of by instalment see mr barrast be in b c class only easy payment be demanded from what about be free in great measure think be for incarnation at least since have be so bitterly tried of course can not tell if have discharged evil debt of past much care what be gained be well worth pain alice shivered pain be very great so be gain if one work for super human thing one must be content to suffer more than ordinary person distress over such thing dear heart added husband
