pretty housemaid with whom intended to walk out on sunday being a talkative a bunyan character of name mulligan must not have be displeased to meet brother officer even stray reveller with whom to converse fellow be in other neighbourhood reveller be unknown in respectable street of troy so mulligan for sake of hearing own voice hummed little song in deep bass growl passed hector villa agamemnon villa paris villa priam villa of be in darkness enshrined in leafy garden at gate of ajax villa halted light in first floor window over classic porch showed that inmate have not yet retired also woman be singing constable mulligan being fond of music waited to hear song kathleen mavourneen thought recognising melody fine pipe have who sings be party will be having within with tongue clapping whisky flowing begorra be be wishing have of same wiped mouth with longing air a stood at gate looking up wide path ran straightly to willow step of porch through short avenue of elm in full

party in progress also a mulligan quick ear detected door be opened with unusual caution closed with equal care person who have emerged whether be man woman policeman must not guess hesitated on step for few minute apparently officer form bulked blackly against light of opposite street lamp stranger be undecided whether to re enter house to come down path mulligan be too dense to be suspicious merely wondered why person in question did not fulfil original intention meanwhile song flowed smoothly mulligan half unconsciously noted that although word be sung slowly piano music between verse be played hurriedly finally thinking that stranger on step must not approve of policeman leaning on gate mulligan turned away with airy grace of elephant hardly have taken few step when young man came quickly down path with light springy step in pleasant tenor voice called to constable anything wrong officer asked gate clicked behind a uttered word mulligan halting under street lamp saluted good humouredly sir declared be just listening to good lady singing sister corrected man also pausing under lamp in such position that light did not reveal countenance ought to like song constable ' for

rejoined mulligan accepting little roll of tobacco be light will be wanting thanks said other bent down to ignite cigarette at match provided by policeman still kept face in shadow not that mulligan have desire reason to see merely thought that gentleman be departing guest although must not account for dark hall set aside idea of party moreover stranger be arrayed in light tweed suit be not exactly appropriate for party also wore loose overcoat of bluish black cloth with deep velvet collar velvet cuff made in latest fashion on so warm night garment be quite unnecessary still mulligan have reason to be suspicious be last man to be inquisitive have politeness if not keen wit of celt after lighting cigarette gentleman strolled away towards ancient village formed nucleus of modern troy unwilling to lose chance of pleasant conversation perhaps kindly shilling mulligan followed beside light active form of companion looked like bear lumbering in company of antelope gentleman did not appear anxious to talk so mulligan made first remark song done said a walked on be long song replied other carelessly dare say will start soon can listen at gate night if have mind to be party will be having then sir party ca people sit up till midnight without having house full of dancer augh grunted mulligan there being light in hall might have guessed there be party other man started

murder be not so common more common than think sir most of be found out be who 'd like really fine crime with name in paper printed recommendation a efficient officer none of poker murder plain sailing will understand sir mystery a read of in little book written by gentry a know law ah incident in detective novel rarely occur in real life said other with more tranquil laugh providence be too original to borrow in way live in hope officer crime may come way sooner than expect not hereabouts sir mulligan shook head gloomily be too clean neighbourhood very place where crime be likely to occur have light constable mulligan struck match time saw face of speaker clearly be handsome face rather worried looking a stranger wore moustache small pointed beard a homberg hat be grey with black band be pressed down over eye mulligan must not determine if be more than usually worried not that minded fancied after reflection that handsome young gentleman be a put out on spree therefore took mark of worry for of dissipation did not even examine face closely when match be extinguished halted there be half hour sir must get back to beat must race for cab said stranger pressing half crown into not unwilling hand thanks for coming so far with officer wonder if watch be right added pulling out be half past eleven something fell at moment chipped against curb with tinkling sound rebounded into road have dropped something sir said mulligan flashing lantern towards middle of street other felt pocket think so can see anything oh matter dare say what can have dropped two searched for time without success at stranger shook head positively felt pocket again must be mistaken remarked think anything be missing however if do find anything can give to when see next be usually on beat for next three night sir ah then be sure to meet often come here good night with wave of hand gentleman walked rapidly away at turn of street looked back again waved hand might have be that be anxious to see if constable be watching such suspicion occurred to mulligan be too pleased with half crown fine upstanding young gentleman be policeman verdict free with money here produced cigarette tobacco good luck go with a inspector be not within sight indeed must not be until mulligan returned to fixed point in achilles avenue policeman decided to solace with smoke after lighting up threw away match fell almost in middle of road flamed up brightly in pause of wind although went out with next gust mulligan in short time caught with keen eye glitter of steel striking match searched round picked up latch key long slim with scarcely projecting ward will not get to bed night said mulligan looking towards corner if be to run after now decided be impossible gentleman walking at unusually rapid pace must be distance away also in meantime might have met with hansom also mulligan have to return to fixed point a failure to meet superior officer must meet with sharp reprimand ah well said philosophic policeman young gentleman will be here to morrow night maybe sister will be still up can give key to on chance of securing half crown mulligan decided that latter course must be more diplomatic astutely adopting walked smartly to achilles avenue consultation of waterbury watch assured that have nearly twenty minute to spare before arrival of inspector therefore sought out ajax villa being guided thereto by fact that light be still burning on first floor heard singing however light showed that lady be still in room though doubtless servant a be shown plainly by stranger conversation be in bed mulligan walked up to door rang with foresight argued lady must come to door whereby must be more certain of money wind be dying down now that be close upon midnight everything in house garden be absolutely still walking up path under umbrageous shelter of elm mulligan saw colour of flower in neutral tint under faint starry sky there be moon kind of luminous twilight pervaded atmosphere mulligan being celt be not impervious to charm of place might have be juliet garden so strangely have magic of night transmuted commonplace into romance housemaid be expensive hurried to door anxious to obtain reward for return of key several time did ring although heard shrill vibration of bell through house one appeared in answer to imperative summons thinking might have made mistake constable stepped back into garden be right be villa out of young man have issued for there burned guiding light on first floor mulligan felt puzzled by inexplicable silence rang bell again indeed pressed great thumb on ivory button for nearly one minute bell shrilled continuously imperiously still one came mulligan scratched head considered something wrong thought if 'd key 'd enter see if lady be ill queer bell waken servant augh lazy beast occurred to that in hand held key dropped by young gentleman almost without thinking fumbled for hole slipped in key to surprise turned under involuntary pressure door swung open noiselessly again constable scratched head thing so assured be becoming mysterious scented adventure be strange that key must open door unless be home be running away for devilment maybe lady be sister perhaps wife sweetheart augh 'd not let go at hour catch however might argue be foolish to stand before open door without doing something inspector must be round soon might probably must demand explanation now that have got far mulligan naturally decided to see adventure through a yet have suspicion that anything be wrong though certainly thought whole affair mysterious walking into dark hall at end of by light of lantern saw glimmer of marble staircase called gently up into blackness be there one there demanded mulligan if so come down for be in want of explanation paused listened there came reply dense silence held house not even clock ticked mulligan suppressed breath listened with ear sound filled save drumming of heart again ran into garden again assured that light be burning overhead began to conclude that position called for intervention of law assuming official air tramped up stair flashing light right left a ascended did not know position of room

tragedy leaving gerty in garden with lover miss mason walked round to house eager to hear have taken place rumour about murder have crept round troy few curious people be staring at window policeman be to be seen inspector kept officer on guard inside villa thinking very rightly that sight of constable in garden must provoke inquiry bring onlooker derrick wished matter kept a quiet a possible until arrival of mr fane body of unfortunate woman have be removed to one of bedroom policeman watched at door everything in house be in same order a have be when entered by mulligan derrick took up

what about wire to mr fane sir will send a soon a get address from lady ah nodded a ring came to door there be laura entered room looking pale discomposed evidence of emotion of derrick took note to be sure be natural that girl of tender age must be unstrung by tragedy have taken place derrick scarcely expected to see other than moved having regard to crime be suspicious of fane family admired laura fresh beauty placed chair for apologising meanwhile for disagreeable duty have to perform be sure will excuse miss mason said gallant derrick will ask a few question a possible really know what

appear at certainly may be able to identify woman fear not from description mr tracey gave of derrick looked at sharply a said eye met fairly did not flinch from scrutiny bosom rose fell hurriedly cheek flushed passed tongue over dry lip thing gave evidence of inward discomposure whether knew anything derrick be not prepared to say if did be sure must be difficult to make speak out laura be innocent young in spite of delicate appearance have strong will derrick guessed a much from way in tightened lip must not conceive that must hold out against examination have anything to conceal asked abruptly rashly laura coloured still more glanced at indignantly how can speak to like said do suspect certainly not affair be strange miss mason from little gathered from mr tracey be assented here be house shut up said derrick pursuing own train of thought left without even caretaker there be need for one to be left interposed girl sister mr fane think that troy be safe suburb there have be burglary hereabouts so merely asked police to keep eye on house besides be away only for three week when do mr fane family return in six day remained behind laura bowed sister be not on very good term began thought best to remain with friend miss baldwin while house be shut up be saying something merely that be queer woman stranger if be stranger must obtain admittance into house while who own be away came on saturday evening at what time be not a yet able to learn one saw come know if came alone in company of one come did entered house how did get in be a puzzled a be sir if will let see body may be able to tell if be that of stranger to can do later said derrick meanwhile wish to put few question even if woman be not stranger be likely that must enter house so far a know brother in law alone have latch key be there not possessed by young man laura looked out of window while answering question not that know of said faintly derrick appeared satisfied with reply took out note book answer question please began who be mr fane brother in law be second partner in shipping firm of mason son mason oh why doe not name appear laura explained firm be old one said there be two partner brother walter fane when father died firm be mason son mason a be old established one brother did not change name when mr fane became partner when did mr fane become partner three year ago when married sister julia did mr fane bring money into business asked derrick then seeing laura look of surprise continued apologetically excuse miss mason must know everything believe mr fane brought very little money into business be sister julia who have money paid sufficient to brother to buy walter share have right to tell thing said laura flushing if wish to know anything further must ask mr fane intend to will give address ocean view wandle road westcliff on sea derrick noted in book will send wire to said a inquest take place to morrow must have present by way do know young man with pointed beard slim figure be visitor at house not that know of said miss mason promptly know one of type with pointed beard mean yet young man came out of house held policeman in talk while accomplice murdered woman be there two men then think so answered derrick cautiously presume miss mason added have be to house since mr fane left certainly not living so near meadow lane be stone throw away quite so same have reason to return here live in house with sister yes then thing be here laura looked hard at derrick trying to fathom meaning took needful thing with a though be going on long journey mr inspector for nearly two week have lived with mr baldwin have not be in achilles avenue have not passed house said that have not be in achilles avenue replied laura then know nothing said derrick obviously disappointed with result of examination absolutely nothing inspector nursed chin thought with eye on ground there be nothing else must ask mr fane be owner of ajax villa a unknown woman have be murdered therein mr fane alone must be able to say how have come by death in past life might be found reason that poor creature must be so slain what did mr fane do before joined firm nothing replied laura rousing from own thought be possessed of independent mean travelled great deal suppose grew weary of so aimless life however sister persuaded to become partner did after married hum said derrick not finding reply threw light on subject then cast eye round room be queer place miss mason mr fane idea no mr fane furnished house sister doe not like room be too cold in look for mr fane be fond of whole house be furnished before mr fane married for marriage presume mr fane lived here a bachelor for six month before married sister doubt engagement lasted six month mr fane furnished house a thought sister must like did not mr fane married sister at end of three month before that furnished house according to own taste derrick thought strange however did not ask more question a felt that have rather exceeded limit of even official courtesy be much obliged to for replying so frankly to question miss mason said if have be too curious strange nature of case must be excuse will now inspect body laura cheek grew even paler than be made objection silently followed inspector moving indifferently through house only when arrived at door of death chamber did draw back have put body into room said resentfully be sorry said derrick opening door of course be quite in ignorance will never be able to sleep in room again murmured laura passed through door derrick held open out of delicacy inspector did not enter with remained outside thinking over what have said seemed to that mr fane have married very suddenly have taken bride to house have not be furnished for house be too large for bachelor must have be intended for two what if fane have be engaged to one else for whom house be furnished engagement being broken married miss julia mason so hurriedly if be so house with strange white room be not to present mr fane taste must have be furnished for unknown woman perhaps unknown woman be poor soul who lay dead within only fane have latch key only fane must have admitted then here derrick broke off felt that be taking too much for granted that be building up theory on unsubstantial foundation until saw fane learned what kind of man be be impossible to formulate theory still for own satisfaction derrick determined to ask laura few more question be at moment emerged pale composed know woman at said before must speak be quite sure perfectly never set eye on before pretty woman added laura sadly with quite girlish face wonder what brought here to meet death wonder said derrick who must have killed be mystery sighed laura turning to go away will not remain one long mr fane must know since only have latch key yes only have here laura broke off flashed inquiring look on inspector do mean to say that brother in law know something about crime if only have latch key stated that young man with pointed beard met by policeman have latch key yes have mr fane beard beard be clean shaven might have assumed disguise how dare hint at thing said laura indignantly be quite sure that mr fane know nothing last night be at westcliff on sea ill in bed can show wire sister knew be going to to morrow wired last night at five o'clock saying that walter be ill have better not come oh statement took inspector aback if fane have be ill at westcliff on sea certainly must not be man met by mulligan can show wire asked will send round to be quite sure that when see mr fane will not suspect of crime better more kindly man doe not live however woman came to enter house however be killed for what reason mr fane can know nothing of matter how be killed stabbed under left shoulder blade while be singing singing what be singing why in strange house be singing 'kathleen mavourneen laura looked surprised sister favourite song oh indeed said derrick sharply hesitated sister be also at westcliff on sea be about to accuse asked laura disdainfully accuse one replied derrick nettled be only trying in direction to learn fact upon to build up theory then why look for real evidence such a what miss mason such a weapon with woman be killed have looked can not be found murderer took away must not be such fool a to leave that lying about doctor fancy from nature of wound that must be long slim dagger kind of stiletto such a foreigner might use said laura involuntarily what do mean asked inspector sharply laura flushed nothing nothing responded foreigner usually make use of such weapon englishman must not kill person with stiletto be not british certainly said derrick with insular prejudice woman might use such thing still know that assassin be man looked straight at woman laura must not quite understand meaning since never struck that meant to incriminate in matter took notice being anxious to learn what derrick thought what be theory on existing fact asked coldly derrick reflected hardly know what to say let suppose that woman admitted into house how got latch key be not prepared to say came to meet one possibly two people who killed two people interrupted laura abruptly there be young man who kept mulligan in talk explained officer one who presumably killed let suppose for sake of argument that woman met two men seeing policeman at gate number one go out to lure away left alone with number two woman sits at piano to sing on music stand be 'kathleen mavourneen know that song sings assassin standing behind watch opportunity stab then go forget that song be being sung according to own account before number one left gate with policeman certainly woman might have begun to sing immediately after number one left before insisted laura policeman listened while number one be in room be song made stop be only going by what told theory doe fit together derrick frowned be hard to put piece of puzzle together miss mason only in detective fiction doe heaven born genius put that together in flash mere mortal be groping in dark may discus hundred theory before hit on right solution nothing more can be done till see mr fane a woman be in house must know know nothing interrupted laura imperiously ca know man be ill at seaside derrick interrupted in turn will wait till hear what mr fane have to say declared abruptly rose to terminate interview a opened door tracey entered hurriedly car found burst out where asked derrick laura together stranded in yard of charing cross station laura turned quickly on derrick beg to observe mr inspector that can not get to westcliff on sea from charing cross have not yet accused mr fane retorted inspector chapter v public opinion naturally there be great excitement over white room crime a soon came to be called inhabitant of troy be shocked a such thing have never before happened in locality found holy quiet invaded by host of reporter detective policeman idler morbid folk who wished for new sensation mr mr fane left child at seaside came up for inquest be held at quiet public house in neighbourhood fane insisted that body must be taken away from ajax villa must have be removed at once declared know woman never set eye on wife doe know ca conceive how came to die in place do alone own latch key be derrick who asked question eyed fane sharply a reply came alone own latch key of house said fane be peculiar lock other key mine will fit see produced long slim key upon derrick unlocking drawer took out of key picked up by mulligan two be identical in respect see said derrick in turn duplicate have be made noticed that strange key be new when mulligan showed where did get key young man who lured mulligan away from gate dropped very strange said fane in puzzled tone ca understand think locksmith who made key can have made two a especially agreed with that be not to do so have address yes be at office in city will give to be sure man be to be trusted most respectable tradesman hum said derrick scratching chin respectable tradesman do queer thing for money at time why must strange woman have be brought to house house to be murdered ca say be what have to find out know woman asked derrick doubtfully fane be smart cheery faced fellow with rather weak mouth looked rather haggard a have practically risen from sick bed to obey summons of law for moment appeared puzzled when derrick spoke then flashed indignant look on grew red do mean to insinuate did something underhand mr inspector inquired excitedly men admire pretty woman said derrick dryly do like men at same time be faithful to wife whom love very dearly be most attached couple if hint at anything wrong sir let tell be ill with cold at seaside when crime be perpetrated also have be in town have known woman certainly must not have brought to own house quite so said derrick soothingly mean to hint for moment that character be not spotless key sir have ever be out of possession never carry a see on steel chain come off at night go on in morning only wife must have have in possession be not going to accuse of taking impression be asked fane scathingly doe mr fane know woman asked derrick passing over ironical speech never set eye on one know who woman be strange strange wonder why must be killed in house know name asked fane there be mark on linen card letter in pocket came out of darkness into house have be swallowed up by darkness of grave know more at inquest something may transpire sincerely hope so said fane bluntly whole thing be most disagreeable will have to give up ajax villa wife be quite upset affair will put to great expense good day one moment do know young man with pointed beard not that can recall replied fane after pause of course may have met person well derrick gave up question in despair must wait for inquest here fresh disappointment awaited nothing came to light at inquest likely to throw light on mystery geason proved that unknown woman have be stabbed from behind have died almost immediately be positive that have be dead five hour when be called in if be so woman who sang song must not be dead one must young man who entered into conversation with mulligan have be sent to lure away so that murder might take place when young man came out of house woman must have be dead three hour doctor firmly held to opinion thereby perplexed jury upset theory of derrick various be opinion given by present during interview thought one have own pet solution of mystery evidence be scanty mr mr fane stated that knew nothing of woman husband insisted that latch key have never be out of possession wife asserted that have be sick in bed mile away at time crime be committed mulligan described meeting with strange young man conversation have ensued also discovery of body how have entered house inquiry on part of police failed to prove identity of dead tracey stated how have missed motor car evidence be forthcoming to show that have be left in charing cross yard one seemed to know who have brought there result of crop of scanty fact be obvious jury brought in verdict against person person unknown be only thing to be said said derrick to fane when crowd dispersed woman be dead must be buried that cost will fall on parish replied fane who did not seem to be unkindly man poor creature died in house so will charge with burial have consulted mr fane think a do know nothing about be true however if make inquiry may learn inspector shook head fear not know where to look be kind thought of to bury mr fane not many men must do that in place after trouble have have be least can do seeing be murdered under roof may hear who be why not advertise have be done handbill have be placed round describing look with picture order have be sent throughout london to police to keep eye open doubt if anything will come of hunt though surely said fane wrinkling brow woman ca disappear like in london london be very place where people disappear retorted derrick who live in big city never know how many people vanish yearly be never heard of again in case have body of woman who be where came from why be murdered in house will probably never be known well said fane with air of man dismissing subject if do intend to make inquiry please keep advised of discovery must like to know how woman entered house believe saw locksmith did swears positively that did not make duplicate key more than that have not duplicate of one made fane looked doubtful must have thought must have retained copy for trade purpose suppose lost key must not have be able to make mr fane however be keeping eye on may be lying for own end one never know always mistrust respectable men from what sister in law told mr derrick be inclined to mistrust derrick coughed case be so strange said be now quite sure that have nothing to do with matter thank for nothing said fane dryly be lucky that with assistance of wife be able to prove alibi very lucky indeed replied inspector cheerfully have be in town night unable to explain coming going might have gone hard with do mean to say nothing absolutely nothing see here mr fane put in place in place of man woman gain admittance to house there be murdered alone have key on face of doe not look a though alone killed else why use of key to let enter house be lucky for a say that in full open court in ear of men be able to prove alibi else nine out of ten must have suspected of knowing more than stated said knew be sure of sir proved with assistance of mr fane innocence a say leave court without stain same case be strange for part pending discovery of young man who dropped key will hunt for woman in past life will be found explanation of death will let know how get on must ask to also keep advised of what see hear fane shrugged shoulder took out cigar will take further step in matter once woman be buried have left ajax villa thing will be relegated to obscurity so far a be concerned well said derrick with side look perhaps be natural then said good bye to fane went away thoughtfully derrick be not particularly brilliant mortal a conduct of case show a saying go must not see further than nose certainly wondered in own mind if despite evidence of mr fane husband might not have something to do with matter to save life to keep from shame might have kept silence be impossible said derrick aloud if be guilty must not lie if victim have be man now a be woman jealous creature like mr fane must certainly not sacrifice to save man who deceived fane be guiltless who be culprit be question be question derrick must not answer though tried to do so in blundering way so unknown woman be duly buried tracey fane went to funeral body be followed by large concourse of who wished to see last of victim of mysterious tragedy one agreed that fane be behaving very well in thus giving poor wretch decent burial fane looked white worn when grave be being filled in rumour went round of how ill have be how have come up from sick bed to see matter through several people shook hand with a left cemetery be congratulated on hand then gate of burial ground be closed grave be left to rain sunshine for one present knew secret must not be delivered up until judgment day be press said last word on subject daily budget always in search of sensational thought affair strange enough to give honour of leading article a many people may remember perplexity of police public in connection with murder may not be uninteresting to give extract two from article inexplicable murder in troy be one of crime at once startle shock public that woman must be done to death in manner be bad enough that with wonderful police organisation identity must remain mystery be nothing le than scandal shame if house of law abiding citizen be to be made shamble for unknown assassin sooner police force be reorganised better again be not disgraceful that nothing can be found likely to prove who poor creature be have not newspaper agent handbill paraphernalia of civilisation for detection of unknown search must be made in most minute manner in order to prove who dead woman be once name be discovered in past life may be found reason of untimely tragic death be opinion of inspector derrick who have handled case with strange element of mystery with indifferent degree of success not what be prepared to admit that case be remarkably difficult must tax intellect of vidocq to unravel must seem that woman went to house between eight nine o'clock be murdered shortly after entered door certainly be seated at piano certainly song of 'kathleen mavourneen ' be open before be sure that never sang song while waiting for one perhaps assassin who struck down may have played for time woman who sang song did so three hour after death of unfortunate creature mulligan swore that heard song about eleven doctor declares that woman be murdered before nine o'clock on face of be impossible to reconcile conflicting evidence one saw woman enter house although many people be about achilles avenue during evening in multitude of people especially on saturday night must lie chance of woman not being observed few people knew that mr fane family one little girl be at seaside so even if one have noticed woman enter gate of ajax villa thing must not be fixed in mind of observer inquiry have be made one appears to have noted woman coming be therefore impossible to say if entered house alone in company of assassin with regard to assassin be inclined to think be man that man who spoke to policeman at eleven o'clock might be that gaining admittance by latch key with woman killed almost immediately entered then watched chance of escape that entered house with woman appears clear stated above that be impossible to say if woman entered house alone by mean that man may have come earlier may have admitted before nine o'clock poor creature walked into death trap taking to white room lured to sit down at piano must give opportunity of standing behind to stab unawares then when be dead probably looked out of window to see how must escape fear evidently kept within till nearly eleven o'clock then saw policeman passing then sang song to make man believe woman be singing afterwards when have lulled suspicion policeman may have entertained came out escaped in manner described be theory singer be described by mulligan remarkably intelligent officer a having deep contralto voice so be probable assassin sang in falsetto that man killed woman thus escaped be sure for only having latch key must have admitted only must have reason to lure into house what that reason may be must remain for ever mystery so far daily budget with gimcrack theory rival newspaper promptly set to work to pick hole in case a presented by paper rival journal star of morning commented a follows respected contemporary go too fast evidence be given clearly by mulligan that song be being sung while presumed assassin in daily budget opinion be in conversation with at gate therefore young man with pointed beard must not have sung 'kathleen mavourneen ' in theory be amusing wo hold water belief be quite different think more real in first place think that young man be person who admitted woman into house so far agree with contemporary say 'women because believe there be two people victim woman two woman came to house in company of young man by in case admitted since however obtained alone possessed latch key be thus enabled to enter deserted house once in white room victim lured to piano again agree be murdered two assassin for man woman be equally guilty though be not prepared to say who actually struck blow then watched opportunity to escape be marvel that must have remained three hour in house perhaps in room after crime be committed arrived unseen along with victim so be natural to think that must have escaped from house a soon a possible positive that must not be suspected guilt make coward of one made coward of two waited in room watching gradual desertion of achilles avenue about eleven decided to venture then policeman appears doubtless to save appearance woman sang man looking out went away to lure policeman did so then woman escaped saw mr tracey motor car standing unwatched at gate forthwith used to fly fearful lest must be followed if went straight to charing cross must have arrived about half past eleven in crowd in yard on saturday night with cab other vehicle coming going must easily be able to draw up car in quiet corner one seems to have noticed woman driving motor be such common spectacle now that one must remark on circumstance think that woman then entered station left london may have escaped to continent may have gone merely to suburb at event trace of be lost deserted car be noted hour later be theory think be more feasible one than offered by contemporary a mr fane be ignorant of name of deceased be inexplicable how came to meet with tragic death in house servant of mr fane be at seaside along with master mistress so no blame can possibly be attached to mr fane be ill in bed at westcliff on sea so can know nothing positively asserts that alone possessed latch key locksmith from whom obtained declares that duplicate be made be not least strange element in case one thing must draw reader attention to decoration of room in murder be perpetrated be white black dress of corpse must have formed strange contrast to snowy desert around when poor creature be discovered by mulligan quite picturesque murder mr fane seems to be gentleman with original turn for furnishing to posse room crime add to romance secret of murder will never be discovered why woman must be stabbed why must have be lured to strange room to be killed how assassin obtained possession of latch key thing must remain for ever mystery be convinced that crime be committed by man woman have given reason to statement purely theoretical one daily budget retorted in short paragraph will merely ask clever contemporary one question 'if woman assassin thus invented be singing at piano before policeman leaned over gate what opportunity have young man to concert scheme of escape ' to demand there came reply press ceased to comment on crime murder at ajax villa be relegated to catalogue of unknown crime for quite two week then strange thing came to light chapter vi strange discovery will have to make up mind what intend to do dear said mr fane to sister for may tell that walter have arranged to make change in what way asked laura looking up from sewing mr fane did not answer directly looked round cosy morning room with rather wistful expression be very charming room decorated in fashion of quaint old parlour in such apartment might jane austen heroine have sat two lady in modern dress looked rather out of place mr fane be tall statuesque with placid firm face beautiful cold eye be calm have none of wrinkle show indulgence of emotion earthquake must have failed to upset eternal self possession occupied in knitting fleecy shawl scarcely lifted eye a spoke continued to work placidly never dropping single stitch there never be woman who have so much under control a mr fane laura often wondered how came to marry excitable vivacious man like walter perhaps exception to law that like draw to like drew together mr fane found in husband whose nature be so totally opposed to own complement of sister resembled one very little mr fane be dark tall laura slight fair laura laughed when be amused showed anger when felt indulged unrestrained in emotion though never exceeded be a open in disposition a mr fane be secretive glance must reveal laura thought scrutiny must show what mr fane have in mind of be plainly dressed laura indulged in few more trimming than sister mr fane might have be lady abbess from severity of black garb very good abbess must have made only nun under charge must have be controlled with rod of iron have weakness have patience with in others not even pain appealed to for have never be ill toothache be unknown to headache have never experienced seemed to move amongst le favoured mortal like goddess majestic unfeeling far removed from engaging weakness of human nature mr fane by reason of abnormal severity be not popular to make happy marriage man woman must rule if have strong will separation divorce be only remedy to avert unhappy life if man be strong control woman if woman have will guide man thus with divided kingdom domestic life can be fairly happy in case completely so when mr fane julia mason be then determined to marry walter also determined to have own way be a weak a be strong therefore did exactly a ordered always gave outward rule so to speak only instructed behind scene how be to act on stage of world people said that mr mr fane be happy pair never knew real reason of such happiness mr fane concealed iron hand in velvet glove occasionally walter proved restive always managed by quiet determination to bring again into subjection may also be stated that cherished secret contempt that must thus give in to although such yielding formed basis of ideal marriage only laura knew how mr fane despised husband since be living with pair be wise enough to keep knowledge secret otherwise mr fane must have made disagreeable have large capacity for rendering house too hot for one disliked witness expulsion of two servant who have served fane when be bachelor who be discharged in most polite way two month after mr fane came to live at ajax villa domestic boadicea looked round room vaguely then brought eye back to pretty anxious face of laura have poor opinion of laura always strove to impose will on laura have own idea of life resented julia interference there be little love between sister be entirely due to julia domineering temper not that two ever fought mr fane must not fight simply held out till got own way thus be usually successful with walter laura made of sterner stuff managed to hold own firm quality annoyed julia who liked people to grovel at foot be domestic tyrant of worst outside sun be shining ray penetrated even into room mr fane sat in flood of gold be a unwarmed thereby a statue of goddess even tragedy have happened lately left few trace of annoyance on placid brow now that unknown woman be buried paper have ceased to interest in matter apparently dismissed from mind secretly be annoyed with laura because girl have insisted on changing bedroom be not going to sleep in room in that body be laid out said laura be on hint mr fane framed reply wonder at asking in what way intend to make change said in cold voice seeing that changed room oh find villa disagreeable after tragedy so far a be concerned must not mind living here for rest of day like house neighbourhood especially do like white room very place where poor creature be killed said laura with shudder made mr fane smile dear what doe matter death be death however come a ought to know if murder took place in room in house must not mind must like to take place in nursery asked laura here touched fane on raw spot if there be one thing self possessed woman loved be little daughter that be annoyed showed by slight flush crimsoned face must say such thing dear said in icy tone of course except nursery atmosphere of crime must not be conducive to health of minnie a be saying walter wish to give up house said nothing of sort said laura irritated say now then walter wish to go abroad what about business mr fane raised perfectly marked eyebrow well what about laura know walter be often away for week yachting time season make difference to so far a love of sea be concerned frederick say frederick mason be brother that walter be of very little use in office wonder keep then said laura there be question of keeping replied mr fane serenely speak of walter a though be office boy be partner remember do business for quite understand be very simple laura walter a know brought very little money into business seems to have spent what have greater part in furnishing house for be furnished before became engaged be true saw what be coming long time before walter asked to be wife hinted that be furnishing house here how be spending money on then knew that intended to make wife determined to accept not that loved over much added mr fane quietly be anxious to have say in business frederick be fool unless business be looked after will go to ruin a wife of one of partner be able to take part in conduct of business must have done so without marrying said laura mr fane shook head father left income of five hundred year left much more because knew must make good use of money came to principal be not invested in business asked frederick to let become partner refused then engaged to walter who became partner with money frederick be willing seeing that walter be not good business man to let act for husband dare say must have permitted without marriage must not for reason however know now why married walter besides walter be fool wished to have weak husband so might control be there love at in marriage well dear mr fane laughed must confess that walter be very good looking must be jealous of attention to other woman be answered yes so far a love be concerned understand how walter can go abroad leave business be not much use can look after for a have always done do think must let walter go away yachting if did not like free hand be happy on sea be happy in counting house so be well villa have become objectionable to walter on account of murder so intend to give up probably will move to french watering place to switzerland walter can enjoy in usual way can run over when needful to attend to business understand if make home in switzerland will be far from london also walter will not be able to yacht true enough will see must be near england so can run across rapidly walter must be near sea for beloved boat if allow frederick to conduct business without help be sure will ruin too wonder like walter to remain away for so long julia dear have perfect confidence in if loved must keep by

money frederick take after late mother kind woman so weak oh dear sighed mr fane how very weak laura felt inclined to walk out of room knew that such behaviour must result in nothing mr fane must show no anger must simply attack laura on subject uppermost in mind when again met subject be laura future so girl thought best to bring matter to issue doe mean that withdraw opposition to marriage with arnold still think match be bad one if be determined to commit social suicide will not hinder down at westcliff considered matter resolved to tell when returned of course murder brings matter still

of land a be anticipated by mr baldwin have increased many speculator offered large sum to buy mr baldwin be too lazy to make move enjoyed pigging in large roomy house quite resolved not to move until child be settled in life then proposed to sell land use money to take proper station in society whatever meant be cunning enough to know that land must increase still more in value there be making of business woman in mr baldwin have not be so incorrigibly lazy really ca move sighed mr baldwin when approached on subject by gerty who be businesslike speculative heaven know can hardly get through day work with bad health besides there be professor to be considered nice man if be only sure that rufus be dead might consent to take be sheer vanity on part of lazy fat woman a professor have intention of asking to become mr bocaros be bachelor by nature passed life in study holding small post in suburban college where taught foreign language just managed to keep head above water for sake of peace because hated boarding house professor wanted home to when mr baldwin came to cloverhead have tiny cottage on estate at foot of meadow at back of manor house be surrounded by pine lying near

face be eye under shaggy black brow seemed to blaze like lamp however weak ill man looked blazing eye showed that be full of vitality also lean hand must grip firmly long leg took over ground at surprising rate yet ate little appeared to be badly nourished tracey to whom bocaros be always source of wonder constant speculation confided to gerty that believed professor be possessed of restorative served instead of food on whole there be air of mystery about man provoked curiosity of lively inquisitive american must have inspired curiosity with many people also have not bocaros lived so retired life baldwin child called house ogre castle invented weird tale of professor eating little child must wonder if be vampire of sort said tracey live on air food in mother hubbard cupboard of must keep flea in condition believe in much eating mr baldwin responded although never gave inside rest be always chewing like cow abstinence keep brain clear over abstinence kill body retorted tracey bocaros may have thought of murder said very little about never took in paper be accustomed to borrow daily budget from mr baldwin when lady have finished court news only part of paper took interest in usually after return from school where taught bocaros came across meadow by well defined path asked for journal be usually between four five o'clock then must have chat with mr baldwin two three week after ajax villa tragedy when professor tore along path always walked a though be hurrying for doctor met tracey half way american have newspaper in hand coming for guess said tracey handing over journal be just bringing to there be question two wish to ask mind do bocaros fixed brilliant eye on other what be question friend demanded in english hardly bore trace of foreign accent american did not reply directly be clever sort of smart round go ahead colleger said tracey taking thin arm of man attention bocaros did not appreciate want to ask opinion about murder know nothing about murder friend why not go to police police tracey made gesture of disgust ai worth cent why about three week have gone by since poor girl be stabbed seem nearer truth than be discussed before said bocaros a approached belt of pine told that must form theory work lie amidst language be philologist friend detective guess 'd pan out better than rest of if be flatter bocaros removed arm inserted large key into lock of door will come in seem very set on chin music will come said tracey who when bent on obtaining anything never rested till achieved purpose bocaros gave gentle sigh more sensitive man might have taken a sign that company be not wanted at precise moment tracey must not go so have to be admitted entered room be lined with book furnished otherwise in poor manner threw into one armchair then took out cigarette case have one said extending pipe friend will please better replied bocaros filled large china pipe must have obtained when be german student then took seat with back towards window intimated that be ready see here said tracey opening newspaper pointing to paragraph read be about murder asked bocaros puffing gently at pipe yes that fool of derrick have made discovery of value in case can not be fool friend replied bocaros leaning back head inhaling smoke luxuriously tell what paper say ca read while talk be sure will not be silent for five minute be fact said tracey coolly have got long tongue inquiring mind sha read paragraph seems that derrick mean have found out woman name how interesting said bocaros unmoved in rather bored tone how did find

afterwards said bocaros hastily at present want to know woman name keep hair on professor name be brand bocaros rose from chair dropping pipe threw up hand with foreign ejaculation brand flora brand yes how do come to know front name be cousin said professor sat down to cover face with hand tracey whistled stared in making communication to man be far from expecting that announcement must be made

through long hair mr tracey be clever man can rely on to help help tracey looked sharply at professor what be mean help with police be not accustomed to deal with matter will ask question well what if do can answer reckon yes yes know how suspicious police be may be in foreign land where hail from guess be too pig headed here to think much woman flora be murdered in ajax villa be only short distance from house may think that killed be rubbish be queer certainly that must have come to end life in way so near to shanty there be not much chance of police accusing did know fane in way never even heard of not from miss mason know have only spoken dozen word to said bocaros twisting hand together know how shy be lady gerty b put in tracey yes miss baldwin introduced to miss mason have little speech together young lady might have mentioned name of fane forget forget bocaros passed hand over brow again know how absent be yes yes said luther tracey soothingly for saw that man be growing excited lie down go slow tell about cousin of yours be first cousin explained bocaros sitting down keeping down by strongest of effort father sister married man called calvert calvert why be

that must have be murdered in so barbarous fashion see position live near house where crime be committed inherit ten thousand year be much in need of money how do know what police may accuse of killing flora will have to prove how got into house first said american rather ashamed of momentary suspicion since man looked at matter in fashion lie low professor be right guess there be long

poor always dressed well most charming lady where did get ten thousand year from relative who died in australia at first interview stated that have such relative that be probable must inherit money

gentleman have be much respected member of profession name inspired confidence regarding merry own name be certainly odd fitted extremely well be stout rubicund lawyer not at resembling accepted type there be nothing dry solemn about merry seemed to be simple sort of person client sometimes doubted ability cheerfulness be assumed really be a deep a well be well wherein truth did not reside not that merry did anything likely to get struck off roll be far too clever for be certainly unscrupulous more than match for majority of rascal always looked for worst in man smile complacent fatness disarmed suspicion of talent many sharper have cause to rue trusting to deceitful appearance of lawyer mr merry sat alone in dingy room window of looked out on to blank room be surrounded by black painted deed box be remarkably dusty before lawyer be pile of letter intended to answer shortly at present moment be looking at yesterday copy of daily budget belonged to merry junior father have

into rage bocaros did nothing of sort face be white appeared to breathe with difficulty then smiled drew long breath of relief so have left nothing said be glad of glad of echoed merry yes be fearful lest police must suspect of having hand in poor flora death now that have left nothing can never think have motive to kill be true enough said merry puzzled in case see how police can suspect be true that live near house where mr brand be murdered doubt can account for action on night said bocaros unhesitatingly be just where difficulty come in live alone from five o'clock on day saw one so far a police be concerned must have be perfectly easy for to have killed mr brand have returned to lonely house without raising suspicion there be need to incriminate said lawyer thinking bocaros be slightly touched be quite sure that police will think a do what be that if be guilty must not be in such hurry to put in wrong be not in wrong be innocent quite so well there be good discussing matter suppose can throw light on strange death none have told know trust that mr calvert seeing have inherited money will take up matter hunt down assassin thinking must inherit decided to do so myself what

although have played minor part in drama of bard arnold be mr varney pet lodger a be on stage frequently gave benefit of advice calvert always received stale instruction with good humour attention

betokened man who thought handsome intellectual face on whole usually bright with good health good humour contentment at present however be rather clouded cause of dismal expression be to be found in presence of two men who be seated near window arnold in riding dress stood on hearth rug with hand in pocket have come back from ride morning to find two gentleman waiting for professor bocaros said mr varney in hall when admitted be gentleman though shabby other called jasher be a vulgar a vulgar name be rather hard on mr jasher who be not so vulgar a landlady made out be a stout a bocaros be lean fair complacent well fed elderly man of falstaff tribe mr jasher looked a though knew good dinner when sat down to one be quite able to appreciate delicate cookery good wine round fat face be red freckled with rather full lip twinkling grey eye humorous in expression hair be plentiful if rather grey with fat hand folded sleepily on rotund stomach mr jasher looked anything inquiry agent yet be profession a announced by professor bocaros arnold have received intimation calmly though with astonishment why do bring man to asked curtly do know who be asked bocaros in turn arnold nodded do there be certain relative of ours who sometimes spoke of flora brand arnold nodded again mr brand said be flora calvert daughter of uncle aunt professor be understand mother doubtless know of relationship since told that have seen twice interposed bocaros quickly then wiped mouth saw five six year ago then shortly before murder jasher looked directly at calvert a professor made statement hoping to discern emotion arnold face doubtless owing to stage training betrayed nothing of feeling looked a cold a face of greek god rather resembled in look be aware that mr brand be murdered said lawyer messrs laing merry told so other day did tell about money asked bocaros big black eye fastened eagerly on face of cousin time calvert coloured trifle shifted rather direct gaze yes answered though know by what right ask such question be cousin even doe not entitle to take liberty bocaros looked annoyed be last man to take liberty with one said coldly while jasher twinkling eye watched face face of calvert alternately flora when saw week before be murdered told that have made will in favour when went to see merry be informed that have changed mind have constituted heir quite so assented young man mr merry told of visit rather expected visit from professor want to help with money want to offer reward in order to learn who killed cousin burst out bocaros swiftly calvert bit lip blood rushed to fair face may be sure will leave stone unturned to learn truth said walked in rather agitated manner up down room at length came to halt opposite jasher be private inquiry agent said mr merry informed that professor under impression that have inherited money employed to hunt for assassin of poor mr brand yes yes cried bocaros shifting chair in great excitement bring to that may employ be poor yes be very poor want money spend what must give in paying jasher to discover assassin be why bring mr jasher to asked arnold what else said bocaros only saw flora twice liked be good to want to know who killed world want to know professor pardon said jasher in unctuous voice think world in general care very much mr calvert world have grown tired of nine day wonder now be occupying in other matter pointed out to professor proposed that must remunerate for what have done seeing that can not pay let sleeping dog lie arnold looked up sharply what do mean by expression asked quickly have discovered anything jasher produced small note book have set down one two thing at present be collecting evidence when have sufficient will know how to move closed book if must like to destroy page why devil must man demanded calvert frowning a cousin legatee of mr brand be doubly concerned in learning truth agree to what professor suggests will search out matter find out who killed poor woman will bear expense if bring guilty person to justice will pay five hundred pound consider done said jasher nodding will engage to get at truth five hundred pound be worth earning be satisfied asked calvert turning to bocaros professor strangely enough seeing that errand have not be in vain looked rather disappointed yes replied hesitatingly be good of be very pleased rose now will go said arnold touching on breast sit down a pay piper call tune mr jasher have passed from employment into mine must like to know turned to jasher what have discovered so far nothing easier said jasher again opening little book have learned detail from paper from observation from professor bocaros from mr tracey tracey said calvert starting remember be american whose car be stolen know better than mr calvert burst in professor be engaged to miss baldwin great friend of young lady whom be to marry arnold turned on greek sharply how do know live in house near mr baldwin be landlady know tracey miss baldwin have met miss mason miss mason told interposed arnold mr tracey informed by miss baldwin told struck a strange added bocaros in rather venomous tone that must be engaged to girl in whose house flora be murdered belongs to brother in law said calvert coldly do mean to hint professor know anything about crime interposed jasher making sign to bocaros to hold tongue doe mean anything of sort merely coincidence mr calvert such a will occur in real life of course bocaros nodded spoke with le significance mean that be merely coincidence calvert looked from one to other suspiciously set mask on face so that must not guess what be passing in mind may a well understand one said coolly if professor mr be under impression have anything to do with crime may think so from fact that being notoriously hard up notoriously anxious to marry miss mason wanted money be quite mistaken be engaged at frivolity theatre from seven till close on midnight night can prove what law call alibi if will apply to stage manager of theatre may convince of fact dear sir said jasher deprecatingly since calvert be now employer one suspect thought from what bocaros hinted said be merely coincidence said professor quickly very fact that be willing to employ jasher offer so large reward proclaims innocence have need to resort to such thing said calvert angrily only learned that dead woman be cousin from fact of white room how did lead to identification of flora with dead woman asked bocaros shrewdly arnold seemed confused saw in paper that white room have be remarked by man called webb who have communicated with police be then found by inspector derrick mr brand have be missing fancied that might be unknown woman be informed that be truth by merry who have communicated with police did not see body must have be able to identify derrick found portrait of cousin say be that of dead woman be rather roundabout explanation bocaros curled lip in spite of denial seemed to suspect arnold that jasher touched arm must have asked question a be allowed agent to speak knew that cousin have room asked jasher yes certainly knew then have sometimes visited have cousin be good friend did not see much of certainly have be in house did know that mr fane have similar white room yes told be own idea said that one else have be beforehand have cousin who have room did mention cousin name not at time flora said that white room be own idea fane insisted that idea be original emanating from brain thought be coincidence there appear to be great many coincidence about case in connection with murmured bocaros of remark calvert for own reason took notice seeing that cousin be killed in white room in ajax villa mr calvert pursued jasher did not strike that must be wise to draw attention of police to other white room certainly not why must have connected flora with dead woman never knew be missing until man webb of hampstead drew attention to disappearance by time white room at hampstead have become known to police in fact room there taken in connection with mr brand disappearance made webb write to police see how can blame said agent patiently be only trying to get at truth know know miss mason be sister in law of fane what of do mean to hint that said jasher hastily be stated at inquest that fane alone have latch key that be never out of possession that man who made invented that particular latch key may say never made how then did mr brand enter house how did know that family be at seaside can not tell why do ask thought miss mason seeing that be engaged to might have spoken out arnold face grew red forbid to bring miss mason name into matter cried imperiously have nothing to do with affair be stopping with mr baldwin on night never went near ajax villa when sister be absent fane wife be at seaside so be servant how can implicate of people say that can retorted jasher be simply groping in dark fact remains that mr fane alone have latch key must have be out of possession so one must take impression have duplicate made well what will tell said bocaros coming away from window mr fane must have be young man who spoke to officer who killed woman poor flora forget said arnold coolly be proved that woman be alive when young man in question be talking to policeman on contrary said professor smoothly be proved that woman poor flora be dead three hour when woman be singing young man luring policeman away how dare say that man lured policeman away cried arnold furiously ignorance of english law professor excuse loose talk be accusing one without basis of fact what be opinion jasher have got one a yet said jasher putting book away rising so far ca see light will go away search then come back to tell if have discovered anything in what direction will search asked calvert uneasily will search in direction of latch key fane alone have so want to learn fane doings on night be at seaside so say said jasher significantly so mr fane say said bocaros quickly better look for young man with pointed beard police have looked everywhere have not be found said arnold calmly think will be found professor be about to speak when jasher pulled to door when there spoke by way mr calvert did ever see mr brand asked never did did ever see portrait time calvert denial be not so emphatic did jasher nodded be right said will come back in few day tell about latch key when two withdrew calvert sat down in armchair buried face in hand head be whirling mind be much troubled so buried be in reflection that did not hear door open be not conscious that one be in room till hand be laid on shoulder with start sprang to foot looked saw laura mason chapter xii arnold laura lover looked at one in terror calvert surprised by laura sudden entrance have time to compose feature seeing face coming to already filled with suspicion against strove vainly to fight reflected paleness haggard look startled for moment mask have dropped human being devoured by terror

coldly a really understand what mean by speech lost that dagger threw into dustbin after killing that poor woman laura calvert rose to foot pale trembling from being calm resolute man suddenly seemed to change into coward with white lip drooping figure stood in middle of room will never say anything more cruel than to said in low voice covered face laura looked with sudden joy overspreading face

to help chapter xiii on track mr jasher be man who in time have played many part on stage of world loved money ease comfort judicious expenditure of money must procure be not sufficiently successful in making income several venture have turned out badly before opened private inquiry office hitherto have not seemed likely to be triumph work be hard pay not very good for month mr jasher have be contemplating wisdom of giving up business starting a theatrical manager be fond of stage in united state have produced several drama at dead loss english people being le clever than yankee jasher thought must again venture on theatrical agency be about time professor bocaros called to see chance of making great deal of money out of simple scholar presented to jasher took up matter be so difficult that detective for so be in fact did not think wise to trust elucidation of mystery to meaner hand resolved to attend to personally charge accordingly discovery that money have passed to calvert be not pleasing to jasher a have now to deal with man more shrewd le inclined to pay largely however supported by bocaros jasher called at bloomsbury lodging of actor ended a have be seen in getting business of hunting down assassin of flora brand be not easy mystery to unravel first thing to be done said mr jasher to in solitude of office be to find out what sort of cove calvert be if be what call stinger will have to go straight if ai will buckle to do best in way will get money can out of in pursuance of amiable resolve jasher sought out several theatrical folk whom knew well report of calvert be that have strong will be very good natured be considered that must never be actor old fashioned stager believed that be merely through good look fashionable clothes obtained engagement jasher knew jealousy of connected with green room determined to see calvert act with own eye according to force talent displayed by young man might be able to estimate depth of character having thus made up mind jasher treated to seat in pit of frivolity theatre audience be small a play be not great success be good thing be got fortune be agent reflection a piece wo run long being out of engagement must have much chance of marrying girl be sweet on according to old bocaros play be not good one best scene being in middle act wherein masked ball took place calvert be dressed a venetian looked remarkably handsome in black velvet gold during scene have to draw dagger drew jasher attention to fact that wore such weapon did not give matter much thought be only when arnold came on in last act in tweed suit with reddish pointed beard that started occurred to that have heard from friend in police of how young man met by mulligan have be thus attired description of young man save in vague way have not be put into paper probably jasher that mind be full of murder must not have noticed dress general appearance a be remembrance of dagger fact of tweed suit pointed beard made reflect also fact that arnold be engaged to sister in law of man to whom villa belonged made lay unusual stress on matter blest if think be got something to do with matter professor said to bocaros same evening greek anxious to know how matter be proceeding have made appointment with jasher at soho restaurant after theatre be now at supper table looking more haggard lean than ever with blazing eye funereal look disappointed at being deprived of mr brand fortune bocaros a laura surmised rightly be angry with arnold for having obtained remark have made in young man presence be mere fault finding word a have reason on face of to suspect of being connected with crime moreover arnold ready acceptance of jasher a agent to search out matter must have done away with idea that be guilty man must be such fool a to put bloodhound of law on own track when have succeeded in gaining end without danger when jasher made above remark bocaros looked at eagerly be idea declared quickly have ground to go upon calvert be engaged to miss mason in brother in law house flora be killed so must know something oh see that mused jasher go too fast professor of course fact fact that get large income may seem suspicious being engaged at theatre night put guilt out of question to learn can about calvert have asked understudy to come to supper jasher glanced at watch will be here soon then can talk from description said bocaros who stuck to point calvert be young man who spoke to mulligan think that have clothes beard described by officer if be man must hardly be such fool a to retain such make up yes must persisted bocaros safety often lie in danger if calvert have changed make up description have appeared in paper suspicion must have be excited true description appeared only vague one calvert did not know that thought best to keep to make up trusting that people who be generally stupid must never connect stage appearance with of man in real life be man be sure came out of house doe say killed mr brand have ten thousand year to gain by doing so quite right woman be killed before nine during hour calvert be engaged at theatre be true enough said professor gloomily same seems queer

nonsense at outset for that gave away always supposing be guilty said that lived in neighbourhood that money be coming to that must easily have gone to villa killed mr brand must not be able to prove alibi by reason of living alone man who be guilty doe give away like bocaros have found message might have torn up so a to let sleeping dog lie still understand well see might have fancied a do that

sufficed to overturn column there beneath concealed by base be coffee stain spoiling purity of carpet tracey produced large knife ripped up carpet thrusting in hand pulled out slim green book rather large in size thereon in gilt letter be word diary solves mystery said tracey quietly now will learn truth chapter xvii professor trump card inspector derrick called to see fane with rather downcast expression of countenance meaning of be explained in conversation have done best sir there be nothing to be discovered mean a regard murder of woman brand asked walter what else must mean replied

under pale eye hinted at sleepless night also there be smell of ether in room a though have be taking drug derrick delicately ascribed look to fact of unpleasant occurrence have taken place in house suppose have come to think haunted sir suggested like idea of living in house in murder have be committed believe in supernatural for sake of wife child be giving up villa intend to live abroad for time must like mystery solved assassin of poor woman brought to justice before go derrick shook head be not to be done sir suppose offer reward not even then mr fane ca find single clue when discovered that white room in hampstead house thought something must come of assassin be clever enough to go there remove evidence of past life of mr brand book paper photograph sort of thing be true found photograph of dead woman knew look already now have be portrait of husband ah do suspect husband yes replied derrick thoughtfully certainly learned that man went to australia time before death found name in passenger list of orient liner then can have nothing to do with crime well know man may start for country to make thing safe for then can come back secretly besides if be not husband who removed thing how did enter cottage why must make such point of destroying own photograph have no aim ca guess be equally mysterious how woman managed to enter house ca learn anything about key being duplicated yet must have be seeing have second key be dropped by man who talked to mulligan have found be likely to tell mr fane case be hopeless believe mr calvert who came in for money have placed matter in hand of private inquiry agent called jasher if ca learn truth jasher ca be clever man well be did work with at one time appears to have wit about case will be beyond wit a be beyond mine dare say mr calvert must offer reward must like to earn derrick rose shook head there be nothing to be done fane thought for few minute eye on ground then went to wife desk wrote out cheque deserve something for trouble said handing to derrick ask in return be that must give photograph of dead woman have fancy to try learn truth oh will do replied inspector taking cheque with thanks be sorry sir that nothing can be done will hear more of case woman be dead buried thing be forgotten there be only one chance what be asked fane curiously husband may return to hampstead house from australia if so

seemed to that knew fane face yet be unaware of having met before face seems familiar muttered bocaros where can have seen searched memory vainly before brain must respond to demand on footman returned with intimation mr fane must see bocaros followed man upstairs into white room here sat mr fane cold statuesque a usual alone minnie be out with nurse laura be paying visit to gerty beside mr fane stood small wicker table on book lay open be a usual engaged in knitting apparently preferred own thought to of popular author whose book be beside when professor entered rose gracefully looked at keenly may ask what have to see about said mr fane putting remark purposely in way so a to impress bocaros with idea that be favoured professor bowed took chair pointed to have never seen mr fane before thought singularly lovely woman a decidedly be also from stern lip piercing eye judged that be woman who must ruthlessly carry out scheme have formed must press forward dauntlessly in face of danger clever woman dangerous woman foe worthy to be met conquered that must conquer even amazon professor did not doubt knew too much for to deny since interview with emily doon have spent time in getting certain proof together mr fane might be clever must not be able to defend in face of fact proposed to place before bocaros feeling way carefully did not reply at once to question will see name on card said quietly professor bocaros read mr fane never heard of did not miss mason mention recall having done so strange said man be tenant of mr baldwin sister be friend of mr baldwin replied mr fane be not to be thought that interest in mr baldwin private affair live in little house across field be very interesting said mr fane sarcastically wondering why man kept telling thing of note be foreigner greek bocaros constantine bocaros then professor feeling nettled by behaviour resolved to startle be cousin of woman who be murdered in room said abruptly mr fane merely raised eyebrow have

fane hand fell stared at man be not be voice be heard sang favourite song indeed mr fane thought for moment without losing colour self possession in face of accusation then returned to seat resolved to give strange man hearing be at seaside when crime be committed so believe husband also husband also said mr fane calmly will be so kind a to tell what mean by question want to prove guilt of calvert can not help to do so said impatiently yes can persisted bocaros calvert be young man who left house while be singing assisted to escape met here used dagger to kill flora brand what dagger
