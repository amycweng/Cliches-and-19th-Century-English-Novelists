corner commenced exhaustive examination of there be nothing remarkable about coat be merely well cut well made dress coat so with grunt of dissatisfaction mr gorby threw aside picked up waistcoat here

be sorry to hear said frettlby referring to fact that whyte be murdered have letter of introduction to seemed clever pushing young fellow confounded cad muttered felix under breath brian who overheard seemed inclined to assent for rest of meal nothing be talked about murder mystery in be shrouded when lady retired chatted about in drawingroom finally dropped for more agreeable subject men however when cloth be removed filled glass continued discussion with unabated vigour brian alone did not take part in conversation sat moodily staring at untasted wine wrapped in brown study what ca make out observed rolleston who be amusing with cracking nut be why did not find out who be before be not hard to answer said frettlby filling glass be comparatively little known here a have be out from england short time fancy that be only house at visited look here rolleston said calton who be sitting near if be to find man dead in hansom cab dressed in evening clothes nine men out of ten be in habit of wearing in evening card in pocket name on linen rather think must find hard to discover who be consider reflects great credit on police for finding out so quickly put one in mind of 'the

frettlby with amused smile criminal must be pretty safe oh know so much about answered felix shrewdly fellow be like trifle at party froth on top something better underneath what greedy simile said

upon went on calton warming to subject man who murdered whyte be ordinary criminal place chose for committal of crime be such safe one do think so said rolleston why must think that hansom cab in public street must be very unsafe be that very fact that make safer replied mr calton epigrammatically read de quincey account of marr murder in london will see that more public place le risk there be of detection there be nothing about gentleman in light coat who murdered whyte to excite royston suspicion entered cab with whyte noise anything likely to attract attention be heard then alighted naturally enough royston drove to st kilda never suspected whyte be dead till looked inside touched a to man in light coat doe live in powlett street in east melbourne why not asked frettlby because

one about at time of morning must return to lodging hotel wherever be staying with impunity of course be theory may be wrong from what insight into human nature profession have given think that idea be correct one present agreed with mr calton idea a really did seem most natural thing must be done by man desirous of escaping detection tell said felix to brian a be on way to drawing room if fellow committed crime be found out by gad ought to get calton to defend chapter viii brian take walk drive when gentleman entered drawing room young lady be engaged in playing one of detestable piece of

since died away brian must see white wavelet breaking lightly on sand long narrow pier ran out like black thread into sheet of gleaming silver away in distance line of williamstown light sparkled like fairy illumination over placid scene of land water be sky such a dore loved great heavy mass of rain cloud heaped one on top of other a rock titan piled to reach olympus then break in woof bit of dark blue sky must be seen glittering with star in midst of sailed serene moon shedding down light on cloudland beneath giving to one silver lining somewhat to annoyance of mr gorby who have eye for picturesque brian gazed at sky for several minute admiring wonderful beauty of broken mass of light shade at length lit cigarette walked down step on to pier oh suicide be muttered gorby not if can

tongue where be to begin desk replied madge going over to be most likely place think so said calton shaking head if a say fitzgerald be careless man must not have troubled to put there however perhaps 'd better look desk be very untidy just like brian a madge remarked full of paid unpaid bill old letter play bill ball programme withered flower reminiscence of former flirtation said calton with laugh pointing to must not wonder retorted miss frettlby coolly brian always be in love with one other know what lytton say 'there be many counterfeit only one eros ' so can afford to forget thing letter however be not to be found in desk be in sitting room tried bedroom with better result madge be about to give up search in despair when suddenly calton eye fell on waste paper basket by unaccountable reason have over looked basket be half full in fact more than half on looking at sudden thought struck lawyer rang bell presently mr sampson made appearance how long have that waste paper basket be standing like that asked pointing to bein ' only fault 'ad to find with 'im said mr sampson ' e bein that untidy that ' e never let clean out until ' e told pussonly ' e said a 'ow e

ah got letter four week ago depend upon will find there madge gave cry falling on knee emptied basket out on floor calton be soon a busy among fragment of paper a though be rag picker ai orf 'eads murmured mr sampson a went to door look like bein ' suddenly cry broke from madge a drew out of mass of paper half burnt letter written on thick creamy looking paper at last cried rising off knee smoothing out knew have not destroyed pretty nearly however said calton a eye glanced rapidly over be almost useless a be there be name to illustration fac simile of letter took over to window spread out upon table be dirty half burnt still be clue above be fac simile of letter there be not much to be gained from be afraid said madge sadly show that have appointment where calton did not answer leaning head on hand stared hard at paper at last jumped up with cry have said in excited tone look at paper see how creamy white be above look at printing in corner villa toorak ' then went down to toorak in hour back again hardly then be not written from toorak no be written in one of melbourne back slum how do know look at girl who brought said calton quickly disreputable woman one far more likely to come from back slum than from toorak a to paper three month ago there be robbery at toorak be of paper be stolen by thief madge said nothing sparkling eye nervous trembling of hand showed excitement will see detective evening said calton exultingly find out where letter came from who wrote will save yet said placing precious letter carefully in pocket book think that will be able to find woman who wrote that hum said lawyer looking thoughtful may be dead a letter say be in dying condition however if can find woman who delivered letter at club who waited for fitzgerald at corner of bourke russell street will be sufficient want to prove be that be not in hansom cab with whyte do think can do depends upon letter said calton tapping pocket book with finger will tell to morrow shortly afterwards left house when calton put madge safely into st kilda train heart felt lighter than have done since fitzgerald arrest chapter xiv richmond in field there be old adage say like draw to like antithesis of be probably that unlike repels unlike there be time when individualism doe not enter into matter fate alone by throwing two person together set up state congenial uncongenial a case may be fate chose to throw together mr gorby mr kilsip be something more than uncongenial to other be equally clever in common profession be universal favourite yet hated other be a fire water to one when came together invariably there be trouble kilsip be tall slender gorby be short stout kilsip looked clever gorby wore smile of self satisfaction alone be sufficient to prevent doing so yet singularly enough be very smile that proved most useful to gorby in pursuit of calling enabled to come at information where sharp looking colleague might try in vain heart of went forth to gorby sweet smile insinuating manner when kilsip appeared people be wont to shut up to retire promptly like alarmed snail within shell gorby gave lie direct to who hold that face be ever index to mind kilsip on other hand with hawk like countenance brilliant black eye hooked nose small thin lipped mouth endorsed theory complexion be quite colourless hair be jet black altogether must not be called fair to look upon craft cunning be of snake like order so long a conducted enquiry in secret be generally successful once let appear personally on scene failure be assured to thus while kilsip passed a cleverer gorby be invariably more successful at event ostensibly when therefore hansom cab murder case be put into gorby hand soul of kilsip be smitten with envy when fitzgerald be arrested evidence collected by gorby seemed to point so conclusively to guilt kilsip writhed in secret over triumph of enemy though must only have be too glad to say that gorby have got hold of wrong man yet evidence be so conclusive that thought never entered head until received note from mr calton asking to call at office that evening at eight o'clock with reference to murder kilsip knew that calton be counsel for prisoner guessed that be wanted to follow up clue determined to devote to whatever calton might require of if only to prove gorby to be wrong so pleased be at mere possibility of triumphing over rival that on casually meeting stopped invited to drink primary effect of sudden unusual hospitality be to arouse gorby suspicion on second thought deeming quite match for kilsip mentally physically gorby accepted invitation ah said kilsip in soft low voice rubbing lean white hand together a sat over drink be lucky man to have laid hand on hansom cab murderer so quickly yes flatter did manage pretty well said gorby lighting pipe have idea that must be so simple though mind required lot of thought before got proper start suppose be pretty sure be man want pursued kilsip softly with brilliant flash of black eye pretty sure indeed retorted mr gorby scornfully there ai pretty sure about 'd take bible oath be man whyte hated one say to whyte `` ll kill if have got to do in open street ' meet whyte drunk fact acknowledges clear out cabman swears come back then get into cab with living man when come out leaf dead one drive to east melbourne get into house at time landlady can prove just time that cab must take to drive from grammar school on st kilda road if ai fool kilsip will see a there be doubt about look square enough said kilsip who wondered what evidence calton must have found to contradict plain statement of fact what be defence mr calton only man a know answered gorby finishing drink clever a be ca put anything in can go against evidence be too sure of sneered kilsip whose soul be devoured with envy oh be retorted gorby getting a red a turkey cock at sneer be jealous be because have got finger in pie ah may have yet going hunting be said gorby with indignant snort hunting for what for man a be already caught believe have got right man remarked kilsip deliberately mr gorby looked upon with smile of pity of course just because have caught perhaps when see hanged will believe then be smart man be retorted kilsip ai pope to be infallible what ground have for saying be not right man demanded gorby kilsip smiled stole softly across room like cat think be fool a to tell ai so safe clever a think with irritating smile went out be regular snake said gorby to a door closed on brother detective be bragging now there be link missing in chain of evidence against fitzgerald so defy can do worst at eight o'clock on night soft footed soft voiced detective presented at calton office found lawyer impatiently waiting for kilsip closed door softly then taking seat opposite to calton waited for to speak lawyer however first handed cigar then producing bottle of whisky two glass from mysterious recess filled one pushed towards detective kilsip accepted little attention with utmost gravity yet be not without effect on a keen eyed lawyer saw calton be great believer in diplomacy never lost opportunity of inculcating into young men starting in life diplomacy said calton to one young aspirant for legal honour be oil cast on troubled water of social professional political life if can by little tact manage mankind be pretty certain to get on in world calton be man who practised what preached believed kilsip to have feline nature like to be stroked to be made much of paid little attention knowing full well must bear fruit also knew that kilsip entertained friendly feeling for gorby that in fact bore hatred determined that feeling existed between two men must serve to end have in view suppose said leaning back in chair watching wreath of blue smoke curling from cigar suppose know in out of hansom cab murder must rather think so said kilsip with curious light in queer eye why gorby doe nothing brag about smartness in catching supposed murderer aha said calton leaning forward putting arm on table supposed murderer eh doe that mean that have be convicted by jury that think that fitzgerald be innocent kilsip stared hard at lawyer in vague kind of way slowly rubbing hand together well said at length in deliberate manner before got note be convinced gorby have got hold of right man when heard that wanted to see knowing be defending prisoner guessed that must have found something in favour wanted to look after right said calton laconically a mr fitzgerald said met whyte at corner hailed cab went on detective how do know that interrupted calton sharply gorby told how devil did find out cried lawyer with genuine surprise because be always poking prying about said kilsip forgetting in indignation that such poking prying formed part of detective business at rate went on quickly if mr fitzgerald did leave mr whyte only chance be got of proving innocence be that did not come back a cabman alleged then suppose think that fitzgerald will prove alibi said calton well sir answered kilsip modestly of course know more about case than do be only defence can see can make well be not going to put in such defence then must be guilty said kilsip promptly not necessarily returned barrister drily if want to save neck will have to prove alibi persisted other be just where point be answered calton doe want to save neck kilsip looking rather bewildered took sip of whisky waited to hear what mr calton have to say fact be said calton lighting fresh cigar have extraordinary idea in head refuse absolutely to say where be on night understand said kilsip nodding head woman nothing of kind retorted calton hastily thought so at first be wrong went to see dying woman who wished to tell something what about be just what ca tell answered calton quickly must have be something important for sent for in great haste be by bedside between hour of one two on friday morning then did not return to cab no did not went to keep appointment for reason other wo tell where appointment be went to room to day found half burnt letter asking to come calton handed letter to kilsip who placed on table examined carefully be written on thursday said detective of course can see that from date whyte be murdered on friday th be written at something villa toorak pursued kilsip still examining paper oh understand went down there hardly retorted calton in sarcastic tone must very well go down there have interview be back in east melbourne in one hour cabman royston can prove that be at russell street at one o'clock landlady that entered lodging in east melbourne at two be at toorak when be letter delivered shortly before twelve o'clock at melbourne club by girl who from what waiter saw of appears to be disreputable individual will see say bearer will wait at bourke street a street be mentioned a fitzgerald after leaving whyte went down russell street to keep appointment most logical conclusion be that bearer of letter waited for at corner of bourke russell street now went on lawyer want to find out who girl brought letter be how god bless soul kilsip how stupid be cried calton irritation getting better of ca understand that paper came from one of back slum therefore must have be stolen sudden light flashed into kilsip eye talbot villa toorak cried quickly snatching up letter again examining with great attention where burglary took place exactly said calton smiling complacently now do understand what want must take to crib in back slum where article stolen from house in toorak be hidden paper pointing to letter be part of swag left behind must have be used by someone there brian fitzgerald obeyed direction given in letter be there at time of murder understand said kilsip with gratified purr there be four men engaged in burglary hid swag at mother guttersnipe crib in lane off little bourke street hang swell like mr fitzgerald in evening dress must very well have gone down there unless have one with well known in locality finished calton rapidly exactly that woman who delivered letter at club guided judging from waiter description of appearance must think be pretty well known about slum well said kilsip rising looking at watch be now nine o'clock so if like will go to old hag place at once dying woman said a if struck by sudden thought there be woman who died there about

next day kilsip called at calton office late in afternoon found lawyer eagerly expecting detective face however looked rather dismal calton be not reassured well said impatiently when kilsip have closed door taken seat where be be just what want to know detective coolly went to salvation army head quarter made enquiry about appears that have be in army a hallelujah lass got tired of in week went off with friend of hers to sydney carried on old life of dissipation ultimately friend got sick of last thing heard about be that have taken up with chinaman in one of sydney slum telegraphed at once to sydney got reply that there be person of name of sal rawlins known to sydney police said must make enquiry let know result ah have doubt changed name said calton thoughtfully stroking chin

conversion never last long a rule be case of 'the devil be sick devil monk must be more than anything else good looking so so believe replied kilsip shrugging shoulder very ignorant must neither read write account for not asking for fitzgerald when called at club probably did not know whom have be sent for will resolve into question of identification expect however if police ca find will put advertisement in paper offering reward send out handbill to same effect must be found brian fitzgerald life hang on thread thread be sal rawlins yes assented kilsip rubbing hand together even if mr fitzgerald acknowledges that be at mother guttersnipe on night in question will have to prove that be there a one else saw be sure of a sure a anyone can be in such case be late hour when came everyone seems to have be asleep except dying woman sal a one be dead other be only person can prove that be there at time when murder be being committed in hansom mother guttersnipe be drunk a acknowledged last night thought that if gentleman did call must have be other one other one repeated calton in puzzled voice what other one whyte calton arose from seat with blank air of astonishment oliver whyte said a soon a must find voice be in habit of going there kilsip curled up in seat like sleek cat pushing forward head till nose looked like beak of bird of prey looked keenly at calton look here sir said in low purring voice there be good deal in case seem plain in fact further go into more mixed up seems to get went to see mother guttersnipe morning told that whyte have visited 'queen several time while lay ill that seemed to be pretty well acquainted with who deuce be woman call 'queen said calton irritably seems to be at bottom of whole affair path take lead to know hardly anything about replied kilsip except be good looking woman of about forty nine come out from england to sydney few month ago then on here how got to mother guttersnipe ca find out though have tried to pump old woman be a close a wax be belief know more about dead woman than chooses to tell what must have told fitzgerald to make act in silly manner stranger who come from england dy in melbourne slum ca possibly know anything about miss frettlby not unless miss frettlby be secretly married to whyte suggested kilsip 'queen knew nonsense retorted calton sharply why hated love fitzgerald besides why on earth must marry secretly make confidant of woman in one of lowest part of melbourne at one time father wanted to marry whyte made such strong opposition that eventually gave consent to engagement with fitzgerald whyte oh have row with mr frettlby left house in rage be murdered same night for sake of paper carried oh be gorby idea said kilsip scornfully with vicious snarl be mine too answered calton firmly whyte have valuable paper always carried about with woman who died evidently told fitzgerald that did so gathered a much from accidental admission made kilsip looked puzzled must confess that be riddle said at length if mr fitzgerald must only speak must clear everything up speak about what man who murdered whyte well if did not go quite so far a that might at least supply motive for crime perhaps so answered calton a detective rose to go be use fitzgerald for reason have evidently made up mind not to speak so only hope in saving lie in finding girl if be anywhere in australia may be sure will be found answered kilsip confidently a took departure australia be so over crowded a that if sal rawlins be in australia at certainly must have be in very remote part effort to find proved futile be open question if be alive dead seemed to have vanished completely be last seen in sydney den with chinaman whom afterwards appears to have left since then nothing whatever be known of notice offering large reward for discovery be inserted in newspaper australian new zealand nothing came of a be unable to read there seemed little chance of knowing of if a calton surmised have changed name one must be likely to tell of there be only bare chance that might hear of casually that might turn up of own accord if returned to melbourne must certainly go to grandmother have motive for not doing so so kilsip kept sharp watch on house much to mr rawlins disgust for with true english pride objected to system of espionage cuss croaked over evening drink to old crone a withered evil

obstinate silence merely answered must only break heart admitted to calton after good deal of questioning that have be at mother guttersnipe on night of murder after have left whyte by corner of scotch church a cabman royston have stated have gone along russell street met sal rawlins near unicorn hotel have taken to mother guttersnipe where have seen dying woman who have told something must not reveal well said mr calton after hearing admission might have saved trouble by admitting before yet kept secret whatever may be have done so might have got hold of sal rawlins before left melbourne now be mere chance whether turn up not brian did not answer to in fact seemed hardly to be thinking of what lawyer be saying just a calton be leaving asked how be madge how can expect to be said calton turning angrily on be very ill owing to worry have have over affair darling darling cried brian in agony clasping hand above head did only to save calton approached laid hand lightly on shoulder dear fellow said gravely confidence between lawyer client be a sacred a between priest penitent must tell secret concern miss frettlby so deeply said brian firmly will never repeat what that wretched woman told when must not tell before in order to save life be not likely be going to do so now when have nothing to gain everything to lose by telling will never ask again said calton rather annoyed a walked to door a to accusation of murder if can find girl be safe when lawyer left gaol went to detective office to see kilsip ascertain if there be news of sal rawlins a usual there be none

utmost vigilance on part of police offer of large reward by calton on behalf of accused by mr frettlby much desired sal rawlins still remained hidden millionaire have maintained most friendly attitude towards brian throughout whole affair refused to believe guilty when calton told of defence of proving alibi by mean of sal rawlins immediately offered large reward be in enough to set person with time on hand hunting for missing witness australia new zealand rang with extremely plebeian name of sal rawlins paper being full of notice offering reward handbill of staring red letter be posted up in railway station in conjunction with liquid sunshine rum dwd whisky have become famous without knowing unless indeed have kept concealed purposely be hardly probable a there be apparent motive for doing so if be above ground must certainly have seen handbill if not paper though not able to read must hardly help hearing something about one topic of conversation throughout australia notwithstanding sal rawlins be still undiscovered calton in despair began to think that must be dead madge though at time courage gave way be still hopeful god will not permit such judicial crime a murder of innocent man to be committed declared mr calton to whom said shook head doubtfully god have permitted to take place before answered softly can only judge future by past at last day of long

news that sal rawlins who alone must prove innocence of prisoner have be found must appear in court that morning have spread like wildfire acquittal of prisoner be confidently expected by large number of sympathising friend who seemed to have sprung up on side like mushroom in single night there be of course plenty of cautious people left who waited to hear verdict of jury before committing who still believed to be guilty unexpected appearance of sal rawlins have turned great tide of public feeling in favour of prisoner many who have be loudest in denunciation of fitzgerald be now more than half convinced of innocence pious clergyman talked in incoherent way about finger of god innocent not suffering unjustly be case of counting unhatched chicken a verdict have yet to be given felix rolleston awoke found famous in small way out of good natured sympathy spice of contrariness have declared belief in brian innocence now to astonishment found that view of matter be likely to prove correct received so much praise on side for presumed perspicuity that soon began to think that have believed in fitzgerald innocence by calm course of reasoning not because of desire to differ from one else in opinion of case after felix rolleston be not only man who have be astonished to find greatness thrust upon come to believe worthy of be wise man however while in full tide of prosperity

fitzgerald too jolly good looking fellow sort of thing to commit murder whereupon clergyman happening to overhear lively felix make flippant remark disagreed with entirely preached sermon to prove good look crime be closely connected that juda iscariot nero be beauty men ah said calton when heard sermon if unique theory be true one what truly pious man clergyman must be allusion to look of reverend gentleman be rather unkind for be by mean bad looking then calton be one of witty men who must rather lose friend than suppress epigram when prisoner be brought in murmur of sympathy ran through crowded court so ill worn out looked calton be puzzled to account for expression of face so different from of man whose life have be saved rather be about to be saved for in truth be foregone conclusion know who stole paper thought a looked at fitzgerald keenly man who did so be murderer of whyte judge having entered court being opened calton rose to make speech stated in few word line of

prisoner be about quarter to twelve just gave to went away delivered to mr fitzgerald left club at about ten minute to one closed evidence for defence after crown prosecutor have made speech in pointed out strong evidence against prisoner calton arose to address jury be fine speaker made splendid defence not single point escaped brilliant piece of oratory be still remembered spoken of admiringly in purlieu of temple court chancery lane began by giving vivid description of circumstance of murder of meeting of murderer victim in collins street east cab driving down to st kilda getting out of cab of murderer after committing crime way in have secured against pursuit having thus enchained attention of jury by graphic manner in described crime pointed out that evidence brought forward by prosecution be purely circumstantial that have utterly failed to identify prisoner in dock with man who entered cab supposition that prisoner man in light coat be one same person rested solely upon evidence of cabman royston who although not intoxicated be judging from own statement not in fit state to distinguish between man who hailed cab man who got in crime be committed by mean of chloroform therefore if prisoner be guilty must have purchased chloroform in shop obtained from friend at event prosecution have not brought forward single piece of evidence to show how where chloroform have be obtained with regard to glove belonging to murdered man found in prisoner pocket picked up off ground at time when first met whyte when deceased be lying drunk near scotch church certainly there be evidence to show that prisoner have picked up before deceased entered cab on other hand there be evidence to show that have be picked up in cab be far more likely that glove especially white glove must be picked up under light of lamp near scotch church where be easily noticeable than in darkness of cab where there be very little room where must be quite dark a blind be drawn down cabman royston swore positively that man who got out of cab on st kilda road wore diamond ring on forefinger of right hand cabman rankin swore to same thing about man who got out at powlett street against must be placed evidence of one of prisoner most intimate friend one who have seen almost daily for last five year have sworn positively that prisoner be not in habit of wearing ring cabman rankin have also sworn that man who entered cab on st kilda road alighted at powlett street east melbourne at two o'clock on friday morning a heard that hour strike from post office clock whereas evidence of prisoner landlady showed plainly that entered house five minute previously evidence be further supported by of watchmaker dendy mr sampson saw hand of kitchen clock point to five minute to two thinking be ten minute slow told detective that prisoner did not enter house till five minute past two must just give man who alighted from cab presuming to have be prisoner sufficient time to walk up to lodging evidence of watchmaker dendy however showed clearly that have put clock right at hour of eight on thursday night that be impossible for to gain ten minute before two on friday morning therefore time five minute to two seen by landlady be correct one prisoner be in house five minute before other man alighted from cab in powlett street point in be sufficient to show that prisoner be innocent evidence of woman rawlins must prove conclusively to jury that prisoner be not man who committed crime witness brown have proved that woman rawlins have delivered letter to gave to prisoner that prisoner left club to keep appointment spoken of in letter letter rather remains of have be put in evidence woman rawlins swore that prisoner met at corner of russell bourke street have gone with to one of back slum there to see writer of letter also proved that at time of committal of crime prisoner be still in back slum by bed of dying woman there being only one door to room must not possibly have left without witness seeing woman rawlins further proved that left prisoner at corner of bourke russell street at twenty five minute to two o'clock be five minute before royston drove cab up to st kilda police station with dead body inside finally woman rawlins proved word by stating that saw post office town hall clock supposing prisoner started from corner of bourke russell street a say did must reach east melbourne in twenty minute made five minute to two on friday morning time at according to landlady statement entered house evidence given by different witness agreed completely formed chain showed whole of prisoner movement at time of committal of murder therefore be absolutely impossible that murder must have be committed by man in dock strongest piece of evidence brought forward by prosecution be that of witness hableton who swore that prisoner used threat against life of deceased language used be merely outcome of passionate irish nature be not sufficient to prove crime to have be committed by prisoner defence prisoner set up be that of alibi evidence of witness for defence proved conclusively that prisoner must not did not commit murder finally calton wound up elaborate exhaustive speech lasted for over two hour by brilliant peroration calling upon jury to base verdict upon plain fact of case if did so must hardly fail in bringing in verdict of not guilty when calton sat down subdued murmur of applause be heard be instantly suppressed judge began to sum up strongly in favour of fitzgerald jury then retired immediately there be dead silence in crowded court unnatural silence such a must have fallen on blood loving roman populace when saw christian martyr kneeling on hot yellow sand of arena watched long lithe form of lion panther creeping steadily towards prey hour being late gas have be lighted there be sickly glare through wide hall fitzgerald have be taken out of court on retiring of jury spectator stared steadily at empty dock seemed to enchain by indescribable fascination conversed among only in whisper until even whispering ceased nothing must be heard steady ticking of clock now then quick drawn breath of timid on looker suddenly woman whose nerve be over strung shrieked cry rang weirdly through crowded hall be taken out again there be silence eye being now fixed on door through jury must re issue with verdict of life death hand of clock moved slowly round quarter half three quarter then hour sounded with silvery ring startled everyone madge sitting with hand tightly clasped together began to fear that highly strung nerve must give way god muttered softly to herself will suspense never end just then door opened jury re entered prisoner be again placed in dock judge resumed seat time with black cap in pocket a everyone guessed usual formality be gone through when foreman of jury stood up neck be craned forward ear be on alert to catch word fell from lip prisoner flushed little then grew pale a death giving quick nervous glance at quiet figure in black of must just catch glimpse then came verdict sharp decisive not guilty on hearing cheer went up from everyone in court so strong be sympathy with brian in vain crier of court yelled order until be red in face in vain judge threatened to commit present for contempt of court voice being inaudible did not matter much enthusiasm must not be restrained be five minute before order be obtained judge having recovered composure delivered judgment discharged prisoner in accordance with verdict calton have won many case be questionable if have ever heard verdict gave so much satisfaction a proclaimed fitzgerald innocent brian stepping down from dock free man passed through crowd of congratulating friend to small room off court where woman be waiting for woman who clung round neck sobbed out darling darling knew that god must save chapter xx argus give opinion morning after trial be concluded following article in reference to matter appeared in argus during past three month have frequently in column commented on extraordinary case be now so widely known a 'the hansom cab tragedy ' can safely say that be most remarkable case have ever come under notice of criminal court verdict given by jury yesterday have enveloped matter in still deeper mystery by train of strange coincidence mr brian fitzgerald young squatter be suspected of having murdered whyte have not be for timely appearance of woman rawlins who turned up at eleventh hour feel sure that verdict of guilty must have be given innocent man must have suffered punishment for crime of fortunately for prisoner for interest of justice counsel mr calton by unwearied diligence be able to discover last witness prove alibi have not be for in spite of remark made by learned counsel in brilliant speech yesterday resulted in acquittal of prisoner question very much if rest of evidence in favour of accused must have be sufficient to persuade jury that be innocent man only point in favour of mr fitzgerald be inability of cabman royston to swear to a man who have got into cab with wearing of diamond ring on forefinger of right hand whereas mr fitzgerald wear ring difference in time sworn to by cabman rankin landlady against point however prosecution placed mass of evidence seemed conclusively to prove guilt of prisoner appearance of sal rawlins in witness box put end to doubt in language must not be mistaken for anything else than truth positively swore that mr fitzgerald be in one of slum off bourke street between hour of one two on friday morning at time murder be committed under circumstance jury unanimously agreed returned verdict of 'not guilty prisoner be forthwith acquitted have to congratulate counsel mr calton for able speech made for defence also mr fitzgerald for providential escape from dishonourable undeserved punishment leaf court without stain on character with respect sympathy of australian for courage dignity with comported throughout while resting under shadow of such serious charge now that have be conclusively proved that be innocent question arises in one mind 'who be murderer of oliver whyte ' man who committed dastardly crime be still at large for know may be in midst emboldened by impunity with have escaped hand of justice may be walking securely down street talking of very crime of be perpetrator secure in thought that trace of have be lost for ever from time alighted from rankin cab at powlett street have ventured probably to remain in melbourne for anyone know may have be in court during late trial nay very article may meet eye may rejoice at futile effort have be made to find let beware justice be not blind blind folded when least expects will tear bandage from keen eye drag forth to light of day to receive reward of deed owing to strong evidence against fitzgerald be only direction in detective have hitherto looked baffled on one side will look on other time may be successful that man a murderer of oliver whyte must be at large be matter of danger not only to individual citizen to community at large for be well known fact that tiger who once taste human blood never overcomes craving for without doubt man who so daringly coolly murdered drunken therefore defenceless man will not hesitate to commit second crime present feeling of class in melbourne must be one of terror that man must be at large must in great measure resemble fear filled everyone heart in london when marr murder be committed be known that murderer have escaped anyone who have read de quincy graphic description of crime perpetrated by williams must tremble to think that such devil incarnate be in midst be imperative necessity that feeling must be done away with how be to be managed be one thing to speak to act there seems to be possible clue discoverable at present can lead to discovery of real murderer man in light coat who got out of rankin cab at powlett street east melbourne designedly a now appears in order to throw suspicion on fitzgerald have vanished a completely a witch in macbeth left trace behind be two o'clock in morning when left cab in quiet suburb like east melbourne one must be about so that must easily escape unseen there seems to be only one chance of ever tracing be to be found in paper be stolen from pocket of dead man what be only two person knew one know now first two be whyte woman who be called 'the queen of be now dead other who know now be man who committed crime there can be doubt that paper be motive for crime a money be taken from pocket of deceased fact also that paper be carried in pocket made inside waistcoat of deceased show that be of value now reason think that dead woman knew of existence of paper be simply appears that came out from england with whyte a mistress after staying time in sydney came on to melbourne how came into such foul squalid den a died in be unable to say unless seeing that be given to drink be picked up drunk by samaritan of slum carried to mr rawlins humble abode whyte visited there frequently appears to have made attempt to remove to better place alleging a reason that doctor said must die if taken into air reporter learned from one of detective that dead woman be in habit of talking to whyte about certain paper on one occasion be overheard to say to 'they will make fortune if play card well ' be told to detective by woman rawlins to whose providential appearance mr fitzgerald owes escape from can be gathered that paper might be be of value sufficient to tempt to commit murder in order to obtain whyte therefore being dead murderer having escaped only way of discovering secret lie at root of tree of crime be to find out history of woman who died in slum traced back for year circumstance may be discovered will reveal what paper contained once be found can confidently say that murderer will soon be discovered be only chance of finding out cause author of mysterious murder if fails fear hansom cab tragedy will have to be relegated to list of undiscovered crime assassin of whyte will have other punishment than of remorse of own conscience chapter xxi three month afterwards hot

cleverly pointed out rosanna moore a likely to be at bottom of whole affair have be learning past history secret of whyte murder reason for be known to refuse even in interest of justice to reveal why know have little fault from amiable though mistaken sense of will say duty refuse to deliver up man whose cowardly crime so nearly cost life after departure from melbourne one said hansom cab tragedy be at end murderer will never be discovered ' ventured to disagree with wiseacre who made remark asked 'who be woman who died at mother guttersnipe ' receiving satisfactory answer from determined to find out took step accordingly in first place learned from roger moreland who if remember be witness against at trial whyte rosanna moore have come out to sydney in john elder about year ago a mr mr whyte need hardly say that did not think needful to go through formality of marriage a such tie might have be found inconvenient on future occasion moreland knew nothing about rosanna moore advised to give up search a coming from city like london must be difficult to find anyone knew there notwithstanding telegraphed home to friend of mine who be bit of amateur detective out name about woman who left england in john elder on st day of august a wife of oliver whyte mirabile dictu found out about knowing a do what maelstrom of humanity london be must admit friend be clever appears however that task set be easier than expected for so called mr whyte be rather notorious individual in own way be burlesque actress at frivolity theatre in london being very handsome woman have be photographed innumerable time consequently when very foolishly went with whyte to choose berth on board boat be recognised by clerk in office a rosanna moore better known a musette of frivolity why ran away with whyte can not tell with reference to men understanding woman refer to balzac remark anent same perhaps musette got weary of st john wood champagne supper longed for purer air of native land ah open eye at latter statement be surprised on second thought be not because told that be native of sydney have gone home in after triumphant career of acting in melbourne why did leave applauding melbourne public flesh pot of egypt know also ran away with rich young squatter with more money than moral who happened to be in melbourne at time seems to have have weakness for running away why chose whyte to go with time puzzle be not rich not particularly good looking have position bad temper how do know trait of mr whyte character morally socially easily enough omniscient friend found out mr oliver whyte be son of london tailor father being well off retired into private life ultimately went way of flesh son finding with capital income pretty taste for amusement cut shop of late lamented parent found out that family have come over with conqueror glanville de whyte helped to sew bayeux tapestry suppose graduated at frivolity theatre a masher in common with other gilded youth of day worshipped at gas lit shrine of musette goddess pleased with incense left other admirer in lurch ran off with fortunate mr whyte so far a go there be nothing to show why murder be committed men perpetrate crime for sake of light o love like musette unless indeed wretched youth embezzles money to buy jewellery for divinity career of musette in london be simply that of clever member of demi monde a far a can learn one be so much in love with a to commit crime for sake so far so good motive of crime must be found in australia whyte have spent nearly money in england consequently musette lover arrived in sydney with comparatively very little cash however with epicurean like philosophy enjoyed on what little have then came to melbourne where stayed at second rate hotel musette may tell have one special vice common one drink loved champagne drank good deal of consequently on arriving at melbourne finding that new generation have arisen knew not joseph mean musette drowned sorrow in flowing bowl went

have missed found out where be that be too ill to be removed presume be rather glad to get rid of such encumbrance so went back to lodging at st kilda judging from landlady story must have occupied for time while rosanna moore be drinking to death in quiet hotel still doe not break off connection with dying woman one night be murdered in hansom cab same night rosanna moore dy so from appearance everything be ended not so for before dying rosanna sends for brian fitzgerald at club reveals to secret lock up in own heart writer of letter have theory fanciful one if will that secret told to brian fitzgerald contains mystery of oliver whyte death now then have not found out good deal without do still decline to reveal rest say know who killed whyte do say know sufficient to lead to detection of murderer if tell so much better for own sense of justice for peace of mind if well will find out without have taken still take great interest in strange case have sworn to bring murderer to justice so make last appeal to to tell what know if refuse will set to work to find out about rosanna moore prior to departure from australia in be certain sooner later to discover secret led to whyte murder if there be strong reason why must be kept silent perhaps will come round to view let matter drop if have to find out murderer of oliver whyte need expect mercy at hand so think over what have said if hear from within next week will regard decision a final pursue search be sure dear fitzgerald will find letter too long in spite of interesting story contains so will have pity on draw to

in kilsip closed door softly gliding along in usual velvet footed manner sat down in chair near calton placing hat on ground looked keenly at barrister well kilsip said calton with yawn playing with watch chain good news to tell well nothing particularly new purred detective rubbing hand together nothing new nothing true matter said calton quoting emerson what have come to see about hansom cab murder replied other quietly deuce cried calton startled out of professional dignity have found out who did answered kilsip rather dismally have idea so have gorby retorted calton dryly idea ended in smoke have practical proof not yet that mean be going to get if possible much virtue in 'if quoted calton picking up pencil scribbling idly on blotting paper to whom doe suspicion point aha said mr kilsip cautiously know answered other coolly family name humbug presume bosh whom do suspect kilsip looked round cautiously a if to make sure be alone then said in stage whisper roger moreland be young man gave evidence a to how whyte got drunk kilsip nodded well how do connect with murder do remember in evidence given by cabman royston rankin swore that man who be with whyte on night wore diamond ring on forefinger of right hand what of nearly second man in melbourne wear diamond ring not on forefinger of right hand oh moreland wear ring in way yes merely coincidence be that proof can obtain at present be very weak said calton scornfully weakest proof may form chain to hang man observed kilsip sententiously moreland gave evidence clearly enough said calton rising pacing room met whyte got drunk together whyte went out of hotel shortly afterwards moreland followed with coat be left behind by whyte then someone snatched from ah did interrupted kilsip quickly so moreland say said calton stopping short understand think moreland be not so drunk a must make out that after following whyte outside put on coat got into cab with be theory be ingenious enough said barrister why must moreland murder whyte what motive have paper pshaw idea of gorby said calton angrily how do know there be paper fact be calton did not intend kilsip to know whyte really have paper until heard what fitzgerald have to tell thing said calton resuming walk if theory be correct think be what became of whyte coat have moreland got have not answered detective decisively seem very positive about said lawyer after moment pause did ask about reproachful look came into kilsip white face not quite so green said forcing smile thought 'd better opinion of than mr calton ask then how did find out fact be moreland be employed a barman in kangaroo hotel barman echoed calton came out here a gentleman of independent fortune why hang man that in be sufficient to prove that have motive to murder whyte moreland pretty well lived on whyte so what must have induced to kill golden goose become barman pshaw idea be absurd well may be right about matter said kilsip rather angrily if gorby make mistake pretend to be infallible at event when saw moreland in bar wore silver ring on forefinger of right hand silver be diamond show be finger be accustomed to wear ring on when saw determined to search room managed to do so while be out found mare nest kilsip nodded so castle of card fall to ground said calton jestingly idea be absurd moreland more committed murder than did why be too drunk on night to do anything humph so say well men calumniate for nothing be lesser danger to avert greater one replied kilsip coolly be sure that moreland be not drunk on night only said so to escape awkward question a to movement depend upon know more than let out well how do intend to set about matter will start looking for coat first ah think have hidden be sure of theory be when moreland got out of cab at powlett street did interrupted calton angrily let suppose for sake of argument that did said kilsip quietly say when left cab walked up powlett street turned to left down george street walked back to town through fitzroy garden then knowing that coat be noticeable threw away rather hid walked out of garden through town in evening dress more noticeable than coat be in evening dress said kilsip quietly neither be observed calton eagerly recalling evidence at trial blow to theory murderer be in evening dress cabman said so yes because have seen mr fitzgerald in evening dress few minute before thought that be same man who got into cab with whyte well what of if remember second man have coat buttoned up moreland wore dark trouser at least suppose so with coat buttoned up be easy for cabman to make mistake believing a did that be mr fitzgerald sound better said calton thoughtfully what be going to do look for coat in fitzroy garden pshaw wild goose chase possibly said kilsip a arose to go when will see again said calton oh to night said kilsip pausing at door have nearly forgotten mother guttersnipe want to see why what be up be dying want to tell secret rosanna moore by jove said calton will tell something about will get to bottom of yet right will be here at eight o'clock very well sir detective glided out wonder if old woman know anything said calton to a resumed seat may have overheard conversation between whyte mistress intends to divulge well be afraid when fitzgerald doe confess will know about beforehand chapter xxvii mother guttersnipe join majority punctual to appointment kilsip called at calton office at eight o'clock in order to guide through squalid labyrinth of slum found barrister waiting impatiently for fact be calton have got into head that rosanna moore be at bottom of whole mystery new piece of evidence discovered went to confirm belief when rosanna moore be dying might have confessed something to mother guttersnipe must hint at name of murderer have strong suspicion that old hag have received hush money in order to keep quiet several time before calton have be on point of going to trying to get secret out of be if knew now fate appeared to be playing into hand voluntary confession be much more likely to be true than one dragged piecemeal from unwilling lip by time kilsip made appearance calton be in high state of excitement suppose 'd better go at once said to kilsip a lit cigar old hag may go off at moment might assented kilsip doubtfully must be bit surprised if pulled through of old woman have nine life like cat not improbable retorted calton a passed into brilliantly lighted street nature seemed to to be essentially feline tell went on what be matter with old age partly drink also think answered kilsip besides surroundings be not very healthy dissipated habit have pretty well settled be anything catching hope cried barrister with shudder a passed into crowd of bourke street know sir not being

being mistress to sedate bondage of wife in question of morality so many people live in glass house that there be few nowadays who can afford to throw stone calton did not think worse of frettlby for

now brian found truth of have be in town almost week have not yet be to see calton morning something very near set out determined to go direct to chancery lane never arrived there have returned to lodging in east melbourne have passed time in house in garden when perhaps business connected with sale of station compelled presence in town drove straight there back curiously enough shrank from meeting of friend felt keenly recent position in prisoner dock even when walking by yarra a frequently did be conscious of uneasy feeling feeling that be object of curiosity that people turned to look at out of morbid desire to see one who have be so nearly hanged for murder a soon a station must be sold married to madge determined to leave australia never set foot on again until must leave place must see one must mix with former friend so great be dread of being stared at mr sampson who have welcomed back with shrill exclamation of delight be loud in expression of disapproval a to way be shutting up eye bein ' 'ollow said sympathising cricket be nat'ral a be want of air 'usband uncle being druggist ' well to do in collingwood s a want of ox eye gent being french name a ' e called atmispeare be fearful for pullin ' people down ' makin ' 'em go off food hardly eats anythin ' ' not bein ' butterfly be expected a appetite must be larger oh be right said brian absently lighting cigarette only half listening to landlady garrulous chatter if anyone call tell be not in want to be bothered by visitor bein a wise thing a solomon ever said answered mr sampson energetically doubt '

take with dash of brandy tho ' to be sure might be cause of want of life drat bell finished hurrying out of room a front door bell sounded leg be givin way under thro ' bein overworked meanwhile brian sat smoked contentedly much relieved by departure of mr sampson with constant chatter soon heard mount stair again entered room with telegram handed to lodger 'opin ' contain bad noose said a retreated to door again like 'avin have shock in early life thro ' one come unexpected a uncle grandfather be dead 'avin perished of consumption family being disposed to disease now if will excuse sir will get to dinner bein ' in 'abit of takin ' meal reg'lar study inside carefully bein ' easily upset thro ' never must be sailor mr sampson having at last exhausted went out of room crackled loudly down stair leaving brian to read telegram tore open envelope found message be from madge to say that have returned to ask to dine with that evening fitzgerald folded up telegram then rising from seat walked moodily up down room with hand in pocket so be there said young man aloud will have to meet shake hand with knowing time what be if be not for madge 'd leave place at once after way stood by in trouble must be coward if did so be a madge have predicted father be unable to stay long in one place have come back to melbourne week after brian have arrived pleasant party at station be broken up like graf of household guest be scattered far wide peterson have left for new zealand en route for wonder of hot lake old colonist be about to start for england in order to refresh boyish memory mr mr rolleston have come back to melbourne where wretched felix be compelled once more to plunge into politics dr chinston have resumed usual routine of fee patient madge be glad to be back in melbourne again a now that health be restored craved for excitement of town life be now more than three month since murder nine day wonder be thing of past possibility of war with russia be one absorbing topic of hour colonist be busy preparing for attack of possible enemy a spanish king have drawn treasure from mexico peru so might white czar lay violent hand on golden store of australia here there be uncultured savage to face son grandson of men who have dimmed glory of russian arm at alma balaclava so in midst of stormy rumour of war tragic fate of oliver whyte be quite forgotten after trial everyone including detective office have given up matter mentally relegated to list of undiscovered crime in spite of utmost vigilance nothing new have be discovered seemed likely that assassin of oliver whyte must remain free man there be only two people in melbourne who still held contrary opinion be calton kilsip men have sworn to discover unknown murderer who struck cowardly blow in dark though there seemed possible chance of success yet worked on kilsip suspected roger moreland boon companion of dead man suspicion be vague uncertain there seemed little hope of verifying barrister did not a yet suspect particular person though death bed confession of mother guttersnipe have thrown new light on subject thought that when fitzgerald told secret rosanna moore have confided to keeping real murderer must soon be discovered at least clue must be found must lead to detection so a matter stood at time of mark frettlby return to melbourne mr calton be waiting for fitzgerald confession before making move while kilsip worked stealthily in dark searching for evidence against moreland on receiving madge telegram brian determined to go down in evening not to dinner so sent reply to madge to effect did not want to meet mark frettlby did not of course tell to madge so have dinner by a father have gone to club time of return be uncertain after dinner wrapped light cloak round repaired to verandah to wait for lover garden looked charming in moonlight with black dense cypress tree standing up against sky great fountain splashing cool silvery there be heavily foliaged oak by gate strolled down path stood under in shadow listening to whisper rustle of multitudinous leaf be curious unearthly glamour moonlight seems to throw over everything though madge knew flower tree shrub in garden yet looked weird fantastical in cold white light went up to fountain seating on edge amused by dipping hand into chilly water letting fall like silver rain back into basin then heard iron gate open shut with clash springing to foot saw someone coming up path in light coat soft wide awake hat oh be at last brian cried a ran down path to meet why did not come before not being brian ca say answered father voice madge burst out laughing what absurd mistake cried why thought be brian indeed yes in hat coat must tell difference in moonlight oh said father with laugh pushing hat back moonlight be necessary to complete spell suppose of course answered daughter if there be moonlight ala for lover ala indeed echoed father must become a extinct a moa where be eye pus when take old man like for gay young lochinvar well really papa answered madge deprecatingly do look so like in coat hat must not tell difference till spoke nonsense child said frettlby roughly be fanciful turning on heel walked rapidly towards house leaving madge staring after in astonishment a well might for father have never spoken to so roughly before wondering at cause of sudden anger stood spell bound until there came step behind soft low whistle turned with scream saw brian smiling at oh be said with pout a caught in arm kissed only said brian ungrammatically disappointing be oh fearfully answered girl with gay laugh a arm in arm walked towards house do know made curious mistake just now thought papa be how strange said brian absently for indeed be admiring charming face looked so pure sweet in moonlight yes be replied have on light coat soft hat just like wear sometimes a be same height took for one brian did not answer there be cold feeling at heart a saw possibility of worst suspicion being confirmed for just at moment there came into mind curious coincidence of man who got into hansom cab being dressed similarly to what if nonsense said aloud rousing out of train of thought resemblance have suggested be sure be said madge who have be talking about something else for last five minute be very rude young man beg pardon said brian waking up be saying that horse be most noble of animal exactly understand began brian rather puzzled of course interrupted madge petulantly considering have be wasting eloquence on deaf man for last ten minute very likely lame a well a deaf to prove truth of remark ran up path with brian after have long chase of for madge be nimble better acquainted with garden than be at last caught just a be running up step into house then history repeat went into drawing room found that mr frettlby have gone up to study did not want to be disturbed madge sat down to piano before struck note brian took hand prisoner madge said gravely a turned round what did father say when made that mistake be very angry answered quite cross be sure know why brian sighed a released hand be about to reply when visitor bell sounded heard servant answer then someone be taken upstairs to mr frettlby study when footman came in to light gas madge asked who be that have come to door know miss answered said wanted to see mr frettlby particularly so took up to study thought that papa said be not to be disturbed yes miss gentleman have appointment with poor papa sighed madge turning again to piano have always got lot to do left to madge began playing waldteufel last new valse dreamy haunting melody with touch of sadness in brian lying lazily on sofa listened then sang gay little french song about love butterfly with mocking refrain made brian laugh memory of offenbach said rising coming over to piano certainly ca approach french in writing airy trifle be unsatisfactory think said madge running finger over key mean nothing of course not replied remember that de quincy say there be moral either big little in iliad well think there be more music in barbara allan than frothy thing said madge with fine scorn come sing five act funeral be groaned brian a rose to obey let have garry owen instead nothing else however must suit capricious young person at piano so brian who have pleasant voice sang quaint old ditty of cruel barbara allan who treated dying love with such disdain sir john graham be as said brian when have finished instead of dying in such silly manner 'd have married right off without asking permission think be worth marrying replied madge opening book of mendelssohn duet must have made fuss over health not being drunk depend upon be plain woman remarked brian gravely be angry because be toasted among rest of country belle think young man have narrow escape 'd always have reminded about unfortunate oversight seem to have analysed nature pretty well said madge little dryly however will leave failing of barbara allan alone sing be mendelssohn charming duet must that love be great favourite of brian be in middle of when suddenly madge stopped a heard loud cry evidently proceeding from father study recollecting dr chinston warning ran out of room upstairs leaving brian rather puzzled by unceremonious departure for though have heard cry yet did not attach much importance to madge knocked at study door then tried to open be locked who be there asked father sharply from inside only papa answered thought be be right replied father quickly go down stair will join shortly madge went back to drawing room only half satisfied with explanation found brian waiting at door with rather anxious face what be matter asked a paused moment at foot of stair papa say nothing replied be sure must have be startled must not have cried out like told what dr chinston have said about state of father heart recital shocked brian greatly did not return to drawing room went out on verandah where after wrapping cloak around madge fitzgerald lit cigarette sat down at far end of verandah somewhat in shadow must see hall door wide open warm flood of mellow light pouring therefrom beyond cold white moonshine after about quarter of hour madge alarm about father having somewhat subsided be chatting on indifferent subject when man came out of hall door paused for moment on step of verandah be dressed in rather fashionable suit of clothes in spite of heat of night have thick white silk scarf round throat be rather cool individual said brian removing cigarette from between lip wonder what good god cried rising to foot a stranger turned round to look at house took off hat for moment roger moreland man started looked quickly round into dark shadow of verandah where be seated then putting on hat ran quickly down path heard gate clang after madge felt sudden fear at expression on brian face a revealed by ray of moonlight streaming full on who be roger moreland asked touching arm ah remember with sudden horror oliver whyte friend yes in hoarse whisper one of witness at trial chapter xxix mr calton curiosity be satisfied there be not much sleep for brian night left madge almost immediately went home did not go to bed felt too anxious ill at ease to sleep passed greater part of night walking up down room occupied with own sad thought be wondering in own mind what must be meaning of roger moreland visit to mark frettlby evidence that have given at trial be that have met whyte have be drinking with during evening whyte then went out be last moreland have seen of now question be what did go to see mark frettlby for have acquaintance with yet called by appointment be true might have be in poverty millionaire being well known a extremely generous man moreland might have called on for money then cry frettlby have given after interview have lasted short time proved that have be startled madge have gone upstairs found door locked father refusing admission now why be so anxious moreland must not be seen by one that have made startling revelation be certain fitzgerald felt sure that be in connection with hansom cab murder case wearied with conjecture about matter towards daybreak threw dressed a be on bed slept heavily till twelve o'clock next day when arose looked at in glass be startled at haggard worn appearance of face moment be awake mind went back to mark frettlby visit of roger moreland net be closing round murmured to see how can escape oh madge madge if only must spare bitterness of knowing what must know sooner later that other unhappy girl sin of father will be visited on child god help took bath after dressing went into sitting room where have cup of tea refreshed considerably mr sampson came crackling merrily upstairs with letter gave vent to exclamation of surprise on seeing altered appearance lor sir exclaimed what 'ave bin doin knowin ' 'abits know 'd a 'd gone to bed not to say a be very temptin ' in 'ot weather with excuse sir look a if 'ad slept blessed wink no more have said brian listlessly holding out hand for letter be walking up down room last night must have walked mile ah 'ow that put in mind of pore 'usband chirped

cash box bein ' filled with brick on 'be departure from 'ouse a brian did not appear particularly interested in domestic reminiscence seemed a if wanted to be left alone mr sampson with final crackle went down stair talked with neighbour in kitchen a to desirability of drawing money out of saving bank in case russian must surprise capture melbourne brian left alone stared out of window at dusty road black shadow cast by tall poplar in front of house must leave place said to chance remark seems to bear on murder be not anxious to have constantly by side like skeleton at feast suddenly recollected letter held in hand now looked at for first time proved to be from madge tearing open hastily read can not understand what be matter with papa wrote ever since man moreland left last night have shut up in study be writing there hour after hour went up morning must not let in did not come down to breakfast be getting seriously alarmed come down to morrow see for be anxious about state of health be sure that moreland told something have upset writing said brian a put letter in pocket what about wonder perhaps be thinking of committing suicide if so for one will not stop be horrible thing to do must be acting for best under circumstance in spite of determination to see calton tell fitzgerald did not go near day felt ill weary want of sleep mental worry telling on terribly looked ten year older than did before murder of whyte be trouble draw line on smooth forehead furrow round mouth if man have mental worry life becomes positive agony to mental torture be quite a bad a physical one if not worse last thing before dropping off to sleep be thought of trouble with first faint light of dawn return hammer day at weary brain while man can sleep life be rendered at least endurable of blessing providence have bestowed there be none so precious a same sleep a wise sancho panza say wrap man like cloak brian felt need of rest so sending telegram to calton to call on in morning to madge that must be down to luncheon next day stayed indoors day amused with smoking reading went to bed early succeeded in having sound sleep so when awoke next morning felt considerably refreshed invigorated be having breakfast at half past eight when heard sound of wheel immediately afterwards ring at bell went to window saw calton trap be at door owner be shortly afterwards shown into room well be nice fellow cried calton after greeting be over here have be waiting for with patience of job thinking be still up country will have breakfast asked brian laughing at indignation what have got said calton looking over table ham egg humph landlady culinary idea be very limited most landlady idea be retorted fitzgerald resuming breakfast unless heaven invents new animal lodger will go on getting beef mutton alternated with hash until end of world when one be in rome one mu speak ill of pope answered calton with grimace do think landlady must supply with brandy soda think so answered fitzgerald rising ringing bell be rather early for sort of thing there be proverb about glass house said calton severely applies to in particular instance whereupon fitzgerald laughed calton having be supplied with what required prepared to talk business need hardly tell how anxious be to hear what have got to say said leaning back in chair may a well tell that be satisfied that know secret already indeed fitzgerald looked astonished in case need not yes need retorted calton told only know half hum rather difficult to answer however will tell know can supply deficiency be quite ready go on stop arose closed door carefully well resuming seat mother guttersnipe died other night be dead a door nail answered calton calmly horrible death bed be scream ring in ear yet before died sent for said what that be mother of rosanna moore yes sal rawlins be rosanna child father said brian in low voice be mark frettlby ah now what have to tell nothing nothing echoed calton surprised then be what rosanna moore told when died yes then why have made mystery about ask said fitzgerald looking up in surprise if have told see what difference must have made to madge be sure retorted barrister completely mystified suppose mean be connection with rosanna moore well of course be not very creditable thing for to have be frettlby mistress still mistress said fitzgerald looking up sharply then know what do mean be not mistress wife calton sprang to foot gave cry of surprise wife fitzgerald nodded why mother guttersnipe did not know thought rosanna be mistress kept marriage secret answered brian a wife ran away with someone else shortly afterwards never revealed understand now said barrister slowly for if mark frettlby be lawfully married to rosanna moore madge be illegitimate yes now occupies place sal rawlins rather sal frettlby ought to poor girl said calton little sadly doe not explain mystery of whyte murder will tell said fitzgerald quickly when rosanna left husband ran away to england with young fellow when got tired of returned to stage became famous a burlesque actress under name of musette there met whyte a friend found out came out here for purpose of extorting money from frettlby when arrived in melbourne rosanna let whyte do business kept quiet gave marriage certificate to whyte have on night be murdered then gorby be right interposed calton eagerly man to whom paper be valuable did murder whyte can doubt that man be not mark frettlby burst out calton surely not mark frettlby brian nodded yes mark frettlby there be silence for few moment calton being too much startled by revelation to say anything when did discover asked after pause at time first came to see in prison said brian have suspicion till then when said that whyte be murdered for sake of certain paper knowing full well what be to whom be of value guessed immediately that mark frettlby have killed whyte in order to obtain to keep secret there can be doubt of said barrister with sigh so be reason frettlby wanted madge to marry whyte hand be to be price of silence when withdrew consent whyte threatened with exposure remember left house in very excited state on night be murdered frettlby must have followed up to town got into cab with after killing with chloroform must have taken marriage certificate from secret pocket escaped brian rose to foot walked rapidly up down room now can understand what hell life have be for last few month said knowing that have committed crime yet have to sit with eat with drink with with knowledge that be murderer madge madge daughter just then knock came to door mr sampson entered with telegram handed to brian tore open a withdrew glancing over gave cry of horror let flutter to foot calton turned rapidly on hearing

accepted with philosophical resignation begotten by very severity of previous trial fitzgerald be in state of mind be calm be calmness of despair misfortune of past year seemed to have come to climax looked forward to publication of whole bitter story with indifference surprised own name that of madge dead father must be on tongue yet felt perfectly callous to whatever might be said on subject so long a madge recovered must go away to part of world leaving australia with bitter memory behind did not care moreland must suffer bitter penalty of crime then nothing more must ever be heard of matter must be better for whole story to be told transitory pain endured than to go on striving to hide infamy shame might be discovered at moment already news be over melbourne that murderer of oliver whyte have be captured that confession must bring to light certain startling fact concerning late mark frettlby brian well knew that world winked at secret vice so long a there be attempt at concealment though be cruelly severe on be brought to light that many whose life might be secretly far more culpable than poor mark frettlby must be first to slander dead man public curiosity however be destined never to be gratified for next day be known that roger moreland have hanged in cell during night have left confession behind when brian heard breathed heartfelt prayer of thanks for deliverance went to see calton whom found at chamber in deep conversation with chinston kilsip came to conclusion that a moreland be now dead nothing must be gained by publishing confession of mark frettlby so agreed to burn when fitzgerald saw in heap of blackened paper in fireplace remained of bitter story felt weight lifted off heart barrister chinston kilsip promised to keep silent kept promise nobly for nothing be ever known of circumstance led to death of oliver whyte be generally supposed that must have be caused by quarrel between dead man friend roger moreland fitzgerald however did not forget good service kilsip have done gave sum of money made independent for life though still followed old profession of detective from sheer love of excitement be always looked upon with admiration a man who have solved mystery of famous hansom cab murder brian after several consultation with calton at last came to conclusion that must be useless to reveal to sal rawlins fact that be mark frettlby daughter a by will money be clearly left to madge revelation must bring pecuniary benefit while bringing up unfitted her for position so yearly income more than sufficient for want be settled upon be allowed to remain in ignorance of parentage influence of sal rawlins old life however be very strong on devoted to task of saving fallen sister knowing a did intricacy of slum be enabled to do immense amount of good many unhappy woman be saved from squalor hardship of gutter life by kind hand of sal rawlins felix rolleston became member of parliament where speech if not very deep be at least amusing while in house always behaved like gentleman must not be said of parliamentary colleague madge slowly recovered from illness a have be explicitly named in will a heiress to mark frettlby great wealth placed management of estate in hand of mr calton who with thinton tarbit acted a agent in australia on recovery learned story of father early marriage calton fitzgerald be silent about fact of sal rawlins being half sister a such relation must do good must only create scandal a explanation must be given except true one shortly afterwards madge married fitzgerald of only too gladly left australia with sorrow bitter memory standing with husband on deck of one of p o steamer a ploughed blue water of hobson bay into foam watched melbourne gradually fade from view under glow of sunset must see two great dome of exhibition law court also government house with tall tower rising from midst of green tree in background be bright crimson sky barred with mass of black cloud over great city hung cloud of smoke like pall flaring red light of sinking sun glared angrily on heavy water steamer seemed to be making way through sea of blood madge clinging to husband arm felt eye fill with tear a saw land of birth receding slowly good bye murmured softly good bye for ever regret said bending head regret answered looking at with loving eye with by side fear nothing surely heart have be tried in furnace of affliction love have be chastened purified be sure of nothing in world replied brian with sigh after sorrow grief of past let hope that future will be peace peace white winged sea gull rose suddenly from crimson water circled rapidly in air above happy omen said looking up fondly to grave face of husband for life for mine bent down kissed great steamer moved slowly out to sea a stood on deck hand clasped in hand with fresh salt breeze blowing keenly in face bore away into placid beauty of coming night towards old world new life
