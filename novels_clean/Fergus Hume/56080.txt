be of mother identity that husband of youth father of dearly loved child must expel from hardly won paradise a soon a discovered therein being case did not waste time in asking for mercy not likely to be granted set to work to find out mean of retaining position in defiance of husband enmity hatred after conversation with mr valpy saw that rupert pethram have glossed over affair of divorce in order to avoid suspicion of scandal against mother of child for be unwilling that child must suffer for sin of parent be certainly point in favour a by threatening to denounce whole affair if be not allowed to retain position must force to acquiesce in demand in order to avoid scandal then if though keeping terrible affair secret from outside world told kaituna about mother disgrace thus destroying love

for can judge foeman skill though in armour be dight lance may find place to kill interview have taken place between mr belswin italian lover have be productive of curious change in demeanour of latter from being master became slave from commanding changed to obeying taking advantage of astonishing transformation mr belswin ordered quondam master about like dog saw that by single flash of fierce eye at critical moment have inculcated superstitious italian with idea that be possessed of evil eye have by so doing taken manhood out of son of south who be decidedly brave in presence of physical danger be so completely slave of superstition that firmly believed mr belswin eye exercised malignant influence upon against be powerless to struggle notwithstanding terrible feeling be too much in love with to think of removing from dread fascination of presence therefore accepted new position with superstitious resignation once twice indeed attempted to exert former authority ominous gleam in mr belswin eye significant sneer on lip soon reduced to obedience cowered at foot of sometime slave in abject terror be not physical fear be not want of manliness be simply effect of supernatural terror acting upon nature singularly prone by birth training to yield to such weird superstition having thus reduced ferrari to state of bondage mr belswin thought that there must be difficulty in making put husband out of way in stealthy manner here however be entirely wrong a ferrari being afraid of english law absolutely refused to lend to committal of crime even at command of evil genius in vain with artistic craft of woman prayed implored cursed ordered ferrari must not be moved from position have taken up in holding aloof from power of law afraid of in other way did exactly a asked in special case fear of visible power of justice be greater than fear of supernatural visitation from glance of evil eye after fortnight battling mr belswin be obliged to confess beaten by steady refusal of slave to obey in what desired most of thing to be done by mean of belk have kept thoroughly well acquainted with have taken place at thornstream during absence bailiff employed mother who be always haunting great house to find out what be going on so information gave son in turn retailed by letter to mr belswin in london from source therefore latter learned about

saw plainly that must hing criminal against so determined to have interview with throw on mercy if granted must be well if however spurned well mr belswin knitted brow clenched hand drew long breath be despairing reckless woman must stop at nothing to gain end so seemed a though sir rupert be in very dangerous position baronet be coward must certainly have felt thrill of fear have known meditated attack by terribly savage wife one effect of ferrari newly born dread of mr belswin supernatural power be that followed like dog seemed afraid to let out of sight formerly having full belief in power to draw back to have not minded being away for certain period now that deemed dominating power be gone be afraid lest must leave altogether kept close watch upon action be with day at night when forced to attend to business insisted that must come to theatre stay in private box where must see during performance mr belswin did not wish to abuse newly gained power over so acquiesced in somewhat unreasonable demand when made preparation to return to thornstream insisted upon accompanying there what about business objected mr belswin will be right cara mia replied rapidly see will go down on sunday sing night will return on monday with will not return on monday signora will think so on sunday night will behold il marito will order away what be left to come back with faithful stephano what say be very true said mr belswin coolly thing may turn out so can stay eh have plan donna lucrezia leave everything to chance dio what faith muttered ferrari lifting hand conversation ended with mr belswin agreeing that ferrari must accompany to thornstream on sunday afternoon with profound belief in unseen be strong characteristic of half civilised nature mr belswin seeing that must hing left everything to chance expected blind faith to be rewarded by miraculous intervention must change husband heart towards have ground for such belief hoping against hope kept repeating to herself that must yet be well that thing must end happily nevertheless in spite of striving to look upon bright side of thing received something of shock when on arriving at deswarth railway station saw archie maxwell advancing towards with most lugubrious expression of countenance wishing to speak with sent ferrari off to look after portmanteau drew disconsolate lover into bare waiting room where must converse freely well asked mr belswin sharply looking at downcast face of young man be true about sir rupert yes of course what else must speak of be true quite true worse luck have refused to sanction engagement yes received letter from in accuses of acting shamefully in winning daughter heart oh cried archie clenching hand if be not father never saw such letter cruel wicked letter if be not father must make apologise for insolence oh said mr belswin cruelly so being father be going to sit quietly down under insult what can do do oh if only be man do why marry kaituna in spite of why see kaituna urge to marry at once have done so refuse to disobey father good heaven thought mr belswin savagely girl be daughter of mine to allow thus to be robbed of man professes to love kept sentiment to herself however only said abruptly what be doing here be going up to town on business indeed so capitulate without struggle replied maxwell flushing at cold contempt expressed in tone be going to see employer about buenos ayres business put off till end of year if can manage will start for south america next month alone not if can help on return will try persuade kaituna to accompany disobey father there be help for replied archie with groan love one very dearly see why life must be spoilt at caprice of selfish old man what doe friend mr clendon say be entirely on side mr valpy same think sir rupert be old brute so be muttered mr belswin angrily well mr maxwell said aloud also be on side be shame that life must be spoilt for caprice remember one thing sir rupert will cut daughter off with shilling let kaituna can face poverty together poor innocent said mr belswin with jeering laugh know what poverty be need speak so unkindly replied archie rather hurt at tone thought wished to marry kaituna so do want to starve will not starve can always make good income dear sir said mr belswin candidly income may be enough for one certainly be not enough for two particularly when other be girl brought up a kaituna have be if marry kaituna without father consent drag down to poverty oh yes do be good glossing over matter better look at hard simple fact mr maxwell will find best in long run love kaituna love look forward to love in cottage kind of thing doe not exist out of novel reality however be not so pleasant then what be to do give up kaituna certainly not kahuna happiness be a dear to a be to if left must pine away be sure must not be happy mr belswin cried young man in desperation know what mean blow hot cold be for against say marry kaituna then add be selfish thing to drag to poverty understand meaning oh density of lover said mr belswin with angry flash of fierce eye be like men dear mr maxwell never see inch beyond nose doe never strike that be also fond of kaituna must do anything to insure happiness yes even oh look so disbelieving friend may have more power than think with sir rupert know sir rupert replied mr belswin grimly be know well here be train mr maxwell so will say good bye what be going to do said archie a went out on to platform know yet will get sir rupert to consent to marriage perhaps maxwell jumped into first class carriage with sigh of despair put head out of window for moment a train started mr belswin yes know meaning seem to have power so will leave future happiness of kaituna in hand will trust entirely very well will see trust have not be misplaced mr belswin however be promising more than must perform stood frowning deeply a train went off from reverie be aroused by touch on shoulder on turning saw

commence to weep such strained silence augur ill before storm living at thornstream be hardly very pleasant after interview between sir rupert daughter everything went on just same very calmness be foreboding sign of coming tempest baronet be deeply angered at what considered kaituna feminine duplicity hiding such feeling under mask of ultra politeness treated with cold courtesy be far more irritating to proud spirit of girl than outburst of wrath must have be inheriting however inconsiderable portion of paternal pride on part treated father with distant politeness so two proud spirit found entirely separated one from other by insurmountable barrier of disdainful silence have contributed to build lived under same roof took meal at same table interchanged usual remark concerning daily event to outward appearance be same to one a have ever be be far from being case for confidence of father in daughter of daughter in father have entirely disappeared regarded one with mutual distrust be certainly very unhappy state of thing be entirely due to peculiar view held by sir rupert regarding bearing towards womankind have interviewed maxwell personally judged for a to fitness to become husband of daughter have spoken of matter to kaituna in kindly manner have made allowance for mutual love of young people who have set aside conventional observation thing might have be better by ordering daughter to give up lover a have formerly ordered high spirited wife to give up friend committed fatal mistake a have reaped consequence of such high handed proceeding before by losing wife seemed a though history must repeat must lose daughter have shown kaituna folly of hasty love match have entreated for own sake to be cautious have requested to consider determination to order ah be mistake made curiously enough never saw in thing demanded absolute unquestioning obedience from household so never for moment struck that girl must dare to defy authority yet be so for in place of making obedient sir rupert blundering conduct have made crafty made up mind that must never give up lover tommy valpy stood friend kaituna met archie at house where parted with many promise of remaining true to one then kaituna returned to thornstream resumed mask of politeness while sir rupert thinking have obeyed given up undesirable lover be to certain extent content although still suspicious of apparent acquiescence in wish thing be in state when mr belswin arrived on leaving railway station after interview with maxwell have met belk did not stop to speak to being afraid of ferrari jealousy in be quite right for belk seeing driving past with stranger scowled savagely a took off hat while ferrari noting good look of young man seeing scowl directed to guessed directly that

discover in meantime how land lay went up to own room sent for kaituna who be delighted to see now be here said girl kissing friend may perhaps induce papa to let marry archie know know about dear replied mr belswin with maternal air mr maxwell met at railway station put in full possession of fact do think papa will let marry asked kaituna timidly really can not tell dear until see papa at

faced to east great shaft of sunlight breaking through misty morning cloud pointed downward like finger of god on to terrace to open window of sir rupert study there in splendour of sunrise lay dead man face downward lay with half of body in room other half on terrace hand stretched out in form of cross clenched in agony of death last night morning nay few hour back be living breathing man full of passion sin hatred of humanity now empty shell soulless husk be remained of sir rupert pethram then servant began to move about house attending to morning duty one be housemaid entered study to put in order there saw dead man with terrible cry fell senseless to ground cry brought in fellow servant there be expression of incredulous wonder exclamation of horror then general hubbub of voice in few minute household knew terrible truth that sir rupert have be found dead in study shot through head dombrain came to scene of tragedy with horror on face followed by kaituna mr belswin for god sake let

nerve said under breath what nerve police came took possession of house brought down detective from london questioned one held inquest discovered nothing well be difficult case police be not infallible therefore failed to discover murderer of sir rupert pethram if have be low london murder case for instance of whitechapel poker sort then indeed criminal must not have escaped human justice in affair be impossible to move in direction justice promised to do what must did nothing that bandage over eye be often in way in instance blinded altogether so whomsoever have killed sir rupert pethram be quite safe a far a stupid blind blundering justice be concerned of course police have theory explained everything accomplished nothing daily paper argued one way police argued public gave view of matter after great cry there be little wool sir rupert according to intelligent jury came by death at hand of person unknown verdict be vague might mean anything then be placed in family vault title estate went to distant cousin kaituna left thornstream penniless orphan new order of thing began new heir be man of business who be hard prided on being hard have large family thinking thornstream rent be quite small enough to rear dozen child male female in equal proportion declined to do anything for kaituna whom scarcely knew mr belswin thereupon stepped forward took kaituna off to london with to see mr dombrain ascertain if possible what private property sir rupert have died possessed of mr dombrain be quite happy to oblige mr belswin in way did what must be comparatively

belswin considers way mean fortune jade when require ever beside be staying fortune jade for when desire never responds to praying mr belswin be not rich woman when left husband took money naturally supposing that silas p oates who played part of co respondent in divorce case must take care of romance however came to end for lady temper being uncertain gentleman income being equally so thing went anything smoothly so parted where quondam lover went mr belswin knew cared for part earned enough to keep comfortable by becoming opera singer be handsome woman with fine voice great dramatic power so a time went on took first class position on board therefore earned great deal of money unfortunately being open handed careless in money matter spent income a earned when arrived in england in search of daughter found very badly off of course owing to peculiar position held at thornstream have received no salary a sir rupert be only one who must pay when saw naturally money question gave way to much more important matter after pethram death mr belswin have taken possession of kaituna with intention of marrying to maxwell now found in london with daughter to provide for very little money in bank ferrari certainly must have be delighted to have shared salary with mr belswin have always kept italian at distance be determined not to give hold over by being in debt since leaving oates have lived decent life earning own money asking favour from one so that although have led somewhat bohemian existence yet for sake of child have kept pure reckless vehement careless a be of outward appearance one must cast stone at in moral sense ferrari knowing well respected for have often pressed to take money from to be repaid by marrying mr belswin not being prepared to discharge debt in way have always refused even now when daughter looked to for support few pound stood between absolute want never thought of asking ferrari for money have suspecting need offered must certainly have declined to take advantage of generosity therefore to appeal to ferrari be out of question what about maxwell mr belswin have daughter happiness too much at heart to jeopardise girl future by appeal to purse of future husband besides maxwell be not rich for have heard lament to toby clendon over lack of money made unacceptable son in law to sir rupert clearly therefore must not ask archie of course there be dombrain doubt if asked must give money suppose refused to assist ah well then must force at point of meditation mr belswin stopped must force be questionable did not like way looked at over dead body of husband certainly knew secret must damage position in london prized so highly then worm will turn if appearance be against a certainly be about death of sir rupert must make thing very disagreeable for formerly must not have minded must have dared in old reckless fashion trusting to indomitable will to carry through safely now have kaituna to think of a well a so determined to leave mr dombrain alone ferrari maxwell dombrain must ask none of three to assist yet something must be done terrible blow of father death have left kaituna prostrate with grief looked to mr belswin for thing yes daughter ignorant of mother personality depended upon mother a must have done have known truth mr belswin although concealing real relationship acted towards newly recovered daughter with utmost tenderness still what about money there be stage must resume profession must entail time to obtain engagement constant absence from kaituna who be not fitted in present upset state of mind to be left alone so after going over kind of possibility in mind mr belswin found at wit end way to turn for assistance coincidence happen in real life a well a in novel be curious thing mr belswin must find in society journal name of silas p oates mentioned a staying at langham hotel silas p oates millionaire most extraordinary have arrived just in time for must apply to for money be old lover be man who have ruined life have deserted shamefully now be rich have right to help yes must call on at once ask for assistance for sake of dead gone day must not refuse so with smile of satisfaction mr belswin looked at paper again mr silas p oates be accompanied by wife daughter oh be married then married respectable while be still tossing on stormy water of bohemian ocean ah men men always have best of love ruin forsake woman then settle down into respectable member of society while woman who have lost for sake be condemned for rest of life to be sport of one sex scorn of other still now that be married must certainly be able to obtain what wished for must not dare to refuse lest must speak to wife destroy happiness never struck mr belswin to act in way must be dishonourable have be

clearly seen by silas now mr oates in addition to many other gift for getting better of fellow creature possessed remarkably retentive memory in matter of face in spite of alteration mr dombrain have made in appearance recognised at once time nerve did not belie reputation gave after slight start leaned back in chair with slight dry smile opinionate remarked silas reflectively that have be on

mr belswin received letter from mr dombrain asking to call be considerably astonished a have thought last interview with must have pretty well resigned to loss of society evidently be now throwing

not imagine unless be to make offer for pole star share a have already set mind at rest on point seemed ridiculous to think that must waste time in trying to encompass impossible be now quite at ease in own mind regarding money matter a hundred pound have obtained from silas together with what already have in bank must enable kaituna to live in comfort for next three four month in economical way of course quite expected to be in possession of other four hundred next week must place in affluence until report of toby came home about pole star share judging from offer made by dombrain mr belswin with feminine acuteness guessed that share be more valuable than now appeared to be so that sale in few month must realise decent sum for kaituna if turned out to be case mr belswin intended to persuade kaituna to marry archie at once future of child being thus secured cared little for must certainly marry a ferrari belk be devoted to despised first for cowardice in matter of removing

how deeply in love be with mr belswin must not feel thrill of pride at thought of own attraction even at mature age of forty five at present however have more important thing to think of than marriage drove along to dombrain office in puzzled state of mind trying to think of reason why wanted to see so that must be prepared to hold own that silas have stolen march on never for moment dreamed have guessed real object of interview sought by mr dombrain must doubtless have felt somewhat ill at ease a be however knew nothing thus ignorance being bliss walked boldly into dingy office took accustomed seat with usual defiant air dombrain be rather nervous although now assumed bullying manner towards woman be afraid of have held power over have hitherto precluded from talking to a must have wished now have discovered something about life gave advantage determined to use power to insult sneer crush in fact treat in same way a have hitherto treated in spite of violent temper foolish impulse mr belswin be not without certain amount of feminine cunning a be quite in dark concerning object of interview moreover did not like ill concealed look of triumph on part of solicitor held tongue waiting for to begin attack so that chance word might afford opportunity of fathoming motif well mr belswin said dombrain with nasty grin on coarse looking face how be to day after conduct in last interview mr belswin looked up down in sneeringly insolent manner made writhe think ought to ask question said disdainfully considering that left crushed like little reptile be oh none of

look after mr belswin sat down again spoke deliberately know what object be in talking like will take a favour if will let know precisely how connect with late husband death say killed hint can prove be lie because if be case must be in prison now mr damberton be not man to spare woman certainly not who have made life hell for last few month can exchange compliment afterwards first story dombrain who be growing weary of fencing lost time in responding to request began at once a know be staying at thornstream on night arrived ostensibly have come down to see sir rupert on business real motive be to see how intended to meet did not appear at dinner thought must put off interview until next day be tired with day work be about to retire to rest when saw descending stair upon hid lest must see coward ejaculated mr belswin disdainfully be coward have be foolish enough to have spoken to in one of paroxysm of anger might have revealed true position to sir rupert out of spite mr belswin thought how have really done how ignorant man before be of narrow escape from exposure exposure only prevented by death of pethram therefore resumed dombrain coldly hid watched door of study entered there door be closed long time passed servant put out light shut up house retired to rest miss pethram have learned since retired early on account of headache a whole thornstream household kept country hour by time clock struck hall clock be speaking of house be asleep except sir rupert half hour sounded still have not left study three quarter struck door be still closed waited waited wondered eleven sounded from clock in hall at few minute past door opened appeared pale ghastly like guilty spectre closing door softly after with furtive look round lest one must be watching fled upstairs brushed past went into bedroom be wanted to see knew have met husband that have not turned out of house so never dreaming that have committed crime to screen real self went to bed next morning flung open arm with dramatic gesture quite in keeping with stagey way in have told story became silent with small eye viciously fastened on unfortunate woman before be sitting like image of stone pale still with tightly compressed lip lurid fire burning in fierce eye only nervous working of hand lying in lap betrayed deep agitation when have finished looked at with smile of disdain saw wonderful thing like cat in dark said scoffingly know perfectly well that hall lamp be still lighted for sir rupert have told servant not to wait up a must work late must put out saw perfectly well have described know so think killed husband be sure of according to evidence at inquest time of death be between ten eleven can prove that left room at eleven o'clock so must have left dead husband behind if saw why did not tell at inquest because wished to spare lie to like be bitter enemy why did spare will tell whether killed sir rupert not be nothing to personally reputation a lawyer be great deal to have denounced result must have be must have told about must have be struck off roll ah thought have motive for sparing well what do intend to do now tell unless promise to leave oates alone if do position will still be lost know know cried dombrain in despair what can do if stop going to oates know will tell if do stop then in revenge will tell see be between two fire said mr belswin calmly well set mind at rest will trouble silas oates more will not all wanted out of be money a to that will take place be banker yes pshaw man need look so scared know well enough that money will be returned to when share be sold be worth nothing so thought until wanted to buy said mr belswin with sneer forget hold life in hand cried dombrain threateningly well hold position in mine retorted mr belswin life be great deal to position be everything to be willing to leave silas oates alone if give money when require if not can denounce when like then will be hanged said dombrain spitefully bah can prove story to be lie how so will tell now good heaven did think that if be guilty 'd think life safe in keeping neck against position bah thing be ridiculous can clear ruin at same time want scandal daughter to know who be a inevitably must have to publicly defend of charge of murder so see that on side have a much desire a to keep matter quiet now then will leave silas oates alone will not go near if want money must supply will do so to reasonable amount replied dombrain hastily say be innocent be after what have seen believe if did not kill who else have motive how do know be not in secret of sir rupert life can tell to so afraid of losing pettifogging position what dare not tell one else saw sir rupert dead body on night did not kill then know who did let hear story said dombrain with disbelieving smile when entered study began mr belswin without further preamble saw husband recognised at once have stirring interview turned out of house left by french window where be found lying dead in order to get shelter for night went to 'the chequer in deswarth be not telling story mind only what suit in dock must tell everything well to resume waited at 'the chequer for time then determined to return to thornstream to say good bye to daughter a knew sir rupert must prevent seeing next day arrived on terrace just when hour of eleven sounded there be still light in sir rupert study stealing along in dark saw dead body lying half in half out of window full sense of danger of position flashed on saw that if be arrested be lost dare not try to enter house by door a be locked if servant admitted must have to account for being out at hour of night must lead to being accused of murder only way to regain own room in safety be across dead body of husband so entered by french window left by study door regained bedroom without one having seen except did not kill swear did not be afraid that story must not go down in court of law told have kept of story to myself to use favourite illustration still hold trump card there be silence for few moment during mr belswin considerably agitated used smelling bottle freely then dombrain spoke well there be nothing more to be said think not said mr belswin rising know condition know mine think retorted dombrain with malignant grin cast upon glance of supreme contempt went to door will see again when want money said vanished humph said mr dombrain thoughtfully if can find out part of story wo tell may be able to stop seeing altogether chapter xxvii case out of night into light come doer of evil deed out of light into night with sin on soul speed hemp be sown tree be grown will hang high a murderer known hath planted seed to be amateur detective requires certain amount of capital there be people who know to be discovered search after can not be successfully conducted without money when people who know be brought under eye of inquirer frequently decline to speak unless well paid for information money therefore be essential to success of solving mystery when archie maxwell sat down calmly to consider aspect of affair found at once face to face with question of fund be young have talent have profession so with endowment looked forward to making fortune be ambition of well constituted youth in age of gold unfortunately like magical draught of mephistopheles time be required to make money a moment be of importance in finding out mystery of sir rupert death archie must not waste four five year in getting together sufficient to prosecute inquiry be true that be engaged to go out to buenos ayres at end of year firm who employed be hard to deal with refused to let draw in advance of salary toby be not well off so must not apply to for aid besides that young man be already on way to antipode so mr maxwell found with comparatively little money in bank difficult case to solve without fund luckily archie be of very sanguine nature hopeful in micawberish sense of something turning up so making up mind to at event make start in affair collected newspaper report of inquest made thoroughly acquainted with in out of baronet death appeared from evidence of butler on night of murder sir rupert have informed that must be sitting up late in study looking over paper that household must go to bed at usual time sir rupert appeared cheerful somewhat preoccupied went into study shortly after dinner butler according to instruction locked up house leaving hall lamp burning for sir rupert to put out then with rest of servant retired to rest heard pistol shot sound of one being in house knew nothing about terrible event have taken place until next morning housemaid stated that have entered study according to usual custom to put to right have there found body of master lying half in half out of french window be open shriek of terror brought fellow servant to spot police be sent for knew nothing more miss pethram deposed that father have said good night to shortly after dinner have retired to study to attend to business remained in drawing room for time with mr dombrain father solicitor who be then staying in house retired to bed about nine o'clock a have bad headache have heard pistol shot during night there be nothing in father demeanour led to think contemplated suicide mr dombrain dead man solicitor said that have come down to thornstream in order to witness signing of sir rupert will signing took place in afternoon at night baronet went to study to look over paper witness offered to accompany sir rupert refused a said be not necessary miss pethram retired to bed about nine o'clock a be left alone also retired hour afterwards sir rupert never gave least idea that contemplated suicide in fact on night of murder seemed very cheerful witness be very heavy sleeper certainly have heard pistol shot during night be only next morning that learned about crime mr belswin chaperon to miss pethram gave evidence be rather important a be last person who saw sir rupert alive have be engaged when sir rupert be in new zealand on arrival have gone up to london on business only returned on day when crime be committed went to see sir rupert in study between eight nine o'clock only have short interview with a have nothing particular to talk about have gone up to room shortly after nine o'clock knowing that miss pethram have retired with bad headache did not disturb went straight to bed of servant might have noticed going upstairs to room did not know sir rupert be complete stranger to seemed well cheerful certainly idea of suicide never crossed mind for moment heard sound of struggle pistol shot knew nothing of committal of crime until next morning doctor evidence be to effect that deceased have be shot somewhere between ten eleven o'clock at night bullet penetrating right eye have entered brain causing death almost instantaneously from slanting upward direction of bullet from eye towards back part of head must think pistol gun have be fired from low position according to idea murderer have be crouching behind shrub on terrace sir rupert came to window a study be lighted form must be clearly defined against brilliant background be opportunity chosen by assassin who have fired from crouching position occupied so that bullet have travelled upwards penetrated into brain through right eye during evidence of witness bullet be produced to court afterwards coroner summed up going on evidence produced jury brought in verdict of murder against person person unknown in addition to bold report of case there be short leader theorised great deal ultimately came to conclusion that nothing must be done to unravel mystery a usual complimented police on vigilance compliment wholly undeserved a from appearance case have be conducted in singularly slip slop fashion utterly unworthy of english justice being engineer maxwell be consequently mathematician therefore having be trained in exact science have singularly logical mind two two according to way of looking at thing made four in instance be doubtful a to whether did so everything in connection with case be wrapped in mystery there seemed to be one on whom suspicion must rest people present in house on night in question have given satisfactory account of movement except perhaps mr belswin only possible suspicion against be that have be last in company of dead man be very well committal of crime pre supposes motive a mr belswin according to own account be complete stranger to sir rupert must certainly be very foolish to even hint thing against have seen baronet spoken to for few minute then retired to bed nothing must be simpler have hand in murder be certainly not mr belswin so archie dismissed fancy a foolish one curious part about whole affair be that one have heard report a sir rupert have be shot sound of weapon employed must certainly have be heard yet present in house averred that heard nothing be to say least very peculiar judging from evidence of doctor sir rupert be shot from terrace argued that assassin must have be stranger to house with idea in head maxwell wondered whether suspicious stranger have be about neighbourhood at time made up mind to inquire sir rupert from account be not loveable character in fact conduct towards maxwell have be anything courteous so that be just kind of man to have enemy being case what be more probable than man woman whom have wronged have followed to thornstream revenged by killing be rather wild idea still seemed only feasible one so maxwell made up mind to go down to deswarth ask hospitality of vicarage for few day make inquiry regarding what stranger have be to village on fatal day be conclusion came to then assertion of one that have heard shot be puzzling more maxwell thought more puzzled became suddenly idea struck jumped to foot have cried be air gun chapter xxviii what mr belk found nothing appears be concealed chance interferes be revealed be great idea one have never entered brain of detective employed in case so maxwell looked upon a earnest of success told one about not even mr belswin kaituna informing that be called out of town for few day on business made preparation for going to deswarth finding out particular regarding case have not come to light at inquest then chance interfered on morning of departure be having breakfast at room intending to catch eleven train to deswarth when departure be postponed indefinitely by appearance of visitor visitor be mr belk sent up name to archie who told servant to admit wondering on what errand have come never for moment thinking that must have anything to do with deswarth tragedy mr belk entered neatly dressed in widow garb with mean evil face looking smug placid under white frill of widow cap on seeing archie curtsied in old fashioned way with natural deference of lower order waited for to speak first wish to see said looking at in surprise for such odd figure have never before entered chamber mr belk with curtsey signified that did wish to see have come to london for purpose reply having be made shut mouth with snap waited still giving hint of errand will not be seated mr mr belk sir said woman seeing that archie be at loss perhaps sir may know son samson belk oh yes good looking bailiff replied maxwell carelessly be son be sir answered mr belk heart swelling with pride at hearing eulogy on son good look be bailiff to sir rupert now be bailiff to new baronet sir thomas pethram indeed be very glad prospect be so good said archie politely wondering what domestic history have to do with prospect ai good sir be why have come up to see good woman what can do cried young man in amazement mr belk wriggled in chair sniffed significantly went on talking apparently in manner most irrelevant to subject in hand sir thomas said with snappy deliberation be hard man sir rupert be hard there be denying boy who be proud did get on with being crushed if sir rupert have died must have left service a did die sir thomas asked to stay on knowing in out of place did so thinking sir thomas must be better master be disappointed mr belk nodded head emphatically ca make silk purse out of sow ear said sententiously be what sir thomas be hard gentleman sir who think boy be slave so be going to leave service mr belk observed archie rather puzzled what on earth have got to do with be coming to sir replied woman imperturbably boy wondered what 'd do when left sir thomas for situation mr maxwell be hard to get especially for poor folk like maxwell nodded assent waited until came to reason of visit in paper pursued mr belk with faint smile of triumph on pale face boy saw that strong men be being exhibited in london gentry be mad on yes believe be case strong man craze be in music hall son sir be called samson be a strong a horse yes know said archie with cordial admiration of physical strength one englishman feel for be tremendously strong have seen do wonderful thing well son proposes to come up to london exhibit strength yes sir said mr belk with look of triumph doe sir be idea have doubt be good one while craze last may make money after will take care of money sir answered mr belk grimly will make hay while sun shine will take care when sun doe shine that will have something to live on do want to help in then in sort of way sir not for nothing maxwell smiled really know what can do for wait sir will tell to git start in london requires money son want fifty pound to give start indeed be afraid ca advance money so say now sir when know what fifty pound 'ull buy perhaps will archie curiosity be now fully aroused owing to significance of word there be evidently something important behind apparently idle preamble waited with anxiety a to what be going to tell be engaged to miss pethram sir be told said mr belk abruptly yes be what then replied maxwell rather haughtily not liking private affair being mentioned by complete stranger mr belk bent forward in mysterious manner touched on knee then flung back in chair with searching look have found out who killed father good god maxwell jumped to foot with ejaculation one hand grasping back of chair stood looking at mean figure before in silent amazement what do mean demanded in stifled voice woman carried obtrusive black leather bag of small size with metal clasp shook slowly at a replied to question in here said in monotonous voice voice that rose fell kept on droning constantly in same dreary monotone in here have something may lead to discovery of criminal maxwell gasped be chance going to reveal secret have be so afraid be secret for ever have be about to go down to deswarth on apparently hopeless quest without anything to guide to conclusion lo at very time when be starting woman appeared from cloud with asseveration that knew something must be sure guide to revealing of mystery in bag said mechanically looking at in fascinated fashion in bag with cry of relief advanced stretched out hand eagerly give to what be give to woman put bag behind back with frown answered in same passionless voice nothing for nothing have told what wanted give fifty pound will have what be clue to man who committed murder give to at once certainly when get fifty pound maxwell reflected be not rich man fifty pound be great consideration to still in search must probably spend amount by giving to woman must perhaps learn name of criminal at once so must be better to save time by acceding to demand thus arrest assassin before have time to leave country therefore made up mind to give to secure evidence said be in bag first tried to find out exactly what that evidence be worth do know who committed murder found something think belongs to may lead to detection will have for fifty pound why do come to be engaged to miss pethram be to interest to find out who killed father besides will pay money if went to sir thomas to sir rupert solicitor must probably refuse to give penny want money for son if give cheque for fifty pound will give be have in bag will like cheque 'd rather have money in gold mistrust like cheque reiterated mr belk doggedly maxwell reflected few moment then made up mind what to do rang bell when servant who attended to chamber in building entered handed cheque for fifty pound made payable to bearer drawn on piccadilly bank branch of be not far distant take hansom cash at once gold will be long about ten minute sir servant departed maxwell turned to mr belk who observed ail doings with satisfied smile see be treating fairly said quietly when messenger return will place fifty pound in hand very well sir in return will give what be in here like distrust cried maxwell angrily be country woman sir know nothing of london way be evidently obdurate there be silence for few minute then archie made attempt to extract information from where did find whatever be will tell sir when have in hand do know to whom belongs sir seems to that be paying heavy price for what be of comparatively little value may be able to tell something in addition to giving to likely to be of service in connection with yes think so humph be clue have of value to yes of pecuniary value mean yes be valuable then why did not sell instead of giving to for fifty pound sir said mr belk coldly be honest woman thing be not mine to sell money obtained dishonestly brings good luck a money be for son wish to be cursed fifty pound now give may be price of man blood be strangely scrupulous will not steal will hang man if be guilty deserves to die credit rather than blame be mine for handing over to justice maxwell looked curiously at speak above station in life very probably replied mr belk indifferently have have education strange dialogue be interrupted by entrance of servant who handed maxwell fifty pound in gold then took departure young man placed money on table motioned to mr belk count please see if be correct mr belk eagerly advanced towards table dividing money into ten counted rapidly having done so took small canvas bag out of pocket put gold into be right sir said with sigh of relief opening black bag have behaved like gentleman have money want have in exchange be small diamond pin in shape of star with eight point maxwell took in hand with sensation that have seen before ah said thoughtfully turning over in hand be thing have bought for fifty pound yes sir be worth about twenty must say said maxwell resuming seat doubtless story attached to will render more valuable there be story sir replied mr belk who have placed gold in obtrusive black bag simply found that on terrace of hall on morning after murder be lying close to window indeed think think that be dropped by man who murdered sir rupert how do know be man be gentleman scarf pin sir hah cried maxwell with sudden start know now where saw saw sir asked mr belk eagerly yes on scarf of man never mind may be mistaken did tell son have found sir wished to surprise with money have told one except be glad of well think have idea surely can not be guilty of murder who sir maxwell who have risen to foot looked at keenly have idea of whom be talking none in least sir young man walked to other end of room then retraced step slowly mr belk said after pause do know if there be stranger in deswarth on night of murder only one sir furriner at chequer went away next morning do think knew sir rupert know sir know be that found that scarf pin near where murder be committed if belongs to furriner killed sir rupert what be doing at deswarth know sir humph well say nothing about to one mr belk will see again when come down to deswarth be coming down to deswarth sir yes to find out who killed sir rupert think will find in london sir said woman with grim smile a stood with hand on door good morning sir good morning maxwell stood long time looking at pin yes said aloud certainly belongs to man have seen in scarf of ferrari in morning met mr belswin at deswarth station chapter xxix danger woman stranger know not thy shame yet there be danger hears thy name hide conceal heed not cost breathe reveal thou art lost diamond scarf pin have be found on terrace of thornstream by mr belk so man to whom belonged must have be there on night of murder owner thereof according to maxwell firm conviction on testimony of own eye be none other than stranger who have be in company of mr belswin at deswarth station first thing therefore to be done be to find out who stranger be demand from explanation of presence at thornstream on fatal night maxwell however did not know man whom suspected of being murderer did not even know name must discover about in two way one of be doubtful other certain doubtful way to go down to deswarth inquire from landlord of chequer name position business in village of man who have stayed at inn be doubtful in way that supposing stranger have come to deswarth to commit crime must naturally give false name to landlord so a to obviate danger of discovery so maxwell with idea in head plainly saw that going down to deswarth in order to interview landlord must in reasonable probability be waste of time certain way to ask mr belswin name of companion reason of coming to village archie felt old doubt about mr belswin revive a thought of doubtful juxtaposition of suspicious character with companion why have gone to london at time of sir rupert arrival why have returned with stranger who have be on terrace on night of murder why have sir rupert be murdered on night of return only one person must answer inquiry person be mr belswin there be certainly something very mysterious about conduct doubtless must be able to give satisfactory explanation otherwise cold sweat broke out on maxwell brow a thought of alternative suspense be always more terrible than event archie full of suspicion against mr belswin unknown foreigner tortured mind to frightful extent over possibility of woman being concerned in murder if however be innocent must be able to exculpate from complicity in affair if be guilty be terrible to think that be daily nightly companion of kaituna have possibly killed father if so might also kill daughter be one whom sir rupert have wronged who thus avenged by hand of idea be terrible maxwell filled with agony of uncertainty determined to go at once to mr belswin demand explanation made point of calling afternoon be lucky enough to find mr belswin alone a kaituna have gone out on shopping excursion with mr valpy who have come up to town previous day mr belswin informed young man of invited to wait until kaituna returned at hour of five o'clock meanwhile said ringing bell sit down will have tea maxwell mechanically took seat glanced at clock hand of pointed to four must give full hour to speak to mr belswin before arrival of kaituna in time expected to learn desired to know lady seemed preoccupied a maxwell be racking brain to invent leading question of spoke for few minute servant brought in tea while mr belswin busied with cup for first time noticed unusual silence of young man well mr maxwell said handing tea with smile speech understand be given to to conceal thought perceive conceal without speaking have come to see on matter of business said archie abruptly putting down cup on small table near at hand paleness of face abruptness of speech agitation of manner at once put mr belswin on guard thrill of fear shot through heart fear lest must have discovered anything about past life must be fatal to living with kaituna iron stoicism however prevailed awaited with outward calm inward perturbation next word mr belswin said slowly bending towards do know diamond pin oh muttered mr belswin under breath recognising at once more misfortune what do say before answer question mr maxwell observed fixing keen eye on face wish to know why put certainly be only fair do remember day met at deswarth railway station yes there be stranger with stranger pray evade question said maxwell in annoyed tone mean dark gentleman whom sent off to see about portmanteau who accompanied from town how do know accompanied from town saw leave first class carriage together that prof nothing travelling in same carriage doe not prove that accompanied from town looked after luggage at request yes did so certainly what doe prove simply that know gentleman mr belswin must have liked to deny a saw from production of diamond pin mention of ferrari maxwell knew something be so afraid lest failing must ask kaituna so possibly discover more than wished that answered frankly yes do know gentleman ah know name yes name be why do want to know because wore diamond pin on day saw with diamond pin yes yes cried mr belswin breathlessly clasping hand be found on terrace of thornstream morning after murder woman sprang to foot with cry ferrari impossible be name ferrari yes be mr maxwell cried seizing young man by lappet of coat what do mean what do suspect mean that diamond pin belongs to ferrari whom have just named suspect that murdered sir rupert pethram mr belswin uttered cry of terror can not be then let prove innocence prove innocence yes said maxwell with air of determination have made up mind to bring murderer of sir rupert pethram to justice appearance be dead against man intend to put matter in hand of police will never find maxwell bounded from seat crossing rapidly to mr belswin seized wrist tell said imperiously have reason for wishing man to escape murmured evasively wish to escape yes to appearance be friend come down with to deswarth jewel belonging to be found at window of room in room man be found dead what doe mean wait cried woman wrenching from grasp wait must think maxwell obeyed returned to seat with cloud on brow for complicity of mr belswin in affair now began to assume gigantic proportion on part mr belswin saw at glance danger by be environed active brain be already at work seeking plan by must extricate already saw that maxwell suspected if did so trembled lest must communicate suspicion to daughter with hand pressed to burning face rapidly glanced at aspect of affair in order to know how to act towards young man whose attitude towards be undeniably hostile if refused to tell anything must put matter into hand of police must immediately arrest ferrari in doing so must have difficulty a being singer be easily to be found appearance be sufficiently strong against to authorise granting of warrant for arrest if ferrari be arrested must certainly urged by fear of law reveal about in examination kaituna must then learn that mr belswin companion be mother if did so mr belswin trembled for result of discovery so at once made up mind to promise maxwell interview with ferrari meanwhile warn italian of peril by mean hoped that if guilty ferrari must at once fly from england if innocent must be able to exculpate without incriminating so that in case must still preserve secret of true relationship to kaituna mr maxwell said at length suppressing agitation will tell know then can judge for thank mr belswin replied maxwell in tone of relief think will be best way a be anxious to avoid interference of police why sir demanded mr belswin with piercing glance young man made reply looked confused upon woman laughed bitterly ah see said with scorn think that stranger to late sir rupert be implicated in death have not said so madam murmured young man hastily swear before god cried mr belswin rising from seat raising right hand swear before god know nothing of death of man ferrari believe ferrari to be innocent appearance be against be true doe not render guilty listen mr maxwell stephano ferrari be friend of mine for met in america before came to england be opera singer be singing with in same company be engaged to be married yes wanted to rest voice a have little money became companion to miss pethram know whether have be good friend to not have be good friend certainly duty kept near miss pethram so saw ferrari rarely a be devoted to naturally missed society at time left deswarth came to london to see about marriage on return be on sunday ferrari came down with a be not singing that night be there anything strange in no seems quite natural replied maxwell after pause must act same way towards kaituna signor ferrari resumed mr belswin coldly stayed that night at chequer returned believe next morning to town did not see a owing to terrible death of sir rupert have to stay with kaituna know how spent night know at what hour returned in morning scarf pin be certainly what of may have come to thornstream to see lost on terrace if so why did not see know know nothing beyond what have told set mind at rest come here to morrow morning at eleven o'clock will take to signor ferrari who will doubtless be able to explain to satisfaction will yes at eleven to morrow be sure be innocent hope so said maxwell heartily if only for sake be still suspicious see replied mr belswin with faint smile well be only natural hope suspicion will be dispelled by signor ferrari explanation now must ask to permit to retire a exciting talk have given headache if however will wait for kaituna not to night thank said maxwell hastily taking hat stick be too disturbed to see good bye rely on promise to morrow at eleven at eleven will wait answered mr belswin truthfully so at present good bye think worse of than can help maxwell said nothing bowing politely left room while mr belswin annoyed at silence stood frowning angrily still suspect muttered ringing bell ferrari must put end to suspicion if can servant entered room hansom at once put on cloak bonnet returned to sitting room to wait for cab be in terrible danger said pulling on glove terrible danger one false step may be known ferrari be only hope can be guilty appearance be against if be murderer let suffer a long a keep silence cab ma'be mr belswin went downstairs care what happens cried when driving away a long a keep child chapter xxx clever defence say 't be indeed sir 't be not so hand be innocent of man blood nay never fear pardon what say judgment be misled by false report why if heed idle tongue wag there be not honest man must becape law for act bear two interpretation one good one bad so that enemy use that fit in best with desire a evil witness 'gainst true intent there be doubt that peril sharpens wit of therefore mr belswin in interview with italian proved able diplomatist that after difficulty obtained what wanted according therefore to arrangement made with ferrari be to tell maxwell a much a possible of doings at deswarth without mentioning name of mr belswin on first hearing of maxwell accusation ferrari wanted to fly a plainly said must be difficult for to defend against charge although swore on crucifix that be perfectly innocent mr belswin dissuaded from course a pointed out that if acknowledged truth of accusation by flight maxwell must immediately inform police must be arrested before must leave england on contrary however if faced charge boldly explained presence of diamond scarf pin on terrace to satisfaction of young man must not only by doing so clear own character might possibly lead to capture of true criminal ferrari agreed therefore to grant interview desired by maxwell tell truth without betraying mr belswin true position towards dead man in way during very curious conversation man woman asked other same question be guilty mr belswin solemnly swore that be innocent told ferrari same story a have told dombrain concerning doings on night explanation satisfied italian then in response to mr belswin question a to innocence gave account of how have passed night after departed carissima said volubly went to seek time be darkness cospetto how black knew not villaggio so returned to osteria in one few minute be in hotel before eleven demanded mr belswin artfully cara mia fled at ten hour went came back at ten ten so must not have killed il marito mr belswin believed story a have be out longer landlord must certainly have talked about ferrari must have be arrested at once on suspicion a be felt quite satisfied that be innocent having thus come to complete understanding with departed mr belswin therefore declared that be innocent ferrari also declared innocence if be case who be guilty ah be to be revealed next day to archie maxwell true to promise young man called for mr belswin at eleven o'clock following morning after short interview with kaituna to whom talked on most indifferent subject departed with companion mr belswin be fearfully pale a future depended upon caution observed by ferrari be afraid lest carried away by impulsive southern nature italian must reveal more than be desirable to maxwell be not afraid of being accused of crime a dombrain alone must give evidence a to being in room after murder have perfect understanding with be terribly afraid of maxwell finding out true relationship to kaituna in case must certainly lose companionship of child to retain have fought so hard maxwell be also somewhat preoccupied a in spite of desire to think best of mr belswin conduct hesitation equivocation appeared so mysterious that be forced to believe that knew more than chose to tell conduct however in conducting to personal interview with ferrari be one argument in favour for never for moment struck simple minded young man that have in way prepared ground beforehand perfectly honest straightforward in maxwell foolishly supposed other human being to posse same desirable quality in hand of two practised diplomatist like italian mr belswin must not possibly hold own life have always be perfectly open one although be not rich have never be put to shift for money in way consequently wit have grown somewhat rusty from want of exercise mr belswin friend however have led reckless bohemian existence called for craft courage coolness dexterity in very high degree therefore be thoroughly competent in dealing with delicate affair like present required subtle management still blundering blue bottle often break web spun by craftiest spider so mr belswin feared lest straightforward honesty of young man must rush through careful scheme by sheer boldness arrive at truth on arrival at ferrari chamber be already waiting for mr belswin having introduced to archie three sat down to talk be fencing match third fencer be maxwell who not only have two opponent against same opponent be gifted with power of attack parry of be completely ignorant speak english see said archie to ferrari after first greeting have passed certainly signor replied italian showing white teeth have be long from italy oh estate of america where have pleasure of meeting signor ferrari observed mr belswin ceremoniously at signor bowed made remark so maxwell seeing that must not commit to speech unless questioned began at once on main object of interview mr belswin presume told wished to see signor ferrari italian bowed about article of jewellery belonging to ferrari bowed again be found on terrace at thornstream residence of late sir rupert pethram signor bowed for third time maxwell hot blooded in thing began to lose temper at persistent silence well sir said sharply perhaps will be kind enough to inform how scarf pin came to be on terrace in question one moment said ferrari politely lifting hand will kindly tell who found what have maxwell hesitated moment seeing reason why must conceal part mr belk have taken in affair spoke out boldly woman know mr belk dio great heaven ejaculation proceeded first from ferrari second from mr belswin in hearing maxwell looked suspiciously from one to other seem surprised so will be surprised said mr belswin gloomily when hear what signor have to tell be at signor ferrari service per bacco be most strange cried ferrari throwing back on sky blue sofa alfieri must have thought nothing so terrible story sir story eh signor excite wonder said italian equably be not so dio be lost in fear signor will tell maxwell bit nether lip with impatience at leisurely way in ferrari be acting a saw from agitation of mr belswin that name of woman who have found scarf pin moved powerfully signor said ferrari gracefully departed with signora here to villagio on day saw waited at osteria know of doubt
