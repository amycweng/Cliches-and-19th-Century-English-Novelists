frond wonderfully delicate distinct have evidently be impressed with india rubber stamp moistened with purple ink square sized envelope bore address stamp seal what must one make of such missive appeared meaningless yet to clarice fern recalled faint memory probably that memory whatever might be be clearer to horran so have given shock of have complained after consideration clarice slipped envelope sheet of paper into pocket thinking advisable to remove from horran sight have fallen into deep sleep be breathing almost imperceptibly face looking singularly calm unwrinkled whatever disease might be certainly be not suffering pain be strange that after ten hour sleep must again relapse into slumber still from look there be cause for alarm so clarice touched bell when chalk entered pointed silently to unconscious master valet be round rosy stout little man with twinkling black eye meek manner beamed with good nature overflowed with milk of human kindness attendant with so cheerful disposition smiling countenance be quite kind of nurse needed by invalid a spirit be infectious frequently served to arouse somewhat melancholy mr horran from dismal musing chalk displayed surprise at sight of patient asleep again lifted in arm placed gently on bed clarice deliberated a to whether must tell chalk who be intelligent devoted to mr horran about missive of purple fern finally decided to say nothing concerning to anyone until have seen anthony elusive memory must not come back to in entirety suggested that ackworth must account for fern in way what do think of chalk asked indicating unconscious man on bed think be asleep miss said chalk innocently why must sleep again after ten hour slumber why must be ill at miss be retort of cheerful little man seeing that doctor say a organ be healthy that there ai nothing whatever matter with miss baird drew white brow together in perplexed way there must be reason for disease chalk doctor say there be disease miss

french window be open moved to close chalk stopped miss master must have air can get dr wentworth say so dr jerce chalk beamed like cherub bless heart miss insists on master getting a little air a possible when dr jerce come down miss say window must be closed when dr wentworth turn up open straight off agree miss be hard on miss be perplexing assented clarice laughing what do do well miss let

laughed at explanation seeing that guardian to appearance be in healthy sleep went away tell when wake up chalk said at door yes miss if master sleep for one hundred year like sleeping beauty chalk chuckled at own simple wit clarice passed morning in attending to domestic duty have consultation with mr rebson about christmas festivity that cheerful housekeeper remarked that must be a well to make house a bright a possible since domestic prophet declared that something terrible must happen before christmas what event might be mr rebson must not tell a prophet after manner of kind be obscure in wording of oracle nevertheless clarice became infected with vague dread mr rebson insisted felt memory of oddly delivered envelope containing stamped picture of purple fern did not tend to dissipate uneasiness when left mr rebson still prophesying coming woe like elderly cassandra girl felt that walk must do good putting on fur sallied forth eager to breathe le portentous atmosphere day be bright clear snow be hard clean in lucid air lurked sting of frost sitting over fire one be apt to shiver smart walking brought colour to most wan cheek communicated glow to whole body clarice looked extremely pretty a exercise tinted oval face sent warm blood spinning through youthful vein walked in determined swinging way with steadfast eye firmly closed mouth like woman who know own mind who mean to have own way needed very strong man to master young lady of new school clarice believed that ackworth be just man to exercise authority certainly dr jerce might have mastered also a be stern strong then did not love dr jerce only from tyrant loved be miss baird ready to take order finding near vicarage clarice determined to enter see if ferdy be there a have not come back to luncheon be probable that have gone to prudence clarke for consolation thing miss baird quite approved of a respected prudence must have be glad to see ferdy engaged to so sensible girl quarrel at breakfast table have doubt left ferdy fretful complaining so be pretty certain that must visit prudence pour woe into sympathetic ear ferdy never must keep trouble to invariably climbed to highest house top to shout out puny grief clarice wished to marry prudence yet sometimes doubted if so sensible girl must tolerate such baby man a husband servant who answered door said that miss clarke have gone out skating with mr baird that vicar be in study clarice must have turned away in pursuit of young people that parson heard voice came into hall be undersized miserable man with head too large for body awkward diffident manner seemed to continually apologise for existence of mr nehemiah clarke voice be querulous complaint be incessant in rusty black clothes with bent frame untidy hair looked most dismal object clarice in then somewhat dejected state of mind scarcely relished interview with so cheerless person however must not help entered study with best grace must muster there whimpered mr clarke waving hand towards array of bill strewed desk like autumn leaf what do think of for christmas clarice how be man to preach goodwill towards men when men wo show goodwill towards get bill at christmas time said miss baird consolingly get more than anyone else moaned vicar sinking into chair before desk why must come to know must pay a go mr clarke have ready money clarice be very well for in lap of luxury have only three hundred year even that small sum come to slowly since people will not pay tithe without legal threat cost money eat much dress plainly never enjoy keep only one cheap servant yet bill will come in prudence be responsible for many ought to emulate name wo imprudence must suit better oh dear how can sympathise with lear think prudence be extravagant mr clarke said clarice who resented placing of burden on other people shoulder always seems to to be sensible girl in way in way muttered vicar discontentedly clarice reflected for few minute from hint dropped by prudence have shrewd idea of where vicar money went how be frank mr clarke asked significantly son be still in london trying to get work poor lad be very unfortunate with education manner brain ought to be one of foremost men of time want of money be bar to advancement what be frank doing nothing have tried army medical profession legal profession lecture hall even stage a yet have not hit upon field in can display undoubted ability to utmost support suppose ca let boy starve said mr clarke defiantly well then seems to that frank be more to blame than prudence for difficulty ought to support will day when acquires position to talent will lead then will bring glory to clarkes only brings misfortune debt just now said clarice dryly who say so asked vicar furiously prudence tell that brother will not do anything pass time in idleness constantly come to for money a be over thirty year of age certainly must support poor frank can not help misfortune rather think that man misfortune be a rule of own making mr clarke own for instance have three hundred year free house ought to keep out of debt if will give money to frank what can expect dear dear said mr clarke testily girl like ca understand thing oh yes can since uncle henry have be ill year have have great deal to do with business vicar started thought mr barras be guardian lawyer so be attends to everything uncle henry rarely see mr barras so have to attend to necessary matter why doe ferdinand ferdinand clarice made gesture of contempt be same a son spends money rather than earns dear must say thing unbecoming in young girl mouth be not modest in woman clarice stood up very tall dignified rather irritated what be use of talking like to mr clarke idea of superiority of man be thing of past be only woman girl a say have five time sense of ferdinand uncle henry trust rather than prudence also be clever sensible believe that be extravagant mr clarke frank be one who spends money if must allow frank to earn own living let prudence arrange affair must soon be out of difficulty prudence know nothing of business clarice frank know le retorted girl thoroughly angry woman have more intuition than men there be way out of difficulty mr clarke what be asked little man somewhat cowed by determined demeanour of miss baird ferdy be in love with prudence let marry then can arrange debt will be paid when ferdy come in for money two year hence in meantime moaned vicar can arrange something be if will stop sending money to frank let sink swim mr clarke self reliance be sole thing will make man of frank will see will see said mr clarke evasively if allow prudence to marry ferdinand note that love one do think will help will help how can mr clarke spoke to uncle henry morning told that a guardian have authority to appoint one at death doe trust ferdy so have constituted head of affair ferdy get two thousand year a do in two year will have casting vote a to how money be disposed of at least up to age of twenty five when take over if ferdy marries prudence next year will allow good income on condition that pay debt will do if advise a will have legal power when uncle henry dy if mr horran doe not die then will see what mr barras can do be lawyer belief in tell everything clarke rose began to pace room have barras told that horran lent one thousand pound five year ago at ten per cent said clarice somewhat startled be that so yes be in great trouble over loan borrowed to help son frank have have to pay interest at rate of ten per cent year be one hundred pound have not paid up for three year so be indebted to mr horran for three hundred pound threatens to sell up mean ruin believe cried clarice energetically uncle henry be kind man must never do thing who say so mr barras then will go up to london see mr barras after christmas ought to have told about did not why do not see uncle henry mr clarke tried to dr jerce must not let said that must upset mr horran if talked business to therefore have kept away from house noticed that have not be near for month said clarice thoughtfully how doe dr jerce come to know of matter mr barras told miss baird flushed in angry way seems to that mr barras take great deal upon said haughtily since uncle henry be ill trust be one to be spoken to about matter not dr jerce will question uncle henry about loan see that everything be put right then wo have to pay three hundred said vicar eagerly ca say that rejoined clarice bluntly will see what can do of course if ferdy must only become engaged to prudence might be able to do much a matter stand dr jerce mr barras may prove too strong for mr horran trust so say clarice doe uncle henry mean have great opinion of dr jerce in weak state may be influenced by will speak to doctor to mr barras more than ca promise vicar looked more miserable than ever twice opened mouth to speak time closed while clarice wondered at hesitation do think that everything be right with mr horran asked mr clarke at length what do mean by asked startled mr horran have money know save what receives from estate by acting a guardian clarice stared never knew that said at length understood of course that uncle henry received sum for acting a guardian since be right have own money house house live in belonged to father now belongs to said clarke rapidly leaning forward with eagerness to emphasise word know because buried parent be present at reading of will mr horran loved mother be trusted by father never have money when father died left everything to mother in trust for ferdinand when went way of flesh constituted mr horran who then managed business guardian a trusted be hard up did not mr barras tell thing clarice said absently began to see that lawyer have not trusted so entirely a have thought neither have horran if vicar be to be believed will speak to uncle henry said after pause from will learn true position of affair meantime please say nothing mr clarke will be silent three hundred interest will see about also be sure that uncle henry doe not mean to be hard on of course business may upset since be so ill dr jerce may be right in keeping away same seems to that dr jerce know good deal about private affair be sure that mr horran tell everything said clarke with gloomy air dr jerce be not friendly towards know why since be at college together be not friendly clarice felt puzzled conversation with mr clarke opened eye to fact that business be not so easy matter a have imagined if be to be tricked by mr barras keeping back detail of finance if dr jerce be influencing horran secretly appeared that must have difficulty in straightening out thing at death nevertheless horran have assured that when passed away must find everything in good order before must pursue subject further in thought door opened prudence appeared with ferdy behind prudence be brunette a dark a ferdy be fair tall handsome full of life spirit from downward curve of mouth must seem that have temper just now appeared to be filled with joy rushed to kiss clarice dear dear said quickly ferdy have ferdy have be glad cried clarice guessing what have happened with swift intuition of woman be exactly what wanted ferdy to do well then said ferdy who be radiant a lover who evidently have forgiven sister for quarrel at breakfast have done done what asked vicar staring open mouthed have asked prudence to become wife thank god said clarke devout egotistic debt will be paid chapter vi discovery on same night weather changed with unexampled rapidity from cold to warm thick mist descended on crumel snow began to melt a though under influence of summer sun long hour of darkness be filled with dripping of water melting of snow whole country be turned into vast expanse of slush expectation of white christmas entertained by old fashioned people vanished next day seemed from warm humidity of foggy air a though season of yule have given place to early autumn clarice looked out of bedroom window on to damp green lawn from patch of snow be quickly disappearing experienced sense of discomfort set down to queer weather perhaps earthquake in earlier part of year have disarranged english climate altered season assuredly atmosphere be decidedly unhealthy yet vague fear of girl may have be le due to sudden change of temperature than to feeling of apprehension entertained since conversation with mr clarke that money matter be not so satisfactory a have thought to be hitherto clarice have implicitly trusted mr barras in innocence of worldly way have always be frank with so far a must see having be delegated by horran to tell of thing connected with estate clarice have believed that knew everything now if vicar be to be believed appeared that horran have lent money be pressing for payment of interest also dr jerce seemed to know of private business of baird orphan to be influencing horran against wretched mr clarke certainly vicar be not very estimable character infatuation for spendthrift son merited contempt rather than approbation nevertheless horran have known clarke life have be to college with with jerce therefore assuredly must not be hard on parson whose sole fault be affection for unworthy son also if jerce be influencing horran a clarke suggested might advise leniency instead of bearing hard on man especially at christmas time barras also appeared to be anxious to force vicar into discharging interest at time when must ill afford to pay three pound much le three hundred more than barras wilfully concealed from clarice fact of case if lawyer withheld item certainly withheld others clarice staring out of window at thaw began to find doubting honesty of mr barras added to trouble be fact of horran mysterious illness mystery of purple fern more than ever clarice be determined not to speak to jerce about missive have sent horran into second deep sleep putting aside fact that jerce be in league with barras a must appear to bankrupt vicar doctor being in love with assuredly be not person to whom must talk freely then again ferdy manner alarmed girl after first outburst of joy on becoming engaged to prudence have relapsed into moody silence seemed to be much worried over something refused to explain to sister in vain on previous night have clarice implored to be entirely frank ferdy declaring that there be nothing wrong have maintained moody manner have drunk much more wine than be good for man with weak brain on whole clarice after reflection concluded that uneasiness be due le to unexampled weather than to domestic mystery by seemed to be surrounded on leaving room found that ferdy have already breakfasted have gone out presuming that be haunting prudence with impatience of young lover clarice thought more about absence breakfasted alone then repaired to mr horran room to speak to of many matter be on mind be just a well thought to go to fountain head at once to learn if horran really desired to sell up vicar be uncle henry awake asked when chalk presented miss be prompt reply be sound asleep a usual dear how long will sleep dr wentworth ca say miss tried to wake ca so dr wentworth said must be better to let sleep until have consultation with dr jerce clarice cast look at french window saw that be open wide in spite of fog see that dr wentworth have be here chalk said

afternoon yes miss dr wentworth doe like constant sleeping of master have sent for dr jerce to consult be just a well said clarice crossing to bed looking at pale calm face of still sleeping man want to talk to dr jerce about business be hardly term wished to ask jerce why grey man have searched pocket why be influencing barras horran to be hard on vicar matter of purple fern intended to relate to one anthony memory of name made glance at watch noted that must soon make appearance horran seemed to be sleeping a placidly a infant so felt that there be cause for alarm bending to kiss placid face turned slowly towards door by way chalk have seen mr ferdinand morning asked thinking that brother might have paid visit to invalid yes miss said valet promptly saw out of waved hand towards open french window going to savoy hotel oh ejaculated clarice hastily left room seemed strange to that ferdy must seek out mother of sarah dump just when became engaged surely did not love dancer when have only lately proposed to prudence remembering dr jerce remark recalling conversation of mr rebson girl felt uneasy on account of brother ferdy seemed to have two string to bow sarah dump be not at home certainly yet here clarice stopped thought sudden idea struck returned quickly to sick room chalk go sometimes to savoy hotel remarked be there last night for hour miss replied valet apologetically mr rebson watched master while be away hope did do wrong master seemed to be sleeping so quietly that thought might get breath of fresh air be right chalk do know if mr dump daughter have returned for christmas yes miss came back last night very pretty girl be miss quite yes yes have seen interrupted clarice hurriedly went away feeling more upset than ever then be reason of ferdy visit to savoy hotel sarah dump be in field ferdy be in net yet weak a boy be seemed incredible that must propose to one woman immediately seek company of here then be trouble for clarice did not know very well what to do be impossible to speak to ferdy a have proof that loved sarah dump save from what mr rebson have said simple denial on part of ferdy must take wind out of sail so to speak must be helpless to do anything on other hand clarice felt certain that in way ferdy be playing double game knew weak character too well to give benefit of doubt for knew might be engaged to sarah dump prudence at same time

wish must explain exactly how picked up letter be still asleep at minute wheel of carriage be heard clarice wondering if new arrival be jerce opened french window stepped out on to terrace now sloppy with mixed snow water mud strolled to end followed by anthony saw that dr jerce have indeed arrived be stepping out of hired fly have just handed man fare when caught sight of clarice at once came towards with outstretched hand took unwillingly enough received wire from wentworth said anxiously hope old friend be not very ill again no be in sound sleep dr wentworth be puzzled over length of slumber come in way went along terrace thank ah mr ackworth how be quite change in weather be why what be matter ejaculation be caused by cry from clarice have picked up small object thaw have revealed be small gold box on face be set curved fern in amethyst purple fern again exclaimed ackworth amazed chapter vii dr jerce explains ackworth clarice looked at one dumfounded dr jerce with considerable amazement looked at finally eye of three rested on object picked up by girl outwardly appeared to be snuffbox with surface of dull gold wherein amethystine fern be delicately set looked exquisite specimen of jeweller art to jerce there seemed nothing about to startle young people yet anthony appeared grave clarice even frightened one must think have picked up serpent said jerce jestingly what be there about snuffbox frightens purple fern replied pointing to amethyst a doctor still seemed to be puzzled ackworth explained do not remember murder of year ago murder oh er yes there be much in paper about read public journal very little time be taken up with medical work just refresh memory will ackworth dead body be stamped with fern be yes on forehead seven people be stabbed to heart one in kensington garden one in strand one in house at hampstead one yes yes remember now interrupted jerce impatiently murderer be caught hanged if forget not one murderer be caught said anthony with emphasis have accomplice whose name refused to reveal really there have be more murder since for over year have ceased ackworth pointed to golden box warning received by mr horran look a though accomplice who be not caught intend to begin series of crime jerce looked confounded what be that say about horran having received warning asked before ackworth must reply clarice drew attention of two men to box have opened be divided into two compartment one of be empty while other be filled with silken pad moistened with purple ink look cried miss baird aghast a well might be be very box contained stamp for impressing purple fern on forehead of victim here be pad stamp have gone oh anthony how did come here letter too what letter asked jerce soothing agitation while ackworth took over box to examine be not exactly letter said clarice striving to appear calm only uncle henry found envelope outside window yesterday contained sheet of paper stamped mr ackworth can show to here be remarked anthony taking envelope from pocket passing to now grave doctor now box have be found seems to that mr horran be in danger of death jerce examined picture of fern turned twisted envelope to see if there be address postmark looked attentively at dainty box humph said cautiously assassin must be man of taste culture since designed receptacle for india rubber stamp us such costly stationery man echoed clarice with sudden idea assassin may not be man at box paper look a though woman no interrupted doctor decisively person who dropped gold box here be man without doubt be connected with wretch who used purple fern to stamp handiwork yes spoke half to there certainly must be gang of course chimed in ackworth quickly man who be caught defied authority to stamp out criminal admitted that have three accomplice two remember now broke in clarice two well then admitted that have two accomplice refused to betray name hiding place also warned government that must avenge death for last twelve month have not done so now ackworth pointed to box warning missive with great significance must take step to save mr horran life ended decisively certainly certainly agreed jerce what be to be done will go at once to local police must not do mr ackworth will be better to come with to london to night report case at scotland yard in meantime uncle henry may be killed chalk can stop with day night until detective arrives detective echoed clarice in dismay in house why not asked jerce quietly must take strong measure see reason why horran must be killed a be not wealthy man gang always selected victim men woman from rich people perhaps to supply luxury touched valuable box expensive envelope certainly man in grey mean to kill horran else why warning man in grey asked ackworth inquiringly ferdy told about said clarice quickly be going to ask about man why did search pocket did not know at time said doctor gravely know now come way walked into drawing room through window must speak softly so that one may overhear be quite safe here said clarice a anthony closed window why be afraid doctor wall have ear dear miss baird remaining man of triumvirate be clever cunning remaining man said ackworth then of three be dead jerce nodded sat down quietly looked somewhat upset be very unpleasant business said anxiously be to blame in not having allowed ferdinand to inform police about assault made on other night have man in grey be arrested warning threat might not have come also fact of box with purple fern must have ensured hanging a one of gang who committed cruel murder be much to blame can say be that not until returned to harley street on night did guess why man in grey wanted to search pocket why did asked clarice who have be listening to explanation with puzzled look be long story then begin at beginning said ackworth impetuously for want to know everything so can see way to what mr ackworth to protecting mr horran getting blackguard arrested jerce nodded approvingly will lend assistance can mr ackworth said firmly unless man be caught will be veritable scourge to society story story cried clarice with impatience be indeed story more like romance than real life said jerce quickly know miss baird have consulting room in tea street whitechapel yes mr horran told that also said anthony physic poor people for nothing do earn so much money in west end think be only right to use talent for poor must do what good can in world know mr ackworth set up for being philanthropist in humble way do what good can well then resumed quickly seeing that clarice be growing impatient again be there in tea street two month ago attended on young man who be dying of consumption appeared to be clever refined intelligent for miserably poor quarter room be furnished with great taste somewhat expensively seemed to be absolutely alone did what must to save life skill be of avail died a have refused to receive fee gave sealed envelope told to carry constantly upon person why asked clarice wonderingly will tell later dying man also warned that if be attacked by fellow with criss cross scar on left cheek to open envelope then man died be buried did not attach much importance to sealed letter did open asked girl eagerly not until man in grey attacked must have opened at once said quickly jerce smiled eve curiosity answered however be not woman so refrained from unsealing envelope after time slipped with other paper into safe thought more about matter when grey man attacked other night incident be recalled to mind not added jerce with emphasis not until ferdinand told that have seen man in grey clothes with scar on cheek then returned to london opened envelope found therein paper containing name address what be asked anthony who be listening attentively alfred osip rough lane stepney also there be few line stating that man who wrote consumptive patient osip be surviving member of purple fern gang that if osip room in stepney be searched paper proving guilt of must be found well then mr ackworth one man have be hanged have died of consumption third alfred osip be person who attacked on terrace doubt in struggle dropped golden box at one time undoubtedly contained india rubber stamp used to mark victim see said clarice why must osip attack doctor jerce looked at in surprise dear be usually quicker in seeing thing said rebukefully of course osip in way knew that dying accomplice have betrayed carried sealed letter a thought on person be why searched must have have arrested when ferdinand suggested going for police never dreamed that wretch be connected with purple fern gang however have made what amends can went at once to scotland yard told authority have told now warning to horran undoubtedly sent by osip box will be valuable evidence may be caught red handed if attempt murder can see now mr ackworth why suggest that must not inform local police osip be cunning dangerous so will be advisable for to get detective from london to see into matter fear crumel police may bungle business return to london afternoon to be precise evening so will at once communicate new discovery to scotland yard authority ackworth nodded think plan be best doctor said in meditative voice only hope brute will not murder mr horran in meantime suggest that chalk must remain constantly with mr horran will not that arouse mr horran suspicion asked anthony after in delicate state of health will not do to let know that be in danger of death uncle henry know already said clarice impetuously discovery of envelope gave shock said so wanted to see doctor expect sight of fern recalled murder to at once have idea that fern be familiar to until mr ackworth refreshed memory must not be sure will speak to chalk said jerce rising will be just a well that one else in house must know about matter there be one who know said voice coming from distant alcove ferdy head appeared over back of deep leather armchair faced towards window doctor started looked displeased ferdinand said in angry voice why did listen to what doe not concern think concern great deal said ferdy coolly came forward into full light of room very pale with ruffled hair went to sleep in chair woke up at sound of voice listened half unconsciously then when story became interesting listened with ear a chair back be towards expect did not see wish have come out ferdy said clarice much annoyed a recalled conversation with ackworth how long have be sleeping not very long came in through window when be out on terrace ackworth looked hard at ferdy to see if be lying must only make out that young man looked extremely upset remarked upon with dryness baird turned on at once with fractiousness of spoilt child story have made quite sick said restlessly want to be murdered in bed warning be not sent to said clarice contemptuously if have be 'd have gone to police station right off wish have let go on night doctor wish have said jerce regretfully however be too late now must do best can say word about to anyone ferdinand jolly well wo wish to be mixed up with horrid thing said baird be going upstairs to lie down now be sleepy before with walking now be quite sick with sleepy with walking whispered clarice drawing close to ferdy have be drinking in savoy hotel eye be red cheek be pale have be oh leave alone said ferdy rudely twitching sleeve from clarice hand abruptly left room anthony bit lip that young monkey deserves kicking said sharply if be not brother clarice must break neck dr jerce started already girl have called man by christian name now man be returning compliment clarice coloured with genuine annoyance a jerce be last man to whom wanted secret of engagement revealed doctor looked sharply from one to other saying nothing walked towards door with official composure clarice did not know if guessed truth if deemed interchange of familiar name mere slip of tongue jerce face be inscrutable will come with to see patient asked clarice politely certainly doctor please remain here mr ackworth cast side glance at jerce to see if noted stiff address made sign will return almost directly anthony looked puzzled a must not understand why clarice have coloured when speaking to doctor be perfectly unaware that jerce have hinted at proposal however a presence of third person did not permit of explanation merely bowed acquiescence clarice looked at lover for one moment in hesitating manner then hastily followed doctor caught up with at door of mr horran bedroom entered without speaking a usual since wentworth have last seen patient french window be wide open jerce immediately shut sharply have told dozen time to keep window closed said severely to chalk open sir protested valet dr wentworth have view have mine said jerce imperiously mr horran be patient dr wentworth be merely called in a local practitioner to act while be absent window must be kept closed day night do hear yes sir said chalk sulkily think master be waking sir jerce clarice turned towards bed saw that horran be sitting up smiled in dreamy way when caught sight of old friend seemed disinclined to talk jerce felt man pulse listened to beating of heart then produced ophthalmoscope examined eye turning up lid delicately with finger after few minute drew back with puzzled expression shook head while horran in semiconscious condition sank back on pillow well asked clarice eagerly jerce shrugged shoulder a usual can say nothing replied in low voice can find trace of optic neuritis visual acuity be normal on next visit when wentworth be present will make more precise examination what be to be done nothing at present never met with more interesting more perplexing case in experience must give much to know true cause of symptom must return to town by three o'clock train concluded doctor glancing at watch said strong voice from bed there saw horran sitting up apparently wide awake sudden change be one quite characteristic of mysterious disease repeated sick man with anxious glance at jerce must have talk daniel thing must be settled between yes yes said jerce good naturedly then sank voice to address clarice apparently want to talk about will leave alone with take chalk with clarice kissed guardian took notice of a eye be steadily fixed on doctor strong calm face thing must be settled between repeated horran a clarice chalk departed chapter viii what happened next well asked anthony when clarice returned to drawing room be mr horran better think so be awake voice be stronger whether improvement will last ca say what doe doctor say nothing be very perplexed over disease doe not know what be matter doe say much for jerce reputation said ackworth dr jerce be only man after answered clarice earnestly uncle henry disease be so very mysterious that dr wentworth can say anything explicit ackworth twisted hand behind back swayed to fro on toe tip wonder if mr horran be really ill after clarice with handkerchief to mouth looked at suddenly inquiringly what do mean from what have seen of mr horran said ackworth quietly doe not appear to be ill colour be good eats well sleep lot have not lost flesh eye be steady certainly appears to become giddy at time might be biliousness from sedentary life also get cross fractious again might be liver life very unhealthily stewing in room with fire such existence be enough to produce symptom suffers from without real physical cause well questioned clarice not knowing what speech meant wo be offended asked ackworth in turn uneasily with what be about to say something about purple fern yes stared at amazed ackworth still continued to sway to fro gazed at ground a replied mr horran may take exercise at night go on understand illness may be feint for what for business connected with purple fern anthony clarice recoiled a though have struck oh know sound ridiculous said ackworth hurriedly perhaps may prove to be ridiculous same fact of man searching jerce on terrace mysterious illness envelope containing stamped fern presence of gold box jerce now have well see exactly know how to put clarice drew near to again do mean to say that uncle henry have anything to do with murder oh go so far a dear do remember that when became engaged to asked to see barras lawyer since guardian be too ill to be spoken to yes wanted to inquire about money well spoke to barras last week learn that certainly get two thousand per annum in couple of year ferdy get same mr horran be sole guardian with right to appoint guardian must die mr barras wishing to stand well with suppose a future husband hinted that might not find everything right at horran death uncle henry told that everything be in order cried miss baird declared that have appointed guardian to look after ferdy money when died when uncle henry died mean humph doe not entirely agree with mr barras hint did no more than hint something be wrong mr horran a understood from barras be cause of being wrong uncle henry have always be good friend quite so have be good guardian yes one must have be better one so far a know precisely said anthony quickly so far a know fact be clarice like mr horran never liked hesitated go on go on keep in suspense well then three month ago be in town went to ball at shah room be not to be plain very reputable dance at event be extremely bohemian went there before be engaged to clarice now must not go well then at dance saw mr horran oh be quite impossible have not be out of room for year year recognised at glance said ackworth steadily military carriage spare figure long iron grey moustache be with tall man who have criss cross scar on left cheek man in grey who searched dr jerce on terrace same if dr jerce description be to be relied upon never thought of thing until left room then remembering late conversation memory of incident came back now clarice if man a jerce declares be mixed up in purple fern business certainly be with mr horran that see brings guardian into affair clarice turned quite pale be very mysterious said to herself yet seems perfectly absurd uncle henry be ill have always be ill off on for last ten year have lived in house with time how must possibly go to town even once without knowledge ackworth shrugged square shoulder oh a to that good motor car must take to london back in few hour uncle henry have not got motor car may have one know of said ackworth quickly a french window of open on to terrace on other side of house must not be difficult for to slip out back again without knowing chalk have sat up with often quite so may have slipped out on night chalk did not sit up with be sure be uncle henry saw at shah room caught only glimpse of with scarred man feel certain be mr horran have rather striking personality appearance know also when moved forward to speak to saw vanished in crowd of dancer if be there when be supposed to be ill at home there may be something in mr barras hint also a be with man in grey box be found on terrace yonder by stamped picture of fern be delivered to seems to that mr horran be secretly mixed up with matter be supposition said clarice uneasily quite so however best thing to do will be to ask mr horran for explanation yes dr jerce must do jerce be eminently respectable man if anything be wrong must think must show scant mercy to wrong doer dr jerce may know more than imagine said clarice quickly related what vicar have said about loan ackworth listened with great attention humph jerce apparently suspect something also horran have be money lending seems be quite shylock why speak to horran about loan to vicar be money horran have be playing with if be true that have nothing save income for acting a guardian mr clarke told that dr jerce must not allow to see uncle henry about loan dr jerce want to keep patient quiet may be quite deceived about disease if be disease dr jerce be too clever to be deceived be insisted ackworth seeing that wentworth can state what disease be tell what clarice announce engagement to will give colour for to interfere then can get mr clarke in to see mr horran also can ask mr horran about appearance with man in grey at shah room finally can ask mr barras to be present make explain hint in way everything will be cleared up matter can be placed upon proper basis clarice assented think idea be very good said quietly same fancy be exaggerating when say that uncle henry have to do with dreadful business of purple fern ackworth shrugged shoulder can best explain that be quite prepared to state on oath that saw mr horran with purple fern man at shah room of course a say may be exaggerating everything say may be explained by mr horran only can put thing right at point of conversation dr jerce returned to drawing room looking rather perturbed for so serene man be drawing on glove a entered where be ferdinand be first question a cast look round upstairs lying down said clarice remember yes yes jerce turned to door again know where room be must see before go glanced at watch will just have time for short conversation before catch three o'clock train excuse miss baird doctor stop stop what be matter with uncle henry be annoyed by mr clarke about loan asked clarice quickly jerce looked at astonished yes do know about mr clarke told said that did not want to see uncle henry about certainly did not said jerce decidedly clarke be always in difficulty horran have be very good to talking of incessant trouble must only irritate horran so must not allow to enter house seems that mr clarke slipped in through french window made trouble to day while chalk be out have promised to see clarke when return here again to arrange that interest of loan stand over for six month will give time to turn round a be wish have not forced way into sick room have done harm doctor about purple fern oh horran talked about have managed to set fear at rest think may be murdered so have told chalk to stay with night to morrow scotland yard people will take up matter will go to yard to night tell everything have discovered also will give in gold box a evidence think began ackworth when jerce cut short have time to talk said impatiently must see ferdinand then catch train a have much to do miss baird guardian be rather feverish with excitement have better not see to night to morrow will come down again with final instruction jerce slipped out of room clarice anthony looked at one will see uncle henry for said clarice determinedly better obey doctor instruction urged anthony after what have to say will keep until to morrow be so worried know darling know slipped arm round slender waist be best to settle perplexing business in ship shape way leave mr horran alone for to night clarice thought for few moment anthony said earnestly can not wait for day for explanation seems to that there can be none unless mr barras be present christmas be here in couple of day so want to go up to town bring down mr barras to morrow then can take into uncle henry room have explanation humph said anthony doubtfully seems to that if jerce go to scotland yard authority there may wish for explanation from mr horran not if hold tongue a to uncle henry being at shah room said anxiously want to shield know yet that be guilty reminded sharply ackworth nodded after have doubtful ground to go upon in connecting horran with criminal triumvirate whose trade mark be purple fern man might be entirely innocent notwithstanding appearance however if barras be honest lawyer on face of there be reason to think that be not must be able in presence of client to state if property of baird orphan be administered honourably if horran have be using money for own secret pleasure for loan to clarke others must be forced to account for same such forced explanation must inevitably compel to acknowledge deny that be at shah room when ackworth saw if confessed so much must also have to explain how came to know grey man who assuredly if gold box be to be accounted for have to do with purple fern crime then in one way matter might be explained be certainly mysterious enough at present in meantime lover postponed inevitable disagreeables in order to talk about own particular future to enjoy more went for short drive in ackworth dog cart have be waiting time at door in charge of mr horran groom anthony have not brought own servant so conversation of fiance be perfectly free unfettered a drove along high street dr jerce passed in earnest conversation with ferdinand expect be bringing brother to sens said ackworth hopefully hope will sighed clarice be not very fond of dr jerce be certainly good man example be one ferdy must follow wonder added musingly if ferdy ever saw uncle henry at shah room be just sort of fast place ferdy must go to anthony flicked horse ear with whip laughed have be there also said coolly perhaps must not have confessed a much to dear why not demanded clarice with perfect candour must not think cotton wool young woman quite understand that men be men that woman be angel questioned anthony bending to see pretty face leave for men to say returned clarice dryly man say of man doe not talk sense doe intend to have have enough of sense for day dearest sensible conversation invariably mean worry let enjoy golden hour without transmuting into dull lead miss baird who be feminine after very much in love young in year spirit thought that be excellent idea so rest of drive be must be desired in way of cheap genuine happiness when ended gave anthony russian tea in tumbler dainty caviare sandwich ferdy a learned from mr rebson have returned from railway station to enjoy golden hour at vicarage mr horran have again fallen asleep simple happiness over afternoon tea must not last for ever when anthony set out for gattlinsands after lingering farewell clarice felt reaction to prevent from feeling dull be necessary that must do something so true to intention of defying dr jerce tapped at door of sick room chalk appeared with whispered communication that patient be awake too fractious to see anyone on night clarice returned to drawing room read indolently until wentworth came to pay late visit at eight o'clock just a descended stair dressed for dinner miss baird caught young physician at door accosted at once be uncle henry better doctor asked coming forward wentworth be slim shy man who wore spectacle spoke in jerky staccato manner when addressed by woman better yes be more awake lethargy passed away very bad temper better leave alone until morning 'night miss baird shot off in confusion like timid schoolboy clarice made hurried meal returned drearily to empty drawing room without desire to encounter fractiousness of guardian have experienced on more than one occasion after somewhat exciting day really felt worn out in need of rest therefore made up mind to retire comparatively early however hoped that ferdy must come home soon to explain absence from dinner table passed time in playing patience until ten o'clock finally after asking mr rebson if house be locked up if ferdy have returned have not ascended stair to bed at top of found ferdy clinging to banister apparently have entered house without mr rebson knowledge oh said clarice perceiving condition again ferdy chuckled have be s ' v ' y h l b't'fly pretty girl jwilly ev'ning such fun be be here missed one step rolled down two with idiotic giggle clarice must have struck in disgust must have done good being prompt powerful young woman caught by collar of coat dragged into bedroom on first floor there locked in while ferdy protested weakly time only yielded to superior force faugh said clarice throwing key on dressing table what weak fool be sat down stared at reflection of face in louis quinze mirror looked weary drawn will be old woman soon if sort of thing go on thought oh dear how tired be of bearing other people burden must end in way will get truth out of uncle henry settle money matter marry anthony wash hand of everything a to ferdy will marry to prudence let look after having thus arranged future retired to rest not to sleep since brain be much too active for slumber tossed turned sighed wearily at interval a hour dragged on to midnight only on hearing church clock strike twelve did begin to lose consciousness finally thankfully sank into deep slumber lasted for hour towards dawn a be often case with worried people began to dream in confused broken way purple fern very naturally since be in mind mingled with fleeting vision fled so seemed through dark street of nightmare length pursued by man in grey who assumed monstrous proportion caught at end of interminable mile so dreamed with gasping horror stabbed to heart then felt mark of purple fern mark indeed of beast a might be stamped on forehead afterwards half awake half asleep only in dream be dead felt being placed in narrow coffin heard hammering of nail closed in for ever ever ever with violent effort broke nightmare bond woke in cold perspiration to see cold faint dawn glimmering behind window blind horrible feeling to hear knocking continue not on dream coffin blow came on bedroom door steady persistent terrifying heard name called in quavering voice sprang out of bed confused dazed wrapping dressing gown round somewhat recovering sens hastily unlocked door invariably kept closed during hour of sleep on threshold stood chalk white shaking with chattering teeth trembling hand miss miss stammered then fled down stair unable to get out word sick with fear clarice followed in disordered attire came to horran room on bed lay body of sick man with cruel wound in breast be stiff cold dead murdered on chill forehead be infernal mark of purple fern chapter ix inquest mr horran be a dead a door nail there must be doubt about while chalk shivered wrung hand in middle of room demoralised helpless clarice bent over bed in dazed manner must scarcely grasp situation notwithstanding that have be foreshadowed a be by mystery of grey man without doubt be assassin sinister omen of purple fern have be fulfilled eighth victim have be struck down forehead bore infernal trade mark of triumvirate no longer existed one of member have be hanged have died from natural cause survivor alfred osip of rough lane stepney have accomplished alone accursed work three have undertaken be sent away explained valet with chattering teeth by master at eleven o'clock a must not let sit up with

have found unfortunate man sound asleep having taken assegai from collection of barbaric weapon on wall have turned down clothes to stab victim with surer aim there be sign of struggle even clarice untutored sens told that henry horran have be foully murdered in sleep how have assassin entered window wheeled round with set face stretched out arm window be open said in dry cracking voice yes miss whispered chalk dr wentworth saw master after dr jerce went away opened window a usual fool cried clarice furiously recollecting jerce precaution in face of warning have made two mistake must have obeyed dr jerce in sitting up night with mr horran window according to direction must have be closed told about window before miss said chalk doggedly let doctor do what liked a ai place to advise medical men a to sitting up dr jerce told to do so master insisted must leave about eleven a usual how can obey asked little man tearfully ask that miss knew danger what danger miss master have slept with window open off on for three year ever since dr wentworth came to look after said be to be open dr jerce always wanted to be shut let do what liked must have remained night with mr horran said clarice remembering that chalk knew nothing about warning of purple fern need of especial supervision with royal bengal tiger miss wailed chalk for be what master be last night never saw so cross never seemed to have something on mind went on awful what did say asked miss baird thinking horran utterance might shed light on darkness ca tell miss be swearing for most part made go to bed laughed when declared that dr jerce told to sit up with how did leave sitting up in bed swearing with window open be ajar a dr wentworth left explained valet cautiously dr jerce closed in day dr wentworth opened when left about eight o'clock last night did hear noise in room during night now how must miss complained little man in injured tone seeing that bedroom be at back of house that sleep like top

echoed valet starting why be man who be going to stop at mr dump savoy hotel few day ago did what day be that asked clarice quickly chalk searched memory mentioned very evening when dr jerce have be searched on terrace there be longer doubt in clarice mind what horran have be killed by osip why so inoffensive man must be thus cruelly put out of way must not conjecture however theorising must not help so moved away from bed with sigh tried to recover composure have better go at once for police chalk said rapidly meanwhile will rouse up brother servant be already up miss do know miss just cast one glance then flew up to miss why not to master ferdinand because miss always look to for order said valet respectfully about body miss touch touch anything said clarice warningly be necessary that

proceeding after jury have inspected corpse few brief remark regarding nature of death heinousness of crime introduced fussy inspector tick with sheaf of note dealing with up to date evidence tick described appearance of dead man described state of room hinted at open window laid before jury deadly assegai with death wound have in human probability be inflicted then inspector reverted to appearance of man in grey at savoy hotel under name of alfred osip related what dr jerce have said about struggle on terrace afterwards mentioned finding of envelope containing representation of purple fern discovery by miss baird of gold box finished by again drawing attention of jury to fact of open window to finding of dead man by chalk not being orator inspector tick spoke with hesitation set forth fact dryly be so interesting that lack of ornamentation be not apparent mr dump be first witness called by inspector deposed in shrill voice with many word alfred so man in grey called came to savoy hotel have paid for bed breakfast dinner after making inquiry about inhabitant of crumel especially about in deceased house laurel on plea that thought of settling in town mr osip have departed have never returned there be nothing in osip talk declared mr dump gave hint that contemplated murder have not reappeared at savoy hotel there be nothing further to be gained from mr dump so be requested to stand aside did unwillingly enough a liked publicity of position dr jerce followed next described how man in grey presumably alfred have searched on terrace of laurel explained that probably wanted letter given to witness by sick man in tea street whitechapel jerce also stated that letter have be handed by to scotland yard authority in london have made inquiry result of must be explained to jury by mr sims detective now present coroner asked few question regarding deceased illness open window of jerce answered in detail explained cause of disease a gathered from post mortem

witness by assegai be produced by inspector tick murder according to condition stiffness of body must have taken place between hour of one two o'clock in morning doctor finally stated that have be life long friend of deceased never knew to have enemy dr wentworth evidence be much same a of jerce held to fresh air although dr jerce preferred patient to have warmth so have opened window just before left deceased at eight o'clock in evening deceased be fractious uneasy on evening have assigned reason for such uneasiness witness took to be connected with mysterious illness that illness have now be explained by post mortem examination samuel chalk deposed to being valet of mr henry horran stated that at request of deceased have retired to bed although instructed to sit up by dr jerce that deceased have be so angry witness declared that must have obeyed doctor order a be judged best to humour master lest worse must happen window be certainly open when left room a witness have not touched according to custom when be set ajar by dr wentworth at eight o'clock witness have not taken notice of arm on wall on evening so must not say if assegai be in place never saw about room until found on floor mr horran dead in bed with wound in breast coroner did deceased notice open window witness sometimes window be open sometimes shut mr horran never troubled about in way coroner have suspicion deceased wished to leave night in order to see someone witness no be swearing in bed when left coroner did lock door of bedroom witness no door of bedroom be never locked juryman did hear noise outside led to believe that someone might be lurking about witness sir coroner knew nothing of purple fern business witness miss baird never told did dr jerce if have known must have stopped in room notwithstanding master bad temper coroner mr horran be not alarmed apprehensive witness not in least be in bad temper wished to leave so did coroner do know why deceased be in bad temper witness rev mr clarke have called in afternoon after left mr horran be very cross a be good tempered up till mr clarke visit suppose mr clarke put out in way coroner gave instruction that mr clarke must be called a witness since have not be done meanwhile clarice baird deposed that deceased be guardian have be ill with mysterious disease for ten year more le usually be good tempered did not see on

business witness also stated how have found gold box have handed to dr jerce who have taken along with picture of purple fern letter given to by sick man of tea street whitechapel to scotland yard deceased have seemed much agitated when found picture of purple fern in unaddressed envelope outside window have never gone into detail about matter have not found opportunity of speaking to on subject a matter of fact deceased have fallen asleep while talking of picture of fern witness have picked up beyond that be agitated witness have reason to believe that mr horran expected to be murdered still since other seven death connected with purple fern have always be preceded by same warning be possible that mr horran be in dread of violent death witness also stated that have heard noise cry during night indeed have known nothing of crime until chalk valet came up to lead down to scene of tragedy from disposition of bedclothes fancied that deceased must have be stabbed in sleep before have time to wake call out witness have told valet to leave room exactly a be when found by have then sent for police coroner when found box did see deceased about witness sir mr horran be asleep for hour hour have opportunity coroner must have done so have deceased be awake witness certainly dr jerce re called said that have not related finding of gold box to deceased since be already in state of nervous excitement owing to visit of mr clarke witness intended to wait until mr horran be more composed then be intention to tell about golden box about osip be such detail a be in letter given to by young man who died in tea street dr jerce stated that have placed evidence in hand of scotland yard authority on same night that went up that have intended to come down next day relate everything to deceased whom hoped to find more composed when arrived at crumel railway station ended witness found that poor friend have be murdered mr clarke hastily summoned from vicarage then put in appearance stated that have received money from mr horran through solicitor mr barras have long wished to see mr horran on matter of interest be overdue for payment of witness be being pressed dr jerce must not allow witness to see mr horran because mr horran health be delicate according to dr jerce must have be detrimental to condition to worry with business witness however be passing laurel saw french window of mr horran bedroom open therefore slipped in on impulse of moment mr horran have expressed a angry about thousand pound loan a declared that have not given mr barras leave to lend money at rate of ten per cent have told witness that must write to barras must see witness in few day about matter telling not to worry in meantime deceased certainly appeared to be very much annoyed witness expressed regret that have not obeyed dr jerce wish have refrained from paying visit only excuse be that have slipped into bedroom on impulse of moment on seeing window open from lane coroner can see window from lane witness certainly very plainly coroner did leave deceased in bad temper witness so bad that be sorry in interest of peace have paid visit coroner did mr horran express fear of being killed witness not word coroner did touch on fact of purple fern murder witness sir never mentioned only conversed with for twenty minute then be about own business coroner suggested that mr barras must be called lawyer have not come down from town a be away on holiday must not return for few day have be telegraphed for to paris where be spending holiday inspector pointed out that evidence given by mr barras must not bear on crime with coroner disagreed mr barras said coroner might be able to explain why lent mr clarke money without leave of deceased inspector tick possibly sir must have bearing on case in hand be here sir not to search into deceased private affair to learn why be killed who killed coroner inquiry into past life of deceased may reveal why be murdered again inspector disagreed with again coroner objected so there be wrangle lasted for minute finally inspector tick being more obstinate of two be agreed that inquest must not be postponed a coroner have suggested for presence of lawyer barras last witness called be thomas sims smiling little jewish faced man from scotland yard with olive complexion pair of dark inquisitive eye deposed that apartment in rough lane stepney have be searched by police osip having probably taken alarm have cleared out everything likely to incriminate young man who have died of consumption in tea street whitechapel attended by dr jerce out of kindness might might not have be connected with purple fern crime only evidence connected with be that have accurately described alfred osip sole evidence associated osip with young man with murder be gold box have be found by miss baird also be probable that a osip according to mr dump to dr jerce have be in crumel short time before have left warning of pictured fern outside window of deceased effort have be made to find osip without result from time have searched dr jerce on terrace of laurel have disappeared according to ticket collector porter official at crumel railway station osip have not even returned to london from station be possible that after searching dr jerce man have walked to next station benleigh to escape pursuit must dr jerce have given alarm juryman why did dr jerce give alarm dr jerce arose to explain be permitted to do so by coroner although rising be out of order ran after man said calmly a soon a must pull together have disappeared mr ferdinand baird who came up suggested that police must be called in when described man a having scar on left cheek then remembered letter dying patient in whitechapel have given with instruction to open must be attacked by such man judged best to return to london open letter before taking action went to scotland yard a soon a learned that osip be connected with purple fern crime more must not do must have given man in charge for assault insisted juryman doubtless replied jerce ironically did not wish to make scandal in friend house moreover since deceased health be extremely delicate must have be injurious to to be disturbed by account of struggle on terrace that must have learned have called police to laurel one must deny what jerce have acted sensibly juryman still holding to opinion be crushed if osip have be arrested at time of assault muttered juryman must not have have murder how be to know good sir that man osip contemplated murder letter received from tea street man be not opened by until returned to town after assault then went at once to scotland yard retorted jerce juryman retired from contest coroner then summed up evidence a clearly concisely a must bearing in mind observed purple fern murder presence of osip who be clearly connected with same above remembering fatal mark on forehead of deceased there must be doubt that crime be eighth of fatal series one of criminal who have perpetrated terrible assassination have be hanged have died from consumption third alfred osip be still alive have undoubtedly stabbed henry horran be proved by fact that usual warning have be given by mean of pictured fern window according to mr clarke must be seen from lane so without doubt osip lurking therein have seen that window be open a light be in room waiting until small hour of morning when victim must presumably be asleep have entered killed unfortunate gentleman coroner ended speech with request that juryman must bring in verdict in accordance with weight of evidence plainly pointed to alfred osip a criminal jury did so very promptly a not one of not one of listener to evidence have doubt that osip be guilty person therefore after bringing in verdict of wilful murder against alfred osip inquest be brought to end juryman very well satisfied with went home although verdict have be given criminal be still at large now that have commenced operation in crumel be doubtful when must stop locksmith of crumel did fine trade during next few day a everyone wanted bolt bar patent lock ingenious alarm quiet little essex town be terribly scared by presence of unseen beast of prey during inquest clarice looking round to see who be present noticed fashionably dressed young lady with wonderful complexion copper coloured hair at once recognised a notorious butterfly sarah zara dump be seated by mother greatly resembled elder woman mouth be firmer eye be more deep set notwithstanding boldness of appearance frivolity of attire nevertheless looked clever quite capable of dominating weaker nature of ferdy baird once twice butterfly met grave gaze of clarice rather to latter surprise immediately dropped eye with quick flush be strange considering known boldness of girl clarice wondered what might mean when inquest be over juryman be leaving house along with rest of crowd clarice noticed girl again be chatting in low voice to ferdy while mr dump sailed ahead with coroner explaining how must have managed case rather annoyed that brother must thus publicly flaunt acquaintance with so notorious young woman clarice pressed through throng in order to touch ferdy arm draw away before must carry out purpose single sentence falling from lip of zara made change mind butterfly lip be almost touching ferdy ear spoke in low rapid voice sufficiently loudly for keen eared miss baird to overhear now that osip be accused whispered zara softly there can be danger chapter xi dog clarice quite intended to ask ferdy be meaning of zara strange remark other thing took up attention for time being forgot saying a regard murder of course clarice one else thought that there be mystery about death of mr horran undoubtedly osip have killed in due accordance with tradition of purple fern only in instance be difficult to guess why crime have be committed on inoffensive man other seven victim men woman have be selected for wealth in case body have be robbed of jewellery house of dead when especial murder took place in house have be looted in case of horran nothing have be stolen therefore robbery a in other case must not be motive for crime however clarice did not trouble head much about matter although fact of mr horran according to ackworth having be in company of osip at shah room curious observation of zara to ferdy might have urged to make enquiry still there be mystery about death save want of motive therefore there be nothing to unravel horran be dead hue cry be out against assassin two day after inquest funeral took place owing to publicity of death respect in horran be held by fellow townsman there be great crowd at cemetery ferdy acted a chief mourner along with dr jerce life long friend of deceased mr clarke read burial service clarice according to custom stopped at home while unfortunate guardian be being laid in untimely grave be then that remembered zara observation wondered anew what meant did girl mean that now osip be accused there must be no danger to ferdy clarice asked question without receiving answer from consciousness fact of murder be sufficiently plain save a to motive so in case have nothing to do with ferdy moreover if zara meant that ferdy be implicated in matter on face of seemed absurd such accusation if made must be rebutted by clarice herself since have locked ferdy in room on night when purposeless crime be committed miss baird used word purposeless because must not conjecture why horran must have be killed in so tragic manner unless of course motive for committal of crime be connected with horran acquaintanceship with osip why dead man have be at shah room in osip company be yet to be explained only assassin must give reason for secret visit to london be not likely to come forward considering that there be price on head clarice at suggestion of dr jerce have offered reward of two hundred pound for apprehension of man in grey london detective sims have gone back to town with firm determination to win sum of money admitted to miss baird with rueful smile that be like looking for needle in haystack to capture remaining member of purple fern triumvirate a yet barras have not put in appearance although have be expected to be present at funeral telegram from stated that must be down immediately afterwards must come to laurel to read will of deceased there have be difficulty in finding mr barras in paris only at eleventh hour have returned to england meanwhile clarice in deep mourning sat in drawing room waiting for arrival of solicitor for return of funeral party ackworth have not come over to attend a stern duty compelled to go to southampton with draft of men for india promised to return a soon a be able clarice anxiously expected a have much to say about property about marriage especially about latter a since death of horran dr jerce have too openly displayed interest in girl be therefore necessary to put end to doctor hope by announcing engagement to captain ackworth while clarice thought of thing mr rebson at elbow kept up cheerful conversation about truth enshrined in page of domestic prophet one thing come true miss said briskly only hope other wo what other asked miss baird listlessly why disgrace miss have death to elderly man who must have be beware of midnight hour death by knife too only be assegai retorted clarice scornfully prophet made mistake in weapon domestic prophet doe condescend to tell everything said mr rebson much offended ca say what murder have taken place sighed girl poor uncle henry have have death sorrow went on housekeeper relentlessly disgrace have still to come disgrace what nonsense so said before miss scoff when know what be happened disgrace must come a domestic prophet plainly say turned over few page cleared throat to read if crime of nature have be committed by person during month of december january february that person if hanged will assuredly bring disgrace on nearest dearest to let degenerate beware say seer oh what rubbish mr rebson put book in pocket took spectacle off nose rose in stately manner death have come said in most scathing voice sorrow have come scoffed at being hard of heart now disgrace will befall house how can asked clarice impatiently osip doe belong to house to disgrace fall on since be guilty mr rebson have answer for so retreated with dignity faith in domestic prophet still unshaken mark word miss clarice disgrace be coming with left room much to relief of miss baird who be very weary of gimcrack saying pinchbeck philosophy mr rebson set such store by scarcely have mr rebson departed when ferdy entered by window looked tall slim in deep mourning very well content with grief for guardian who have be so kind to be apparently swallowed up by reflection that must soon be enjoying two thousand year first glance round drawing room be in search of barras where be that lawyer chap asked ferdy producing cigarette have not arrived yet replied clarice rather disgusted at want of feeling how can talk so ferdy when poor uncle henry be just buried tell about funeral there be nothing to tell said ferdy flinging into most comfortable armchair be much same a other funeral have heart ferdy money retorted youth coolly will soon be remedied thank heaven clarice must not help smiling to herself in spite of grief when thought of how ferdy must be disappointed then occurred to that have especial desire in wanting money so badly pending arrival of lawyer asked question suppose want two thousand year in order to marry prudence perhaps said ferdy cautiously perhaps echoed sister raising angrily why have proposed to prudence know love prudence same proposal doe invariably mean marriage oh said clarice in disgust then still hanker after zara ferdy lighted cigarette calmly know what be talking about observed obstinately mr rebson say that be always at savoy hotel have better mind own business interfering old cat be ferdy retort besides zara doe always live there life in town so do know ferdy dare say see lot of there oh have jerce told so be certain that be familiar with be indeed said ferdy in aggravating tone on what ground since be so clever clarice leaned forward heard zara say to immediately after inquest that a osip be accused there must be no danger time ferdy be startled dropped cigarette bent down to pick up to hide sudden rush of colour came to cheek did hear anything else asked hesitating want to know meaning of sentence did hear ferdy rose paced drawing room shrugging shoulder what inquisitive girl be said carelessly zara only meant that a osip be accused there must be no danger of other murder being committed sounded plausible enough explanation yet clarice doubted truth be not meaning said impetuously what be meaning then asked ferdy sharply know unless meant that be free from danger what do mean by asked ferdy angrily dropped cigarette again do think have anything to do with death of uncle henry certainly not seeing that locked up in room on night same must be at surprised if knew man osip that have influenced in way know osip from moses said ferdy doggedly saw of be glimpse on night searched jerce then be only casual glance when passing in high street how must possibly know blighter uncle henry might have introduced ferdy wheeled round in genuine amazement uncle henry be out of sens clarry know uncle henry never went out of room for year year certainly man in grey never came to laurel until time searched jerce do know shah room ferdy yes sometimes go there snapped ferdy unhesitatingly go there very often expect said sister bitterly well then anthony went there what scoffed ferdy immaculate anthony be more immaculate than other man besides when be there couple three month ago be not then engaged to anthony saw uncle henry with man osip ferdy went quite white anthony must be mistaken anthony did know osip at time doe know now know look of man person with uncle henry at shah room be tall slim man with criss cross scar on left cheek be osip true enough muttered ferdy judging from glimpse caught of in high street in bad light be quite absurd to say that uncle henry be at shah room know that disease prevented from leaving room did not know what disease be at time said clarice coolly there may be mistake a say anthony be too keen eyed to make one did ever see uncle henry in town never did did ever see osip not in town said ferdy truthfully saw in high street on night when jerce be searched look here clarry let have understanding if please do accuse of accuse of nothing interrupted clarice rising trifle wearily only observation of zara have explained that in lame way be certain that know nothing about murder ferdy a be locked in how dare how dare burst out young man furiously red angry even to hint at such thing be insult to be not saint same be not devil excite ferdy know osip be guilty that blame attache to fail to see why zara must have made observation to go ask snapped ferdy rudely speak to person of sort said clarice icily be good decent pretty hard working girl what array of adjective never said that be not wish to know desire to know be suggested by chance observation overheard be be acquainted with osip be in way influenced by osip be not how dare suggest silly thing a to uncle henry having be at shah room be sheer rubbish clarice walked thoughtfully to window dare say be worrying unnecessarily observed there be mystery about uncle henry death anthony may have made mistake do make anxious ferdy dear with wild way be so unsophisticated that fear lest must be led astray be quite able to look after fumed young man again producing cigarette case that unfailing resource in embarrassment sister sighed somehow in everything that ferdy said did there lurked doubtful note on reflection must not confess that seemed ridiculous to think that ferdy knew assassin only for overheard whisper clarice must never have started so futile conversation now wished to end by confessing fault beg pardon ferdy said quietly anxiety for must be excuse before ferdy must accept apology kiss a seemed inclined to do there be furious barking outside angry voice of man clarice stepped out on to terrace there be jane at dr jerce again said hastily went to rescue jerce with very white angry face be repelling with umbrella assault of tawny dog of mongrel collie specie with savage white teeth blazing topaz eye jane a animal be called cherished deep hatred for jerce notwithstanding that have be former master have presented to miss baird on occasion attacked be usually shut up when doctor be expected that jane be lame in left hind leg did not prevent from making furious dart at jerce until clarice caught deftly by collar damned dog will be death of said jerce when jane handed over to ferdy be dragged away growling snapping beg pardon for swearing miss baird be very sorry doctor said clarice leading way back to drawing room jane be shut up a usual must have got loose while groom be at funeral wonder why hate so know said jerce seating recovering calmness get on first rate with dog jane never did like gave to miss baird because never must be friend with devil beg pardon again be quite sure that jane will kill day nonsense bark be worse than bite then hope wo bark again be ungrateful beast picked up in whitechapel on wet day streaming with water starving with hunger have good home with until temper made get rid of perhaps lameness make fractious said clarice jane be really good tempered dog a rule lameness echoed jerce after pause then smiled in odd way why yes miss baird might have something to do with temper however now that be tied up shut up mean said ferdy who have now returned let say disposed of observed doctor genially end subject well dear miss baird added gently now that dear friend have be buried must learn how thing be to be arranged mr barras will tell said clarice glancing at french clock on mantelpiece have not yet come will be here in few moment said jerce cheerily saw walking up high street ah a there came sharp ring at front door there be do want to remain yes do urged clarice ferdy must like to be present at reading of will be best friend must like to be something nearer dearer breathed jerce a door opened clarice rose to welcome lawyer pretended that have not heard guessed that have from flush coloured fair face by time barras be shaking hand with two young people bowed politely to famous doctor be glad be here sir observed sitting down laying aside black bag want to ask question what be demanded jerce looking surprised knew late client mr horran intimately yes for year year be at school college together then must know know what asked jerce still more astonished if late client mr horran be honest man scoundrel chapter xii business affair astonished silence ensued lawyer observation be so very unexpected that one knew exactly how to reply mr barras did not look like man inclined to jest being lean faced dour clean shaven with thin lipped mouth scanty iron grey hair severe black eye peered sternly at world from under shaggy grey eyebrow constantly appeared to hold attitude of hanging judge sentencing criminal to gallows barras be not popular with fellow have name of extremely honest man be supposed to be aggressively just also be deliberately cautious in expressing opinion therefore be scarcely to be wondered at late remark considerably startled three people who have assembled to hear will read being woman clarice be first of trio to recover use of tongue spoke indignantly what do mean by mr barras demanded breathlessly exactly what say miss baird must have remark that addressed to dr jerce here who have not yet replied take by surprise barras said jerce with shrug can reply be that horran be most strictly honest man of acquaintance have not be so late mr baird must hardly have chosen a executor a guardian of child exactly said lawyer again opened portentous black bag question be may not late mr baird have be mistaken a to true character of man own client said clarice indignantly be man a well a lawyer retorted barras coldly still uncle henry whom one liked popularity implies weakness to mind miss baird strength have enemy have always found what do think ferdy asked clarice staggered by lawyer air of conviction about uncle henry oh be rot be one of best even though did get on over well there mr barras said clarice with air of triumph took notice of produced from bag sheaf of important looking document have better read will said barras coldly one moment broke in jerce a barras unfolded sheet of parchment with judicial air must tell about death have heard everything interrupted lawyer mounting golden pince nez have read be to be read in paper think think that late client be eighth victim of purple fern series murdered by surviving villain motive questioned miss baird suddenly same motive brought about death of other victim be solicitor cold reply wealth if like robbery agree with nothing be taken from room how do know because know everything be in room nothing be missing be plain enough on face of admitted barras think that can show error do mean to say that motive for uncle henry murder be robbery asked ferdy sitting up from lounging attitude do have good reason to say so then explain said clarice curtly secretly bewildered be about to do so if will permit said barras with most acid smile beg pardon go on mr barras made short explanation before reading will a thought be about to do parent began looking at twin mr mr baird lived at tremby hall short distance out of town mr baird died left property came to about four thousand year more le solely to wife mother when died property be handed over to late client mr henry horran who acted a guardian for received under late mr baird will five hundred year be much needed by mr horran a be then desperately poor how do know questioned clarice listening intently be mr baird lawyer afterwards became mr horran said iron grey man severely so speak of what know mr horran a have just explained received five hundred year a guardian have also seeing that be infant so to speak complete control of property be be left two thousand year be arranged that must come into possession at age of twenty five meanwhile mr horran be to look after educate guide did said clarice with emotion although ferdy did not openly second speech wriggled uneasily at five hundred year

of four thousand year divided equally mr baird receive at age of twenty five two thousand year miss baird also at age of twenty five receive same sum annually yes yes said jerce who appeared to be irritated by minute way in lawyer be detailing everything of course there be accumulation on income of four thousand year for let see twenty year up to present be whole point remarked barras solemnly will come to point shortly mr baird be allowed two hundred year from age of twenty be for last three year yes snapped ferdy little enough be quite understand that seeing be young gay said lawyer drily well then for three year have be receiving allowance come may tell from letting of tremby hall to american so see of that income of mr ferdinand baird coming from outside source so to speak leaf four thousand year intact clarice heaved weary sigh why explain asked know most part of quite so said barras deliberately know what be about to tell if will permit to speak girl looked at hard there seemed to be great deal lurking behind solicitor manner go on please said apprehensively when dr jerce refers to accumulation on income of four thousand year for twenty year continued mr barras must not forget besides five hundred per annum to mr horran there be also sum required for education for keep of house for clothing of child allude to two added barras looking over pince nez ferdy nodded understand so doe clarry now then said mr barras having reached point will read will a doubt understand exactly how monies stand be how be left by late mother understand about accumulation protested clarice be coming to said lawyer significantly allow to conduct conversation in own way so a to make everything plain will listen will of mr henry horran have nothing to leave burst out ferdy said so did not exactly say so said barras deliberately be fact since five hundred year ceased at mr horran death seeing that must not longer continue duty a guardian certainly have nothing to leave will of late mr baird gave power to appoint new guardian what shame cried ferdy flushing clarry be old enough to handle own money possibly will must stand said barras drily after a will see new guardian be best must be appointed from what have seen of young lady bowed to clarice from frequency with have come into contact with since mr horran illness be quite sure that better appointment must not have be made ferdy started what have clarry to do with demanded angrily barras took notice read will of horran be short to point containing few legacy to servant disposal of jewellery to friend appointment of clarice baird to post of guardian horran death must leave vacant ferdy must scarcely contain wrath when barras ceased do mean to say that clarry have be appointed over head asked white with rage over head when be man do say so said barras quietly in opinion seeing what know of miss baird be excellent suggestion be shame must have be made guardian ferdy clarice pulled fuming youth down into chair with strong hand can talk of later meanwhile a appointment have be made can hing will see lawyer will go into court will can hing said jerce calmly soothingly horran have full right to appoint whom chose if thought that miss baird be most suitable person must accept decision ferdy sat down silenced for once in royal rage clarice laid hand on arm jerked angrily away whereupon look of pain passed over face will not find hard guardian said softly then a still remained sullen turned to barras be there arrangement made a to where will live asked answered solicitor replacing will in bag can live here wherever like will give complete control of four thousand year until reach age of twenty five in two year when will of course give brother half income then a know guardianship cease wo have clarice a guardian cried ferdy wrathfully must said girl in firm tone what be use of going on like ferdy will be good one in law very excellent will said barras primly great responsibility for miss baird said jerce quietly be perfectly well able to bear doctor replied sharply see here said young baird suddenly rousing from brown study will give clarice control of four thousand year yes answered barras of course allowance of two hundred can continue still arising from letting of hall well then went on ferdy rapidly will so far a can see so far a tell doe not say anything about accumulation on four thousand during last twenty year on two thousand if please mr baird said barras leisurely forget that late mr horran received five hundred for service be annually that rest of two thousand be required for various item have mentioned remember said ferdy hastily well then accumulation on two thousand year for twenty year must be in bank invested free from clarice control no by will miss baird must deal with accumulation a well a with income for next two year receives four thousand year what doe not spend having full power under will can let out at interest oh said clarice quickly then two thousand of united income be let out at interest by mr horran ca tell miss baird must have be insisted clarice for mr clarke late client certainly allowed loan of one thousand pound year ago at ten per cent said barras politely be loan know of rest of money what money asked jerce suddenly two thousand year uncle henry did not spend even if nothing be done with amount in twenty year must increase to forty thousand pound must be given to put in ferdy quickly seeing that clarry have full income half of be in trust for mr baird said barras in dry way accumulation miss baird added addressing clarice certainly amount to sum mention if monies be let out at same rate of interest late client extorted from mr clarke amount in bank ought to be much greater unfortunately mr barras stopped hesitated well asked clarice impatiently well money be in bank have book of late mr horran business paper in instance can find what have done with forty thousand pound with possible accumulation jerce started up in dismay be reason why asked if horran be scoundrel demanded be reason replied barras serenely want to know what have become of money think can guess however can guess repeated clarice puzzled yes wondered why mr horran be murdered answer for sum of forty thousand pound barras said so quietly that took away breath of hearer looked at one unable to speak seeing barras explained still further collected rent of baird property said two thousand year paid into london bank according to direction of mr horran that can account for by book paper since went in mr horran income a guardian in keeping up house in educational clothing expense remaining two thousand year paid personally to mr horran a came in never accounted to for use there be reason that must do so added lawyer coolly seeing that mr horran have full power under mr baird will to deal with estate a chose certainly judging from mr clarke loan came under notice fancied that mr horran might be investing money letting out at large interest can find nothing in paper left by deceased likely to throw light on disposal be most extraordinary said clarice thoughtfully do mean to say mr barras uncle henry have forty thousand pound in room when died barras placed finger tip together leaned back leave to miss baird mr horran always insisted must bring to two thousand year of rent in gold always according to wish paid in gold sent up paper from desk of course have business letter deed rest of such thing in office in case can find what have become of forty thousand pound when saw in paper cause must be assigned for murder of late client recollected that purple fern villain always struck down rich dawned upon that instead of investing two thousand year regularly received in gold emphasised lawyer mr horran kept money in room be murdered for possession why must have kept money in room instead of at bank must say mr barras shrugged shoulder again well late client must have be miser be explanation can give be certain that be murdered for sake of forty thousand pound that have be stolen now dr jerce will understand why asked if friend be honest man scoundrel honest man said jerce energetically have supplied reason for money being missed horran may have be miser although never noticed that be may have kept money in room may have be murdered for must have observe doctor said barras dryly that sentence commence with beay be theory if money have be stolen suggested clarice may be traced in way ca trace gold miss baird horran always insisted upon having money in gold be what make think that be miser called scoundrel if spent money on own pleasure certainly be scoundrel if on other hand merely kept gold to enjoy looking at be stolen from at time of death be simply miser have paid by painful end for being miser however barras stood up there be more to be said think have made plain miss baird whenever like to come to office will talk over future money arrangement meanwhile must prove will pay death duty legacy put thing straight will now take leave will not stop to tea dinner mr barras thank said lawyer stiffly taking up bag walked in stately manner out of house ferdy rose after hesitating for moment ran after quickly jerce clarice be left alone what will do asked jerce slowly must ask anthony said clarice mechanically captain ackworth anthony repeated quietly man intend to marry chapter xiii new epoch dr jerce looked at clarice with lowering face expressive eye flashed with anger be strong willed man accustomed to having own way in face of obstacle merest hint of opposition annoyed having set heart on marrying miss baird be determined to bring about match notwithstanding hint of refusal have given while horran be alive determination remained unchanged to be sure have then be ignorant of engagement with ackworth have calculated upon easier conquest of objection now that knew affection be engaged saw clearly that must be extremely difficult for to achieve purpose clarice a knew be weak girl to be talked into surrender for jerce attempted to bend to will doctor be too clever man to give way to bad temper knowing that weakness might lose prize aimed at inwardly angry be outwardly calm after first swift look of annoyance regained suavity doe captain ackworth know that intend to marry asked jerce politely clarice threw back head haughtily certainly have proposed to be engaged since when may ask may ask be not bound to answer be oldest friend miss baird now that poor horran be dead clarice lifted eyebrow still fail to see that being old friend give right to cross examine about thing concern concern great deal that must be happy said jerce disconcerted by calmness then can set mind at rest doctor be happy jerce looked down at neat boot must have thought that girl of strong character must have chosen otherwise really said clarice indifferently in fact stammered jerce flushing thought of offering a husband oh saw that long ago doctor have pity upon why must have pity asked clarice with perceptible smile have not played coquette with said jerce bitterly be bound to say that at first hint gave of feeling recoiled have since held at arm length seeing be engaged be a must be jerce bit lip angered that must be so calm so completely mistress of herself there be hope for suppose inquired with great humility none anthony be man love anthony will be husband perhaps said jerce under breath heard why do say that asked abruptly there be many slip cup lip be very well known proverb doctor doe not explain what mean then will permit to speak plainer if be wise will not said clarice quietly be good friend doctor why must become stranger must never be stranger to said fervently oh think so if chose must choose certainly if must not accept situation can not cried jerce emotion getting better of judgment be man feel like man for year have loved for long time have wished to make wife spoke to horran be agreeable must marry indeed cried clarice with flush of anger then permit to remind doctor that mr horran much a loved have not right to dispose of hand go with heart be possessed by captain ackworth said jerce bitterly exactly leave nothing to be desired in way of explanation ackworth be not worthy of urged doctor really in what way jerce be puzzled how to reply knew next to nothing about captain ackworth doe look a if have brain ah look be deceptive sometimes now doctor look a though have common sense yet conversation at present doe reveal that quality be hard clarice thought that be not going to call clarice until have right wish to acquire right be too late come doctor said clarice tired of quibbling be useless to prolong conversation there be more important thing to talk about than marriage after a have reminded be entirely own affair let agree to be friend held out hand smiling jerce did not take can be nothing le than husband said drawing down long upper lip obstinately in case doctor may a well part for ever for ever jerce started to foot much agitated oh clarice mean that love adore worship doubt may seem ridiculous to that man of age must speak like schoolboy must show deepest feeling so plainly have have lonely life be world to send away without hope only say that day in sweet hour can come take hand in mine clarice rose also eye sparkled with anger be mad to talk in way cried passionately how can say what want to say when be engaged when love be rich pleaded jerce eagerly have great name have heard that name will be included in list of new year honour will be sir daniel jerce will be mr ackworth interrupted clarice imperiously not word more doctor mind be made up so be mine said jerce with snarl face livid eye hard will not marry man who will prevent asked clarice with superb disdain who will prevent from becoming anthony wife will will become wife if there be not man in world must decline that honour let remind that be school girl to be frightened by stage thunder how dare how dare clarice stamped foot clenched hand go away never come near again jerce remained silent for one moment then without word took up hat walked slowly to door only when have opened stood with handle in hand did speak will go away said with steady look at girl will not return until summon when door closed clarice sank back in seat overwhelmed with emotion have small sympathy for doctor since have merely cried like child for moon knew be entirely beyond reach last word impressed with sense of danger wondered what meant by sudden obedience have defied remained to argue must have felt safer dr jerce a knew be too strong man to give in without struggle that must do so in instance be ominous in word of french proverb have recoiled to spring higher yet clarice must not see how must harm anthony in way be now own mistress free from supervision of kind horran death be mystery although murderer be still at large must certainly be caught sooner later ferdy here clarice rose again face grew white what if jerce must harm by harming ferdy jerce knew about boy fast life jerce if put to must not hesitate to sacrifice ferdy anyone else to achieve end question be what did jerce know about ferdy while clarice asked ferdy entered looking very sulky do call shame clarry said flinging into chair thrusting hand into pocket why must uncle henry have

with inquired crossly must think that ought to be satisfied seeing that everything have come way clarry do think that be pleasure for to take burden upon shoulder asked clarice fiercely must much rather that uncle henry have named dr jerce a guardian seeing dr jerce know so much about ferdy started to foot changing colour like chameleon have jerce be saying about demanded with sick look

have hidden gold without chalk knowing anything about hiding oh yes chalk be not always with uncle henry be frequently away for hour rarely sat up with night unless by doctor order uncle henry received gold in small sum so must easily hide if wished spend in london said ackworth significantly ah mean that uncle henry went secretly to london said clarice recalling story anthony have told about shah room well saw there with osip know be sure that companion be osip yes did not know at time when jerce described that criss cross scar thin lean figure of man be sure be osip mr horran also knew well enough ended ackworth with emphasis even in glimpse caught of be certain ca see how uncle henry ill a be must have travelled to town objected clarice dear argued before stated then a state now that quick motor car must easily take mr horran from here to london now clarice large sum of money be missing point to fact that mr horran must have secretly led gay life that illness be merely excuse to hide real existence said clarice with horror ca think uncle henry be so wicked remember doctor found out what suffered from that be real disease humph perhaps said ackworth grudgingly money ca say anything about if mr horran have forty thousand paid to in gold said anthony firmly must either have spent by secretly going to town to place like shah room where saw must have concealed money somewhere now ca find money lawyer ca account for in business way only remains from common sense point of view that horran really be profligate used illness a mask doctor dr jerce dr wentworth say that post mortem examination showed that uncle henry really be ill persisted clarice much distressed thing in brain called quite accounted for symptom so puzzled then give up said anthony so do replied clarice promptly be not going to trouble more about missing money about capture of osip about anything else must settle ferdy future then can marry speech be quite agreeable to ackworth who have long wished to bring to point while be talking about more pleasant subject connected with marriage jane limped in at open window immediately went to anthony dog be fond of young man showed pleasure by rubbing head against knee looking up at with faithful eye jane love a much a hate dr jerce said clarice patting dog shaggy coat why must hate jerce know especially a be kind to found in whitechapel starving wet took home hated so much that have to get rid of intended to have poisoned asked to give to dear jane be so faithful same must like dr jerce for kindness be glad doe said anthony like dr jerce why not everyone doe clarice how can ask that when know that have cheek to propose to like jerce oh be clever enough very philanthropic same be impertinent of old man to propose

hope jane wo laughed girl will certainly bite if doe h be said ackworth examining dog strong white teeth ca say 'd like to get bite from jaw anyone must run away seeing that jane be lame think jane be obstinate enough to follow until can get bite said clarice dryly never knew so dogged dog there be pun for anthony why laugh to please anthony did laugh be rebuked for obvious effort made then clarice romped with jane who barked danced a well a lameness permitted trio in short behaved like child careless glee went far to dispel gloomy atmosphere for week have pervaded house clarice by time be recovering from effect of tragedy be more like old bright self on especial evening anthony stopped to dinner heedless of necessity of chaperon enjoyed greatly be quite foretaste of time when must be darby joan by own particular fireside however after pleasure come business next afternoon miss baird set out for vicarage have ascertained that clarkes have returned in morning called few hour later anxious to get ferdy business settled so that must arrange own life often have girl wondered why mr clarke who have seemed markedly pleased when engagement be announced must have placed bar in way of marriage be resolved to come to complete understanding to learn reason for whim to use power possessed to bring about desirable match objection mr clarke must urge against ferdy clarice be certain that prudence must remain true to absent lover prudence have always loved ferdy deeply from time be boy girl together mr clarke proved to be in study clarice found unpacking parcel be astonished to see how ill man looked have never enjoyed best of health be invariably badly dressed absent minded now looked leaner than ever eye avoided own uneasily clarice sat down in perfect state of consternation dear mr clarke said a soon a must get breath what on earth be matter nothing said vicar with weary sigh went on with unpacking in restless disturbed manner went away for health persisted miss baird have be breathing sea air for three week doe seem to have done particle of good when mind be ill at ease clarice there be chance of body regaining health what be matter now asked clarice abruptly son frank be dead said vicar with sob oh clarice be dreadfully shocked now quite understood sick look of bereaved father knew that frank have be apple of mr clarke eye notwithstanding that have always behaved like rascal inherently be be sorry said rising perhaps must like to go away stop please will send prudence to a have to attend to pastoral matter poor son say anything more clarice interrupted vicar looking untidy pathetic figure son be dead never wish to hear name mentioned again a have sown so have reaped hope god will have mercy upon soul how did die say no more cried mr clarke before clarice must apologise hurried from room clarice be puzzled frank be dead strange to say vicar seemed glad that be dead frank undoubtedly be prodigal son father have always condoned folly rascality yet apparently at eleventh hour frank have done something even lenient parent must not forgive clarice did not wish to know what deed be have quite enough trouble of own without thinking of of other people still attitude wild word of mr clarke astonished not little prudence came in looking almost a ill a father have done girl be tall handsome dark with cool confident manner with considerable fund of common sense appeared very sick very ill at ease accepted kiss of old friend in mechanical way provoked clarice into speech seem very pleased to see prudence be said prudence in dull heavy voice if have not come to must have called at laurel want help will have said clarice impetuously be matter be brother death yes be one thing father be worried about there be something else if explain to must promise never to speak of what say to anyone wo said clarice struck by earnestness wondering what fatal secret be about to be unfolded be something ferdy have done speak of ferdy speak of poor darling boy will never see again never never never wild fear be in clarice heart prudence exclaimed catching girl arm have ferdy be doing anything wrong ferdy be can be desired can never marry why not because said prudence in solemn manner if marry ferdy father will be accused of murdering mr horran chapter xv vicar trouble in dingy study eloquent silence prevailed after making startling announcement prudence sat tearless with drawn white face plucking at damp handkerchief carried in hand poor girl have wept until must weep more must do with worn out emotion be to hold peace until clarice must help to continue conversation that young lady a white faced a hostess sat tongue tied horrified looked at sad figure before at grim line of theological book bound in calf at unclean window with ragged curtain at grimy carpet worn faded took time to collect thought when did recover speech be to energetically deny truth of girl speech believe cried clarice decisively talk to prudence went on a girl be about to speak know perfectly well that uncle henry be murdered by wretched osip that verdict to effect be brought in by jury besides what possible object must father have to commit murder prudence looked up with scared look stealthily glanced at door a answered in whisper loan interest said prudence in voice of ghost so thin low be speech clarice started reflected there certainly be motive here to make clarke commit crime be if horran grinding to dust have proposed to sell up be exactly what dead man never intended to do uncle henry must never have behaved like usurer said clarice charged father ten per cent said prudence scathingly if have be shylock must have charged fifty per cent dear also must not have allowed interest to run on for three year without claiming own now think of added clarice recalling late conversation with mr barras uncle henry knew very little about matter instructed mr barras to lend father one thousand pound omitted to mention interest mr barras charged ten per cent on own be large percentage then mr barras be not most amiable of men suppose thought be doing right in getting a much a must for money father owed mr horran one thousand pound three hundred for interest said prudence one moment dear owed still owes to estate of myself ferdy mr horran have settled income for acting a guardian money lent be ours not have taken debt upon when marry ferdy will give father discharge prudence lifted up hand with low wail can never marry ferdy said in broken voice what nonsense will marry see father stand in dock a felon there be chance of prudence what doe father say clarice do think have told said vehemently oh poor father have enough trouble to bear without heaping more on know nothing of reason for refusing to marry object said clarice much perplexed yes because of brother frank have brought disgrace on have died in disgrace when where prudence ca tell anything rejoined girl know be that just after burial of guardian father received bad news about frank have not seen frank for year have heard anything about be always in trouble father be always sending money borrowed that thousand to help frank get out of scrape time news must have be awful for father came to saying that frank be dead that never wished to hear name mentioned again wrote off to get clergyman arranged that must go away for time have never told what brother did have asked three four time will not say word about poor dead frank then father told that because frank have done something wicked be to give up thought of marrying ferdy did agree to said that frank sin must never spoil life father be very angry with be perfectly right said clarice heartily common sense coming to aid if sin of father be visited on child be reason that additional burden of brother fault must be heaped on sister shoulder be quite right to stick to ferdy dear what caused to change mind prudence be told that father have murdered mr horran said poor girl again in same terrified whisper that if married ferdy information must be given to police must lead to arrest what preposterous story said clarice indignantly did believe prudence girl glanced round again seemed to shrink into nothing a whispered yes clarice stared at ought to stick up for father said with slang with great truth god help wish must wailed prudence clasping hand clarice caught one of hand be more explicit said quickly have told so much that must tell wo let police know about father guilt no because believe that be guilty why jury brought in verdict against osip evidence be perfectly plain go on tell know prudence drew chair close to of visitor placed lip to clarice ear father owed money a know explained hurriedly mr barras wrote saying that unless interest be paid immediately after new year father must be sold up be nearly frenzied a must not have stopped in parish if sale have taken place be so poor that have nowhere to go to then a father said bishop might have interfered private matter of sort have nothing to do with bishop father thought otherwise went about house moaning that be in disgrace did not know what to do then came on day ferdy became engaged father be more cheerful after have gone on account of engagement from something said to said must speak to uncle henry settle loan said clarice rapidly go on dear want to know before father return afterwards father fell into low spirit again wanted to see mr horran for tried to be refused admittance know nodded clarice dr jerce thought that visit must irritate uncle henry now that know mr barras charged ten per cent that uncle henry who respected father be ignorant of such extortion quite understand why dr jerce did not want uncle henry to be upset be quite right then prudence father did see guardian yes went in by open french window remember what said at inquest interrupted clarice with musing air ah started a memory came back to stated that uncle henry denied giving mr barras permission to lend money said prudence quickly if will refer to newspaper report clarice really said that mr horran declared that have not given mr barras permission to lend money at ten per cent so agrees with what say mr barras be allowed to make loan charged ten per cent on own account so to speak clarice nodded well then uncle henry told father not to worry said that must write to mr barras prudence nodded yes remember there be pause then clarice said impatiently well then dear girl if matter be thus adjusted by uncle henry father see what motive mr clarke have to kill guardian prudence thought for few moment clarice may be that father did not tell exact truth about interview at inquest see wished to avert suspicion from be never suspected wait clarice father be very much agitated after interview with mr horran although said very little about to heard more about matter until inquest when father gave evidence thought that spoke truly until until what until woman called to see while everyone be at funeral clarice started woman what woman mr dump daughter zara dump butterfly yes know a well a do clarice sarah dump be name although chooses to call zara be always most disagreeable girl a knew when have anything to do with in sunday school be before went away to appear on stage a butterfly never did think much of said clarice contemptuously indeed never thought about at until learned accidentally that ferdy admired admires ferdy said prudence panting with dark eye flashing hate oh how hate be wonderful same clarice how dowdy little country girl have blossomed into well dressed woman of world superficial prudence dare say be a ignorant a ever know from what little saw of at church festival school treat that must speak english speaks very well now said prudence bitterly well enough at event to tell must give up ferdy did at minx bidding clarice clenched fist so that glove split must have turned out of house insolent creature to dare to love ferdy to dare to address in way what did say at first laughed at when spoke well asked clarice seeing that girl hesitated what did say told that father have murdered mr horran that if did not refuse to marry ferdy must tell police clarice laughed derisively believed story story brazen girl have inducement to tell not at first afterwards found proof against father can never believe that said miss baird very decidedly what proof tell first on what ground dump woman based accusation said that be stopping at savoy hotel with mother for rest quite right know be mr rebson told go on mr dump on night what night night when mr horran be killed be murdered between one two in morning well then during hour of darkness said prudence impatiently on night morning if like mr dump be taken ill sarah be awakened to attend to sal volatile be needed so sarah put on thing went out to chemist believe chemist must not attend to anyone at hour by way what do say hour be two o'clock said prudence softly then chemist be relative of mr dump clarice must probably give sarah what wanted sal volatile humph said clarice inelegantly well sarah said that went along quietly passed house must have to if came up lane to go to high street remarked clarice trying mentally to follow wandering of butterfly so a to be certain of truth of evidence be moonlight night sarah kept in shadow on other side of lane so that one must see going out so late why must have done did expect to meet anyone said something about chance of meeting policeman be prudence reply do let get on with story clarice will never get finished be attention well then sarah say that saw father come quickly out of window of uncle bedroom run out of garden up lane be in shadow passed rapidly saw for one second in moonlight face white terrified went got sal volatile told one of what have seen not even mother until came to use knowledge to part from ferdy when prudence paused clarice looked at with unmoved face well dear well said prudence be sarah dump story very weak one believe made up must not get father arrested on evidence clarice prudence placed lip at girl ear laughed at sarah wild story when went examined father bedroom found shirt thrown into washing basket have not be called for basket mean owing to holiday found that wrist be spotted with blood oh clarice started be certain that be blood quite certain dipped one of cuff in water spot turned perfectly red clarice gripped friend hand tightly do think that father really be guilty ca think prudence have reason everything be arranged between uncle henry yes father said that at inquest may have told untruth to shield prudence do believe that father be guilty sometimes do sometimes father have have so much worry that be not always accountable for action may have gone out in frenzy finding window open may have oh poor girl broke off weeping what be to do ask father to prove innocence dare not clarice what with own trouble death of frank mysterious wickedness of frank have be guilty poor father be nearly crazy did know that be accused of murder must go out of mind altogether if sarah dump tell police will hold tongue said must give up ferdy wrote told ferdy must not marry said that father did not approve of match ferdy said something about said clarice well then prudence leave everything to will speak to anthony be very clever will be able to help worry hush father clarke entered room with wild look hurriedly frowned when saw two girl together thought have gone clarice said fretfully wish must go prudence have much to do be going said clarice pressing girl arm so a to make humour excited man only waited to tell mr clarke have seen mr barras have assumed right of loan will have further trouble about be good of said clarke gloomily few day ago must have hailed news with joy be now too late be outcast accursed father father said prudence placing hand on arm shook off tell girl must leave house hide shameful head angel of lord will pursue child not with fiery brand mr clarke said clarice in firm way fastening eye very steadily on excited face of poor parson be talking nonsense sit down will not direct in own house be for good speaking softly clarice placed hand on clarke arm drew gently towards arm chair with eye fixed on time prudence watched in awestricken silence a miss baird seemed to be quite mistress of situation sit down sit down whispered clarice softly when parson dropped heavily into chair placed cool hand on burning brow will sleep now wake feeling much better will not sleep said clarke trying to remove eye from a mesmeric influence be dominating go away yes when sleep sleep sleep sleep clarice voice took on kind of sing song drew warm firm hand gently across man wrinkled brow gradually clarke muscle relaxed eye grew calmer then closed began to breath gently wake up in hour feeling perfectly well commanded clarice then beckoned astonished prudence from room used to do to uncle henry for headache laughed chapter xvi strange communication having thus quieted overwrought vicar clarice took leave of poor prudence however left girl in much more cheerful frame of mind a asserted belief in mr clarke innocence in spite of appearance to contrary promised assistance when miss baird returned home thought over what have learned appeared difficult to keep word certainly did not think that parson be guilty even though evidence of blood spotted cuff be almost proof positive in way might be explained although at moment clarice must not suggest to herself possible explanation believed that clarke have given true evidence at inquest that horran have quite intended to put matter right for year late guardian have known vicar have always respected although have never approved of clarke devotion to miserable son be quite probable that horran have instructed barras to give vicar loan of one thousand pound be improbable that have insisted upon ten per cent indeed knowing clarke circumstance upon percentage whatsoever owing to horran illness have given barras power of attorney to execute small matter connected with estate thus save trouble so be probable that barras for benefit of estate have charged large percentage must easily be ascertained by conversation with lawyer clarice determined to pay visit to london see a soon a must with regard to story told by sarah dump girl be doubtful might might not be true assuredly zara dump anxious to marry ferdy have reason to get mr clarke into trouble so a to prevent marriage of prudence then again really might have seen clarke leave death chamber thus have made use of secret knowledge to gain end if be case clarice asked what clarke be doing in guardian room at early hour of morning according to medical evidence horran be murdered between one two be at latter hour according to zara dump clarke have left laurel question must be settled by asking vicar bluntly to explain seeing that poor man be so overwrought be impossible to question for moment examination must have to come sooner later if thing be to be put right miss baird thought that must be a well to wait for few day irony of situation lay in fact that zara need not have accused vicar so a to gain refusal of prudence procure stoppage of marriage mr clarke refused to allow ceremony to take place for reason connected with prodigal son what that reason be clarice very much wanted to know determined to insist upon explanation when questioned vicar about presumed midnight visit clarice be naturally of impatient character must have be delighted to then there have interviewed clarke so a to learn truth man be not in fit state of mind to calmly discus trouble clarice trusted that few day must reduce excitement to normal limit then must have quiet conversation induce to be frank with meanwhile reflected upon what be best to be done after cogitation determined to go next day to see mr barras learn exactly how matter stood a regard loan afterwards must return see mr clarke meanwhile intended to explain matter to anthony so a to have benefit of common sense having thus arranged thing clarice possessed soul in patience for day scheme be upset when ferdy unexpectedly arrived about seven o'clock just in time for dinner looked nervous shirked explanation of appearance until dinner be over be seated with puzzled sister in drawing room now then ferdy said clarice when coffee be served brother have lighted inevitable cigarette perhaps will tell why have come down be glad to see questioned ferdy evasively delighted doe not answer question why did come to see clarry of course other reason ferdy hesitated sought inspiration from ceiling then in usual crafty way began to explain by degree suppose know that everything be ended between prudence said clarice looked hard at wondered if must be wise for to admit that have seen prudence knew reason why engagement have be broken off moment reflection convinced that in dealing with so shifty young man a be must be better to deny knowledge ferdy be playing game be certain what game might be wanted very much to learn if gave rope enough must assuredly hang so proceeded to do by pretending ignorance hinted when last met that there be misunderstanding between there be misunderstanding on part cried ferdy falling at once into trap love prudence be willing to marry refuse to marry have broken off engagement indeed what reason doe assign for sudden change father will not accept a son in law on what ground ferdy shrugged shoulder mr clarke according to prudence doe not approve of match have be doing anything to make disapprove asked clarice quickly pointedly replied ferdy indignantly know why be always suspecting of doing wrong clarry be straight be be a straight a most fellow be not saying much rejoined clarice sarcastically well then be a straight a ackworth that be not ferdy anthony always speaks truth so do have right to say otherwise ferdy life have told half truth be much worse than right down lie oh hang be too bad tell what be clarry if have bad opinion of be not fit for society give income let go out of life will hing of sort said clarice sternly be not fit to look after own life if gave two thousand year remember can not do until two year be past must simply go headlong to ruin ferdy must marry prudence will look after how impossible be clarry cried ferdy greatly exasperated tell must like to marry prudence wo allow to father be against becoming husband can ask if doubt oh believe what say remarked clarice readily then what be to do leave to time to right thing dare say mr clarke will change mind again may not for year even if change at grumbled ferdy ca wait on pleasure for ever if love prudence can know do love doe love said young man sulkily if ca get love in one quarter must in do see oh yes said clarice cruelly see that love only one person be what be other woman name ferdy started grew red other woman yes talk about

wounded air if have be chucked by one loved must seek love elsewhere be certain of ah judge by well then ferdy suppose refuse to allow to marry zara ca be own master over age be not master of money

pompously be afraid that wo do much good retorted sister with calm smile in first place have money lawyer will undertake case unless certain fee be paid down in second place will fail in action will be perfectly clear a to power duty a guardian have full power to do what like until be legally of age in two year be infernal shame muttered ferdy who have sense enough to see that spoke truth think so sensible person who understood position of thing must not think so either however can see that be waste of time for to go to law what else can do can go on stage with zara yes said ferdy triumphantly rubbing hand ah did think 'd say that did expected to hear anything so long a be sufficiently silly said clarice in coldest tone really ferdy be child wo find so when take own way what be own way have told be engaged to zara intend to marry now prudence have behaved so badly if refuse to allow money will chuck medical profession go on stage to act with zara in butterfly sketch at mascot music hall be satisfied with chrysalis can act act what asked clarice puzzled by scientific word chrysalis in sketch be called birth of butterfly there be chrysalis acted by man wriggle about

if truly love lady not dancer will wait until time brings mr clarke round to accepting a son in law said ferdy very decidedly want answer please so can arrange what to do ah mean must decide whether be to be doctor chrysalis said clarice quietly contemptuously give few minute to consider matter ferdy brother looked at suddenly apparently thinking that be about to give way however be sufficiently wise not to press advantage for time being will play for time said crossing to piano while think will music disturb in way said clarice absently ferdy began to play soft murmurous piece of music suggested waving green forest gentle summer wind played very well in amateur sort of way played also softly so clarice be quite able to follow own thought a music echoed through room in ferdy defiance saw again hand of zara dump apparently dancer be bent upon marrying boy must stop at nothing to accomplish aim perhaps be in love a ferdy undoubtedly be handsome charming fellow also in two year must be in possession of very respectable income anthony have hinted that zara wished to marry money have not chanced upon millionaire sufficiently susceptible else have genuine love for ferdy baird be prepared to be happy with on moderate income clarice saw very plainly that brother be absolutely dominated by will of dancer that if refused allowance must only throw more completely into arm of clever woman on other hand by letting thing remain a be must be able by holding purse string to keep certain hold over headstrong boy be out of question to allow ferdy to ruin career by going on music hall stage moreover clarice began to feel piqued by zara that woman must set to intrigue in manner annoyed zara apparently thought that must get everything own way clarice be determined that must not be triumphant along line looked forward with pleasure to thwarting dancer also in accusation of clarke by miss dump clarice saw that much larger issue than ferdy future be involved zara evidently quite expected that clarice must refuse ferdy allowance thus must compel to rely on miss baird at once resolved to countercheck dancer by acting in contrary way a have done with ferdy so must do with zara be intended to give dancer rope enough to hang clarice wished to find out what string zara be pulling time be required to look into matter time must be gained by checkmating in manner so having made up mind clarice called ferdy away from piano dear boy said gently want to be unhappy know a said before prudence have treated badly so be not to be wondered at that must go to woman who love zara doe oh doe said ferdy promptly well then said clarice in caressing tone will continue allowance a want to go on stage if do must make promise anything cried ferdy delighted at having secured end promise that will not contract secret marriage with dancer said miss baird earnestly promise with heart replied ferdy so agreement be made clarice thus gained time to fathom scheme of miss dump have to do with greater thing than ferdy imagined be at moment little later anthony appeared in full mess kit looked excited when burst into room did more noisily than usual apologise for dress said coming forward to kiss clarice be in such hurry to see came over without changing in fellow motor car be waiting outside ca stop more than few minute expect want to speak to clarry said ferdy quickly will go

musing looked up why do say behe ackworth pointed to caligraphy of letter lay on table before handwriting be like of woman men woman write exactly alike nowadays dear besides if woman have written certainly must have assumed even more masculine style of writing then think that letter be written by man of course ca think of man who desire to prevent marriage ackworth considered for one moment drew inspiration from steadfast eye dr jerce said suddenly sir daniel jerce give proper title what make think that several thing one be that sir daniel quoted slip betwixt cup lip proverb in fact hinted more in manner than word must never become wife confounded cheek said anthony seating have be standing hitherto what right have to interfere right of man who be in love with woman said clarice

be growing late clarice insisted that must go escorted to door ferdy be conversing with anthony brother officer who have brought over car of course amateur chauffeur be introduced to miss baird chatted so gaily for few minute that anthony must not believe have anything on mind yet knew very well that be extremely anxious be nerving to face enemy finally insisted that must go indoors a night

previous night declined to kiss when went in case must suffer also be ferdy over never ran chance of getting into trouble if be not likely to benefit clarice sighed when departed then laughed sad a be at ferdy selfishness thought of plot cheered up boy a be resolved must be saved from zara dump in spite of sir daniel be extremely astonished to receive clarice note asking to come down elderly heart beat rapidly a reflected that have called back have told that must not see again unless asked to come here very message for have longed be in hand went down to crumel by midday train shortly arrived at laurel here found clarice up dressed seated in drawing room looking very unwell occupied large chair near fire be enveloped in multiplicity of wrap to keep from shivering when sir daniel entered did not rise offer hand might give cold said clarice hoarsely dear dear be very sick remarked jerce quite at ease in presence of ill health how did get cold be standing in porch last night talking to anthony jerce bit lip a mentioned name stretched out hand let feel pulse clarice kept hand under shawl have asked to come for reason than to prescribe for also have taken simple remedy will be well in few day still ca ask famous sir daniel jerce to attend to trifling case like mine since famous sir daniel be here observed doctor good humouredly may a well exercise profession know added earnestly must do anything for even though have treated so cruelly will persist in saying that cried clarice petulantly when know that never loved that never gave encouragement that have reason to blame in way if have come here to make disagreeable have come because sent for said jerce calmly if remember said must never see again unless did send for oh suppose thought that invitation meant that have changed mind about marrying anthony did hope that said sir daniel plainly a can conceive other reason why must ask down unless added with bitterness wish to torture own conscience must do sir daniel own conscience understand miss baird think again hinted must never marry anthony did rejoined jerce steadily hope wo why not because wish to marry see clarice drew anonymous letter from pocket placed in hand to gain end be willing to go to length doctor read few line gravely then handed back letter still understand yes do sir daniel wrote that letter jerce sprang to foot with agility astonishing in so stout man insult said with cold suppressed fury have not reason to flashed out when seek to prevent marriage by accusing ferdy of murder did not accuse never wrote that letter be not in handwriting be not written on own stationery of course not must have signed name if have be did ask down to accuse of asked sir daniel contemptuously yes did tell that plot will fail a ferdy be perfectly innocent never said that be guilty that letter did not write that letter clarice looked at steadily face be calm nerve be unshaken have failed to take unawares with abrupt accusation man be innocent if have made mistake ask pardon said quietly have read letter just moment never set eye on before what do think of accusation know what to think said jerce coolly oh then believe that writer if not have certain ground upon to accuse brother of murder know writer know ground other man must have lost temper at insult have offered being in love with forgive unfair suspicion still in justice to myself will take leave a can not inflict upon company of man of whom think so meanly one moment said clarice who must not tell if be really innocent if be acting part what must do about letter if be must obey writer said jerce promptly ah then have interest in stopping marriage have must do anything in power to break off engagement with ackworth so must marry precisely believe wrote letter after said clarice between clenched teeth defy to look in face deny do look in face do deny said jerce coldly writer of letter have done good turn thank how do know be man sir daniel shrugged shoulder know only surmise surmise what that man wrote why not woman sneered clarice why not indeed know a much about matter a do beaten by imperturbability girl adopted mode of attack why must ferdy be accused know unless be that ferdy life wild life a told must do much for money for money what do mean mean that forty thousand pound be yet unaccounted for oh ferdy murdered uncle henry for money writer accuses of crime said jerce quietly be not prepared to endorse accusation a know nothing know cried clarice vehemently ferdy be locked in room by on night of crime because have be taking too much to drink have better answer letter say so retorted jerce to whom must write to what address ca say answered steadily will be wise if break off engagement with captain ackworth ferdinand may be innocent in one way yet guilty in explain may be accomplice after fact doctor cried clarice rising quickly know something know nothing save that ferdy life wild fast life be of undisciplined nature walked to door take leave with last warning obey that anonymous note give up ackworth else else questioned clarice eagerly else ferdinand may be hanged chapter xviii unexpected happens clarice sank back in chair a jerce left room wondering if have heard aright sir daniel have certainly said in plain english that failing breaking of engagement ferdy must be hanged meant guilt of ferdy yet must prove that boy have be locked in room what be meant by being accessory after fact must have to ask mr barras meaning of legal phrase in way however guessed that much implicated ferdy in crime ferdy be wild assuredly to get money must do much must never dare to commit vile murder in first place nature be too mild in second be too timid ferdy must be innocent yet be strange that must always be so mysterious so ready to take alarm clarice recalled several occasion when ferdy have appeared startled by apparently innocent remark then again ferdy be in toil of zara dump zara from accusation of mr clarke knew something about crime what if be throwing blame on parson to shield ferdy whom loved at point of agonised reflection door opened sir daniel jerce again appeared think said coldly yet very pointedly that if take walk put away medicine bottle will find that illness will vanish good day be gone in moment clarice flung off shawl ran to door jerce then saw through feigned disorder what fool be to try deceive so clever physician by time gained hall jerce have already passed out of front door when opened that be passing out of gate for moment felt inclined to call back insist upon illness knowing that must not deceive so capable judge closed door again returned to drawing room there wrapped up again be necessary to deceive in house since one be so acute a jerce to tell false illness from real one must not carry out plot unless pretended to be ill so have taken advantage of being in porch on previous night to secure end intending to go secretly to london on same evening clarice wished to keep to room so that one save mr rebson in whom must have to confide must know that be out of house especially have wished to deceive jerce yet have seen through scheme of pretended sickness must be on look out to see why have acted in such manner clarice be certain that in way jerce be plotting against anthony notwithstanding denial of anonymous letter must take ingenuity clever a thought to circumvent doctor be uncommonly sharp uncommonly suspicious if found out what intended to do must nullify success of plot in way what fool have be to see especially when have gained nothing by interview in face of first failure to impose upon clever man who wanted own way many woman must have thrown up sponge clarice only stiffened back in face of increasing difficulty come what may must masquerade a intended learn truth of ferdy hidden life plan be at once daring simple in look exactly resembled ferdy dressed in suit of clothes one must be able to recognise a sister also must mimic ferdy trick of speech ordinary gesture exactly thus must be able to pas a brother even with who knew well once arrayed a ferdy clarice intended to go to london pas evening at mascot music hall in order to witness performance of sarah dump then a ferdy must go round see dancer perhaps zara might let slip something must put on track of boy delinquency if must arrive at truth of ferdy fast life at jerce have hinted might learn how came to be implicated in crime be implicated rather than clarke since clarice believed that zara have only accused clarke to save lover a well a to prevent marriage with prudence also direct accusation in anonymous letter hinted that someone if not jerce knew that ferdy have connection with death of henry horran jerce hinted that ferdy be mixed up in matter be ready to use information whatever might be to place ferdy in dock if match with ackworth be not broken off can thus be seen why clarice have asked anthony to invite brother to gattlinsands on evening to detain if possible for next night did not want to run risk of meeting ferdy at mascot music hall to have a be two richmond in field on one night hoped to learn sufficient to force ferdy into open confession when knew might be able to save failing success on night trusted to be more successful on ensuing evening in case felt that must be successful if ferdy be to be saved from trickster who be around from own weak self of course experiment be daring one anthony certainly must not approve of too much be at stake to hesitate so clarice went up to room about five o'clock to get ready for masquerade on stroke of hour mr rebson appeared with telegram proved to be from anthony wired that ferdy have accepted invitation be on way to gattlinsands be right said clarice putting wire carefully away what be right deary asked mr rebson who be smoothing nursling bed nanny come here said girl led mr rebson to chair dare say remember what said about disgrace domestic prophet replied mr rebson smoothing apron yes disgrace will come say what like will come fear mr rebson clapped gnarled old hand have brought to sens cried in cracked voice with great triumph will never doubt domestic prophet again oh answered clarice artfully disgrace be coming fear nanny to ferdy mr rebson hand fell by side began to shake disgrace to darling boy whimpered oh miss clarice what be have be doing be not what have be doing what be about to do said miss baird resolutely now nanny if want to save ferdy from disgrace from imprisonment perhaps from worse must hold tongue about what be going to tell swear on bible whimpered mr rebson again oh pretty boy sweet darling began to cry in senile manner clarice knew that must trust old woman to be silent a affection for unworthy ferdy must have sealed lip even have be threatened with gallows to open if clarice wanted to leave laurel secretly for masquerade to return without absence being known be absolutely necessary that must trust old woman therefore risked telling mr rebson that knew again impressed upon at end of confession absolute necessity for ferdy sake of silence mr rebson wept time cried out at interval exclaimed indignantly at ferdy enemy altogether conducted a partisan of shifty youth knew that domestic prophet must not lie cried mr rebson though never thought meant precious lamb oh miss clarice what be to be done will hang quarter darling baby nanny can save said clarice soothingly will will if will consent to help must go to scaffold for ferdy sweetheart said mr rebson fervently whereupon clarice explained how meant to masquerade a twin brother mr rebson be startled expostulated in alarm oh deary be dreadful thing must do what must world say world will never know nanny be why want to help be supposed to be ill with cold so can be thought to be in room nursing while be away let anyone enter attend to a if be really ill in bed everyone will think that be indisposed when will be back asked mr rebson shaking nervous to morrow time can stop at hotel in town oh miss clarice young lady without chaperon wo be young lady young man said clarice impatiently crossing room to look into gladstone bag have packed with

house be not yet quite full clarice be thus enabled to secure very comfortable stall a evening grew later seat on side of be gradually filled found that one next to remained empty performance be of usual class showed little originality although be entirely new to girl who have lived most of life in crumel acrobat tumbled thought reader performed wonder musical american played various instrument interspersed jangling with united state slang delivered in nasal voice various crack comedian sang comic song of day be clarice thought dreary production enjoyed performance however a be new to wondered what ferdy must find in turn to come there night after night perhaps birth of butterfly must be more artistic amusing came on at nine o'clock be especial moment for clarice have waited evening immediately before curtain rose on sketch little overdressed woman came pushing along to vacant seat beside miss baird turned to see who be to dismay recognised mr dump little woman also recognised a thought clarice brother exchanged greeting very affably though be not astonished to see here mr ferdinand said mr dump in voluble way zara say that come nearly night to see sketch come mr

that curtain rose have to pay attention to sketch scene represented very picturesquely garden of rose at back be brobdignagian flower upon lay stretched out gigantic green worm be probably chrysalis have be ferdy ambition to act while music thrilled through air light rapidly changed worm began to writhe to execute acrobatic feat twisted turned on small space comparatively speaking of flower finally crawled across stage wriggling grotesquely mr dump be annoyed to think that child of mine twine must make such exhibition of said indignantly be not zara whispered clarice smiling appears a butterfly know then can say be that ai like butterfly have met with said mr dump angrily having chased a girl wait till zara appears be reply of charming handsome young gentleman whom landlady of savoy hotel took to be mr ferdinand baird of laurel mr dump sniffed aggressively sat very rigid with fullest intention of giving daughter good talking to for daring to lower dignity of twine name meanwhile eye of be watching pretty picture on stage wind swept through garden of flower blossom withered under blighting breath in one moment radiant paradise of rose took on wintry aspect snow fell thickly tree shed leaf sky turned dark ungainly green chrysalis shivered wriggled in wonderful manner to shrill blowing of flute trumpet in orchestra be so realistic that audience must almost a one enthusiast declared feel cold then came mellow sound of flute delicate trilling of stringed instrument rose began to bloom again sky regained brilliant blue tree budded afresh under touch of sudden spring green worm writhed way to gigantic rose lay there exhausted still until rising petal of flower concealed from sight then came pause afterwards with triumphal burst of music out of closed rose sprang light airy figure with glittering glorious butterfly wing scintillating vast zara shot up to fly like rocket then swooped gracefully down to front of stage supported in airy flight by invisible wire fluttered amongst blossom like immense jewelled insect coquetting caressing hovering marvellously on iridescent pinion over played ever changing limelight so that girl floated lightly a thistle down in midst of king opal of prismatic hue then dropped lightly on to stage began dreamy sensuous dance must have driven st anthony out of sens when dance be at height zara whirled fast furious in radiant light colour dismal note sounded in orchestra butterfly paused shivered a cold wind bent flower chilled again dance commenced time be slower music grew sadder many flower began to fade once more finally snow began to fall in feathery white flake shortly garden be again strewn in ruin poor butterfly frozen dying sank weakly to ground while snow piled white mound over short lived beauty when dancer be completely buried curtain fell rose again in answer to thunderous applause zara appeared leading by hand fellow artiste who have so wonderfully performed chrysalis have put aside mask came to front of stage where must be plainly seen clarice looked at indifferently when glanced aside at mr dump saw that little woman face be bloodless pinched oh mr ferdinand gasped mr dump clutching companion arm be osip be murderer chapter xix zara butterfly in noise of applause greeted osip zara terrified whisper of mr dump passed unnoticed girl naturally searched for mother smiled on catching sight of next to pretended ferdy baird eye of osip followed of zara alighted on pallid face of country landlady at once bowed abruptly to audience walked hurriedly from stage leaving butterfly rather discourteously to follow at leisure clarice who have immediately grasped significance of mr dump whisper half rose tried to shake off detaining grasp of little woman be trying to escape said clarice excitedly a applause have now ceased several people overheard looked round inquiringly murmured mr dump dragging girl down with unexpected strength hold tongue mr ferdinand for zara sake justice must be done retorted clarice anxious to have miscreant captured forthwith for own sake then muttered woman with white lip clarice truly surprised dropped back into seat what do mean by demanded indignantly know know murmured other still holding on convulsively zara said that have power to make marry if make trouble over osip may use power in way what nonsense returned clarice shrugging same remained quiet for time being from mr dump hurried speech be apparent that zara really have hold over ferdy must not hesitate to use to harm if anything came of supposed interference with shady doings clarice wondered that zara bold daring a be cared to connect with so dangerous man a assassin of so many people osip association with accusation of vicar admitted presence near house about hour of crime looked a though knew much more than chose to tell also power over ferdy might implicate in way in infernal doings of purple fern clarice therefore to save ferdy from possible accusation resolved to take measure to have osip captured until such time a knew more exactly how matter stood shortly mr dump released hold turned paler than ever take out get brandy three star whispered little woman who have undoubtedly received great shock clarice saw that be on verge of fainting so at once piloted along row of seat to nearest bar procured glass of liqueur brandy flighty barmaid doubt friend of ferdy saluted clarice with engaging smile slangy greeting finally remarking that old girl meaning mr dump looked chippy insult to year a well a strong liquor brought back colour to mr dump cheek stiffness to back replacing glass on counter with bang frowned on saucy girl be bold painted hussy snapped mr dump aggressively brandy gone to aunt head ferdy giggled barmaid in wise disturbed take

good clarice moved towards door there be more to be said good night zara stood for one moment with clenched hand frown on pretty babyish face must look so strong at time deceived men into thinking

in one way yet in might do harm with manager have really be ignorant that survivor of famous purple fern triumvirate be acting with who must believe in innocence did fact become public property with

suppose so what devil man be yet know a brown really be rather nice ugh zara shivered again be not silly fainting woman turn cold to think how often have be in company might have killed clarice took cigarette out of silver box lighted up must be going now said quietly so have to keep up pretence of being man one last word understand one yes said zara promptly keep silent about clarke about osip

what do mean zara looked into other woman eye come to door said taking clarice by arm when in hall helped girl on with fur coat gave silk hat placed silver knobbed cane in hand then led to door of flat clarice suffered in silence wondering what be coming good night said zara when clarice be on mat what do say about ferdy asked clarice quickly see must tell sighed dancer will let find out for bent head whispered search ferdy bedroom at laurel began clarice impatiently only to find talking to panel of door zara have shut abruptly left disguised girl standing irresolutely on mat clarice hesitated wondered if must not be better to insist upon door being opened again on second thought went down stair drove back to hotel long evening battle with zara have worn out strong nerve clarice passed wakeful night wondered what zara meant when have told to search ferdy bedroom must not be possible that ferdy have anything to do with crime a have be locked in on night also if zara knew that ferdy be guilty certainly must not marry there seemed to be answer to question suggested by zara last remark clarice therefore tried to sleep resolving to return to crumel next day search bedroom a zara have told trembled to think what might discover next morning false mr ferdinand baird ate breakfast paid bill drove to liverpool street station to catch ten o'clock train in tweed suit clarice looked wonderfully handsome distinguished a adopted manly air one have suspicion that good looking young man be really beautiful woman managed to get first class to herself thus escaped chance of recognition on crumel platform be greeted a mr baird acknowledged greeting calmly on reaching house found french window open servant about in few minute be safe in own bedroom be dressing again in woman garb mr rebson appeared be right deary one think what be ill how did get along very well nanny will tell later let of servant come upstairs for at least hour what do wish to do will tell later

quite satisfied departed kept servant downstairs according to instruction clarice went at once to ferdy room began to search for twenty minute be unsuccessful a came across nothing suspicious be difficult search a did not know what to look for judged that might be letter blood stained shirt something likely to implicate brother in crime several time stopped turning out drawer examining wardrobe to laugh at folly possessed to believe in zara lie feeling that there might be truth in dancer hint made search on yet clarice must not believe that ferdy whom have locked in very room have anything to do with so awful crime let alone fact that ferdy although foolish be not wicked end came at last found what sought what sought be evidence implicating ferdy in small drawer wrapped up carefully in old silk tie girl found small india rubber stamp with wildly beating heart dipped in water to moisten pressed hard on scrap of shaving paper removed stamp found on paper faint impression of purple fern chapter xxi ackworth news mr rebson being woman fond of gossip have fair share of curiosity also be anxious to hear what clarice have be doing in london to know exactly how have saved ferdy although mr rebson have very vague idea of what ferdy be to be saved from that darling have anything to do with crime never entered foolish old head however impatience must not permit to stay downstairs longer than hour so went back to room of young mistress a soon a must clarice be not within mr rebson be puzzled hunted through other room on same floor at length came to ferdy apartment here found room in disorder clarice lying on carpet in dead faint considerably alarmed mr rebson got water vinegar sal volatile such like aid to insensible people shortly clarice revived sat up with dazed look a soon a memory of what have found came back to with rush struggled to foot crushed up scrap of shaving paper upon have impressed fern stamp have held closely in left hand time be insensible so did not think that dim eyed old nurse have seen anything more than mr rebson ascribed to london trip unexampled behaviour on part of girl never before have strong minded clarice baird lost sens come lie down deary coaxed mr rebson leading girl back to own room be fairly worn out with gadding about nasty london will bring up tea do nanny said clarice faintly when nurse left room lay passively upon bed what felt at moment one knew one must ever know stamp of purple fern be inseparably connected with many murder that must be in ferdy bedroom hidden away so carefully seemed terrible inexplicable ferdy must not have murdered guardian since have be locked up in room yet stamp have be used to impress fatal mark on forehead of dead be in ferdy possession of course osip who be really murderer might have have stamp certainly must have have stamp doubt member of triumvirate possessed similar article ferdy be guiltless osip have done deed yet how came that ferdy have particular stamp in possession clarice must have shrieked with fear horror have to roll over on pillow to prevent from cry out then agonised thought came into tormented mind zara have told to search ferdy room

not stabbed horran with assegai since have be locked in room must have impressed purple fern on dead man forehead unless osip oh yes osip must have done not ferdy not ferdy not ferdy so girl distracted brain buzzed droned with hideous repetition of one word guilt guilt guilt will go mad moaned clarice what be to do dare not tell anthony dare not marry what be to be done oh great heaven what be to be done then came into mind that zara have stated how clarke have paid midnight visit to death chamber at two o'clock be time according to medical evidence when deed have be committed between one two o'clock in morning dr jerce have said at inquest clarke be there if be innocent might know who be guilty must not have seen ferdy who be bolted barred in bedroom might have seen osip

if be guiltless must certainly detail happened if mentioned ferdy name then must not do that must not dare not ferdy must prove alibi sister must prove alibi for killed horran brother be at least innocent yet stamp stamp of purple fern how must explain that away miss clarice do look bad said mr rebson entering with dainty meal of tea toast that nasty london here drink tea will feel better soon deary after have saved master ferdy have deary little maid clarice winced lied bravely yes said faintly have saved ferdy need have fear nanny leave for ten minute rather reluctantly old woman departed clarice forced to drink cup of tea to eat morsel of toast must have to be strong if ferdy be to be saved zara knew truth about boy might tell police there be one to save ferdy poor weak foolish creature sister sister must save in face of obstacle clarice therefore fought with struggled desperately with woman weakness braced with prayer finally triumphed over flesh by strength of spirit when mr rebson stole back to bedroom be amazed to see how rapidly young mistress have recovered presence of mind have left pale faced tearful girl found calm self contained woman be wonderful what tea toast will do mr rebson with great complacency nanny observed clarice who have now determined what to do send to mr clarke tell to see afternoon be not well enough deary be must see hair deary what be matter with oh yes clarice mechanically put hand to head be rather awkward be not too closely cropped nanny get out hair cut off will weave into what have left on scalp mr rebson laughed at what conceived be joke between contrived very skilfully to fasten on shorn tress a ferdy usually wore hair in musician like way clarice have imitated cut so be not difficult to replace severed lock in style in generally wore also since wished to still play part of invalid made mr rebson draw down blind light fire then swathed in blanket shawl clarice sat ready for visit of parson have failed to deceive sir daniel jerce mr clarke being le clever observant not doctor felt certain that must manage to trick having thus arranged stage anxious girl waited for vicar mr clarke appeared almost on heel of messenger looked more wild wan than ever with weary air shook hand with miss baird expressed regret that be suffering from influenza then sat down opposite to stared into fire with lack lustre eye clarice have to break ice mr clarke said hesitating for be not easy to begin wish to speak to about very important matter be quite at service clarice one touch reputation said girl mr clarke started became paler than ever a cast keen wild look at speaker understand stuttered carry thought back to night when uncle henry be murdered said clarice significantly will understand vicar considered for few moment then shook head know what mean thought thought moistened dry lip thought that be going to speak of frank wo have name mentioned ended violently did not intend to speak of frank said clarice wondering why memory of dead son must so agitate of visit to uncle henry room on night visit stammered old man midnight visit who said that oh there be need for to give name interrupted clarice in sharp tone someone saw leaving bedroom at two in morning what be doing there at time oh yes remember mr clarke spoke in dreamy way must have spoken to police about frank wickedness put quite out of head then of course looked awkward for clarice be almost too astonished to speak that must take revelation so calmly perplexed greatly how do mean that looked awkward for asked after embarrassing pause going to see poor horran at hour said mr clarke innocently then seeing dead body clarice rose unsteadily be man mad to admit what have seen must not make remark stared at tongue tied vicar still continued dreamy absent minded then owed poor horran one thousand pound with interest went on slowly people might have said that have murdered then be innocent gasped miss baird clarke looked up sharply struck by speech significance of tone innocent said in clear vigorous voice be innocent of course never thought that be guilty well person who saw who be asked clarke quickly decline to mention name matter no matter be surprised that must believe guilty of wicked deed clarice have known for year yet now seems that know at if will explain yes will explain at once must have explained before to police frank wickedness frank death oh clasped hand together in agony of sorrow be ever man tried so hardly a have be hush say nothing sit down let collect thought will tell everything be about visit to poor horran on night nothing else need be talked about own affair be own affair unable to remain seated rose walked up down room trying to compose clarice wondering what be about to say resumed seat watched in silence after time mr clarke recovered self control still walking told that wanted to know saw horran one afternoon explained remember what said at inquest noticed that bedroom window be open so slipped in anxious to gain time from horran to pay interest did not wish to be sold up know so told everything be very angry with questioned clarice not with certainly not with barras be in fault have told barras to lend thousand pound for a long a required there be question of interest when mentioned ten per cent horran declared that knew nothing about must have be told before such interest have be charged have never intended must be hampered in way loan be to be from friend to friend be strange mused clarke that in three year more barras must never have mentioned to horran that have charged interest evidently charged interest secretly said clarice after thoughtful pause naturally must say nothing about then saw uncle henry frequently during three year why did not mention horran never during earlier interview touched on subject of loan matter be never discussed be only of late when found must not pay interest wished to speak of difficulty then jerce must not allow to see old friend be quite right said clarice reproachfully seeing how ill uncle henry be did upset know barras upset expostulated vicar be angry with barras not with declared must have spoken before also said that jerce have right to prevent seeing that there be need for to go to front door when wished to see said must enter by french window be generally open yes be said miss baird thinking of difference of opinion existed between two doctor why did choose so late hour to enter by way clarke hesitated looked down be much disturbed on night of crime have received bad news unable to sleep walked in garden on bitterly cold night oh thaw have come by time know left garden walked about town have idea of going to see horran for at time knew that must be asleep however walked back to vicarage up lane saw light in bedroom window open be certain that be open asked clarice entered by a thought must see if horran be asleep awake then well be asleep awake be dead said vicar with great emotion be lying in bed with clothes in disorder breast streaming with blood with clothes in disorder echoed clarice raising why when saw poor uncle henry corpse clothes be carefully arranged smoothed did said mr clarke in broken voice saw that be dead so arranged clothes hastily went away without touching anything in room why did not give alarm why cried clarke astonished when might have be accused of committing crime be fool clarice mere presence at hour must have accused returned home said nothing about what have seen be few minute past two o'clock when regained bed clarice asked question in low anxious voice did see anyone within without house saw one heard nothing who be saw zara dump who have gone out late at night to procure medicine for mother why did not accuse did to prudence so made prudence give up ferdy whom zara wish to marry then zara made false accusation wonder that daughter believed did not at first explained clarice prudence found blood on cuff of shirt have worn very likely when be arranging bedclothes of murdered friend blood must easily have got on to cuff so be why prudence gave up brother thought did so because wished why did wish clarke be pleased once yes said vicar sadly for then did not know what know now about frank never mention name never speak of be not master of when think think mr clarke clutched scanty lock with hand rushed suddenly from room clarice did not wish to call back since knew that wished to know clarke be innocent have not set eye upon brother so far ferdy be safe who must have written that anonymous letter until author of be discovered clarice knew that must have peace of mind a always must be apprehensive lest ferdy must be arrested afternoon clarice puzzled over what be best to be done remained in room with aching head feigned illness be rapidly turning to real one so sick did feel with worry anxiety then received surprise anthony card be brought up mr rebson said that be waiting for in drawing room why be here clarice asked then hastily arranging attire went down filled with nervous fear clarice said anthony abruptly coming forward with outstretched hand have made discovery must tell at once what have found out in whitechapel have be there what about ferdy left in charge of fellow be still at gattlinsands wait will explain later news consumptive chap attended by jerce one of purple fern murderer be who do think none other than frank clarke vicar son chapter xxii anonymous letter announcement of ackworth be so terrible so unexpected that clarice must scarcely believe ear knew that frank clarke be rascal extravagant that be selfish dishonourable never entered head that must turn out to be cold blooded murderer wonder vicar who have forgiven much to prodigal son have stopped short of finally pardoning such unmitigated scoundrel must have known what frank be said clarice involuntarily who must have known asked anthony quickly mr clarke be here short time ago must not let mention son name must know yes clarice struck hand together be why refused to let prudence marry ferdy thought that be prudence who refused to marry ferdy yes for reason told that reason accusation of mr clarke by zara dump remember anthony ruffled hair in sore perplexity what have done about have seen zara have seen that girl when where last night in london at mascot music hall at own room look surprised be must not have gone to room let alone mascot music hall know to save ferdy did so be just a well that went for several reason oh have much to tell clarice drew lover to sofa with gentle force perhaps will be angry with said must trust remarked ackworth slowly trust have not be misplaced have done what may think rather bold thing still in case what have learned be so important that can safely say that end have justified mean what have done anthony looked apprehensive tapped cheek nothing to make colour up in way dear boy will tell everything when have explained how came to find out about frank clarke oh will not take long asked ferdy down yesterday a desired to do came without suspicion that wanted out of way have very jolly evening at least ferdy have for be worrying about wondering what be doing also must admit that have detective fever what be asked miss baird opening eye well errand wanted to execute raised curiosity to fever heat felt must not rest until have learned name of jerce consumptive patient especially when remembered that be one of purple fern triumvirate next morning have duty to attend to so handed ferdy over to irish chap who must amuse keep eye on then bunked off to london by ten o'clock train did not come up to see what be doing asked clarice in suspicious manner did not even know that be in london replied anthony rather wounded by doubt in case a intended to trust must not have spied upon ask pardon dear kissed ackworth accepted delightful apology continued went down to whitechapel have deuce of hunt to find tea street came across kind of sister of mercy who knew about jerce philanthropic mission jerce have surgery in tea street go there twice week usually at night sister anne so told be called reminded of bluebeard showed where consumptive young man have lived police have be there after jerce have communicated that letter to scotland yard what letter one given by dying man to jerce warning that might be attacked by osip if remember sick chap confessed that be one of member of triumvirate according to sister anne young man be called felix exton police found stray letter in room showed that be really frank clarke son of vicar clarice nodded expect police came down told mr clarke about discovery poor man wonder suffers so terribly will not allow son name to be mentioned that miserable frank yet remember handsome bright young man be bad lot said ackworth emphatically scarcely blame man for striking blow in hot blood to murder in such cold blooded way a adopted by purple fern gang be too terrible to think of now that know frank clarke be assassin must seem a if instinct to murder be hereditary said clarice quickly must not think so badly of vicar anthony be innocent related to lover mr clarke have explained to humph said ackworth when ended be very plausible tale have only vicar word for truth be to interest to exonerate son be connected with osip so clarke through frank may be connected also with blackguard wish must be found osip mean wonder with personality have not be spotted saw said clarice unexpectedly anthony rose with startled gesture yes said faintly at mascot music young man looked at anxiously clarice said taking cold hand look pale mr rebson said something about having influenza yet be all right when saw last clarice nodded might say that caught cold a be afraid must do when be in porch ca say that because be not true be quite well look have not influenza mean corrected pretended to be ill so that might carry out scheme what scheme one have in mind when asked to trust anthony want to tell do trust still of course do laid hand caressingly on head be afraid that will blame in why clarice might well utter name in astonished tone for hair so lightly pinned on head came off plait remained in hand there sat with head cropped like man pale smile on face intended to tell said quietly be just a well that have found out in way found out what why have cut off beautiful hair think that look rather like ferdy very want to look like ferdy prefer a be dear dear echoed doe that mean forgiveness for what anthony looked more puzzled than ever for masquerade cut off hair dressed in suit of ferdy clothes went to london a ferdy stopped at favourite hotel also went to mascot music hall a ferdy to zara dump flat a ferdy learned great deal anthony stared at open mouthed do mean to say that dressed a man asked aghast yes be necessary to learn ferdy secret so utilised resemblance to to find out what wanted one discovered be clarice baird save zara oh lord anthony clutched head will tell everyone have made that right know too much about zara for to betray be quite safe only zara know mr rebson know now know be absolutely safe what made do mad thing have told to save ferdy must have gone up interrupted clarice imperiously zara must have laughed at did what did with full knowledge of what be doing must forgive anthony think will when learn what terrible thing have discovered of course be somewhat annoyed said ackworth slowly at least must be be ordinary woman be so clever so well able to look after that forgive time must ask not to masquerade again a ferdy promise that said with sigh ferdy be in such danger that must help ferdy in danger what sort of danger let begin at beginning go on to end interrupt anthony then related adventure ackworth held peace until detailed recognition of osip when jumped with muttered oath why did not have arrested cried everything must then have be discovered yes even to fact that ferdy be implicated in terrible crime said clarice sarcastically ackworth jumped again revelation be getting on nerve what do mean asked irritably let go on from where saw osip said clarice continued recital up to point when fainted in ferdy bedroom with stamp in hand now what do say asked breathlessly know what to say muttered ackworth much agitated look a though ferdy knew something yet if be locked in room must not have murdered horran oh for one moment believe that did having stamp might have impressed purple fern on nonsense interrupted soldier violently be drunk incapable be locked in clarice looked down anthony said in pained voice have tried to fight against doubt of ferdy will come be so weak so tricky so deceitful so carried away by own selfish impulse that be capable of thing save murder ferdy be fool grant murderer never accused of murder said girl faintly may be accomplice be just a bad not when know ferdy be so weak man osip be strong willed may have coerced ferdy into stamping uncle henry forehead after death of osip be guilty yes firmly believe from warning sent that osip be guilty then mean to say that osip went upstairs after killing horran released ferdy brought down to osip must not know where ferdy room be must not know that be drunk locked up ferdy might have feigned drunkenness so a to induce to lock up have ever done so before oh yes punished ferdy in way besides be afraid that in drunken mood might wander about house perhaps set place on fire ferdy always resented locking up in instance if be likely to be implicated in crime forced to be accomplice by stronger will of osip locked door must provide convenient alibi ferdy might have pretended drunkenness then have released with key have done what said anthony did not immediately reply stood before clarice biting nail thinking when went up to town morning said slowly ferdy asked to get letter might be waiting for at sir daniel jerce place in harley street yes ferdy life with well jerce be away have be for time down in whitechapel think servant said be just a well why asked clarice rising a ackworth took three letter from pocket because might have seen especial letter addressed to ferdy letter stamped with purple fern clarice took square envelope held out be addressed to brother at jerce house on flap of envelope in purple wax be stamped small fern few people unless looked very closely must have noticed fern certainly nine people out of ten must not have connected stamp with crime unless murder be in mind apparently tenth more observant person be anthony intend to take letter to ferdy make open in presence said ackworth oh clarice what be doing be opening letter said girl calmly take responsibility for doing so will tell ferdy still be not quite right to open not quite right repeated clarice fiercely do think care for when ferdy neck may be at stake do opened letter in most deliberate way well knowing what be doing now will read anthony must not admit that clarice be right secretly thought that must be better for to read letter than for police to scan content read quietly enough then passed to lover there be masked ball at shah room to night said irrelevantly be there said anthony puzzled why read letter ackworth did so contained only few line saying that writer wanted to meet mr ferdinand baird at shah room on evening on particular business after last night wrote anonymous correspondent for there be name appended to note can scarcely wonder that insist upon meeting can guess who be wear red domino with white favour will wear purple domino with golden star meet at ten o'clock under omar khayym palm in desert anthony read twice wonder who wrote said osip replied clarice promptly what be more excuse hastily left room much to amazement of anthony have plenty to think about until returned did almost immediately with open letter in hand be anonymous note sent to said clarice handing to looking over shoulder see writing be distinctly similar be osip who tried to stop marriage by threatening ferdy now osip thinking that ferdy saw at mascot music hall last night want to arrange meeting why asked ackworth recognising that handwriting be indeed similar ca tell that until see osip clarice how can see osip evening be now five can catch seven train up can see a saw last night wo tell clarice baird anything may tell ferdy baird lot do want to disguise again said ackworth looking angry must must said eagerly if be to save brother to go to room be respectable oh what doe matter said clarice impatiently go a young man one will recognise ferdy stop to night at gattlinsands promised must release from promise declared obstinately ackworth bit lip like said decidedly then be not man took for retorted girl must have thought be above conventional rubbish anthony be to be wife must trust in way do be sure have proved trust in ah did not know what be about to do said clarice rather unjustly now that do know refuse to trust only wish to go alone to shah room will be quite safe one will know osip be murderer said ackworth may kill why must kill interpolated thinking be ferdy baird who recognised at mascot music hall dare say that belief that have told police now seek revenge will risk that clarice be brave girl wo let go alone will come up with to night ferdy must be kept away flanigan will attend to will cut over to gattlinsands arrange that there can catch train will meet at junction seven o'clock come by will go together wo tell police about osip not until learn a ferdy exact relation

of gay party caravan of camel horse donkey took band of pleasure seeker from oasis to oasis into desert to dine at one of bedouin encampment for entertainment there be mirage skilfully managed with magic lantern foray of wild arab story teller relating arabian night must be hired singer must be obtained dancing girl must be engaged eastern fortune teller be frequently employed to read future by mean of sand diagram be very new very amusing very fantastical so be little wonder that shah room be crowded nightly must be deserted when novelty wore off just now fashionable london be delighted with sham life in sham east anthony clarice arrived about nine o'clock went at once to great dancing saloon where masked ball be in progress clarice have again assumed ferdy evening dress ackworth be astonished to see how closely resembled brother when tricked out in masculine attire a anthony knew much more of way mean of midnight london than be good for have taken clarice to costumier shop in drury lane there have procured necessary domino for adventure that of ackworth be merely one of black silk plain unpretentious clarice wore red cloak with bunch of loose white ribbon on breast so osip might recognise gazing at dancer dress two looked vainly for purple domino with gold star costume be nowhere to be seen then clarice reminded companion that meeting be to take place in desert so hither bent step pending arrival of osip partook of hasty supper be hungry for hurry of getting up from country have left time to eat what be to do when osip come for asked anthony remain here answered clarice looking round wo go out of sight promise if do will follow said ackworth resolutely be not going to let remain alone with known murderer have brought clarice looked sideways saw that be holding heavy army revolver under fold of domino wo require to use said hastily if osip mean anything by asking for meeting with ferdy be that wish to escape will therefore not try to hurt in way ca trust such scoundrel said ackworth quietly if go out of sight follow remember that be seated under tent on extreme verge of desert between be small turkish table upon stood tray heaped with eastern food when coffee came be close upon ten o'clock anthony lighted cigarette also offered one to clarice who took smiling thought did not like to smoke said do must keep up character of ferdy be rarely without cigarette in mouth look at mirage be extremely pretty for on far horizon out of air seemingly grew delicate ethereal vision of spire temple embattled wall white glorious against blue sky quivering with heat clarice be too restless to be tempted with such pleasure walked out of tent while ackworth settled with arab attendant here there looked in vain for purple domino must see sign desert be filling rapidly there be much laughter much talking camel paced about in stately manner troupe of bedouin be performing raid displaying wonderful horsemanship from near tent came chatter of merry people enjoying unaccustomed food shortly anthony adjusting mask joined stood watching for coming of man who be so ardently wanted by police in few minute ackworth touched clarice arm drew attention silently to couple of men in evening dress unmasked who be walking towards oasis distance away clarice nearly betrayed by feminine scream of surprise when beheld sir daniel jerce arm in arm with lawyer what doe that mean asked in low astonished voice anthony shrugged square shoulder there be nothing remarkable about that said lightly jerce suppose feel need of little excitement after hard work so come here be not kind of place must expect to visit said miss baird staring after retreating figure with mr barras too who be driest most uninteresting of men must not have thought that must go in for amusement of kind humph barras like jerce may have two side to character side know of scarcely seem to be respectable retorted girl who felt uneasy at sight of two men wish must follow anthony added a jerce companion entered central oasis learn why be here see what good must do dear besides wish to keep eye on osip hush mention name there may be spy about wonder when will come anthony glanced at watch want two minute to ten remarked quickly have better go to omar khayym palm go alone said clarice hastily if did not mention name see with wo address where be palm speak of in central oasis said ackworth pointing see golden palm on verge disappear into oasis clarice will come after get chap to converse where can see from tent will smoke have drink keep eye on clarice nodded leaving anthony to re seat at turkish table walked slowly towards golden palm be distance away be artificial tree of gigantic height nearly touched glass roof shut in fairy desert under saw already waiting man clothed in purple domino glittering with gold star stood smoking cigar gazed at mirage now enveloped in rosy colour be here said clarice touching on arm man wheeled quickly looked searchingly at red domino with white favour said softly will please remove mask mr baird anticipating girl have already loosened string next moment osip if be osip found staring into face of individual took to be ferdy a gave nod of satisfaction clarice spoke to in turn will now remove mask asked replacing own man glanced round seeing that one be sufficiently near to examine closely slipped off mask clarice beheld thin face woefully scarred especially on cheek criss cross mark have be entirely obliterated one at casual glance must have recognised osip a have be did great credit to mr dump power of observation that have so rapidly guessed on stage too that acrobat who played chrysalis be assassin so anxiously sought for be satisfied asked osip replacing mask suppose be man said clarice trying to appear calm shivering little a thought of what companion have done only know by sight remember did mr dump tell last night yes how recognised without criss cross mark can not say replied clarice quietly oh trust woman to jump to conclusion said coolly might have be lean figure shape of head general air that knew by certainly congratulate mr dump on cleverness be wrong in saying that know by sight saw in high street of crumel clarice suddenly recollected that ferdy have noticed man in grey have told jerce about be only passing glance protested must never have remembered ah be not woman said osip thoroughly imposed upon by disguise manly bearing can not speak here someone might overhear have to be careful ended with slight laugh ugh said clarice shuddered why do do asked osip suddenly curiously granted that be what be be better mr baird clarice felt a though cold water be running through vein what do mean faltered think know what mean retorted osip will camp in desert where there will be wide space round one can come within ear shot without being seen come led way towards sandy track beckoning to picturesquely attired waiter to follow clarice cast look in direction of anthony who be watching at tent door followed in short space of time sham arab attendant be bavarian have spread carpet have arranged pillow also placed turkish stool in middle waited for order scarred man reclined on one set of pillow signalled to clarice that must recline on other did will have turkish coffee narghile asked must be strictly eastern here know clarice accepted although secretly doubted if must smoke narghile shortly attendant brought what be wanted then went away miss baird found smoking drinking in company with scoundrel who have killed eight people shivered again a waiter retreated be left comparatively alone osip noticed be cold air company asked jeeringly company said clarice tartly oh then like doe draw to like must think after what have done mr baird must be le scrupulous dare to accuse of murdering ta ta ta let have heroic please do think that if did not hold life in hand must risk being here with so running chance of capture be in same boat mr baird if be hanged for murder will swing beside promise took clarice self control to keep quiet after ferdy really be guilty of murder have only to learn how have contrived to escape from locked room osip apparently knew about impatiently awaited recital have not be masked must have observed pallor of face perhaps suspicion must have be aroused a be quite believed to be brother talked on leisurely owing to solitary position one must approach within hearing distance without being seen by watchful osip of course know why did murder said osip in low rapid voice be be coerced what power have jerce over to make commit crime jerce clarice dropped snaky twist of narghile be last name expected to hear yes snapped osip imperiously oh need try to hide doings ever since frank clarke betrayed on death bed scoundrel have be watching jerce why did search asked clarice perplexed osip raised angrily on elbow will pretend ignorance said sharply when know quite well that frank clarke gave jerce gold box containing stamp searched jerce to find have not got on did not know what have become of now be certain that gave stamp to so that might impress purple fern on horran forehead so make police believe murder be of piece with other crime be quite wrong said clarice keeping nerve in wonderful manner considering terrible communication gold box be found on terrace where have dropped did not drop jerce must have guessed why be searching have flung aside where be gold box now jerce took to scotland yard clever daring villain said osip bitterly stamp know where be be not in box jerce have removed previously have given to what fool be to carry box about with when did give stamp to never did what be use of denying thing cried osip angrily striking with clenched fist on table be seen in horran bedroom after two o'clock in morning impressing purple fern on body of victim be after clarke have fled mr baird expect just a killed horran heard clarke coming so concealed when parson went away afraid lest must be accused doubt came out from hiding place stamped forehead then returned to own room pretended innocence who told zara dump told after last night knew who be a mother told went to room to day wanted to have arrested told must accuse of killing horran for knew that accused clarke have be near laurel about time of murder how did know learned from clarke yes

part mr baird england be getting too hot for so intend to leave country barras jerce be in league in way barras be horran lawyer so league may have something to do with property perhaps have murmured clarice white a corpse under mask felt that must be impossible to sustain manly character much longer under accumulated horror pah said osip scornfully a rose to foot what be use of pretending know everything a do care if did murder horran a commit murder have fellow feeling for such daring in fact rather admire mr baird if must remain in england must propose partnership since partner be dead there be heap of money to be made with purple fern yet know what villain be cried clarice involuntarily pooh say that because be new to criminal business be more villain than swindling stockbroker in city one of pious chapel going hypocrite who sweat employ must get rid of conscience if want to succeed mr baird although admit that have made excellent start be clever idea to use purple fern stamp to shift murder of horran on to shoulder know that be accused know that be innocent of crime perhaps not of others of four others said osip politely murdered four people clarke murdered one third partner who be hanged poor chap killed remaining two invented purple fern murder syndicate so have to do most of work stop stop must try harden a have taken fancy to for boldness for cleverness in

stammered clarice hoarsely well saw stamp corpse stop for heaven sake stop cried girl sick with fear for miserable brother fell forward on turkish table on outstretched arm not insensible nearly so by time desert be crowded with people many be wandering aimlessly here there near at hand camel be grunting mule squealing arab shrieking nautch girl be dancing busy glittering life of pleasure hummed everywhere with feverish persistency osip rather amazed at what took to be baird unmanly weakness be about to stoop raise when saw ackworth running rapidly forward did not know soldier saw that man be bearing straight down on trap trap said osip with glare at clarice overheard gasped with last effort be woman baird sister damn breathed osip thoroughly taken aback casting one fearful look around at people whose attention be now attracted slipped away amongst crowd anthony raced up breathless what have done let give alarm must be clarice clutched arm desperately raised to foot for sake for ferdy for then fainted in earnest heat heat said ackworth sharply to officious attendant friend ill health delicate boy will look after get out clear way damn crowd accepting natural excuse fell back chapter xxiv ferdinand baird at next day late in afternoon clarice sat in drawing room of laurel waiting for arrival of several people be very wet day rain beat drowsily against window through

jerce power must be sent to prison never intended to kill uncle henry why did jerce want killed asked ackworth suddenly well said that uncle henry disease puzzled that reason must not be found out unless be dead body be examined be scientific curiosity pshaw said anthony while clarice heard explanation with incredulous horror do mean to tell that jerce must place neck in noose in order to gain

about uncle henry becoming suspicious of business must exactly make out what be meant ended ferdy gathered that finance of estate estate be wrong can see said clarice quickly can understand barras told lie when said that gave uncle henry forty thousand in gold gave to jerce made uncle henry scapegoat nothing wrong be ever suspected by poor uncle henry told day before be murdered that must find everything in order well did yes said clarice indignantly because mr barras cooked account put blame of missing thousand on to poor guardian who must not defend villain knew ferdy knew did not tell

sister quickly yes be lighted candle looked at watch then drank water sat on bed to think of what must do felt jolly miserable can tell said ferdy in aggrieved tone what with debt being in love with prudence with zara worrying with jerce making thing hot then thought that must be best to go down see uncle henry tell remembering conversation of jerce barras fancied that account be wrong that if jerce made hot for over bill uncle henry must make hot for jerce swear cried ferdy again that when went down stair never intended to lay hand on man who have be like father to intended to tell throw on mercy how did get out when have locked in ferdy cast contemptuous look on why have key of course locked in several time thought be safe must get out whenever liked unlocked door went down to see

stabbed to heart with bedclothes disarranged very nearly gave alarm then thought that a uncle henry be dead have to do be to stamp forehead with purple fern to get cheque from jerce into possession be about to do so said ferdy frankly while sister groaned at fresh instance of callous wickedness when heard noise outside slipped under bed why on earth did do demanded anthony bluntly be very natural protested ferdy sulkily be afraid lest murderer must return kill of course did want anyone to see beside dead body of uncle henry considering circumstance fancied chalk might be coming dreaded lest must get into trouble a have business in room at time oh there be plenty of reason for to make scarce well be chalk said clarice tapping foot impatiently be old clarke came in at window calling softly on uncle henry heard voice peeped out to see nearly squealed when spotted body so think that be guilty then groaned prayed for reason arranged bedclothes smoothly afterwards cut a hard a must frightened out of life a be in few minute crept out stamped corpse forehead be only thing must do to put square with jerce when crept upstairs locked again in room thought that everything be safe be grumbled ferdy apparently thinking aggrieved zara be knocking about spotted through window made break off with prudence by threatening to tell police said that prudence must let off zara said must manage did too by telling poor girl mr clarke have committed crime swear have finished ferdy generously be that questioned clarice when ended out of breath what more do wish to say asked ferdy indignantly be not to blame a must help uncle henry being killed never forged cheque be name know clarry only altered figure little swear never stabbed uncle henry just stamped with fern be abominable thing to do cried ackworth angrily see said young man obstinately what did matter when uncle henry be dead have to get even with jerce save somehow did too jerce when came for post mortem saw stamp on forehead gave back cheque right enough burnt so no one can harm in way think be making great row over nothing ended ferdy in injured tone a be quite innocent clarice looked at anthony anthony at clarice in despair of be amazed at callous view ferdy took of case really did not seem to be aware of enormity of fault looked upon crime for crime be a merely mistake of ordinary life perhaps anthony for clarice be too heart broken to speak must have proceeded to lecture ferdy on iniquity that ring came to front door jane at miss baird foot raised head ackworth went to drawing room door when opened cheerful bland voice of sir daniel jerce be heard remarking on bad weather to mr rebson at once jane began to growl flew across room anthony catch cried clarice young man have only time to grip jane by scruff of neck swing aside when doctor entered room jerce looked quiet smiling apparently have idea of danger of position laughed when saw jane snapping snarling with blazing eye picture of impotent wrath really wonder why dog hate so said sir daniel shrugging know better than do retorted clarice sternly chapter xxv whole truth sir daniel looked surprised when heard clarice remark glanced from to ferdy saw that brother sister be white troubled feeling absolutely safe never ascribed emotion to anything connected with advancing to fire warmed hand smiled more blandly than ever must think must know by time miss baird said cheerfully wet weather be clarice said nothing ferdy evaded eye of jerce while anthony having put jane out into garden returned closed drawing room door considering what be to be said be best a thought to keep conversation a private a possible doctor also noted that ackworth looked stern white by time showed slight uneasiness a trouble be too palpably in air for to ignore perhaps thought of betrayal crossed mind for suddenly looked apprehensively at young baird ferdy dodged eye again doctor to break oppressive silence made uneasy joke be very quiet said smiling in wry way be because have forgotten manner have not shaken hand ask pardon will do so now miss baird said clarice putting hand behind back wonder that have assurance even to speak to considering that asked down be strange speech said jerce frowning losing suave look thought that be satisfied with assurance that never wrote that anonymous letter of complained know that did not write in case will be glad to know why greet in way said jerce in icy tone be that captain ackworth be angry with because dared to love said anthony in turn to save further surmise a to what be matter allow to inform dr jerce sir daniel if please interrupted other large face becoming watchful cunning give proper title can do said clarice who be restraining wrath with great difficulty be scoundrel indeed said jerce blanching wincing maintaining composure in most wonderful manner considering provocation regret that must call old friend by so harsh name old friend who plotted death of be lie broke in jerce with sudden flash of rage never intended horran harm by own mouth be condemned said anthony quickly miss baird never mentioned name why must think that meant mr horran ask because horran be dead death be mentioned said jerce striving to extricate from difficulty perhaps will explain why have be asked here to be insulted must rather that police insulted asked anthony coldly
