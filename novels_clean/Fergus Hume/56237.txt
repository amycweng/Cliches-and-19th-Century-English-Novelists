lady branwin must stop for night must have be dead then muttered audrey shivering heard noise heard nothing neither did husband badoura left lady branwin quite comfortable shortly before eight o'clock assassin must have opened window murdered almost immediately after left why be murdered asked shawe insistently ca say sir more than can say how assassin managed to enter court why added madame coralie quickly so sure be that court can not be entered that window of bedroom be never fastened must therefore not be difficult for assassin to enter expect that found lady branwin asleep so quickly after left interrupted inspector gave lady branwin sleeping draught explained madame coralie a nerve be bad must not rest for treatment intended to give be necessary that nerve must be in better order audrey nodded remember said gravely mamma be very much agitated when came here very restless why asked lanton sharply on account of desire for treatment feared madame coralie must not give mamma explained that to then of course there be diamond oh audrey started where be diamond inspector lanton pricked up ear looked at madame coralie diamond repeated where be diamond madame coralie started

morocco bag intended to take to jeweller get reset a stopped here took bag out of motor carried into house with saw red bag said madame coralie much agitated swear did not know that contained diamond lady branwin did not mention what bag contained paid attention to be bag in room asked lanton looking round must be must be said madame coralie beginning to search have such bag with remember that did not notice what did with why must not knowing contained diamond thorough search be made without result audrey again described bag mentioned that mother have attached small label to so that owner must be known if be lost inspector lanton seized on last word did expect to be lost certainly not intended understood from own lip to take diamond to jeweller because remained here took bag in with must be somewhere in hand of assassin probably remarked shawe nodding lanton looked at do think robbery be motive for murder yes do since diamond be missing else why must lady branwin who have enemy be strangled assassin must have known that have jewel with must have climbed wall of court to gain entrance by window be there no footmark have not searched court muttered lanton doubtfully mention of diamond put different complexion on case paused for moment then scrambled through window crossed court at foot of wall near closed door picked up scrap of paper be label called out triumphantly evidently string became loose fell off while thief be making off with plunder then turned to examine door uttered cry a peered down to look through key hole door have be opened declared loudly key be in lock on outside ah said ralph with satisfaction now be on trail of assassin catch screamed madame coralie fiercely catch hang chapter iv inquest there be many interesting item of news in newspaper when turkish shop tragedy took place for be middle of london season social event succeeded one rapidly nevertheless affair created sensation a lady branwin be wife of millionaire well known figure in society especially did female population of mayfair belgravia comment on murder a having taken place in own particular pet shop concerned nearly be dreadful to think that if one of passed night under madame coralie roof death might be result many declared that must never go near place again be when news of crime be fresh startling later lady saw reason to revise opinion since there be one madame coralie to perform miracle of rejuvenation immediate result of murder be to send sir joseph branwin to bed be burly red faced man who ate drank largely so be not surprising that announcement of wife terrible death must cause to have fit when grasped truth dropped down straightway for quite two week be unable to leave bed to attend to necessary matter be at inquest at funeral daughter along with ralph shawe have to look after everything sir joseph be not grateful never be being singularly selfish man be quite surprise to audrey that must have fallen ill when told truth daresay be fonder of mamma than thought said to ralph blamed for having misjudged father yet always quarrelled did not seem to get on at well together quarrelling may have be matter of habit said shawe doubtfully married couple may be devoted to one yet may be always bickering think audrey that told parent marriage be love match of romantic nature so mamma said replied girl nodding gravely papa be boy girl together at bleakleigh promised to marry when made fortune year afterwards returned to keep promise papa mamma be child of labourer so must think remarked ralph caustically remembering excessively plebeian look of couple can never understand how come to be daughter audrey be more like than lily be like cabbage rose audrey nodded head absently a be thinking of other thing what will verdict of inquest be demanded anxiously in absence of proof likely to identify assassin there can only be one verdict wilful murder against person person unknown oh do think then that there be more than one assassin dear inclusion of plural be merely matter of form undoubtedly poor lady branwin be murdered by one person only man who afterwards stole jewel think be man then in absence of evidence presume so by way audrey how be that mother have label attached to red morocco bag be unusual oh be peculiarity of mamma nature attached label to almost everything took out of door a always seemed to fancy that what carried might be lost in way a thought provided against contingency papa used to laugh at for care with prepared little piece of parchment jokingly said that must have be baggage porter poor mamma audrey sighed be strange that odd habit must be mean of tracing murderer have not traced unfortunately said ralph shaking head finding of label at foot of wall undoubtedly show that escaped in way be strange that must have left key in lock very strange assented shawe emphatically show how deliberate be in behaviour must have known that have plenty of time to escape even then smarter man must have taken key with be one of mistake cleverest criminal make how did get key from madame coralie did not madame declares that never have key to door in court wall a be never used certainly have never be opened during tenancy key used be what be known a skeleton key such a burglar carry then assassin be burglar think so one of criminal class at event a amateur must have managed so cleverly leaving of key however be mistake can be traced by doubt if can door open on to alley paved with stone footmark can be found from time man left court by door be safe dear if there be chance of being taken will be by mean of diamond even be doubtful all have to do be to unset stone sell separately be anxious to hear what further evidence may be collected by lanton for inquest shawe anxiety be quite unnecessary a very little evidence be forthcoming when inquest be held inspector did what must to trace assassin be like looking for needle in bottle of hay great crowd collected outside building wherein inquest be held few people be admitted audrey came with lover a be necessary that must state how mother have be in possession of missing jewel ralph came with a moral support sir joseph unfortunately must not attend owing to illness sent solicitor to watch case on behalf ordered that everything must be done to trace assassin even to offering reward of one thousand pound for villain apprehension offer being well known before inquest took place brought many people to hear what must of evidence in hope of being able to lay murderer by heel claim money a have before be stated lanton did not allow general public to crowd room wherein proceeding took place inspector lanton be first witness gave succinct account of how have be called in when fact of murder became known detailed that have learnt produced plan of building wherein crime have taken place also label together with key of court door stated name of witness proposed to call of doctor who have examined body of unfortunate woman be first to follow lanton in giving evidence deposed that deceased have be strangled so far a must judge from condition of body at eight o'clock in evening have made examination at next morning almost immediately fact of murder have be discovered doctor evidence be short dry provided clue whereby to trace assassin a creature have left behind nothing by must be identified madame coralie came next appeared perhaps for purpose of advertisement in turkish dress wearing yashmak before entering court have drawn inspector lanton aside to ask not to request to remove yashmak on ground that must be detrimental to business lanton then saw for drew aside veil to reveal truth madame coralie have disfiguring birthmark on cheek mouth chin made look anything attractive naturally a pointed out if customer knew that must not remove birthmark from own face must scarcely a might think do claimed towards beautifying lanton pointed out that a have already made reputation birthmark did not matter a quite saw point recognised reason why woman concealed lower part of face passed round word to coroner jury that be needle for yashmak to be removed madame coralie therefore gave evidence holding silken covering over mouth a only black eye be visible presented weird figure many of illustrated paper have picture of in odd dress many be comment thereon of a madame coralie knew probably counted upon be good for business woman stated that received lady branwin on night of murder for purpose of diagnosing case that might be treated a to complexion figure lady branwin decided to remain for night madame coralie told to miss branwin when girl called at shop according to instruction from mother on way to theatre lady branwin be then in bed madame did not see again until next morning at seven when went to rouse discovered that be dead window looking into court be open said witness although have closed on previous night did not lock of course a one ever entered court none of window of ground floor bedroom be locked then window must easily have be opened from outside asked coroner making note oh yes be not even snicked replied witness there be necessity a one must enter court save from house by door in court wall be proved very conclusively that court door have not be opened since madame have taken house also door leading into court from building have rarely be opened one wanted to go into court explained madame again insisted upon point left lady branwin quite cheerful in bed at about ten minute to eight o'clock came up to still room about five minute to eight assistant zobeide be in room so be husband mr vail also believe that two other girl of mine badoura parizade be behind curtain of room attending to hair skin wash husband drew attention to fact be sure be five minute to eight when be in room be coroner question be positive be emphatic reply eddy husband mentioned a went out that be five minute after eight have be talking to for ten minute more le result of statement be that edmund vail be called proved that what wife have asserted be correct mentioned by talking with finger to zobeide who be deaf that be five minute to eight o'clock immediately before wife entered talked to of business private business for time left house by side door ten minute later zobeide who gave evidence through interpreter of deaf dumb language corroborated evidence be well established that madame coralie have be with two witness from five minute to eight until five minute past eight being case since lady branwin be murdered at eight o'clock madame coralie must not be guilty of crime yet before evidence have be given several people have hinted at complicity what be said by vail zobeide indeed afterwards by badoura parizade provided with alibi beyond question madame coralie be afterwards recalled questioned about diamond denied knowledge of saying that lady branwin brought in red morocco bag with label attached of took greatest care did not mention to what be in bag said madame emphatically when tucked in for night placed under pillow never thought of asking question witness also stated that have never possessed key to court wall door did not recognise one produced to jury house door leading into court be locked key have be left with others on nail in still room one must have got into court by door on night stated madame coralie a to remaining door out of husband went when left be at end of long passage on ground floor lead into right of way can be approached from walpole lane locked myself after have seen miss branwin at street door took key to room one must have entered house after a side door street door be locked when assistant retired to bed audrey evidence be confined to fact that mother have taken two thousand pound worth of diamond to get certain of reset have intended to take straight to jeweller having arranged to consult with madame coralie subsequently to remain for night have taken bag out of motorcar into house label produced be in mother handwriting audrey stated lady branwin fancy for labelling anything took out of door on whole a coroner remarked evidence be satisfactory if did not prove who have committed murder certainly exonerated who be in house have be proved that madame coralie four assistant slept in two room opened into one also madame have be with other people at very time when crime according to medical evidence have be committed undoubtedly robbery be motive for committal of crime probably strangling have be unpremeditated lady branwin be coroner reading of what have happened have gone to sleep with diamond under pillow a madame coralie have stated be only reasonable to believe that have awakened to find robber removing jewel natural outcry be prevented immediately by strangulation since assassin a man have become must silence in other way then criminal have escaped by window through have entered through door of court wall dropping of label possibly have be loosely tied to bag be positive clue to way in man have got away presence of skeleton key in door be further evidence thing being taken into consideration be apparent that blame must be attached to madame coralie to assistant there be not slightest breath of suspicion against in way jury added coroner must be well advised to return open verdict result of speech recollection of meagre evidence placed before be verdict ralph shawe have predicted wilful murder against person person unknown be statement of foreman inquest ended with belief in many mind that murder of lady branwin must have to be added to already long list of undiscovered crime chattering arguing greatly disappointed that nothing more tangible have resulted from proceeding everyone went way reporter hastened to several paper with detail more le veracious of have taken place one fact be certain that murder so far be mystery lady branwin be duly buried at kensal green amidst large concourse of people many be letter telegram of condolence sir joseph received for week so paragraph appeared in paper suggesting possible clue offer of one thousand pound reward prompted many people to keep matter of crime in mind also busybody wrote to journal insisting that turkish shop must be closed be pointed out that madame coralie have always conducted business respectably that assistant be to blame in way for what have taken place be therefore scarcely fair that woman must lose mean of livelihood for not preventing what be beyond power to prevent finally after nine day wonder matter of crime be permitted to drop into oblivion so far a general public be concerned lady branwin a someone observed be dead buried secret of murder be buried with within month wretched woman sensational death be forgotten turkish shop continued to open door there be falling off sighed madame coralie woman wo come just a if must help miserable lady branwin dying in way did wish have died anywhere in house be over be ruined however madame coralie be not ruined for business speedily picked up again also be not over for in dark at least one person be trying to trace assassin be ralph shawe attended to matter because

prettiness with madame coralie assistance so a to win back love required to be stimulated by mere beauty of form face music hall artist be respectable asked audrey suddenly oh quite said mr mellop laughing artificially wonder why ask merely heard name answered audrey quietly why do laugh mr mellop tried to stop tittering oh dear can see said gaily face betrays to think that must run after who

love dear said widow in tantalising way anyone can see when be in room everyone know that be a good a engaged to although father wo hear of marrying poor man made gesture of contempt be man after have ground to say that mr shawe run after only face dear strong desire to know about miss pearl if be said audrey with quiet scorn can exonerate ralph from being admirer of miss pearl know that be true to call ralph said visitor glibly dear what will father say want to marry lord anvers what that puny little racing man have never said anything to about mr mellop if doe will certainly refuse to entertain idea since have hinted that world know business went on looking widow straight in face can inform everyone on authority intend to marry mr shawe that be engaged with father consent dear never mind audrey be glad to see that mr mellop attention have be taken off name of rosy pearl a did not want for obvious reason to talk about lady father understand one oh dare say dear do father mr

poor husband did not leave very well off be so expensive to go about in london besides darling mother be good friend to heart be wrung audrey knew perfectly well that lady branwin have be very good friend indeed to mr mellop who be something of parasite knew also that lady heart be not wrung in least have used phrase because sounded well because wished to ingratiate with heiress not that mr mellop be bad hearted woman be simply frivolous incapable of feeling deep emotion in own silly way have be attached to late lady branwin because have found useful friend in same way be prepared to lavish willow affection on audrey mr mellop duly arrived with many box be given charming suite of apartment luxuriously furnished with civilisation must provide in way of comfort certainly life be somewhat quiet a audrey rarely left ground even when in house preferred to be alone with book music surroundings be costly food be excellent there be innumerable servant ready to obey widow beck call mr mellop during three week stay felt that be already wife of millionaire took advantage of opportunity to go out daily in one of luxurious motor car to shop extensively run up many bill on assumption that sir joseph must certainly pay when proposed shopkeeper who hitherto have be rather shy of pretty little widow trusted readily when knew that be chaperoning miss branwin saw that used sir joseph up to date vehicle also might have dropped hint two that have come to stay at camden hill house at event during halcyon time mr mellop assuredly gathered together wardrobe quantity of jewellery stood in good service afterwards when gate of millionaire eden closed behind a yet never believed that must close if did that must be within a second lady branwin meanwhile since chaperon be discreet sir joseph be at seaside audrey saw great deal of ralph because of mourning for mother must not meet a usual in kensington garden came to afternoon tea sometimes to dinner mr mellop only too anxious to get audrey married so that must prosecute matrimonial plan when millionaire returned be rarely present at meeting if be speedily got out of way on plea of fatigue that have to write letter audrey might have have chaperon so far a mr mellop be concerned be evident that little widow have taken hint given by girl at first candid interview mr mellop wrote sir joseph gushing letter about sweet child without mentioning almost constant presence of young barrister audrey ralph did not talk like lover now girl be consumed by fierce desire to hunt down assassin of mother talked of little else chance of tracing murderer ralph assured that have kept in touch with inspector lanton with police generally to say nothing of frequent visit to detective at scotland yard nothing can be found out said barrister sadly something must be found out cried audrey at last of interview if police fail must succeed father audrey made gesture of contempt father think that have done duty by offering thousand pound reward will not lift finger to find assassin of poor mother be glad be dead oh surely not remarked ralph rather shocked by blunt speech surely yes said girl bitterly did not tell before ralph because be ashamed to tell father be going to marry again shawe be startled mr mellop asked after bewildered pause although mere invitation to mr mellop that must be chaperon have caused to entertain idea of marriage do know rosy pearl music hall dancer yes well be to be future lady branwin oh audrey cried shawe greatly astonished must be mistaken have information from father own lip insisted audrey what do know of woman very little be handsome woman in style of juno be wonderful dancer heard sir joseph have be paying attention to did not dream that contemplated marriage with doe then mr mellop call painted butterfly be very substantial butterfly said shawe with ghost of smile for audrey be too much in earnest to tolerate lightness of sort believe be rather respectable woman woman a must stand in place of dead mother asked audrey looking searchingly at face rejoined ralph promptly yet ca say have heard word against rosy pearl simply mean that must not like one who have be dancer to be stepmother certainly must not said audrey decisively yet if object father a hinted be quite capable of turning out of door will do in case unless marry lord anvers what shawe flushed little reptile who know great deal about said audrey cutting short wish to hear more will leave house rather than marry rather than see pearl woman occupying mother place come to darling said ralph holding out arm let get married at once defy father must lose money then dear oh what doe matter want not money dear placed hand on shoulder looked deeply into keen grey eye now filled with love light be too fond of to allow to ruin for sake ruin arm slipped round waist placed cheek against hers how must do that silly darling very easily replied in tired voice for have gone through be wearing out have just enough money to get along with a bachelor what be enough for one be not enough for two in spite of proverb if married in haste must repent at leisure not only must be poor father being thwarted must do best to hinder must not do declared shawe who believed that be capable of defying world much le sir joseph oh yes must must must use money influence to prevent solicitor giving brief must turn people against must give bad name know father hard nature pertinacious way of following up thing poor mother told how have ruined disgraced several people who have crossed path ralph pushed slightly away from taking hand looked into eye do think that be ready to give up because father must act in way demanded be not afraid of sir joseph of man two people can play at game if father try to crush will find be not man to be cast out of path if have money have brain be quite willing to pit intellect against wealth hang sir joseph dozen like beg pardon dear for after be father father in name only said audrey admiring lover indignation be righteous masterful in eye know what think of ralph wish have better opinion of nature experience mother experience what have told show that father be hard man with strong will doe not care what anyone suffers so long a get way mere fact that have already decided to marry again marry music hall artist show how callous be be like hamlet mother ended audrey bitterly with funeral baked meat not yet cold a in play ralph took turn up down room with frowning brow looking deeply perplexed what be to be done then demanded stopping before girl thing ca go on in way wo marry for own sake wo marry at present interpolated girl audrey say that father intends to marry rosy pearl a soon a possibly can without shocking public opinion when doe ca stay in house a declare also say that will not marry lord anvers father so tell be bound to turn out if refuse to obey so seems to that evil day be only postponed for few month daresay ralph much may happen in few month for one thing may find out who killed mother even if have money must offer home must refuse to marry until truth come to light be impossible after can do little good be not impossible can at least punish assassin one care for poor mother memory must avenge death come dear placed arm round neck will be knight errant yes said ralph promptly kissed where will begin begin replied audrey seriously begin at madame coralie at pink shop at pink shop repeated lover good will start to morrow chapter vii lady detective influenced by audrey love touched by devotion to mother memory shawe have committed beyond withdrawal to rle of knight errant like of old be going out if not to redress cruel wrong at least to revenge quite understood why girl wished to punish assassin of mother must not see how fulfilment of task have set must bring about marriage sir joseph cared so little for late wife that be quite willing to bury bitter fact of existence in oblivion to reawaken recollection of objectionable lady branwin by bringing murderer to justice thus revive whole terrible episode for benefit of public must not be pleasing to millionaire moreover if shawe did accomplish aim branwin must only pay to already promised reward must be ready enough to give money since have ample mean at disposal certainly must remain firm on question of marriage of course ralph knew well enough that audrey must not fail must remain true since refused to marry because fancied must hinder career since sir joseph certainly must disinherit if so persisted thus must not bring money to aid that career seemed that there be faint hope must become mr shawe still have promised only remained for to keep promise with hope that event must so turn out that desire of heart might be fulfilled with idea in mind shawe returned to chamber in temple set about making start be like looking for needle in haystack in first place shawe did not see how must enter madame coralie shop ask question from woman assistant yet if wished to learn anything be absolutely necessary to do so madame coralie must certainly refuse to answer question since shawe be not accredited agent of police moreover for obvious reason connected with business wished murder to be relegated to list of undiscovered crime trail assuredly started at pink shop a audrey have stated if must not find anyone likely to give clue to beginning of thing ralph disconsolately considered very sensibly that there must be little chance of success be at point of meditation that thought of perry toat be good idea a be very person required for especial purpose peronella toat called perry for business purpose be woman detective with whom have come into contact over divorce case be mainly owing to shadowing of guilty couple that petitioner have obtained freedom judge have complimented miss toat on way in have managed business moreover a be woman must easily be able to penetrate into shop entirely devoted to need of woman once within sacred wall might be able to learn what be necessary in way of clue will write to at once shawe said to drew writing material towards be clever little woman daresay can cajole force madame coralie into answering what question be necessary to be put be hanged if can see where how be going to start letter brought miss toat next day to chamber at ten o'clock before started for court be undersized colourless little woman with white face drab hued hair mouth be firm with thin pale lip eye be of sharp grey almost steely in glitter quietly arrayed in tailor made costume looked very businesslike crisp decisive manner showed that knew value of time in silence listened to shawe exposition of case be difficult mystery to unravel said when have finished where be mystery asked ralph somewhat surprised murder be doubt committed for sake of diamond motive be clear how did assassin know that lady branwin have jewel with asked perry toat fixing pale eye on face how did know position of room in slept how did gain admission into court can answer last question said shawe easily gained admission into court by mean of skeleton key be now in possession of police inspector lanton have believe miss toat drummed on table with thin finger be not unlike claw of bird of prey if assassin used key remarked must have examined lock have bought key to fit must take time mr shawe well asked barrister puzzled well repeated raising sandy eyebrow ca see that procuring of key must take time yet lady branwin slept at pink shop on spur of moment a be merely have diamond with by chance since according to daughter be taking to be reset by jeweller if be right added miss toat with emphasis think that be right in surmise assassin must have have idea beforehand that lady branwin must sleep in room wherein be murdered must have diamond with if a say slept there on spur of moment exactly therein lie difficulty mystery to alluded arrangement of lady branwin to stay be decided in five minute let say yet key to door of court must have taken longer time to procure be strange also mused perry toat that assassin must have known plan of shop how did learn that when within court must be able to gain entrance into bedroom let alone fact that must not be sure visitor be sleeping in then infer said shawe promptly that assassin must be someone attached to pink shop why not on ground have stated because evidence went to show that everyone connected with business accounted for time madame coralie husband zobeide badoura parizade to give fantastical name be in room devoted to preparing ware on about very time murder be being committed according to medical evidence peri banou be in shop be only person who be on same floor a of bedroom wherein crime took place do accuse accuse anyone a yet will go to shop ask question shawe shook head sceptically if thing be a hint one will answer question oh think so said miss toat quietly know how to ask question madame coralie may not allow to enter shop give five pound note said detective lady irrelevantly after ralph have placed one in hand continued with will buy few thing to make beautiful for ever there be faint smile on grey face a spoke between while will keep eye open find out what wish to know if do be wonder said barrister quickly for be very doubtful of success of enterprise can say said miss toat in unemotional tone when indicate assassin of lady branwin good day when be to see again asked ralph following to door perry toat looked back with demure face when have something to report will do best shawe urged always do best for client said in tone of faint rebuke in case there be much money also oh sha charge much mr shawe be not alluding to will pay well if lay hand on assassin will have thousand pound reward offered by peronella toat interrupted with flushed face one thousand pound said drawing deep breath yes forgot that must earn if do can gain heart desire what be that smiled demurely husband be reply vanished ralph went back to room with look of wonder seemed impossible that shadow of woman must ever be able to gain husband even if have bribe of one thousand pound to offer bridegroom for more than week miss toat remained absent during period haunted walpole lane sought out madame coralie declared that wanted complexion improved owner of pink shop thought that there be much room for improvement did wonder for five pound note be le charge than usually made since murder business have be bad with madame coralie be willing enough to capture small fish a big one for moment must not be enticed into net after miss toat complexion have be renovated that wily person decided to undergo course of treatment for hair figure necessitated two three night stay in shop be for reason that wrote to shawe asked to forward twenty pound did so rather ruefully for be not well off search for assassin promised to be expensive however be for audrey sake so ralph parted with very good grace with hard earned money having thus obtained fund in plenty detective took up abode in very bedroom wherein lady branwin have be murdered knew that be fatal chamber a have seen plan of shop daily paper have published when murder be sensation of day madame coralie be rather vexed when miss toat mentioned artlessly to on being installed in room that murder will ruin business said medea of walpole lane gloomily oh think so said client sweetly mind in least sleeping in room where crime have be committed be very sensible woman miss toat said madame coralie energetically friend seem to have deserted since death of lady branwin will come back madame miss toat nodded vigorously event will soon pas out of mind by way have anything be heard likely to show who be guilty said madame coralie savagely wish must find out 'd kill man for ruining business will be killed in case by law said miss toat in silky voice let hope that will be caught amen to think ever will plainly little evidence be to be got out of madame coralie probably knew nothing of truth if did must assuredly have denounced culprit to police if only out of revenge miss toat saw that must get clue in direction submitted to treatment for hair figure with very good grace proprietress of pink shop must have be ill pleased have seen little woman slipping about premise in dead of night like eel being tiny light footed especially since wore list slipper miss toat when inmate of place be buried in slumber must take dark lantern steal round room examined shop passage running at back terminating in door opened on to right of way leading into walpole lane noticed that house door into empty court be flush with of four bedroom to be precise miss toat in investigation be very precise quartette of door led to several apartment fifth door admitted anyone who be curious into court miss toat be curious a found key on nail in still room a have be mentioned in evidence at inquest opened door explored court from end to end when hair have be burnished to soft golden hue figure have be made le angular took effusive leave of magician went round to make inquiry about of person that during stay in shop by dexterous questioning by word of mouth by mean of deaf dumb language perry have found out great deal madame coralie must have rather have not known armed with knowledge went from pillar to post added to stock of information finally presenting by appointment at shawe chamber to report progress barrister scarcely knew for instead of looking like drab nonentity appeared quite pretty in artificial manner really thought that thus transmogrified must be able to gain husband have hinted at complimented on changed appearance be in way of business said perry toat disdainfully a soon a conclude task will revert to former state why demanded shawe wondering if vanity must allow sacrifice appeared that miss toat have vanity at madame coralie adornment be too conspicuous for one of calling explained attract attention in quarter where wish to be unknown better to be ugly duckling mr shawe for then can be more successful in profession remark recalled ralph to business in hand sincerely hope that have be successful in instance said eagerly woman with artificial air of youth garish mask of aggressive beauty looked thoughtfully at young man have learnt great deal may be of use to said slowly can not say so far a opinion go have be successful oh ralph dropped back into chair whence have risen seemed extremely disappointed then have failed say that in case must have succeeded say that remarked miss toat drily must have done one other cried shawe exasperated have learnt nothing very definite there be certain fact drummed on table usual gesture when puzzled be very difficult case mr shawe know for such reason placed in hand retorted miss toat nodded be gratified by opinion of skill said politely same ca expect to work miracle be miracle required in case think so produced mass of note from bag laid down before barrister there will find have be able to learn said to employer contain information about madame coralie information reveals much must give ear not to have known read note ralph turned over loose paper must rather hear what have discovered by word of mouth said fretfully for beating round bush annoyed in word miss toat do suspect anyone yes do detective leant forward with bright eye only theoretically suspect paused for effect suspect madame coralie a having strangled lady branwin chapter viii mysterious communication ralph stared at woman then threw back in chair with short laugh be greatly disappointed in reply be ridiculous to believe even hint madame coralie must be guilty remarked sharply proved very clear alibi le than four people husband three assistant proved that be in still room when crime be taking place below yes assented miss toat leaning chin on hand elbow on table be what puzzle alibi be very clear yet of course understand that be merely theorising yes yes yes shawe made irritable gesture for strain on nerve be great idea be ridiculous if have accused that dumb girl who be in shop on ground floor when crime be committed must have be more feasible bedroom be on ground floor also see reason to accuse peri banou said miss toat quietly see reason to accuse madame coralie yes theory be oh never mind theory miss toat come to fact detective be not at put out by short temper a saw that nerve be worn thin sympathised with with quick movement drew loose note to own side of table very good said in brisk businesslike tone let come to fact if please do know why madame coralie wear yashmak inspector lanton hinted something about to when at inquest be to add to attraction of turkish shop to make more mysterious a be ah miss toat raised pencilled eyebrow then inspector did not tell exact truth expect madame coralie asked to keep quiet for obvious reason obvious may be said ralph impatiently ca see why be plain enough wearing of yashmak be partly by way of good advertisement a suggests mystery partly be real reason expect be worn from necessity from necessity shawe stared hard at visitor madame coralie have disfiguring birthmark on right cheek extending over mouth chin spoil good look must have have beauty when younger strange be not mr shawe that who can restore woman look can hing with own how do know that be marked in way saw when be asleep how did enter bedroom asked ralph much astonished detective laughed when everyone be asleep stole about house investigating in list slipper with bull eye lantern madame coralie lay aside yashmak when in bed so easily saw that wish to keep concealed why must so very much want to conceal miss toat looked at greatly amazed have not be listening to what have be saying mr shawe why if madame customer knew that must not remove birthmark from face must be case of 'physician heal thyself ' with must lose confidence yes yes ralph assented impatiently waved hand understand now very naturally must doubt capability in spite of reputation what have birthmark to do with murder nothing said perry toat promptly yet be glad enough to see for in connection with case never mind broke off abruptly can talk of later tell about disfigurement because be just a well that must learn everything about woman so closely connected with death of lady branwin also will be useful mark to know in case try to get rid of more diamond what shawe jumped up with exclamation do mean to say that have pawned diamond in case must be guilty must look like be only theorising remember oh hang theory think stopped short conscious that have be rude to little woman beg pardon went on ceremoniously nerve be out of order be vexed with apologise miss toat nodded in friendly way quite understand said smoothly people unaccustomed to be mixed up with criminal matter usually do let nerve get out of order although ca say that usually apologise there have advantage of greater part of client to come to business be now six seven week since murder discovered by various inquiry made here there everywhere that two month ago madame coralie be in deep water financially now be more prosperous miss toat paused can draw own inference mean to say that committed murder in order to steal diamond have sold pawned to realise spoil miss toat nodded again that be theory barrister put hand into pocket began to pace room a be custom when perplexed see what evidence have to support theory remarked after pause well a agreed at first interview lady branwin only arranged in five minute to sleep at pink shop be merely by chance that have diamond with that murder be committed for sake of jewel be positive since be missing yet outside person must not have known that unfortunate woman be possessed of jewel at particular time madame coralie knew pardon interrupted shawe in own hearing declared that did not know what lady branwin have in red bag miss toat shrugged shoulder naturally for own sake must say that mr shawe fact remains that owing to rapidity unexpectedness of lady branwin decision to sleep at shop outsider must have arranged beforehand to commit crime for sake of jewel key in outside door of court be that might have be arranged a false clue to throw police off scent doubt said shawe decisively remember that theory be entirely destroyed by very strong alibi of madame coralie woman must not have be in two place at once well said perry toat cautiously stated that suspected madame coralie have strangled lady branwin did not say that have actually committed deed oh then think employed someone else to commit murder yes for own sake be careful to provide alibi know of lady branwin came at five o'clock to shop be murdered according to medical evidence about eight madame coralie have therefore ample time to tell accomplice that lady branwin possessed diamond also a lady branwin talked frequently of coming for treatment madame always refused evening when agreed to give treatment might have be arranged madame must also explain to accomplice about door in outer wall of court have arranged for window of bedroom to be open then well rest be easy woman declared that window be shut of course for own sake in same way that declared ignorance of diamond being in red bag said lately went on miss toat in apologetic manner that key in outer door of court might have be arranged a false clue be right in one way a key be fancy left in door to avert suspicion from madame coralie accomplice must have entered escaped in way afterwards when lady branwin be dead buried inquest be over must have met accomplice to share spoil hence be now in possession of money according to many people sadly needed have traced diamond asked ralph abruptly will not be easy task to trace especially if have be unset sold a separate stone be shortly going round pawnshop to various fence know what fence be person who receives stolen good suppose mr shawe if madame sold pawned mark may help to identify think not said shawe grimly a must probably wear veil certainly not yashmak said miss toat quietly however can make inquiry a say moreover will go back to shop again ask further question think so far a can judge that theory be correct one ralph again walked floor who do think be accomplice ca say said detective promptly at first thought madame husband might be one be with three assistant in still room can prove a strong alibi a wife what sort of person be husband what be name edward vail be name be what must call wastrel replied perry toat quickly one of dandified idiot who walk street dress loudly in order to attract eye of woman be good looking in effeminate way have never done stroke of work in life strange so clever woman a madame coralie must marry character be clever woman who generally make fool of in particular way said miss toat enigmatically however think eddy vail be usually called eddy to mind stamp character think be accomplice owing to alibi unless little woman paused suggestively unless what unless three assistant have be bribed threatened into providing alibi for own sake of course madame must say be in still room zobeide badoura parizade may have be bullied cajoled into supporting false statement be possible said shawe musingly if madame husband be guilty be easy to see how must have learnt beforehand about diamond how can get at truth by working on badoura jealousy be in love with eddy a be pretty girl unscrupulous scamp have encouraged in spite of fact that be married man intend to go back to shop to get to state what know if know anything quite so if doe jealousy of eddy vail will make speak know exactly how to unloosen tongue will try to seems ridiculous that eddy vail must be in love with dumb blind girl did say that be in love with said miss toat drily that be in love with be quite different way of looking at matter moreover badoura a forewoman be in possession of sens mr shawe zobeide be deaf parizade be blind peri banou be dumb badoura be right be simply pretty commonplace girl who have be attracted by eddy vail good look well said barrister after long pause hope will be successful although be bound to say that have evidence can see to support wild theory may not be so very wild after wait until can make badoura speak yes added miss toat with after thought peri banou also dumb girl who be in shop when crime be committed humph suppose may know something may be going to ask meanwhile must have more money say twenty pound ralph looked rueful can get for to morrow said doubtfully for to tell truth miss toat be not very well off just now ca do without mr shawe replied plainly must if must be necessary must go back to pink shop spend money a be only way in can come into contact with badoura peri banou in order to question of course if wish to give up case certainly not exclaimed hastily will send twenty pound to office to morrow before twelve o'clock solution of mystery mean lot to be willing to spend last farthing on think will have to do said miss toat getting ready to go expect to get tangible clue from two girl with piece of comfort departed leaving ralph rather disconsolate while case be being examined into shawe have seen very little of audrey sir joseph have returned unexpectedly from brighton for have grown weary of seaside wished to get back to business mr mellop still remained at house on camden hill a millionaire finding amusing woman to have at dinner table asked to chaperon daughter for longer period widow augured from branwin be really in love with did must to fascinate still further be glad that have come back to be under spell ralph be far from pleased by unexpected return a must not visit house so freely a formerly twice thrice did call sir joseph be so grim glacial in welcome that young man thought be best to remain away also mr mellop taking cue from millionaire behaved disagreeably kept closer watch on audrey ralph be very unhappy must only see sweetheart at odd time in odd way course of true love be not running smoothly by mean shawe however busied with searching into case with assistance of perry toat wily person came to again again related various detail have learnt from badoura parizade peri banou more le helped on matter so busy be barrister in fixing piece of puzzle together for by time have tangible scrap of evidence from perry toat investigation that quite neglected audrey be not therefore surprised to receive note from asking to come to round pond in kensington garden next morning at seven o'clock at hour sir joseph mr mellop be likely to be up audrey must be free from watchful eye ralph promptly decided to go sent answer to note since might fall into hand of enemy for so regarded millionaire widow who wished to marry millionaire early a be at rendezvous audrey be still earlier came towards hurriedly pathetic figure in black dress kissed hastily then at once announced reason why have sent for have received anonymous letter said audrey unexpectedly anonymous letter repeated ralph curiously what about can read for produced from pocket advises to refrain from investigating murder of mother if do declares that will suffer greatest grief of life shawe be evidently startled show letter said abruptly chapter ix question of clock audrey handed over dingy envelope bearing london postmark addressed to at camden hill house out of shawe took equally dingy piece of paper single sheet of very cheap stationery on few line in vile caligraphy be scrawled read at once while audrey sat down on near chair watched silently dear miss ran anonymous letter be to warn from invistigiting poor ma deth a know be doing keip off gras be silly will sueffer gratest grief of life be from one who sine a see frend what do think of asked girl when lover silently replaced paper in envelope sat down beside think there may be something in said shawe slowly wonder wonder what if must not be a well to take advice of tapped envelope a handed back to cried audrey worn face flushing thousand time will learn truth at cost if lead to more sorrow dear care what lead to to know worst worst may be be better than terrible suspense looked at dingy communication dubiously wonder who wrote uneducated person apparently believe declared girl quickly that bad spelling bad writing be intended to mislead shawe shook head how can be sure of be sure of nothing be only assuming that such be case at event person who wrote letter know that matter of death be being looked into see who can possibly know save perry toat who be perry toat detective whom be employing to search what have found out dear miss toat name be peronella toat call perry on card for business reason have found out nothing very tangible confines to theorising lot ralph paused shook head once more fancy be growing tired of case related perry toat discovery such a be also detailed theory when ended audrey be almost a despairing a appeared to be there doe seem to be single ray of light lamented girl putting envelope into pocket madame coralie assistant husband seem to be innocent unless added with quick look there be something in idea of prepared alibi well miss toat have learnt nothing likely to show that surmise be right in way audrey badoura apparently know nothing infatuated with eddy vail refuse to say what may know a to peri banou who be dumb information can be got from although be in shop when crime be committed say that be asleep on divan zobeide certainly admits that left there when went up to still room badoura peri banou zobeide said miss branwin ticking off quaint musical name on finger have mentioned only three of assistant what about fourth parizade oh being blind of course can see nothing at be behind curtain in still room preparing wash when madame coralie came to speak to husband be about eight o'clock just before madame came down to tell that mother must remain for night be about half past eight madame came to door oh dear girl must be mistaken madame husband say be five ten minute after eight o'clock when came to audrey shook head vehemently mr mellop will tell that did not leave house until quarter past eight pink shop that of course must make right own house there be first piece at theatre mr mellop did not care about seeing only left in time to get to theatre by nine when chief drama of evening began be nearly half past eight when reached pink shop a took ten minute more le to get to walpole lane there must be mistake said shawe rather puzzled by clear positive explanation why badoura say that eddy vail drew attention to clock in still room then be five minute to eight almost immediately afterwards madame came up from seeing mother tucked in for night very shortly went to shop door to speak to then clock in still room must be wrong said audrey tell miss toat what say may be able to learn if be so well supposing prove that still room clock be wrong ca see in case madame coralie must not have come up from seeing mother safely to bed for must have come up to still room at about fifteen twenty minute past hour medical evidence say that poor mother be murdered at eight o'clock doe seem strange said shawe reflectively humph wonder if perry toat be right after if alibi very convincing one must say be faked affair audrey turned earnestly towards girl say nothing of to anyone will tell miss toat yes will certainly do after still room clock may be right only mean that madame waited twenty minute so talking to husband instead of coming down at once if came at once then matter will have to be looked into will ask miss toat to question badoura eddy vail who noticed time may be able to say how long madame coralie remained in still room dear be mere theory one may prove to be true really ralph audrey spoke with flush on face seem anxious to learn truth be in one way not in remember anonymous letter care what letter say person who wrote be evidently concerned in death of poor mother be afraid lest must be caught there may be truth in admitted shawe however have better leave matter in hand will tell perry toat what say about difference in time always supposing that madame coralie did not linger in still room when hear of anything definite likely to supply clue will let know have let know very little hitherto said audrey bitterly darling took hand looked into eye surely be not dissatisfied with be in way admitted blushing guiltily be so anxious to learn truth revenge mother if wo search will search shawe must hing in face of determination agree scribbled perry toat address on card gave to girl audrey slipped into dingy envelope held anonymous letter with intention of calling on detective whenever must if go on with matter will help to best of ability said earnestly a turned away think that desire wish to be gratified only want to be happy wo be happy until learn who murdered dear mother said girl obstinately then took arm walked across to gate near palace be glad that will help ask be that will let assist will go to perry tat take immediate hand in game be playing said barrister decidedly a see that in other way will be satisfied now let see home come too far with dear father may have risen by time if meet there will be trouble mind said shawe throwing back well shaped head be not afraid of sir joseph by way talking about possibility of clock being wrong be father with in car no went out at six o'clock for one of prowl what do mean by one of prowl asked shawe surprised well papa for talking be really kind when chooses be sorry for poor people for really ragged unwashed poor be sometimes go out quietly wanders round street giving money to beggar helping who need help throw quite light on father character said ralph grimly must have thought that sir joseph be last person in world to help anyone to act secret philanthropist mr mellop told that did so saw once twice in tweed suit in evening helping people giving money be papa must go out for such purpose for usually put on evening dress for dinner change afterwards on night go out doe change clothes very often doe come to dinner on night mr mellop have meal to ourselves went alone to theatre papa have gone out at six in usual clothes for prowl perhaps ended audrey wistfully have misjudged father may not be so hard a think never knew that helped poor until mr mellop told only saw by chance when taxi cab broke down one evening on embankment well be glad to hear that sir joseph have redeeming quality said shawe somewhat cynically for whole story sounded improbable seeing what knew of man of young people noticed at time that be near gate of branwin mansion be therefore astonished when sir joseph stepped out be dressed in rough tweed suit looked more bulky aggressive than ever with scowl fairly snatched daughter from barrister arm expected something of sort audrey when went out so early said in domineering tone be just coming to kensington garden mr mellop kindly told how met rascal in be rascal sir said shawe spiritedly yes be know that wish daughter to marry yet arrange secret meeting in garden be to blame if anyone said audrey hotly for arranged meeting pretty confession for young lady said father grimly will take care that arrange no more a for sir turned on ralph forbid to think of miss branwin be to

coolly so matter little what arrangement have made with anvers who be indeed rascal called go inside audrey said branwin pushed daughter within gate hurriedly mr shawe good day also stalked in without

more bent than ever upon marriage with lord anvers asked to dinner so that might prosecute suit proposed suitor be pale faced sandy haired insignificant little man with pair of wicked looking black

from anyone anything in order to benefit just now anvers being desperately hard up decided that be necessary for to marry audrey audrey dowry wanted money more than maid seeing that be pretty be not unwilling to take two together even though meant loss of freedom audrey took violent dislike to even before have be suggested to a possible husband have never liked a there be atmosphere of impurity about repelled that must seek to be husband made more active in dislike when pressed suit told plainly that must never marry lord anvers not being troubled with delicacy simply laughed oh must marry

sir joseph talk into exhaustion when millionaire must say no more faced calmly will never marry lord anvers papa will marry ralph whenever can oh will when when confound roared branwin when learns who killed mother said audrey passed out of room without noticing sudden greyness replaced purple hue of father large face what with anxiety to learn who have murdered mother with insistent trouble around audrey felt angry with everyone everything even ralph seemed to be against since have waxed lukewarm in prosecuting search for assassin audrey have not seen since have advised to heed warning of anonymous letter have received communication likely to show that be looking into matter of murder under circumstance resolved to take up rle of amateur detective since there be one else who loved dead sufficiently to avenge crime audrey at least made up mind to hunt down murderer began one afternoon by driving to perry toat office for ralph have written down whereabouts sir joseph sullen angry with daughter have gone to club mr mellop in bedroom be fretting over destruction of hope therefore there be one to spy on girl having dressed plainly took taxi cab in kensington high street drove to strand perry toat office be in buckingham street detective herself be disengaged admitted audrey into private sanctum moment read name on card thought must come miss branwin said perry toat cordially a mr shawe told that be different from most girl few must wish to undertake search propose to make few girl if have have mother murdered in so barbarous fashion be audrey reply eyed with disapproval garish complexion burnished hair general renovation of miss toat detective smiled guessing thought of visitor touched hair skin be concession to business demand have to submit to sort of thing in order to gain permission to remain for searching purpose at pink shop oh audrey understood did find out anything told mr shawe have discovered what theory formed on discovery said miss toat glancing at watch explained to that have reported everything to over week ago yes admitted miss branwin did not give hope that anything must come of what have learnt fear not clue be so slight miss branwin by way perry toat looked again at watch can only give ten minute so a be expecting client colonel ilse ah poor man come to to be helped in finding stolen daughter stolen daughter echoed audrey yes wife died in child birth twenty year ago child be stolen by hospital nurse who attended there be grudge believe why must bother with trouble of other people when have so many of own said miss toat in lively way come time be short what do wish to tell what be opinion of case a now stand asked audrey abruptly be difficult mysterious case said detective slowly be opinion that madame coralie can tell truth do think that be guilty be if be guilty be because employed someone else to murder mother believe strangled lady branwin why not because madame coralie proved alibi ah audrey nodded then mr shawe did not tell about idea a to clock in still room being wrong miss toat looked at quickly what be idea audrey related what knew of discrepancy between statement of madame coralie husband badoura own be nearly half past eight when madame came to see at door said audrey positively miss toat looked steadily at girl strange said in musing tone now wonder why mr shawe did not tell be important be not asked audrey eagerly very important if can prove what say will show that be possible for madame coralie to have be with lady branwin at eight then must be guilty said audrey triumphantly suspect eddy vail husband a well a wife be in dire need of money may have committed deed although wife may have suggested commission if must only trace diamond miss toat thinking hard began to trace figure on blotting paper have seen that man vail said miss branwin after pause mr shawe described to recognised description at once be hanging about walpole lane when mother came back for red bag contained diamond oh miss toat looked up be strong point did mother happen to mention when in lane that diamond be in bag said audrey after thought simply asked for bag be sure that madame coralie must have known about diamond a poor mother must be sure to tell have ever seen madame coralie asked miss toat sharply only in half darkness when came to door at half past eight to tell that mother must remain for night then said perry toat rising go to pink shop see now be so straightforward earnest that may succeed where fail ask question can think of see what madame coralie look like hear what say mean hear what say of course may be sure that if have anything to hide will be most guarded in answer look into face watch change of colour oh miss toat stopped in dismay forgot madame coralie wear yashmak constantly in case will get to remove said audrey quickly see what mean will manage in way to see face if be guilty will know somehow wish must come with said miss toat hastily following audrey to door opened into small outer office fear that colonel ilse ah here be miss branwin saw before slender very straight man with grey moustache grey hair with tanned face general military look have kind blue eye when saw so pretty girl emerge from dingy office of perry toat same eye lighted up with admiration with bow to detective stood on one side to let girl pas audrey gave swift glance at clearly cut face a went out there seemed to be something familiar about colonel ilse countenance must not say precisely what be besides mind be too much taken up with late conversation with miss toat to concern with so trifling matter detective accompanied to outer door see to morrow at three o'clock said in low voice tell if have succeeded in getting madame coralie to remove yashmak miss branwin readily promised a felt that needed miss toat professional assistance in quest be now undertaking felt eager to reach pink shop to question madame coralie heart beat quickly a climbed into 'bus must

astonished look on face employer at once sent off on false scent miss branwin have called to see about mother death said madame coralie quietly be slightly hysterical have doubt heard what cried out trust speaker looked anxiously round shop that one else heard be alone here replied badoura evidently accepting explanation a reasonable one can get miss branwin glass of water dear said owner of shop

do here come miss branwin if mind climbing stair although audrey felt considerably annoyed at being described a hysterical nevertheless saw necessity of such explanation to satisfy curiosity of forewoman therefore wisely said nothing followed madame into narrow back passage up stair on arriving in still room elder woman dismissed assistant having looked behind curtain to see that one be hidden there likely to overhear conversation closed door audrey watched a sat down with back to window tried to steady nerve naturally have sustained shock now miss branwin said madame coralie in quiet voice can talk first so that may be certain of identity will lay aside flung long veil of yashmak over shoulder girl examined that face carefully madame coralie be certainly extremely like lady branwin have same muddy complexion large black eye same stout shapeless figure aggressive birthmark made difference after single glimpse of much le cautious lengthy survey there must be question that woman before be not lady branwin mistake be natural said audrey with sigh very natural answered madame coralie who have evidently followed train of thought very difficult thing to do especially a first saw side face mark doe not show when look thus adapted position to word resemblance became even more apparent dora be twin ended madame with nod father did not tell that oh so father told about dear thought have long ago forgotten existence of poor flora arkwright far from forgetting audrey assured aunt said that wished have married instead of information did not seem to please madame coralie for thin lip tightened gave vent to short laugh then audrey noted a further difference between sister that woman before spoke in hoarse loud domineering voice lady branwin on other hand have always talked softly possessed musical utterance be one of few poor charm owned so joseph remembers in way doe dear said madame coralie clasping hand have if have be fool must have married why did asked audrey bluntly have stated reason said madame coralie drily be fool be bound to say in own defence that never believed joseph must become so wealthy never struck a particularly clever yet must

hastily for be too careful of skin to risk hanging neglect killed be always good faithful wife to broke heart papa be rather unkind said audrey nervously relieved by explanation madame again laughed shortly unkind rather unkind repeated why treated like brute told about fancy poor soul coming to to be made young again in hope that must regain joseph affection told that be fool must waste money perhaps wanted to help also added madame coralie in softer tone dora be always fond of knew that kept shop yes in fact helped to set up shop year ago made promise that must never tell joseph of

handsome fool go about making love to younger woman while life on money however be always good tempered suit well enough in bleakleigh believed that destiny must have be better one dream dear dream be

that glove split if one else will revenge by finding out who killed will do so fear have undertaken search will never be ended said aunt in pitying tone feeling doe credit will assist by mean in power dear for not only be poor dora sister death have harmed business can talk of what will do later said audrey quickly meanwhile go on with story very dull story fear dear said madame coralie with sigh joseph like dora be child of labourer lived next door to one then joseph fell in love with dora because be pretty went away to make fortune paper will tell how did so there be need for to talk about will say that joseph behaved well to dora for returned to marry then way of sister parted went on golden road while madame coralie glanced round room again with great scorn while made for goal did not see mother occasionally not for many year dear got married to gamekeeper gamekeeper of squire shawe of bleakleigh be killed by poacher within year of marriage left with few hundred pound in hand there be child there be nothing to keep in bleakleigh since parent be dead so came to london then madame coralie shivered what happened then asked audrey sympathetically trouble be born to trouble dear everything must go wrong with went wrong tried stage failed became lecturer lost voice hear how hoarse be still went to america a lady maid be stranded there in san francisco worked a typist laboured in laundry took to reporting edited woman paper did must to keep above water a reporter be sent to paris in interest of paper failed went in for massaging people then well to make long story short

wife of millionaire be bound to say that dora behaved very well said nothing to brute of husband managed in way to get enough to start in business then madame coralie stopped abruptly with gesture be dear doe business pay asked audrey mindful of what ralph have said regarding difficulty of woman before yes be must pay if must only get in money client being woman of fashion be such bad payer ask for year of credit then there be eddy who be extravagant be fool to marry did so for companionship bought so to speak so understand one perfectly of course poor dora death have done lot of harm to now

marvellously candid saved money dear have not be listening to what have be saying how must save money with eddy extravagance customer who never will pay bill be dora who came to rescue gave diamond poor dear audrey jumped up amazed gave diamond echoed said at inquest know perfectly well what said at inquest what be saying to interrupted madame coralie sharply denied that knew anything of diamond for obvious reason did so if have admitted possession of diamond must have be suspected a person who strangled mother one knew that dora be sister must have explained at said madame coralie positively must not have explained for story must have appeared to be merely made up one to account for possession of jewel of course resemblance for dora be wonderfully alike save for birthmark must have hinted be speaking truth in case must have have to remove yashmak then world must have known of disfigurement must have ruined business dear audrey looked bewildered if mother be not strangled for sake of diamond why be killed aunt shrugged shoulder have asked that again again yet think that can see way dora brought diamond pretending that wished to be reset when be in bedroom together took out of bag gave to then placed empty bag under pillow came upstairs after tucking in for night in order to put away jewel can think of be that someone got into court by mean of skeleton key thinking that jewel be still in bag strangled poor dora then escaped if remember label be found near court door explanation be very frank from mere fact that madame coralie admitted having jewel audrey be certain that be not guilty person have employed anyone else to commit crime besides a two woman be twin sister likeness proved beyond doubt idea of one murdering other be out of question suppose said audrey after pause that know people suspect oh yes said aunt indifferently if knew about diamond must be certain of guilt however got eddy to unset stone sell separately have be over to antwerp selling so be quite safe that be looked at audrey unless tell police what have told must not think of doing so said girl anxiously for really believed aunt to be innocent more than will try disabuse ralph of guilt ralph oh yes squire shawe younger son poor dora told be engaged to well be there anything else want to know must help to find out who murdered mother certainly will do for own sake come see again may be able to give clue between may trace assassin oh aunt will do cried audrey with shining eye madame coralie kissed yes even if ruin love poor mother memory must do anything for dora daughter chapter xii unknown customer before leaving newly discovered aunt audrey extracted permission from to reveal what have be told to ralph at first madame coralie have made objection on being assured that shawe must must keep own counsel consented that must be told about diamond if be hunting for assassin thinking be one said madame coralie will learn beforehand have jewel will not be ready to credit with disposing of stolen gem eddy be sometimes so careless that fear lest police must know think must be best to tell police said audrey wisely interest in case have died away said aunt not even joseph reward of one thousand pound can revive tell mr shawe by mean warn to keep own counsel audrey left madame coralie with strange feeling so close be resemblance between sister dead alive that have be conversing with mother returned home in dream then thought disconsolately that be nearer learning what wished to know than have be before be necessary to disabuse perry toat of idea that proprietress of pink shop be guilty audrey determined to call at appointed hour next day afterwards must see ralph detail what have learnt to interview lover detective be not easy task owing to watch be kept on action however providence stood friend unexpectedly sir joseph wished to drive people down to richmond for afternoon tea at star garter invited mr mellop to join party to punish audrey for way in have

rather doleful a now knew that millionaire have made up mind on authority of audrey to marry rosy pearl widow did not intend to lose prize without struggle a be much too valuable besides having seen miss pearl on music hall stage did not think particularly formidable rival determined on day to be a fascinating a possible in order to carry off sir joseph from under very nose of rosy pearl a mr mellop have very good opinion of thought that must succeed so happy be in hope of success that kissed audrey in hall poor dear wish be coming said affectionately oh trouble about said audrey who quite understood what kiss meant give attention to capturing father must like for stepmother asked mr mellop coaxingly must like better than rosy pearl said audrey drily will have undying gratitude if can save from woman darling mr mellop pecked again at audrey cheek with great delight at having enlisted sympathy so far will do best when car glided away audrey laughed felt sure that mr mellop must do best be also very certain that must fail a sir joseph never changed mind have declared with indecent haste that intended to marry music hall artist must do so obstacle be placed in way moreover rosy pearl be just kind of fine woman whom millionaire admired mr mellop be mere shrimp beside miss pearl massive proportion sir joseph did not care for diaphanous creature of widow type however mr mellop have intense faith in own cleverness in man stupidity went forth to conquer wonder that audrey knowing father adamantine nature laughed a must be lady branwin fluttered out smile chiffon if be going out for wool will come home shorn thought audrey went away to put on quietest frock when arrived at buckingham street strand miss toat be duly waiting to hear what have learnt audrey have already arranged in own mind what to say sat down feeling quite cool composed so calm did seem that miss toat laughed in vexed way so have be unsuccessful have learnt nothing said promptly how do know asked

nothing to be learnt miss toat be quite sure that madame coralie be innocent what make think so observed face did not change colour told have told with greatest frankness naturally said miss toat doubtfully must be on guard with think be replied audrey with studied simplicity besides have promised to help to find criminal be most anxious to do so because of business see how discovering real criminal will improve business well audrey looked pensive madame coralie be rather revengeful very cunning what be to be done now have failed have not looked into everything yet miss toat intend to call again on madame coralie will do so also said perry toat with determination for recollected large reward felt anxious to obtain visitor did not wish to forbid calling again at pink shop a such request might have awakened miss toat suspicion so said nothing feeling certain that madame coralie be perfectly well able to look after meanwhile miss toat having gathered wished to learn feeling faint suspicion that audrey have not told everything made up mind to look into thing for herself then turned conversation so miss branwin must not gather intention made conquest other day said miss toat while audrey rose to take leave smoothed glove really girl blushed what do mean colonel ilse fell in love with audrey blushed again that nice military man who came a went yesterday mean be really charming such nice smile if be engaged to mr shawe might follow up conquest miss toat shook head must be disappointed colonel ilse have buried heart in grave of wife who died over twenty year ago if

detective returned to paper rather discontentedly also wished to walk out with lover there be chance of unless gained one thousand pound sir joseph branwin offered for detection of wife assassin episode of ralph meeting audrey at office sight of love made little woman more determined than ever to win reward be butterfly said miss toat shuffling paper be only grub a yet so while poor grub worked in dull room butterfly fluttered in sunshine to be precise drove in taxi cab to favourite meeting place near round pond here audrey related how have seen madame coralie what have taken place shawe be not easily astonished on occasion confessed that be be surprising to learn madame coralie be sister of lady branwin more surprising still to hear that so easily confessed to having possession of long lost diamond oh must be innocent said barrister after astonished pause ca conceive must admit so much if be guilty very possession of jewel must make police certain of guilt police must never know said audrey anxiously remember tell under seal of secrecy oh will say nothing ralph assured seriously especially a aunt have be so candid a to dispel suspicion may have entertained regarding complicity in crime then believe in perry toat theory no certainly have own view what be shawe hesitated will tell what be when be more certain of suspicion then do suspect someone asked girl swiftly yes be have found mare nest audrey looked at carefully struck that face be thin pale that eye looked remarkably dull be worrying dear yes over case really think shawe passed hand across forehead that must be best to leave alone audrey took hand looked entreatingly into face why not let sleeping dog lie shook head must learn who killed mother aunt flora be madame coralie will help why do wish thing to be left alone because wording of anonymous letter haunt said shawe irritably if search into matter will experience very great grief be worth risking that for sake of mother memory be said girl

quietly said audrey insistently discussed matter before told must not drag down hinder career by saddling with poor wife if marry against father wish be bound to be poor besides have sworn to myself never to rest until murderer of poor mother be brought to justice if wo help certainly seem anxious to do so must work alone of course will help snapped barrister sharply want to get at truth a speedily a possible so that may be married to aid in search now make suggestion audrey looked at with interest what be say that father admired madame coralie when be flora arkwright of bleakleigh very good flora arkwright may have admired father may have grudged marrying mother now why not go to madame coralie straight away rouse jealousy rouse jealousy deceased wife sister bill be law now there be bar against madame coralie marrying sir joseph yes there be forget eddy vail oh deuce cried barrister in dismay so do never mind be a well to try experiment tell madame coralie sir joseph be to marry rosy pearl see what will say for dead mother sake if not for own may resent marriage of course idea be absurd said audrey pettishly aunt have not shadow of excuse to object to father marrying anyone what ever feeling may have entertained for once have be parted too long for such feeling to exist now well experiment be worth trying insisted ralph anxiously audrey thought for moment then rose walked across grass to set mind at rest will see aunt at once tell good will wait at door of pink shop hear report with understanding two strolled across garden to walpole lane while ralph lingered on pavement audrey passed into turkish shop have chosen rather awkward hour for interview a madame coralie client be rolling up in carriage motor brougham proprietress of shop be upstairs in still room sent down word that must see miss branwin at once girl soon found in presence of aunt while badoura who have introduced returned to look after customer who be being served by other three girl can only

what madame coralie gave roar like of wounded lioness who be woman miss rosy pearl of music hall creature impossible madame coralie clenched hand black eye looked extremely angry why be rosy pearl who be other customer who slept in house on night of crime oh audrey grew pale in flash saw what madame coralie meant chapter xiii blind clue after significant hint madame coralie refused to speak more alleging that be extremely busy must not afford time however told niece to call see again when must be more explicit meanwhile girl be obliged to return to lover with what meagre information have gleaned passing through perfumed shop now crowded with fashionable woman rejoined ralph on pavement together strolled up walpole lane in direction of kensington palace told aunt a suggested about father intention to marry miss pearl said audrey abruptly be right be jealous strange be not after year besides audrey shrugged shoulder in contemptuous way fancy woman remaining faithful to father woman have odd taste said shawe quietly father be so masterful man that be certain to be successful with fair sex humph be jealous be well what did say very little be manner of speaking more than what said when told must have seen eye flash above yashmak oh never mind eye flashing audrey said shawe impatiently what be word said be that rosy pearl be customer who slept at pink shop on night of crime what ralph stopped suddenly stared lady who refused to allow name to be given who slept in upstairs bedroom yes think that aunt mean to hint oh see what mean interrupted ralph quickly jealousy give hint very plainly rosy pearl be in house rosy pearl want to become second lady branwin so rosy pearl get rid of interrupted audrey in turn looking pale ca think that strangled mother have reason to said ralph grimly a madame coralie admits that have diamond robbery can not now be given a motive for committal of crime do believe that rosy pearl really did murder mother so that way might be opened to to be father second wife ca say for certain until examine into matter more closely said shawe anxiously certainly look like sir joseph be millionaire from sudden way in announced intention of making wife be evident that two discussed matter while mother be still alive paused thought for few minute tell what audrey will go at once to perry toat tell can come also asked audrey again feeling detective fever be just a wise not to arouse father suspicion why must be aroused asked audrey quickly know nothing of rosy pearl doings on night daresay doe replied shawe turning away face if thought

strange about lover unwillingness to discus matter freely with also must not conceive why wished to obey instruction of anonymous letter abandon further search for assassin with instinct of woman in love felt that there be veil between ralph why there must be must not conceive only thing to be done be to wait patiently audrey thought a dressed for dinner sooner later will learn why ralph be behaving so strangely meanwhile shawe never thinking that audrey be puzzled by odd reluctance have found perry toat on point of leaving office when breathlessly explained errand sat down to gather detail idea rosy pearl have be sleeping in pink shop on night when lady branwin have be murdered revealed matter in new light have known about diamond being in madame coralie possession might have be still more certain since ralph have solemnly promised audrey to keep silent on particular point must not impart suspicion to detective however learnt enough to suggest building up of more feasible theory of course rosy pearl desire to become lady branwin second provides strong motive for commission of crime know that miss pearl be anxious to marry sir joseph be anxious to marry be quite different thing miss pearl to knowledge be woman who have always have eye to main chance said perry toat drily have kept highly respectable so that might make good match branwin be wealthy can give

grand way audrey shrugged shoulder when little woman disappeared a regarded hinted accusation a merely due to spite without doubt be a mr mellop must not possibly prove branwin complicity in crime sir joseph certainly might have be in walpole lane although audrey did not think that be probable yet even if have be presence a girl have already observed proved absolutely nothing when mr mellop took departure bag baggage did in afternoon audrey wended way to kensington garden to keep three o'clock appointment with ralph shawe although waited for over hour did not make appearance omission made audrey confident that there be something wrong a be not like ralph to evade meeting lately have noted unwillingness to answer question connected with search for lady branwin murderer now that so pointedly avoided company for what must be more pointed than failure to keep engagement decided to see miss toat ask question detective certainly knew that ralph knew in what ralph refused to speak about might be found reason for behaving so strangely with idea girl left garden took cab to buckingham street for once miss perry be not in office grimy little boy technically termed clerk told that detective must return in few minute meanwhile be shown into inner room to wait found there no le person than colonel ilse rose politely when entered looked at so hard that audrey blushed also be waiting for miss toat miss branwin said colonel offering chair will not be seated understand will not be long thank how did know name colonel ilse must answer like yankee by asking question miss branwin how did know mine miss toat told miss toat told repeated colonel smiling fact be hope will not mind saying a be old enough to be father young lady remind of someone who be very dear to curiosity made ask name curiosity made ask what yours be also said audrey quickly face eye to be particular remind of someone ilse looked at rather oddly of whom may ask said eagerly girl shook head ca say almost feel a if have known before daresay be fancy perhaps be perhaps be said colonel quietly what do mean nothing miss branwin only may have met by chance excuse did not satisfy audrey must not very well go on asking question liked look of colonel ilse have handsome rather sad face blue eye be strangely kind pathetic be searching for little girl said impulsively miss toat told upon word said colonel humorously miss toat seems to have told great deal yes miss branwin be looking for daughter who be stolen from twenty more year ago hospital nurse took away have never be able to find why did nurse take away colonel ilse actually blushed through tan be in fit of jealousy that did so explained hurriedly be well be too long story to tell have placed matter in hand of miss toat lately have told that think will be successful in finding daughter audrey shook pretty head gravely be long time after loss to think of finding have be in india for many year said colonel who seemed to be singularly frank in conversation military man have scanty time to attend to own affair lately have retired a have come in for fortune owing to death of uncle greatly wish to find child so that may be heiress hope will be successful said audrey sympathetically hope so too think if can trace hospital nurse that truth will become known nurse have oh colonel ilse stopped explaining a door opened to reveal perry toat here be lady miss branwin will leave to discharge business first interview can come later colonel bowed into outer room perry toat took off glove sat at desk by time effect of madame coralie improvement have worn off more le detective be rapidly becoming drab unlovely personage actually be audrey liked better without mask of fictitious loveliness a have honest if ugly face girl felt that must absolutely trust wanted someone to trust now that ralph have failed do like colonel ilse asked miss toat when door closed very much said audrey frankly seems to be very nice man sad ah be task to turn sadness into joy said detective looking keenly at client by finding daughter yes by finding daughter assented perry toat who looked sharp little rat of woman a sat at table now let come to business miss branwin ca give much time so please state what wish to see about a speedily a possible speak in confidence of course hesitated audrey rather embarrassed of course in strictest confidence what be be about mr shawe ca understand be engaged to marry yes audrey flushed love very dearly mind telling a be woman can understand lately there be something queer about wish to learn who murdered mother have be trying over week ago asked to give up search oh perry toat sat up alertly asked to give up search why miss branwin felt in pocket brought out anonymous letter for reason said passing to perry toat letter warns that if persist in searching into case will experience greatest grief of life oh said perry toat again ran sharp eye over ill written line mr shawe agrees with letter yes be most anxious to get to give up searching always avoids answering question a much a can to day have appointment to see in kensington garden did not appear be first time have ever behaved in way so came at once to ask if can tell reason for change of mind perry toat looked hard at anonymous letter did not answer after time went to tin box brought out paper with compared missive addressed to audrey let look at envelope please said after long pause oh here be picked up from table examined postmark what do make of asked audrey impatiently of letter oh be written by someone who want case stopped by assassin why do think might be assassin because only assassin must like end put to case humph said miss toat anxiously be one view there be miss branwin certain person may be anxious to prevent learning truth in case must cause great pain so letter say said audrey quickly understand unless suddenly stopped with mouth open oh gasped faintly for have just occurred to what mr mellop have hinted think that father wrote perry toat looked astonished why must think father be merely idea interrupted audrey feverishly fact be certain spiteful woman hinted that father be glad of mother death so that must marry miss pearl in fact person said plainly that sir joseph be guilty said other bluntly not exactly audrey rose quickly looked indignant be quite ridiculous to think of such thing yet perry toat tapped anonymous letter person who wrote may have written because suspected father then man wrote what man can guess can do more than guess said detective drily know by comparison of handwriting anonymous letter be written by ralph shawe oh audrey turned pale so explains conduct chapter xv ralph suspicion took audrey time to recover from announcement so unexpectedly made by miss toat in fact felt so faint that detective made drink glass of water when better asked question have be in mind time accuse mr shawe of said miss toat hastily how can think of thing mr shawe be perfectly innocent wrote letter because suspected person who be other person perry toat hesitated think will be best for to ask mr shawe to give explanation said trifle stiffly ca say for certain whom suspect must be someone known to must not have worded letter in way have done audrey leant elbow on table now aching head on hand see how can make out that mr shawe wrote letter said for answer perry toat placed before letter have taken out of tin box be from ralph giving various instruction to detective beside placed anonymous epistle can see said miss toat quietly that although handwriting of anonymous letter be disguised there be great similarity to of mr shawe here here pointed out several letter then to clinch matter said positively paper be mr shawe office boy keep to make note on have noticed that also postmark be london be not strong enough to prove mr shawe wrote letter think be miss branwin however will be easy for to deny authorship if ask must say added miss toat determined to be perfectly frank that evidence be slight go mostly by similarity of writing also told mr shawe something parizade told seemed to alarm ever since then have tried to stop looking into matter therefore judge that to enlist on side wrote miss toat laid lean hand on anonymous epistle why must speak plainly to see reason why must trick in manner argued audrey distressed to find that ralph have behaved in so underhanded way ca answer question in spite of belief may be wrong in suspecting mr shawe however be easy to learn truth take letter mr shawe have written to place before along with anonymous one then see what say report to reply audrey agreed to do went away much puzzled mystery of case be affecting nerve now that ralph seemed to be on side of enemy did not know way to turn for advice perry toat intention be good seemed to be more clever at theorising than in finding real evidence likely to be of service for elucidation of problem so far what discovery have made be trifling have resulted in nothing poor audrey went home lamenting inwardly that truth must never become known however there be only one thing to be done did be wrote short note to ralph asking to call at camden hill house a mr mellop be now absent sir joseph must probably go out in evening according to usual custom coast must be clear for ralph visit besides audrey be weary of playing secret game wished lover to come forward boldly claim even at risk of sir joseph displeasure must fall on sooner later so be just a well to get over at once sent letter by special messenger then went to lie down a head be aching be not to be wondered at seeing what shock have sustained sir joseph came home to express satisfaction that mr mellop be out of house ascribed daughter weary look when met to regret for loss of friend audrey hastened to undeceive told that did not like mr mellop papa have not changed opinion said very distinctly well dear be right for once replied branwin more amiably than usual talked too much began to feel that be nuisance however have gone need see again paused then abruptly made announcement intend to take abroad care to go papa doe matter what care will do a be told change of scene will do good a look pale enough wish to stop with madame lemain be charming woman husband be very good friend of mine will stay in paris until agree to obey marry lord anvers not word have made up mind have made up mine cried girl greatly angered refuse to marry lord anvers have told so oh doe matter branwin assured coolly anvers intends to propose again will receive same answer think not audrey few week in paris may cause to change mind since will not be seeing rascal shawe day a have reason to believe be doing see ralph can audrey confessed candidly defiantly if consent to marriage with will run away by mean if choose to risk loss of dowry said sir joseph grimly hold purse remember if disobey not one shilling of money will get intend to talk of matter more to either do what want will disown a daughter in paris may perhaps make up mind without glance at pale faced girl branwin left room audrey be still unconquered father took wrong tone with when hoped to bully into compliance have spoken affectionately be more amiable might have overlooked previous neglect have striven to please said did muttered girl to herself must never consent to marry lord anvers so seemed that sir joseph design of sending abroad for reflection be likely to prove useless time audrey have appointed for lover to call be eight o'clock did not make appearance sir joseph have not gone out a girl have expected to be writing letter in library alone in late mother sitting room audrey paced to fro with eye on timepiece at half past eight grew quite sick with apprehension a began to believe that something must have happened to ralph else that be afraid to face perhaps after ralph since have written letter have something to do with crime a so pointedly avoided meeting audrey felt that must not pas night without knowing truth at quarter to nine o'clock made up mind that a lover must not come to must go to have chamber in temple a well knew for when lady branwin be alive have gone there to have afternoon tea with young barrister be impossible to remain in state of suspense longer so audrey ran up to room changed from dinner dress into quiet walking frock stole out of house a unobstrusively a must fortunately have couple of pound in purse so did not hesitate to call cab in very short time be speeding along in taxi on rash errand be rash here be young girl going by night to call on young bachelor even though be engaged to daring be enough to make matron in society shriek with horror while driving through lighted street audrey must not help thinking of what mr mellop must say did know of escapade for little widow herself be terribly afraid of mr grundy although lively enough under rose must never have dared to act in way girl did not care mr mellop be not likely to hear about matter even if did audrey be too anxious worried to take notice of spiteful remark whole life happiness be at stake felt that be impossible to wait longer for explanation ralph apparently knew something in way be connected with what took place on fatal night what that something might be audrey dreaded to think same be determined to know what be must bear anything save suspense on arriving in fleet street girl dismissed cab walked into garden wherein rose tall pile of building containing shawe chamber shilling word to friendly hall porter soon procured admission into building went up in lift to third floor knowing ralph number rang bell wondering if be at home if journey have be in vain in few minute door be opened barrister appeared for moment a audrey wore veil did not recognise in dim light of passage may inquire what want asked politely ralph said girl faintly leant against wall a strength have kept up be now failing good heaven audrey cried shawe dismay what be doing here mahomet must not come to mountain so mountain have to come to mahomet replied audrey with anxious smile dear girl be right oh never mind appearance interrupted feverishly one know a wear thick veil let in ralph have much to say to shawe immediately conducted into sitting room there be nothing else to be done a knew that audrey must be obstinate when chose must refuse to depart without explanation moreover almost banished enormity of visit from mind dreaded lest must have learnt something particularly did not wish to know young man felt sure that really might have gained forbidden knowledge since have dared to take bold step sit down here dear said wheeling forward comfortable armchair look pale let give glass of wine want wine feel all right audrey said ralph who must scarcely conceal dismay how did escape mr mellop father mr mellop have gone home explained girl with faint smile a thought of little widow discomfiture father be busy in library slipped out quietly must not have come here darling think of what world will say be so rash care what world say retorted audrey crossly world be doing nothing for must consider blame for coming to see when have broken two appointment with broke first admit dear made second appointment have note asking to come to evening yes did not come have intention of coming said shawe without hesitation have intention of coming ralph audrey caught hand do think that be treating in straightforward way yes perhaps must be more open with yet if be must be afraid angry be angry in case seeing that will not trust afraid looked at very straightly why must be afraid shawe dropped into opposite chair with air of lassitude if explained that audrey must have to be more frank than care to be why for what reason there be thing wish to know in connection with mother death yes said ralph after second pause in connection with mother death audrey knelt at foot looked anxiously into face why not leave matter alone marry how can when refuse to trust said sternly do trust trust entirely then tell what know ca be too difficult be that why chose to write anonymous letter asked quickly barrister rose flushed deep red while looked at with startled eye what do mean stammered mean what say perry toat examined that letter by comparing handwriting with of unknown correspondent by looking at postmark by recognising common paper a used by office boy to keep note be certain that wrote letter there be long pause shawe driven into corner said nothing did not even meet reproachful eye standing on hearth rug stared at floor opening shutting hand well said audrey after pause very impatiently what do say wrote letter for very good reason admitted young man nervously what be reason demanded looking at searchingly ca tell audrey ask do ask must tell why did write that letter if will have truth burst out shawe wished to spare pain so said in letter audrey assured coolly what pain be that wish to spare never mind never mind ralph impatiently waved hand must not be here audrey let take back home girl laughed bitterly be that have to say leave room until tell truth want to know why wrote anonymous letter instead of speaking to openly have spoken openly must have asked question must not answer must answer now did murder mother good heaven how can ask thing cried shawe furiously be opinion have of very well said audrey coolly be innocent so will let that pas miss toat said that have never be same since told something that parizade have said what be shawe reflected for few moment see that will have to tell dear said sadly although have done best to spare knowledge parizade while wandering about pink shop on night of crime smelt strong scent of harris tweed listen ralph told girl in detail same story a blind woman have told perry toat well said audrey much puzzled seems that someone who wore harris tweed be in passage hiding what have to do with desire must know nothing who be constantly wear harris tweed almost constantly be asked shawe plenty of people wear harris tweed men woman why father yes said ralph interrupting pointedly father audrey grew red white by turn father suspect father believe that be guilty said ralph solemnly nodded chapter xvi dilemma moment audrey became certain of name of person accused by lover recalled what mr mellop have said about sir joseph a thought came into mind turned very white leaning back in chair closed eye feeling deadly sick really seemed a though ralph have spoken truth that father of people be guilty wonder diamond have not be stolen sir joseph have not crept into pink shop to steal jewel to rid of undesirable wife nervous shiver shook girl from head to foot almost lost consciousness touch of cold glass rim on lip made open eye saw that shawe be offering wine drink darling will feel better said anxiously time audrey did not refuse a felt that needed to be sustained at moment without word drank wine then motioned ralph to remove glass in minute so colour came back to face sat up with renewed strength be right now declared firmly ralph sit down explain what be there to explain said shawe replacing wine glass on table resuming former seat know that suspect sir joseph why suspect for reason wrote anonymous letter yes said barrister frankly after perry toat told what parizade have said after what mentioned about father going out at night ostensibly to help poor suspected mentioned father prowling before kensington garden conversation knew if told face to face that must either be indignant with must go straight to father make trouble be desire to keep suspicion quiet since be difficult to verify for reason wrote anonymously advised to stop search knew what grief must cause audrey leant back looked at lover have reason to love father a know said dully have always be unkind to be unkind to poor mother ca think that killed evidence be slight admit replied ralph gravely perhaps be evidence must not stand in court of law same to mind certainly lay sir joseph open to suspicion parizade might have mistaken smell being blind have particularly keen olfactory nerve sense of smell be almost a highly developed a of dog perfume of harris tweed if can be called perfume peaty smell mean be so strong so characteristic that even ordinary person must guess that other people besides father wear harris tweed suit interrupted audrey trying to find excuse quite so lady wear tailor made dress of men wear suit a rule that particular kind of cloth be mostly worn by who shoot be worn a rule in country be rarely that one see in london at event amongst people of father class yes admitted audrey father be always particular about dress go to city in frock coat silk hat invariably dress for dinner in fact doe what most people in society do in way of dress remember that told how went on prowl people in society do a rule said ralph quite so dear why suspect father be that have quite craze for harris tweed once twice told that for ordinary suit wear other cloth besides certainly want to marry miss pearl yes yes yes quite understand admit that might have be lurking in passage on night certainly be in walpole lane during evening how do know demanded shawe rather startled mr mellop saw be on hither side of lane when came to ask if mother intended to remain for night must mr mellop have be mistaken think so unfortunately said audrey with mournful look knew so well also saw in tweed suit early in evening when came to take to theatre thought told that be not at dinner went out very early so did said girl quickly mr mellop came early also passed in hall when be going out did not stay to dinner be six o'clock when went out about time mr mellop arrived mentioned fact to when did say that saw sir joseph in lane to day be one reason why wished to see mr have be trying hard to get father to marry yesterday learnt from own lip that intended to marry rosy pearl lost temper father asked to leave returned to own home afternoon at last interview hinted that believed father have something to do with death of mother stated that have seen in lane have other ground upon to base statement think so believe belief what say be simply petty spite of woman who have be disappointed can do harm to father in way singly think can assented barrister thoughtfully if parizade evidence became public property there must be trouble if be taken in conjunction with what mr mellop saw think that perry toat suspect father said audrey after lengthy pause at least did not say that did told to ask for explanation a declared that seemed disturbed by parizade evidence with good reason said barrister one know how important evidence be seeing that be aware of father liking for harris tweed ca think that be guilty same said audrey tearfully shawe walked up down room thoughtfully well said finally have kept suspicion from a long a must now that know audrey think must question father oh shrank back in chair dare not if perry toat may get to know what have discovered a be anxious to gain reward will certainly go to sir joseph audrey shivered oh how angry must be if be innocent certainly must show miss toat mercy on other hand if be guilty must make term ca think that be guilty cried girl in despair with fault surely must not strangle own wife rose to foot seems incredible look at evidence audrey must speak to father let speak tell one thing took in arm have forgiven for strange conduct for know that seemed strange in dear eye yes know why acted a did be to save from grief if father be guilty said girl shivering certainly will be greatest grief of life a said in letter how can marry must father turn out to be murderer darling ralph held to heart visit sin of father on child if murdered dozen woman must still make wife wish must leave whole of horrible affair alone marry at once unless father can exonerate will have to leave alone dare not go on with matter involves honour more than that involves liberty life hush stopped short to listen audrey listened also seemed for moment so still be that have be changed into stone be ring at front door said ralph anxiously bring anyone in pleaded audrey hastily letting down veil trust replied ralph left room have only be gone two minute audrey heard open door when there came sound of loud domineering voice girl recognised at once oh clasped hand shrank against wall father be indeed sir joseph who burst into room looking a furious a mad bull ralph be trying to detain in vain will break head if try to stop bellowed sir joseph who be beside with rage oh there be shameless girl be use hiding face with veil know have followed here what if have demanded audrey throwing up veil looking at intruder with flashing eye what if have what if have roared father clenching big hand jade do ask that when find here in scoundrel room at ten o'clock in evening ralph closed door with crash faced millionaire be not scoundrel be because declined to allow to see audrey at house have decoyed here came here of own free will said audrey who be deadly pale quite firm then go away at free will said father advancing have cab below come away at once oh minx little thought that told ranger to watch ranger be one of sir joseph footman did watch by order saw leave house followed to hear tell cabman to drive to temple when informed guessed that have come to see branwin must not think of name bad enough to call barrister so contented by shaking fist furiously set one of servant to spy on daughter said audrey with look of profound scorn yes did be lucky for took such care of reputation hussy can silence man if anyone else came to know of presence here think what world must say care what world say said audrey contemptuously care be good name be dragging through mud what of own good name own wicked action be dragging in mud cried ralph suddenly faced millionaire defiantly what deuce do mean will tell what mean must not do so that be treating audrey so vilely be in pink shop on night wife be murdered deny if can branwin staggered against wall glared at speaker deny if can echoed wrathfully of course can deny fool what do mean by saying thing be in pink shop on night said ralph doggedly be not at event be in lane said audrey suddenly also also sir joseph raised big arm must have struck daughter that audrey swerved ralph caught by wrist let go let go hang cried sir joseph only used much worse oath ralph be slighter man by clever trick succeeded in taking millionaire off guard sent spinning across room if dare to lay finger on audrey will throw out of window said barrister flung arm round weeping girl branwin glared wiped heated forehead accuse of of murder gasped trembling with rage simply say that be in walpole lane in pink shop on night of murder perhaps can explain be not there confound in lane yes be in lane did not enter shop by what right do accuse of crime say again a said before accuse of crime replied ralph firmly wore suit of harris tweed on night did always wear harris tweed be favourite cloth well one of girl in pink shop blind girl who have very keen sense of smell told detective be employing to learn truth how on night of murder smelt peaty scent of harris tweed have got to do with plenty of people wear harris tweed suit plenty of people wish to get rid of wife snapped shawe ah so do accuse said sir joseph who be now calming down motive for wishing to get rid of wife miss rosy pearl can best answer question what do know of miss pearl speak of with respect a be to be wife so said answered ralph calmly be stopping in pink shop also on night branwin winced became very calm be wonderful to see how rapidly cooled down from hot anger miss pearl be in shop a client of madame coralie said with attempt at dignity can have ground for saying that have anything to do with matter never said so rejoined ralph drily only suspect because of wearing harris tweed someone clothed in such cloth certainly lurked in passage on night be that person said sir joseph coolly defy to prove oh papa wish to prove said audrey quickly word denying presence there be sufficient branwin turned on daughter with great show of courtesy pardon have not honour of acquaintance said politely be stranger to papa what do mean mean that have left house to see lover against wish now cast off can stay here will never re enter home have disgraced audrey sank into chair with cry of dismay ralph advanced furiously on millionaire sir joseph ca mean do mean have disobeyed moreover in conjunction with have accused of committing murder did not did not cried audrey wringing hand pardon did said branwin still ironically polite can take own way henceforth must advise to change name a speedily a possible ca possibly care to keep name when be in danger of arrest a murderer of own wife mr shawe bowed to barrister congratulate on approaching marriage sir joseph not word more door be closed on woman pointed insultingly to audrey good night of with final bow walked heavily out of room moment later heard door bang chapter xvii what audrey overheard two young people remained alone looking at one feeling quite aghast at position in now found have not expected sir joseph appearance much le that must behave in so brutal manner moreover have repelled hinted accusation so calmly have admitted so freely that have be in walpole lane that audrey ralph felt certain be completely innocent certainly have not directly accused of committing crime girl especially must have be horrified at mere idea sir joseph have taken what said to mean that suspected so have revenged in cruel way have done bang of door startled from momentary state of stupor into unexpected behaviour of branwin have plunged audrey with white face startled eye looked at lover what be to be done now asked in low voice must drive back home at once said ralph determinedly shook head be useless father will go straight home give order be not to be admitted oh be impossible think of scandal papa doe not mind scandal already have shown how far be prepared to go by having watched by ranger oh clenched hand think of disgrace of then must stay night at hotel can not have baggage what hotel must take in with baggage have very little money too only clothes stand up in oh money doe matter darling can provide with what require said ralph hastily then muttered through teeth be confoundedly awkward situation in case father be brute be what have always be said audrey with tired sigh for late conversation have quite broken up man who have always have own way there be only one thing to be done rose what be asked shawe hopefully must go to pink shop throw on mercy of aunt ralph brightened clever darling to think of said looking at watch be half past ten o'clock wonder if will be still up daresay if not can rouse come ralph pulled down veil to hide very white face let go at once oh do hope that father will say nothing of being here to anyone now see how rash have be be terrible darling really think father will say anything for very shame can not will account for absence by saying that refused to obey with regard to marriage with anvers that turned out everyone who know what animal be will believe version be quite sure that visit here will never be known thus comforted seeing commonsense view taken by shawe audrey went down stair with lover passed out of great block of building through garden porter be not visible a audrey wore such thick veil be not likely that must be able to recognise on future occasion in fleet street barrister procured cab drove westward in silence whole thing seemed like nightmare audrey shivered like leaf be terrible to think that have home if madame coralie refused to take in heaven only knew what must do have hope that aunt must stand by at crisis particularly a seemed to hate sir joseph audrey darling think must get married said ralph after long silence thing ca go on in way career said audrey faintly never mind career father have deserted so must become wife in order may have right to protect madame coralie can keep with until can arrange matter if mr mellop come to hear of when be wife one will dare to say word said ralph decidedly if anyone doe will have to reckon with besides a told before father brutal a be will not be such fool a to soil name of own daughter popularity be breath of nostril people must cry out on if talked of visit to yes audrey felt cheered when ralph talked in way think be right do hope aunt will take in from what told of interview think will dear seems to hate sir joseph in very healthy manner audrey really know how came to have father believe that be daughter there must be mistake wish be anyone else daughter indeed said girl sighing will soon be wife so will settle everything said ralph a cab turned into walpole lane here be dearest there be light in upstairs window so madame coralie have not yet retired having

be appeared working late in still room at newly invented lotion in perfumed dimly lighted shop lover waited that girl doe not suspect truth see whispered ralph hurriedly thanks to clever explanation replied audrey in same low voice what be to say when stay here night aunt will invent explanation trouble here be even a shawe spoke heavy footfall of woman be heard came into shop hurriedly eye be visible above black silk of yashmak looked startled anxious although rest of face must not be seen evidently with very good reason be alarmed by late unexpected visit aunt flora began audrey have only uttered name when madame coralie pointed to shawe with alarmed gesture oh be right went on girl rapidly know about told must tell remember yes said madame coralie in harsh voice peering at young man anxiously gave permission to tell mind hold tongue mr shawe then without waiting for reply turned to audrey what be matter that come here at hour father have turned out of house aunt flora come to for

with sob unless take in have place to shelter head dear madame coralie made a though to catch niece in arm checked abruptly of course will stay here a long a like badoura told have come from theatre excuse for midnight visit said ralph quickly now madame must invent reason for audrey stopping here for night oh be easy enough stepped back looked at slender figure of girl scarcely visible in dim light be too thin miss branwin wish to treat will badoura accept excuse asked audrey timidly yes said madame bluntly will accept excuse like to give if doe loses situation trouble miss why call audrey aunt flora because want relationship known said woman promptly be just a well therefore must call miss branwin ca stay talking here night go away mr shawe come here again until give permission want to

what do mean never mind go away at once madame unlocked door be too late to chatter miss branwin look quite worn out shawe admitted truth of speech after farewell embrace at madame coralie looked benignly took leave when door be once more closed audrey followed aunt up stair to still room wherein four assistant be working can go to bed now said madame coralie with glance at clock on

care nothing for great deal for what money have speak of before audrey must say anything more badoura returned with information that bedroom be ready madame coralie who seemed to be singularly capable woman who knew own mind at once insisted that visitor must retire so be that in very short space of time audrey found in comfortable bed for few moment mused on strange chance have brought to sleep in very house wherein mother have be murdered then great fatigue felt overcame fell into profound slumber lasted until morning so deep be that did not even dream at ten o'clock next morning awoke found aunt standing beside with cup of tea madame coralie explained how have looked in once twice before that audrey have be sleeping so quietly that have not have heart to waken drink tea take sleep advised madame coralie wisely a more sleep after last night experience better will feel audrey who still felt languid willingly consented madame went out quietly did not however through absence of mind quite close door audrey be therefore wakened time later by sound of two voice conversing softly at once remembered that still room be opposite to bedroom occupied evidently door be open a own door be not closed must hear very plainly half awake half asleep listened not meaning to eavesdrop simply because felt too tired to close door to give evidence of presence voice be of man woman audrey recognised latter one a of badoura who man be must not guess be very cruel said badoura addressing companion softly be tired of be sure well always worry so said man voice gruffly ca be always running after must not have said once eddy replied badoura name suddenly enlightened audrey to fact that forewoman be conversing with madame coralie scampish husband ashamed of listening even involuntarily

once leap from bed to denounce eddy vail girl although appeared delicate be inexperienced have commonsense way of looking at thing helped greatly in emergency rapidly reviewed situation saw that must be wiser for present to hold tongue when laid matter before ralph must be time enough to consider what be best course to pursue be necessary to obtain further proof of vail guilt a for moment rested merely on statement of badoura if badoura changed mind became reconciled to eddy might deny that have made remark about clock finally seeing that be indebted to aunt for night lodging if for nothing else audrey did not wish to make trouble in pink shop already murder have given place bad name if there be more scandal madame coralie business must be ruined entirely audrey must rest more when heard madame coralie go into still room to talk with scampish husband quietly rose closed bedroom door then dressed rapidly soon came out looking much usual self although be decidedly pale aunt be still talking to eddy have just handed letter scampish husband looked more pretty dandified than ever threw glance of leering admiration at charming newcomer when audrey remembered that badoura accused of

like world to become aware of be on tip of audrey tongue to ask if thing in question have to do with sir joseph presence in house on night of murder aunt gave time to speak there be gentleman waiting in lane to see said abruptly audrey ran to window ralph said quickly joyfully yes have come in spite of prohibition silly fellow that be want stay here to be talked about however a will not go away

quivered at gentle touch have taken in when have home said girl tenderly will never forget aunt flora wish must remove that horrid yashmak let kiss madame coralie drew aside dark veil allowed audrey to press kiss on mouth then dropped yashmak again over disfiguring birthmark turned away in silence to busy with tiny box containing ointment have better go dear said at length in low voice mr shawe be waiting audrey wondered why aunt must be so moved by simple caress guessing that did not wish to converse at moment quietly left room ran down stair a passed through shop quartette of assistant who be busy in various way looked up with bright smile one enlightened by badoura have seen lover pacing lane sympathised with audrey haste girl blushed laughed a left shop ran across narrow roadway holding out hand dear darling said ralph tenderly audrey saw how lean anxious face looked have be worrying about night need have said audrey a walked down lane have be right sleep have done lot of good can worry about now ralph because be dreadfully hungry want breakfast what shawe be rather indignant have madame coralie given food audrey shook head suggested must breakfast with since refused to go away without seeing must have got food in house have chosen ralph put arm in confidentially agreed to see because have much to say what be new discovery yes very important one ca talk until have eaten remember dear have have nothing in way of food since dinner last night have undergone great deal poor darling cried ralph with great compunction sha say word until have have breakfast will have mine also for to tell truth audrey must eat nothing morning now have seen appetite be reviving proved at sumptuous meal ordered at restaurant in high street be excellent place with excellent cook two young people chose exactly dish enjoyed most in middle of meal audrey laughed a struck a strange that people so troubled a be must eat drink so freely one must think be pauper turned out of house home by hard hearted father said audrey smiling be glad see humour of said ralph drily oh be angry dear thank heaven have gift of humour to enable to see trouble in true light aunt flora have sent for box have written to tell father be to stop with for time being hinted that must force to allow income how can force asked shawe quickly doe know that be in pink shop on night did not say so did mention subject besides papa said in room that although be in lane did not enter shop see what else must expect to say replied ralph with shrug if be in shop certainly must not incriminate by admitting after have only parizade evidence regarding that scent of harris tweed to go upon said audrey thoughtfully seeing that father be so fond of wearing that particular cloth must say that evidence be very strong retorted ralph yet declared that must not stand in court of law perhaps yes perhaps be difficult thing to say audrey however since now know what wrote anonymous letter to keep from there will be further hesitation on part in searching for true assassin if prof to be father sha be sorry seeing how brutally have behaved to audrey shook head if thought that papa be guilty must ask to stop searching to leave to punishment of conscience have got one dear said shawe scoffingly if be guilty who be may ask eddy vail said audrey without moment hesitation ralph pushed back chair looked at in astonishment restaurant be almost empty have corner table entirely to so must speak very freely so long a kept voice low on ground do make assertion audrey asked sharply overheard conversation between badoura eddy vail morning oh learnt enough to make suspect vail learnt plainly that vail be guilty if badoura be to be believed shawe remained silent through sheer astonishment tell exactly what did overhear remarked at length miss branwin thereupon lowered voice still more so that whisper must be overheard by other people detailed word have passed between badoura madame coralie husband saw afterwards with aunt flora finished audrey a sent with letter to father be nasty impertinent little man wished to converse with even offered hand shuddered a if must touch well ralph what do think of matter badoura declaration certainly endorses what said about time madame coralie came down to see at door remarked shawe thoughtfully if eddy vail came up at five minute to eight put clock back to must account for twenty five minute be certainly nearly half past eight before saw aunt flora said audrey quickly then if came down immediately after entering still room a be stated at inquest said clock must have be wrong eddy vail madame coralie badoura say that be five minute after eight when madame came down to of course eddy putting clock wrong must account for extra time why did put clock wrong asked audrey bewildered badoura supply answer to question dear said ralph grimly wished to provide alibi badoura madame coralie must both swear that be in still room at eight o'clock when be really five twenty minute past eight have that time seeing that according to medical evidence mother be murdered at about eight to commit crime yes eddy vail may be guilty then father be innocent be not in pink shop of course going by evidence of clock when mr mellop saw father in walpole lane mother have already be dead for twenty minute more le of course ralph looked thoughtful may have killed then have slipped round by court key be in outer door remember to walpole lane guessing that must call there thus must provide with very good alibi did know that be going to call for mother yes told when got home really ca think that be guilty ralph especially a badoura accuses eddy vail why must eddy kill mother because of diamond madame coralie said that sister have given to if be lie make out madame coralie to be accomplice after fact must have known that husband have murdered lady branwin oh dear be impossible aunt flora can be guilty be so good ralph have own idea of madame coralie goodness be use communicating same to girl seeing how kind aunt have be to thought for few moment then raised head in order to learn positively what took place in house on night said decisively must find independent witness can asked audrey faintly for be greatly bewildered think so rosy pearl oh audrey stared will know nothing be not so sure of be sleeping in upstairs bedroom probably be asleep might be that be awake said shawe quickly at event be strange that woman whom father desire to marry must be in house where obstacle to marriage met with death on selfsame night too ended ralph with nod what be to be done asked audrey astonished at new development say nothing about badoura conversation with eddy vail wait patiently until see rosy pearl will do so very day wonder if be guilty queried audrey shawe must not answer question be scarcely to be wondered at chapter xix matrimonial arrangement ralph did not call on miss pearl day a intended to do for simple reason that more important business demanded attention after returning with audrey to pink shop walked away thinking with irritation over disagreeable position in girl be placed by callous behaviour of father certainly a audrey be supposed to be going in for figure treatment stay with madame coralie be reasonably accounted for ralph guessed that sir joseph must offer excuse to friend when asked after daughter there be doubt that when old man recovered from furious rage into have fallen when accused of crime must think twice before admitting that have turned audrey out of door sir joseph in spite of domineering way be coward so far a social reputation be concerned must not risk finger of scorn being pointed at assuredly must be when people came to hear of brutal action so far everything be right shawe did not care that girl intended to make wife must remain with madame coralie even though woman be audrey aunt apparently intended to be kind to niece ralph knew that reputation be none of best must do audrey harm to remain long at pink shop especially a since murder have obtained most unenviable notoriety madame coralie a shawe learnt through perry toat be looked at askance by police nothing must be said against have assuredly cleared herself of complicity in connection with lady branwin death thanks mainly a ralph now saw to false evidence of still room clock be watched nevertheless be regarded a person of doubtful character perhaps be hard on poor creature that must be so regarded for did best to conduct business in proper way very business be of decidedly dubious character demanded secrecy for obvious reason lady anxious to renew youth did not care about visit to pink shop to be talked about very necessary secrecy lent doubtful air to madame coralie occupation on whole young barrister thought that must be just a well to remove audrey a soon a possible from tainted atmosphere must only be done by marriage a failing aunt audrey have friend with whom must stay certainly there be people who liked must be glad of company application to of meant awkward question must be asked if woman scented scandal must assuredly be extremely pertinacious until learnt whole truth a whole truth involved confession of audrey rash visit to temple acknowledgment of father drastic behaviour be not right to risk such thing becoming known whereas if shawe married girl quickly must be looked upon a runaway match sir joseph anger must be accounted for in way be well known that wished daughter to marry lord anvers have refused to permit barrister to pay address therefore elopement for be what marriage with shawe must amount to must appeal to romantic nature of audrey friend woman must be on side more ralph thought over matter more felt that speedy marriage be only way in to adjust situation required thought to accomplish shawe have small income with economy must be enough for two until received larger fee already be well known man day made progress so there must be doubt that in near future must be well able to support wife at present moment must not lay hand on ready money be what wanted to do in ordinary way audrey must have to live in kensington parish for three week so must in order to get married a ralph wished to remove future wife from pink shop a speedily a possible delay be not to be thought of there only remained to procure special licence cost large sum of money will go see godmother decided ralph after have turned question of immediate matrimony over in mind lady sanby be young man godmother have always professed to be very fond proud of have often presented with cheque when be at college later when be studying for bar indeed for lady sanby help ralph must not have be able to wait for brief since father squire of bleakleigh be not wealthy godmother have always behaved generously ralph therefore went to house that same afternoon instead of visiting miss pearl before going wrote to star of music hall asking to see next morning at eleven o'clock saying that have something important to say to having thus arranged matter young man went to dorleigh crescent to interview lady sanby be ancient dowager with merry eye great liking for young men especially if be handsome rising ralph be so lady sanby always made great fuss over when called went everywhere knew everyone be altogether a gay old dame a must be found in mayfair also a be very rich son present lord sanby daughter in law together with numerous offspring paid greatest attention grannie have money to leave therefore grannie be regarded a oracle of family behaved always like benevolent despot for one must deny what be charming old lady if somewhat sharp in way of speaking dear boy said lady sanby welcoming godson with effusion presenting withered cheek for kiss what have be doing time have seen name in paper in connection with profession be not getting brief not at present grannie said ralph for lady sanby allowed to call by endearing name a acknowledgment of interest took in will come along right when be married oh lady sanby shook old head knowingly a knew much of ralph love story so still adore daughter of wretched woman who be murdered in pink shop yes said liked audrey grannie so do be dear girl did like vulgar old mother though must say that now seeing be dead do like father be wicked domineering navvy will probably be made peer sort of rich labourer always do get peerage well so be going to marry must if want to succeed in profession said ralph quickly head be full of love matter ca think of client yes want to get married in three day have come to for help oh will do want dear boy be so clever that look on a one likely to reflect credit on sanby family be idiot well how can assist will explain in first place wish to tell rather surprising story about must promise to keep silence oh dear lad be well very well for keeping secret if said knew must ruin men in london woman well shawe wasted further talk in introducing subject related that knew about case from time lady branwin have entered pink shop down to last word audrey have told concerning badoura accusation of eddy vail now what do think asked when have finished long story felt vexed that old lady did not display more astonishment be wonderful story lady sanby assured coolly truth be always stranger than fiction have have so many surprise in long life that nothing astonishes be glad told can well see that be thing one must hold one tongue about so vexing one always have to keep silence about most wonderful thing do think that sir joseph branwin horrid man be guilty ca say perhaps suspect eddy vail ca be sure of madame coralie said ralph positively can safely say that suspect for be behaving too well over audrey matter doe mean to say must commit crime if suited said lady sanby coolly be not nice woman dear sooner get that poor girl away from pink shop better will be knew must say that said shawe quickly for reason want to help grannie to help audrey be of course like audrey be girl of spirit will make good wife well what do wish to do ask here to stay for time although be kind of to suggest said shawe hurriedly people must talk ask question wish to lend one hundred pound so can buy special licence marry audrey at once have sufficient cash to take journey to go on honeymoon mean said lady sanby humorously well idea be very good one marry at once by special licence go away to quiet place so that can recover from trouble then bring here a wife can stay with for week until can find house dear dear grannie silly silly grannie think be romantic old fool to waste money at time of life in wo be wasted will pay back will give five hundred pound a wedding gift ca take lady sanby grannie foolish boy well then ca take such large sum grannie talk nonsense said lady sanby going to desk producing cheque book five hundred pound wo go very far seeing audrey have be accustomed to million wo be accustomed to more said future bridegroom in gloomy tone father have disowned never mind marry will put matter right between there be cheque handed oblong slip of paper really ca take so much then wo get le dear man gracious have dandled on knee slapped stuffed with cake have be always good be why like to impose on lady sanby laughed grimly need be afraid of doing ralph one old young ever succeeded in imposing upon now take wedding

when bestow approval grannie be angel ralph very greatly touched by kindness kissed warmly grannie pushed away keep kiss nice word for audrey will grow jealous now run away have heap to do ca afford to waste time a briefless barrister doe briefless laughed ralph who be now with very good reason in excellent spirit well grannie only ask that will retain a counsel in breach of promise case be sure to have with one of numerous admirer joke pleased gay old lady immensely shawe departed paid welcome cheque into bank must now afford to marry audrey at once take away from soiled circumstance of life felt duly grateful to madame coralie did not wish audrey when be mr shawe to see more of than be consistent with being relation for moment felt inclined to go to walpole lane tell audrey about lady sanby offer kindness in giving such welcome wedding present knew that audrey must be disappointed if have nothing to tell about miss pearl so resolved before again sought pink shop to see lady in question miss pearl wrote said that must be pleased to see at time mentioned therefore next morning ralph duly walked to quiet house in quiet bloomsbury square wherein miss pearl have room demure maidservant admitted into house conducted up wide staircase be old georgian mansion to sitting room of lady when departed to tell miss pearl that visitor have arrived young barrister glanced round room to see if must gather from furnishing what character of future lady branwin be like struck oddly enough considering profession of dancer singer that be something of puritan room be spacious have lofty ceiling painted with wreath of flower love knot of blue ribbon under roof suggested gay pompadour fancy room looked cold drab furniture be of dark wood upholstered in dark green window two french window opened on to iron balcony be draped with green curtain carpet be also green without pattern in centre of apartment be prim table on book be placed at regular interval one of book shawe found to be pilgrim progress be chronicle of schonberg cotta family felt rather astonished a be not class of literature expected miss pearl to favour then room be altogether so stiff formal so deadly cold in spite of being warm in open air that barrister be puzzled must have be shown into apartment of missionary by mistake be reflection sat down greatly bewildered woman who dance at music hall ca possibly like to live in such room always heard that be aggressively respectable reflection be cut short by stately entrance of lady be thinking about miss pearl be stately being tall nobly formed woman who walked in quite majestic way have large foot large hand large bust large limb indeed be large in way looked more like venus of milo than modern woman face be pale grave clear cut have rather severe mouth with compressed lip to add to resemblance to heathen goddess hair be smoothed back from marble forehead coiled behind in simple greek knot in calm graceful way moved forward with large brown unwinking eye fastened on bewildered face of young man eye almost hypnotised ralph for gaze be so steady made think that after be le like venus than like ox eyed juno be mr shawe said in low deep contralto voice yes miss pearl stammered then observed well cut tailor made dress be simplicity worn with linen collar be material brought startled look into eye wear harris tweed dress gasped miss pearl eyed with grave surprise why must not asked chapter xx music hall artist miss pearl question be awkward to answer on spur of moment a may be easily guessed ralph have intended to lead gradually up to object of visit thrown off guard by sight of dress have committed in most untimely manner while thinking of possible answer must delay explanation stared hard at miss pearl trying to guess what kind of woman be from furnishing of room from look severe mode of dress took to be religious woman of puritanic cast who have abjured pomp vanity of world yet be music hall dancer profession did not suit surroundings appearance will explain why made that remark shortly said shawe evading direct reply a well a be able truth to tell errand be not very pleasant one miss pearl looked at card held in large white hand pondered thoughtfully mr ralph shawe said in heavy voice ah yes remember now perhaps mr ralph shawe can guess errand perhaps can muttered shawe wondering what must say sir joseph branwin pursued dancer told about a undesirable suitor for hand of daughter be right in assuming that have called to enlist sympathy enlist sympathy repeated visitor staring yes want continued miss pearl in ponderously playful manner to ask sir joseph to permit to pay address will do so with pleasure a have sympathy with miss branwin shawe still stared in dazed way a speech completely puzzled in vulgar parlance took wind out of sail here have come practically to accuse lady of being connected with murder of woman whom have wished to supplant very lady be now most generously offering assistance to forward private aim shawe must not quite understand if be cunning on rosy pearl part mere stupidity perhaps liberal offer of generous nature noted careful way in spoke method of picking out well sounding word mentally observed that be doing best to correct defective education by thinking well before spoke in meantime miss pearl did not hurry a appeared to be singularly leisurely person with large calm eye gazing amiably at gracious rounded figure whole placid pose reminded ralph of nothing so much a sacred white cow cow can be furious when aroused barrister wondered if must rise in majesty like goddess of war when learnt true meaning of visit must be stupid thought else must have persisted in learning straight away meaning of first enigmatic remark yet accepted postponement calmly be quite ready to wait for explanation be greatly obliged to for kindness miss pearl said quietly fear offer of help be too late sir joseph have have serious quarrel with daughter serious quarrel with daughter repeated woman slowly a if trying to get idea well into head then added after pause must like to hear what quarrel be about ralph did not intend to tell be sure branwin must be too much ashamed of to give information well know miss pearl sir joseph wanted daughter to marry lord anvers refused so miss branwin left house a father be so furious with miss branwin have left house where be staying now at pink shop said shawe promptly be unwilling to name audrey temporary abode did so to see what effect name have on calm undemonstrative woman have effect indeed for miss pearl white skin slowly became vivid crimson for first time during interview displayed emotion perhaps be aware of meaning in shawe gaze when saw agitation for gave excuse think that pink shop be proper place for young lady to stay at remarked frigidly why not be there miss pearl have frequently be there mr shawe a artist have to take greatest care of what look posse find madame coralie invaluable slept at pink shop on night lady branwin be miss pearl displayed more agitation rare thing for so slow thinking woman interrupted somewhat sharply admit that did wish to be known for what reason miss pearl asked ralph pressing advantage mercilessly can guess reason mr shawe replied with heavy indignation know what evil mind people have sir joseph be admirer of mine quite in platonic way understand of course murmured barrister have heard of unblemished reputation miss pearl must think be unblemished said dancer speaking faster than usual dear mother who be consistent baptist always warned when left home to keep unspotted from world circumstance have made music hall dancer have always conducted discreetly always will do so not by way of advertisement mr shawe because principle instilled by dear mother will not permit to behave in other way doe credit miss pearl murmured ralph feeling called upon to say something polite rosy pearl looked at like offended goddess know whether mean to be sarcastic mr shawe let tell that sarcasm be out of place be one of men who believe that woman can be virtuous in midst of temptation not at miss pearl there be good woman on stage often bad woman in church circle be question of temperament be question of doing what be right mr shawe said goddess with disdainful look be dancer be true one can say word against think anyone have said word ralph ventured to remark if did said miss pearl sharply must bring libel action against without delay solicitor have instruction to take notice of flippant remark made about to deal with a deserves with such precaution must be like csar wife above suspicion know mr csar said rosy pearl coldly betrayed lack of educational knowledge in remark attend to own business to nothing else daresay wonder mr shawe why with sentiment be on music hall stage well ralph admitted more more puzzled by simplicity unable to tell if be real feigned must say that do wonder be because be stupid stupid shawe stared have never heard woman admit a much before yes be said miss pearl in rich slow voice looking more than ever like sacred white cow parent live in small essex village have large family father be carpenter mother a told consistent baptist being poor child be have to work when be eighteen got housemaid place in london must not do work be not difficult work said shawe marvelling at candour be not difficult work said miss pearl who seemed to have habit of repeating word perhaps to fix in memory be stupid be always making mistake through forgetting thing lost place after place because of what be called lack of intelligence have to work in way yet must not being too slow heavy then old gentleman be scholar said that resembled greek statue gave idea a friend of mine knew music hall manager went to manager asked to let appear in living picture consented not at once admired for look said miss pearl with great simplicity made love to do be great nuisance a like sort of thing manager became quite friendly when boxed ear must have be odd manager said ralph thinking so strong white arm must hurt considerably oh be like rest of said miss pearl heavily however declared that saw possibility in sent to someone to be taught when mentioned what scholar have said about being like greek man be professor of dancing got idea of reviving attic dance taught three chant song mean mean song mean chant to dance have seen performance have not mr shawe yes very beautiful performance be said ralph recalled scene represented greek temple before miss pearl in scanty white robe danced in slow graceful manner chanting be right word be chanting stately word to solemn music also danced flower dance of anthesterian festival be of more lively character be very beautiful performance repeated ralph emphatically be glad think so said miss pearl with slow sweet smile three dance took year to learn thought must never master in end did then appeared be success quite like greek dress added dancer confidentially a scarcely cover one so long a be respectable what doe matter ralph laughed in somewhat embarrassed manner be beginning to like miss pearl because be so childlike unaffected think look perfectly respectable said with smile be glad think so said miss pearl once more did not seem to have many idea get good salary for three year have be dancing everywhere so have saved money be able to help mother be shocked at first being consistent baptist now be reconciled to idea a know have never forgotten early teaching success wo last for ever be clever enough to see so intend to marry sir joseph branwin hope to make good wife be sure will said shawe heartily felt a though be encouraging child have known long for two year have always be good friend to although have invariably kept at arm length now that wife be dead want to marry say that will marry miss pearl looked at shawe very directly think will marry of course may not have not yet made up mind said just now yes know what said mr shawe one can never be sure of anything in world of trouble however doe much matter if marry not a have saved lot of money be quite content to go back to village live with parent now mr shawe have told about perhaps will explain why wish to see time be getting on shawe have learnt nothing definite a yet so lost further time plunged into middle of reason for calling wish to know if saw anything when stayed at pink shop likely to lead to suspect who be assassin of lady branwin there said miss pearl colouring again knew day must be asked that question again be asked before yes inspector lanton asked learnt from madame coralie slept in upstairs room questioned of course knew nothing a be asleep time told so also asked to keep name out of paper a such publicity must not have be good for now added miss pearl emphatically must do positive harm seeing sir joseph want to marry people must say nasty thing for instance that wished lady branwin to die daresay said miss pearl in quite savage tone for so serene goddess let be have always solicitor to look after reputation do think that asked suddenly said ralph frankly might have entertained such suspicion after seeing suspect in least still paused may know of something know what for instance asked miss pearl sharply ralph evaded answer asked question did wear harris tweed dress when be at pink shop did not why do ask because one of assistant of madame coralie blind girl whose sense of smell be abnormal scented peaty fragrance of harris tweed in lower passage about time lady branwin be murdered at least one hour later oh indeed said miss pearl coolly then think that wore dress went downstairs to murder lady branwin so must marry mean said that parizade smelt perfume hour afterwards say that did not wear dress sir joseph always when in tweed prefers harris cloth be in house asked miss pearl bewildered be what wish to tell ca rose like offended goddess if be certainly must not tell mr shawe if sir joseph knew that dared to accuse of murder know what have told miss pearl know also that accuse directly of murder someone wearing harris tweed be in lower passage deny wearing dress a sir joseph be partial to cloth conclude that be lurking in house be certainly seen in lane by mr mellop think said miss pearl frigidly that have better tell story to sir joseph can not assist be asleep in upstairs room evening know nothing a told inspector lanton a be satisfied see why must not be of course take word there be 'but ' about interrupted dancer imperiously ralph found thinking what beautiful creature be mother always taught never to tell lie if think that know anything of crime mr shawe will prove sincerity ignorance by refusing to marry sir joseph branwin good day walked out of room in a stately manner a have entered wonder murmured ralph leaving house if be born liar if be really truly telling truth chapter xxi marriage certainly be not easy task to come to conclusion about miss pearl ralph took for beautiful amiable stupid woman narrowed by early training into perfect specimen of what wife must be be wife to ordinary british philistine sir joseph be not prim conventional man after style of suburban clerk clever individual who knew how to use brain might certainly admire miss pearl for calm maternal beauty shawe be satisfied that must not possibly tolerate such milk water character miss pearl be more suitable to be wife of sunday school teacher than second lady branwin consideration brought barrister round to wonder if miss pearl have not be playing very clever game with have be with for quite hour time have be so taken up with telling about herself that have not be able to cross examine in dexterous manner have contrived to keep at arm length left quiet bloomsbury house about a wise a when entered considerably puzzled over present aspect of affair young man sought out perry toat described visit to miss pearl also repeated what audrey have overheard a passing between badoura eddy vail miss toat listened in silence shrewd little eye twinkled be really most puzzling case said at length of course clue of scent be very slight one to go by sir joseph be fond of especial kind of cloth probably asked miss pearl to favour by having dress made of same material eddy vail might also have suit of cloth might be person who lurked in passage think must be guilty said ralph insistently for if be innocent certainly must not have altered clock quite so let consider matter now theory beg pardon miss toat interrupted shawe rather crossly be trifle tired of theory lead to nothing miss toat be not at put out oh to theorise be only way to get at truth of matter one may have dozen theory then can abandon one in turn a seems improbable let conduct business in own way mr shawe well ralph resigned to what seemed to to be futile discussion let have latest theory bearing in mind what badoura said about clock being wrong eddy vail being husband of madame coralie think be sole person who have reason to have skeleton key made for door in wall of court probably wished to enter leave house at convenience without bothering wife what must be use of entering court objected shawe seeing that must not get into house door be always locked yes key be usually on nail in still room said perry toat cleverly found that out when be staying at pink shop for treatment eddy vail must easily have taken key when chose have opened inner door then got key made for outer door thus must be free of house be imagination miss toat be only constructing theory on evidence let admit that thing be a say well then on night eddy vail have key in pocket only one of outer door for reason quite unconnected with lady branwin stay since must not have known of entered court at time madame coralie be in bedroom with patient looking through window must see diamond produced madame coralie a declare say that lady branwin gave madame coralie put lady branwin to bed diamond be replaced in red bag under pillow then madame coralie left room say at ten minute to eight o'clock whereupon eddy vail scrambled in at window strangled woman take jewel out of bag put into pocket then to lose time leaf by bedroom door run up stair to still room arriving there at five minute to hour in order to put back clock to half past seven thirty odd minute later madame coralie who have be in shop come up eddy draw attention to time a five minute past eight a now know be really close on half past eight madame coralie go down at once to see miss branwin to say that mother will stop for night will bring time to mentioned by miss branwin a hour arrived at walpole lane on way to theatre afterwards eddy vail go out by street door return to court to drop label to leave key in lock of court wall door so a to encourage idea of burglar what do think of be very feasible theory said ralph after pause fall to ground in face of madame coralie admission that lady branwin gave jewel only make accomplice after fact said perry toat cheerfully ralph shook head must not approve of murder of own sister miss toat said gently yes hinted something about two woman being sister forget exactly what said a have be so busy with case of colonel ilse missing daughter be trying to find photograph of hospital nurse who stole child know tell exactly relationship about will listen carefully shawe related that knew little woman nodded head of course complicates matter still doe not exonerate madame coralie be not straight woman what do mean never mind since be to marry miss branwin advice to be to keep away from madame coralie know something about something bad very bad what be asked shawe with considerable curiosity oh ask just now said perry toat impatiently will tell when be more certain meanwhile go get special licence marry miss branwin sooner be out of pink shop better agree with said ralph drily a stood up to take leave while be on honeymoon wish to examine into truth of miss pearl statement that be asleep whole time also a to reason why sir joseph be in walpole lane on night perry toat looked at suddenly have theory also said sharply well ralph drew on glove slowly seems to that sir joseph who knew that wife be staying at pink shop might have enlisted service of eddy vail have borrowed that key mention might have entered court have strangled wife while sending eddy vail upstairs to put clock wrong must easily have strangled wife have left again by court door to come round to walpole lane thus must be able to

hesitation that have given up idea of searching into mystery of mother death think so rejoined audrey slowly because be afraid afraid of what may find papa be criminal after what have told seems to may be quite wrong that papa rosy pearl be responsible for death oh shuddered be too horrible agree with audrey to mind eddy vail be assassin however perry toat have doubt seen by time when return to london will have news for mr shawe frowned hugged knee a stared at sea line really think that must be best to leave whole thing alone a said in anonymous letter yes be right in saying what did if father be proved to be guilty will indeed be greatest grief of life have reason to love seems terrible that must be darling have proof that committed deed tell that eddy vail if anyone be guilty person altered time of still room clock that in say volume same wish case to be stopped said audrey doggedly from decision ralph must not move privately be pleased a be weary of whole sordid business did not wish early married life to be encumbered with criminal case will see perry toat when return to london tell not to bother more about matter said sitting up be just at moment by one of odd coincidence not uncommon in life that miss perry toat made appearance from behind rock appeared so pat to moment so suddenly upon mention of name that ralph almost believed have be listening behind rock for dramatic moment of appearance seemed from very first speech that be not case good day mr shawe good morning mr shawe said perry toat looking more like sharp little rat than ever just came down morning from london by early train guessing that must be on beach came in search of voice attracted a be poking about rock so here be yes here be said ralph rather glumly seem pleased to see said miss toat drily must man on honeymoon be pleased to see detective retorted then laughed looked at wife what do say audrey girl flushed say now what said before wish whole case to drop said with frown be impossible to drop now mr shawe replied perry toat in quiet voice in own interest be necessary that matter must be gone into be sorry to interrupt honeymoon what have found out left alternative to come down report progress what have discovered asked ralph eagerly even audrey in spite of late speech seemed anxious to hear what little woman have to say miss toat did not seem very ready to satisfy curiosity sitting down on rock tucked foot under produced cigarette when be lighted began to smoke went on talking a if barrister have not asked pertinent question besides be too anxious to earn thousand pound to drop case said quietly be in love a well a be mr shawe can only marry if get money audrey shuddered must not like dowry earned in way said why not be on side of justice be right to hunt down criminal who vex law abiding citizen profession be glorious one although be looked at askance however when marry edwin be purser on liner will give up hunting for criminal arrest of lady branwin murderer will be last achievement in line ralph glanced at audrey looked down at husband same thought be in mind of be shawe who put into word can expect man to supply reward for own capture asked young man perry toat raised eyebrow what do mean oh see laughed softly set mind at rest mr shawe believe that father be guilty paused for effect then added calmly have seen miss rosy pearl ralph threw away cigarette with ejaculation oh did tell truth told great deal will impart to gradually one moment interrupted ralph hurriedly tell opinion of be really stupid woman be stupidity feigned ask hard question said little woman gravely be stupid in many way have cunning protective instinct like of many animal with small brain power cunning be cleverly masked by apparent simplicity ah said barrister significantly then be really in passage on night yes be wore long rough cloak of harris tweed sir joseph have presented to be therefore right when denied to mr shawe that have worn dress kind of half truth half lie quite so threatened to set inspector lanton to question unless be frank with be in deadly terror of publicity lest must harm spotless reputation be so proud of for reason because said must not make confidence too public told what knew then understand said shawe quietly that be not guilty if be must not have given promise be certainly not guilty to mind said perry toat after pause although other people might think different judge for mr shawe tell said then can judge remarked audrey quickly perry toat nodded rosy pearl be sleeping in upstairs bedroom on night be there for treatment found impossible to sleep because night be so warm therefore sat at open window look out on to court for sake of keeping draught away be important point concealed behind curtain night be luminous a be summer so in half gloom saw outer door set in wall of court open man come in audrey ralph uttered exclamation simultaneously who be man asked barrister hurriedly miss pearl must not tell a be too dark to see man face saw steal round court apparently coming to door gave admission into house naturally did not know of door a man disappeared from gaze thought that must have entered house for moment thought strange not knowing that door of court be kept locked concluded that someone connected with pink shop have simply entered house ralph nodded be natural that must not suspect anything man entrance in commonplace way must not look suspicious to woman who be ignorant of constantly locked door well well pursued detective slowly miss pearl grew tired of sitting at window went to bed here according to story fell asleep perry toat looked queerly at young couple a said later awakened thinking something be wrong what did mean by exactly asked ralph bluntly simply said that have feeling that something be wrong be about nine o'clock shortly after must not so said be quite sure of exact hour however flung on harris tweed cloak went down in darkness on hearing parizade descend although did not know be parizade ran to farthest end of passage crouched on floor parizade who being blind moved easily in darkness then went up stair again why must miss pearl hesitate to address demanded audrey why must think anything be wrong asked ralph perry toat hesitated will answer question later said after reflective pause must let tell story in own way a be not easy one to tell ralph nodded go on be at disposal miss pearl pursued detective thinking man might have right to be in house went along passage looked into bedroom have box of match with struck light in room thus found lady branwin dead assured of stole up stair again without giving alarm cried ralph astonished ask said perry toat vehemently what must have done under circumstance sir joseph admired miss pearl wished wife out of way so that must marry miss pearl recognised lady branwin at once a have often seen in park other place guessed if gave alarm be called a witness how might be suspected of encompassing death ca see can see said audrey grasping position quicker than husband think considering circumstance acted wisely what did do then went back to bed told lanton next morning that have be asleep time so be story in way other portion of will tell later not just now why not asked shawe suspiciously that explanation come later also said miss toat with odd little smile to go on left miss pearl sought out eddy vail why did do demanded audrey quickly because guessed that only must have have key manufactured to fit court door be in terrible state of mind when questioned admitted that have key then be criminal cried shawe triumphantly denies that be replied perry toat quietly told that got key made a wanted to enter pink shop when must without wife knowing that be under roof badoura admitted sometimes by inner door a easily got key from nail in still room why must there be secrecy asked ralph puzzled well said perry toat after pause if ask think mr edmund vail be in habit of robbing wife when must with connivance of badoura blame girl over much a be crazy be crazy about scamp can discus later meanwhile must understand that eddy vail have skeleton key made for purpose told of story be that entered court about quarter to eight o'clock a window of bedroom wherein madame coralie lady branwin be talking be open saw one display diamond to other immediately resolved to steal a badoura have left inner door unlocked ran upstairs at five minute to eight to put still room clock back hour prove alibi intended later to steal out again into court climb through window to take jewel did said ralph quickly not immediately madame came up secured alibi then turned out by front door went round by back entered court window be still open got in found lady branwin dead diamond gone according to story be too terrified to wait see scrambled out of window again fairly ran away in hurry left key in lock of court door after turning inner door be found locked also key be on nail in still room next day said shawe quickly of course when madame turned eddy out by front badoura locked inner door restored key to nail however eddy swears that lady branwin be dead when entered doe not know who killed what be to be done now asked audrey in dismay perry toat replied promptly mr shawe must come with to london by midday train have arranged meeting with madame coralie eddy vail in office then when mr shawe mr shawe be face to face with may arrive at truth why not arrange to have sir joseph miss pearl present also oh will probably see down here to morrow said perry toat drily miss pearl assured that must do best to induce sir joseph to come down be reconciled more than intends to come down with sir joseph 'blessed be peace maker ended miss toat grinning never mind peacemaking said ralph briskly let go to london get particular matter threshed out come audrey one moment said perry toat bringing photograph out of pocket do remember how told be hunting for hospital nurse who stole colonel ilse child yes what have case to do with matter asked ralph with considerable impatience a wished to do one thing at time look at photograph mr shawe see said detective audrey took photograph looked at hard then started back with cry of amazement be picture of mother gasped said miss toat easily be misled by resemblance by absence of birthmark doe not show in photograph see said ralph examining picture be madame coralie exactly a hospital nurse kidnapper chapter xxiii one part of truth naturally mr mr shawe did not care about interrupting honeymoon by visit to town especially on errand connected with criminal matter necessity of taking such journey be very great seeing that perry toat assured how arranged interview with madame coralie husband must probably clear up matter in surprising way apparently detective knew much more than be prepared to admit for once twice looked at young couple in odd way ralph saw stealthy glance did not ask in presence of wife what meant warned by experience hesitated to be too abrupt in questioning did not know what astonishing fact might be told young man did express surprise when examined photograph of madame coralie be woman without doubt for face although looking much younger be too strongly marked to be mistaken be dressed a nurse looked quite pretty a figure be more shapely garb became of course birthmark be not revealed by photographic process if have be ralph be not sufficiently expert to know be eliminated carefully so that subject of portrait might appear at best where did get asked ralph when trio walked back to three fisher to get ready for midday journey have be hunting for for long time replied perry toat replacing photograph in pocket at length procured from old servant of colonel ilse who have be in house when madame coralie acted a nurse to mr ilse called mr askew then askew askew muttered shawe musingly true name be arkwright used false name with same initial letter because of mark on linen doubt said miss toat of course portrait be taken more than twenty year ago there be sufficient resemblance for to recognise a of madame coralie a always wear yashmak forget midnight exploration of pink shop when saw madame coralie in bed without yashmak by light of bull eye lantern said detective quickly then be sure that be nurse who stole child quite sure appears be jealous of mr ilse a be in love with colonel at time although have ground to go upon be not colonel then of course be pleased at discovery expect said audrey perry toat cast one of stealthy glance at young wife very pleased indeed assented cordially since discovery of madame coralie a nurse may give back daughter at three fisher audrey found curt note from father saying that be coming down to see afternoon a have obtained address from lady sanby sir joseph have learnt about wedding how lady sanby have acted a fairy godmother perhaps for reason be willing to be reconciled to daughter letter from miss rosy pearl to ralph have arrived by same post put different complexion on affair miss pearl wrote saying that have prevailed on sir joseph to become friend again with audrey that must come with millionaire to weed on sand to witness reconciliation fortunately be not engaged at music hall for two week wrote dancer so can stay at three fisher for night cultivate society of wife may tell that if be not at weed on sand must not be able to come down with sir joseph a in profession one can never be too careful ralph laughed at display of miss pearl uneasy virtue be afraid that will not find here said to audrey not afternoon replied girl quickly can return by late train must like to become reconciled with papa think lady sanby have something to do with sir joseph desire to be on speaking term with said ralph trifle drily doubt gave good talking to however will leave note saying that will return by when can return miss toat detective thought for moment so leave here by half past twelve train said looking at watch attached to wrist get to london at past two o'clock will reach office in buckingham street at three there expect to find madame coralie eddy vail waiting for interview will likely be long one say two three hour can catch six o'clock train there be also one at eight if prefer to dine in london will take six train back said audrey quickly a want to keep father waiting longer than can help to say nothing of miss pearl said ralph with shrug must be horrified if did not arrive at three fisher until eight o'clock found alone with future husband at disgraceful hour by way miss toat went on quickly for saw that audrey be about to rebuke for flippant speech doe colonel ilse know that know that interview be taking place interrupted detective rapidly will be present at so that madame coralie may be forced to tell where long lost daughter be to be found of course have affair of murder to deal with also be just a well to get whole matter finished off at once for one will be delighted said shawe with emphasis be very very tired of whole sordid business think must have be when wrote that anonymous letter said miss toat with sly smile ralph laughed be very clever of to trace writing of to remarked coolly however wife now understands why wrote here audrey intimated opinion that must lose train if did not start at once for station other agreed brisk walk soon took on to platform shortly be on way to junction there transferred three self to main express during journey talked great deal about case a have compartment to ralph saw although audrey did not that miss toat be keeping back something be anxious to tell wondered what must be when train left junction steamed through clear atmosphere in midst of sunshine a drew near to metropolis air became dense smoky by time arrived at terminus three traveller found environed by thick fog not glimpse of sun be to be seen round be cotton wool atmosphere disagreeable dispiriting audrey shivered when stepped out on to london platform be glad that ralph have insisted on bringing fur cloak with for to wear what extraordinary climate said with shudder scarcely hour ago be in broad sunshine now look at look at what asked ralph laughing can see nothing indeed be right from victoria station to strand be in kind of cloud land through taxi cab crawled at cautious pace took three quarter of hour to reach buckingham street here fog be denser than ever miss toat leading way up narrow stair to office simply groped amidst familiar surroundings like miner in coal mine however two room of office blazed with electric light warmth illumination be quite comfortable after chilly gloom of street madame coralie husband be waiting colonel ilse have not yet put in appearance proprietress of pink shop have for once discarded turkish dress yashmak wore quiet costume loose cloak to hide shapeless figure together with thick black veil masked disfigured face eddy appeared over dressed more cherubic than ever in quite unnecessary fur coat for day be warm in spite of fog did not need face however be very pale looked decidedly uncomfortable a grinned uneasily at mr shawe dear aunt flora how be said girl coming forward madame coralie kept at arm length simply shook hand be mr shawe now said quietly belong to will always look upon a aunt will never forget kindness to in hour of need said audrey hurt by cold behaviour be good child said madame coralie quietly in steady voice have not done wish to do intend to see father make give allowance oh papa will do in case think said mr shawe eagerly be going down

madame coralie sharply eddy told that have be talking to insisted must come with day perhaps will tell what mean fool added glaring at eddy through veil pretend know nothing eddy swallowed something balanced smart silk hat on knee only know that miss toat seems to think that killed lady branwin be ridiculous said madame coralie resolutely be going to re open that painful case asked perry toat abruptly think that be ever closed said detective quietly in view of what miss pearl overheard be necessary to talk about matter however painful may be to madame what did miss pearl overhear will know later be belief said madame coralie folding arm speaking in loud tone miss pearl be implicated in matter will prove that in certain way said perry toat quickly a miss pearl certainly saw lady branwin dead stole down into lower passage entered bedroom about nine what be doing wandering about house at hour demanded madame coralie fiercely will learn soon meanwhile must wait for arrival of colonel ilse looked directly at madame coralie to see what effect name have on recollection name brought to madame coralie did not reveal that startled remained silent behind thick fold of veil masked face audrey must have spoken if only to ask why perry toat be badgering aunt when door opened colonel ilse made appearance looked spic span entirely military in upright carriage be glad to see colonel ilse said perry toat audrey whose hand be on arm of aunt felt woman quiver although did not open colonel seemed rather perturbed addressed to miss toat after hurried glance at audrey wrote saying have found nurse who stole daughter elsie said in faltering tone yes said perry toat deliberately pointing to madame coralie there be colonel be lie breathed madame coralie under breath be not lie said detective coldly more than fact that husband killed lady branwin be lie eddy jumped to foot with shrill hysterical laugh did not kill lady branwin said excitedly can prove did not hold tongue fool cried madame coralie savagely prove innocence commanded perry toat who looked puzzled lady branwin said vail still shrilly be not dead not dead everyone looked bewildered eddy stretched out hand pulled veil from wife face woman be lady branwin said with choking note in voice mother mother cried audrey rising to foot grasping at ralph for support chapter xxiv part of truth be indeed lady branwin who sat there quiet silent immovable gazing at astonished company eddy with look of fear on craven face have sunk back into chair moment have torn off veil have told wonderful truth others
