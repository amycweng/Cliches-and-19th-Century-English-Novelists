moustache short imperial talked in languid way in somewhat obscure manner be trait juliet disliked in basil must rather have seen spruce well groomed man about town like cuthbert at present moment

yes aunt selina have be murdered called to see morning found house in possession of police day have be down there with mallow with cuthbert said juliet starting growing red what be doing there came

there brother threw keen glance at see that exclaimed gave reason for being in neighborhood came up with be coming on here in few moment be why did not turn up afternoon juliet nodded appeared satisfied with explanation kept eye on brother when entered into detail about crime emotion during recital betrayed markedly saw detective said basil with quicker speech than usual be first rate chap called jennings when heard be miss loach nephew did mind speaking freely what did learn asked mr octagon enough to make mystery surrounding death deeper than ever what do mean asked sister restlessly ca murderer be found not trace of can be discovered why do say 'him might have be woman rejoined basil positively woman must have struck so hard blow aunt selina be stabbed to heart must have be killed a be rising from chair death so doctor say must have be instantaneous have weapon be found asked juliet in low voice basil turned quickly in chair looked at sharply said not sign of weapon can

sent clancy away at ten o'clock parlor maid returned to kitchen there have supper heard bell ring at eleven found aunt dead in sitting room stabbed to heart heard bell ring echoed juliet how must aunt ring if have be killed might have rung a be dying said basil after pause seems be seated near button of bell must have touched without rising might have rung with last effort then have died before parlor maid must get to room else said mr octagon anxious to prove perspicuity assassin may have stabbed then have touched bell what cried step son derisively to summon witness think assassin must be such fool however be can be discovered aunt selina be dead one know who killed be house locked up front door be closed window be bolted barred besides policeman be walking down crooked lane few minute before eleven must have seen anyone leaving house reported that be quiet then assassin might have rung bell at eleven said peter certainly not for must never have escaped immediately afterwards without policeman seeing might have got out by back suggested juliet dear girl what be thinking of wall round lord caranby mansion block exit at back anyone leaving house must go up lane through part at bottom policeman be near there shortly before eleven saw one leaving house look here said mr octagon who have be ruminating if a doctor say death be instantaneous how must aunt have rung bell yes added juliet even have death not taken place at once must not have be more than few minute before eleven when blow be struck aunt might have have strength to crawl to bell touch assassin must not have escaped from house seeing a say policeman be on guard aunt died instantaneously insisted basil then must not have sounded bell said juliet triumphantly assassin did that said peter thus called witness cried basil ridiculous then how do explain matter ca explain neither can detective jennings be mystery must of servant began peter interrupted saxon four servant be having supper in kitchen be innocent well will see what inquest reveals something may be found before then likely to elucidate mystery here come mallow questioned jennings also so can question if like doe mother know yes doe want fact of relationship to aunt talked about basil understood at once wonder said shrugging shoulder be not pleasant affair for woman of mother celebrity to be mixed up with meantime juliet having heard ring at front door escaped from room to see lover met divesting of overcoat in hall ran to with outstretched hand why have got on overcoat warm day asked have cold caught one last night said cuthbert kissing where be last night asked juliet drawing into side room thought be coming to marlow theatre with basil yes uncle arrived unexpectedly in england sent for to hotel in guelph street avon hotel know will insist on fire even in june room be so hot that caught cold when came out have to go down to rexton to day on business put on coat so a to avoid catching further cold why room juliet father basil be in drawing room be talking of murder want to hear more about there be pleasanter thing to talk about said mallow knew basil must come crammed with news have told told everything must gather from detective seems that crime be quite mystery quite why aunt must be killed how assassin escaped after killing can not be discovered jennings be in high glee about love puzzle of sort do know asked juliet anxiously oh yes jennings be gentleman be at eton with ran through money took up detective business be very clever if anyone will learn truth will now theory juliet put hand over mouth said have have enough horror for afternoon let talk of must rather do said mallow kissed mallow be handsome fellow tall slim with rather military carriage face be clean shaven save for small straw colored moustache showed up almost white against bronze of face be more of athlete than student be one reason why juliet be fond of have seen so much of literary circle that always vowed must marry man who never opened book cuthbert nearly fulfilled requirement a read little save novel newspaper be well known in sporting circle having good private income owned race horse be always irreproachably dressed good humored cheerful consequently be popular if not overburdened with brain managed to make agreeable to world to have what american call good time have travelled much be fond of big game shooting to complete characterization be necessary to mention that have served in boer war have gained dso be in day before met juliet might not have risked life so precious to juliet be dark rather little not at like junoesque mother be extremely pretty dressed to perfection having more brain stronger will than mallow guided in way have already succeeded in improving moral with so gentle charming mentor cuthbert be quite willing to be led into path of virtue adored juliet loved so appeared that marriage must be quite ideal much a love one said cuthbert when lover be seated on sofa wonder can talk of anything horrid murder because there be nothing to talk of rejoined girl impatiently according to basil case be most mysterious so be useless for to worry over until something tangible be discovered want to speak to seriously here juliet hesitated well go on said cuthbert taking hand mother say began juliet then hesitated again promise will keep to yourself what be about to tell certainly never be fellow to chatter then mother say that murder will put stop to marriage mallow stared then flushed up to ear what on earth doe mean by that asked aghast juliet looked searchingly at do know of impediment of course be sorry for death of aunt really see what have to do with juliet drew breath of relief mother hint that know who committed crime what know how doe know ca say refuse to speak be not on good term with aunt selina never saw one for over fifteen year mother be much disturbed about murder be natural sister be sister however much one may have quarrelled why must death stop marriage know more than do here be mother ask yourself be indeed mr octagon who entered room looked very pale otherwise be perfectly composed in silence gave hand to cuthbert kept black eye fixed steadily on face young man flushed turned away whereat mr octagon sighed juliet broke embarrassed silence mother said have told cuthbert what said then have right to said mr octagon sternly oh think have said mallow rather annoyed seeing hint that crime will stop marriage mr octagon did not answer be uncle in town asked yes arrived from continent day two ago thought so said half to herself strove to repress agitation mr mallow daughter ca marry why not give reason have reason to give must be on account of murder be told juliet so can not explain lover looked at one in dazed fashion woman objection seemed to be senseless surely think cuthbert killed aunt selina said juliet laughing in forced manner suspect then whom do suspect demanded mallow decline to say will decline to say to police mr octagon stepped back pace yes must faltered cuthbert mallow looked at wondering why be so agitated juliet stole hand into then addressed seriously mr octagon said remark about uncle lead to think suspect ca marry juliet on account of crime then hear said mallow driven into corner from moment devote to finding out who killed unfortunate sister when assassin be discovered may consent to marriage spoke to empty air mr octagon have left room almost before first word left mouth chapter v lord caranby romance cuthbert be considerably perplexed by attitude of juliet mother have always be more than kind to on announcement that wished to marry daughter have expressed well pleased during engagement have lasted six month have received a juliet intended husband with almost ostentatious delight now for inexplicable reason suddenly changed mind declined to explain rack brain a might cuthbert must not see how death of sister have quarrelled with to whom have be stranger for so long must affect engagement however there be doubt in mind that refusal of mr octagon to approve of marriage lay in fact that sister have met with violent end therefore mallow be determined to see jennings help to best of ability to discover assassin when criminal be brought to justice either mr opposition must be at end true reason for existence must be revealed meantime be sure that must keep juliet out of way that in future must be refused admittance to shrine of mus be annoying so long a juliet remained true cuthbert thought must bear exclusion betrothed a still regarded girl must meet in park at house of mutual friend in thousand one place clever woman like must think of although cuthbert knew that mr octagon have frequently regretted refusal of daughter to marry arkwright must probably try induce to do so now that matter stood thus yet be not afraid in own heart juliet be a staunch a steel be certain that mr octagon must be on side basil probably must agree with mother whose lead slavishly followed mallow have rather contempt for basil did not count opposition a dangerous on leaving shrine of mus young man first intention be to seek out jennings see what progress be making in matter on reflection thought must call again on uncle question regarding knowledge of mr octagon seemed to cuthbert that from woman question a to whether lord caranby have returned from abroad remark on hearing that have suspicion be in mind a to being concerned in crime yet beyond fact that unfinished house stood behind cottage where crime have be committed belonged to lord caranby who have known dead woman in past cuthbert must not see how mr octagon must constitute latter day connection between dead sister old friend lord caranby might be induced to talk easy matter from what said mystery of mr octagon attitude might be elucidated only in past so far a perplexed young man must conjecture must be found reason for sudden change of front cuthbert therefore sent wire to uncle stating that wished to see after eight o'clock on special business then went home to dress while thus employed thought over mean way to make caranby open mouth old lord be silent grave man who never uttered unnecessary word be difficult to induce to be confidential invariably have approved of nephew engagement although have never seen juliet so might be that must speak out if there be anything to say in order to remove impediment to match depended upon what information received a to how mallow must act at half past eight drove to avon hotel be shown up at once to uncle sitting room that must live in hotel be of caranby eccentricity have house in town three in country yet for year have lived a saying be on portmanteau even villa at nice owned be unoccupied by strange nobleman be usually let to rich american when in england stopped at avon hotel when in country remained at inn of neighborhood in might chance to find wandering wandering be excellent word to apply to lord caranby peregrination be a restless a gipsy far more aimless never appeared to take interest in anything be always moving here there everywhere have so far a cuthbert knew object in life reason for cainlike behavior caranby never condescended to explain when nephew entered room looking smart handsome in accurate evening suit caranby who be seated near fire stood up courteously to welcome leaning on cane suffered from sciatica must not walk save with assistance of stick on account also always insisted on room being heated to extraordinary degree like salamander basked in heat must not allow door window to be opened even in midst of summer when large fire made apartment almost unendurable cuthbert felt a though be walking into turkish bath sat a far away from fire a must after saluting uncle sank back into seat looked at inquiringly lord caranby be tall thin almost emaciated with lean sallow clean shaven face scanty crop of fair hair mixed with gray eye be sunken full of vitality although usually be grave somewhat sad hand be deformed with gout for that wore several costly ring be perfectly dressed a quiet composed a artist model when spoke be in unemotional way a though have exhausted expression of feeling early in life perhaps have for from what cuthbert have heard from uncle past of nobleman be not without excitement caranby name be rarely mentioned in london remained so much abroad that have quite dropped out of circle to entry of rank entitled age be sixty five be surprised at seeing again to night said cuthbert be never surprised at anything replied uncle dryly exhausted have to say to one before eight o'clock last night at time left therefore know why have come evening conversation be bound to be dull excuse ca afford to be bored at age can not say that conversation be particularly agreeable last night rejoined mallow equally dryly talked business money matter about will about engagement also said caranby without vestige of smile must interest young man of ardent temperament certainly thought subject amused must be surprised to learn that engagement have be broken off since conversation said cuthbert crossing leg who can account for whim of woman after perhaps be to be congratulated on not marrying weathercock juliet have nothing to do with breaking of engagement mother object understood for last six month that mother not only approved be delighted be strange part sir on hearing of death of sister mr octagon suddenly changed mind told that marriage must not take place did give reason declined to do so same woman muttered caranby always mysterious unsatisfactory say sister be dead cuthbert cast look at globe lay on small table near caranby elbow if have read paper sir yes have read that miss loach have be murdered went down to rexton to day presume heard something more than detail set forth by press cuthbert nodded appears to be mystery caranby did not reply looked into fire poor selina said half to sad end for such charming woman must hardly apply word to miss loach sir did not appear to be lady be by mean refined must have changed then in young day sister be handsomest woman in london believe be engaged to one of said mallow politely yes replied uncle grimly escaped escaped strange word be not suitable one cuthbert did not know what to make of speech have permission to smoke asked taking out case yes will have coffee thank have before came here will extended case of cigarette caranby declined ring for fletcher to get chibouque be in corner will dispense with fletcher with permission cuthbert brought chibouque to uncle side in minute old man be smoking a gravely a turk method of consuming tobacco be eccentricity for few moment spoke then caranby broke silence so want to help to find out mr octagon reason do said mallow rather surprised by caranby perspicuity what make think can explain cuthbert looked at cigarette asked on chance that may be able to do so said gravely fact be to be frank mr octagon appears to think might have something to do with crime caranby did not seem surprised smoked imperturbably quite understand young man related how mr octagon have inquired if earl be back from continent subsequent remark of course may be unduly suspicious said suggested quite so interrupted old gentleman gravely be quick at putting two two together isabella octagon hate so much that must gladly see on scaffold be not astonished that suspect what motive can impute caranby laid aside long coil be holding laughed quietly to oh will find motive if suit what can not understand be why must accuse now have have ample opportunity during past twenty year since death of miss saul for instance did not exactly accuse no woman like must not then of course sister dying only last night affords opportunity of getting into trouble be afraid mr octagon will be disappointed of revenge long though have waited revenge remember sir be mother of juliet sincerely hope juliet doe not take after then said lord caranby tartly to be perfectly plain with cuthbert must never understand why mr octagon sanctioned engagement with daughter considering be nephew understand said mallow staring uneasily caranby did not answer immediately rose walked painfully up down room leaning heavily on cane mallow offered arm be impatiently waved aside when old man sat down again turned serious face to nephew do love girl with heart soul love of course be made for one mr octagon like mr octagon never did said mallow impetuously care two straw for opposition will marry juliet in spite of revenge seems to be practising on though why must hope to vex by meddling with marriage can not understand can put matter in nutshell said caranby quoted congreve have rage like love to hatred turned hell fury like woman scorned oh said mallow dropping cigarette whole story be revealed to in quotation gentleman doe talk of thing said caranby abruptly for year have held tongue still a mr octagon doe not hesitate to strike at through a happiness be at stake happiness of girl love will tell so far a can guess why woman behaves in way if please sir cuthbert settled to listen about twenty year ago said caranby plunging into subject isabella selina loach be well known in society be daughter of country squire kent remember created sensation with beauty when came to town fell in love with selina isabella if will pardon vanity fell in love with hated sister on account must have married selina father who be hard up wished to marry wealthy american isabella to part selina from helped father what argument used know selina suddenly changed in manner towards out of pique may think weak of cuthbert be fool in day became engaged to girl who be singer name be emilia saul believe be of jewish extraction liked in way have wonderful power over proposed be accepted if have really loved miss loach must have worn willow told be foolish moreover miss saul fascinated selina be cold emilia be charming be weak therefore became engaged to emilia selina a heard arranged to marry wealthy american believe be angry at apparently forgetting so soon be in fault not cuthbert looked at smart shoe have loved selina said slowly must have remained true to have married in spite of objection of father of sister isabella mr octagon be forget that cuthbert must scarcely run away with girl who believed story about what sort of story asked mallow remembering certain rumor sort one always doe tell of unmarried man retorted caranby scandalous story isabella picked up retailed to selina never pretended to be saint have selina really loved must have overlooked certain fault did love cuthbert did in power to prove love for time be engaged to when expressed wish must build house after own design consented house at rexton exclaimed young man exactly got architect to build according to design suggested by selina when engagement be broken became out of pique remember engaged to miss saul still went on building house selina believe be very angry one week when be out of london went down with sister to see house there met emilia ah then there be trouble no there be time for quarrel if be what mean when three met emilia be walking across plank on unfinished second story on seeing loach girl be isabella tale emilia lost footing fell thirty foot be killed almost instantaneously face be much disfigured took place during dinner hour when workman be absent when returned body be found recognized by clothes did not girl remain took fright at accident returned home here fresh disaster awaited mr loach be dead died suddenly of heart disease selina at once broke engagement with american returned to strangely enough did not never saw again after death of father girl went to continent only came back after two year abroad then isabella after vainly trying to get to marry became wife of saxon then rising barrister selina went to rexton shut up in house now have house did have corrected cuthbert forget be dead yes tried to see refused to look on face again alleging that have treated badly by becoming engaged to miss saul that poor soul be buried then shut up house left a be now travelled a know for year be travelling still for matter of added caranby with sigh selina fault be only woman ever loved be there not inquest held on emilia body oh yes isabella gave evidence a to accident selina be too ill to appear there be need cause of death be plain enough moreover emilia have relative who cared to make inquiry left very little money so have did not trouble be strange story said cuthbert looking puzzled have idea that emilia may have be pushed off plank by selina certainly not rejoined caranby indignantly be good kind girl must not do thing humph said mallow remembering eagle nose thin lip of miss loach be not so sure of isabella who be passionate might have done resumed caranby often did wish to speak to on subject never did after jury brought in verdict of accidental death so there be use making trouble have emilia no relative who might have made inquiry believe have brother who be clerk in office a said left money so did not bother saw after death sight of made glad have not married sister looked thorough blackguard sly dangerous a said emilia came of low people be only fine voice great talent brought into society where met have never heard of brother since expect be dead by time be over twenty year ago can now understand why mr octagon object to marriage have never forgiven for not making wife cuthbert nodded again ca understand why must have consented at only to alter mind when selina died ca understand decline to mix up in matter will have to learn reason intend to said mallow rising reason be certain be connected with violent death of sister speech to caranby replied by shaking head did not agree with idea see in spite of mr octagon hint have reason to kill selina said caranby gravely can not understand why isabella must accuse chapter vi perplexing case morning after visit to lord caranby mallow be unexpectedly called to devonshire on account of mother illness mr mallow be fretful hypochondriac who always imagined worse than really be cuthbert have often be summoned to dying bed only to find that be alive well expected that summons must be false alarm being dutiful son tore away from town took mid day express to exeter a expected mr mallow be by mean so bad a hinted in wire cuthbert be vexed that must have called down insisted that must remain unwilling to cause pain did so be four day before returned to london visit to exeter be not without result for asked mother about caranby romance mr mallow knew about highly disapproved of brother in law be crazy said vigorously when subject be brought up one evening life have be queer father must have have title cuthbert well will have day said son soothingly caranby be not likely to marry yes will never be lady caranby lamented mr mallow who be intensely selfish egotistical must have adorned title such old one a be too be glad that horrid selina loach never became wife even saul girl must have be better speak evil of dead mother see why must praise bad dead snapped mr mallow never liked isabella selina be horrid girl constantly quarrelling hardly ever spoke to one how can contemplate marrying daughter of isabella really know slight to there have said have to say on subject to do justice mr mallow certainly have never ceased nagging at cuthbert to break engagement have known that mr octagon have forbidden marriage must have rejoiced to save making awkward explanation to woman who must not hold tongue cuthbert said nothing about breach did like miss saul mother asked only saw on concert platform said mr mallow opening eye gracious cuthbert never associated with sort of people caranby be infatuated with to be sure got engaged to spite selina really did treat badly believe miss saul horrid hebrew name be hypnotized forgot almost a soon a died in spite of ridiculous idea of shutting up house such valuable land a there be at rexton too well hope violent death of selina will be warning to caranby not that wish harm in spite of being next heir to title do money while mr mallow rambled on in diffusive manner cuthbert be thinking when ended why must death be warning to caranby asked quickly good gracious cuthbert get on nerve why because believe that selina pushed miss saul off plank killed be just kind of violent girl who must do thing like miss saul relative have waited year to kill selina now be dead will kill caranby because did not marry wretched girl cuthbert stared mother what be talking about caranby told that miss saul have only one brother probably be dead ah said mr mallow did tell that miss saul father be arrested for coining passing false money forget believe brother be involved also ca be sure only know girl be dead then saul family did not move in matter a police knew too much about good gracious shuddered lady to think if have lived caranby must have married into family have cheated of title be sure of what say mother of course be look up old file of newspaper will read about matter be old history now really wo talk more of thing cuthbert if do there will be sleep for to night oh dear such nerve a have did ever see miss saul mother told did on platform be fine large big girl with hook nose big black eye rather like selina isabella for be sure have jewish blood in vein miss saul if be real name might have passed a relative of horrid loach girl mr octagon sister who died be certainly much alike of course be if miss saul have lived must have be kind of triplet hate that style of beauty said mr mallow who be slim fair so coarse everyone called loach girl pretty never did never liked wo call on mr octagon vulgar name if marry fifty of wretched daughter cuthbert say that mother juliet be angel then ca be mother daughter said mr mallow obscurely finished discussion in what considered to be triumphant manner must renew though son tried to learn more about loach saul family however be satisfied with knowledge have acquired while returning next day to london have ample time to think over what have be told miss selina loach have certainly shut up for many year in rose cottage seemed a though be afraid of being hurt in way perhaps even anticipated violent death then mr octagon hinted that knew who have killed sister might not have be caranby after whom meant one of saul family a mr mallow suggested wonder if be a mother think mused cuthbert staring out of window at panorama of landscape moving swiftly past perhaps selina did kill miss saul shut up to avoid being murdered by one of relative caranby said that selina did not go to inquest pretended be ill then sister went to continent for two year finally when returned selina instead of taking proper place in society a isabella did shut up a recluse in rose cottage saul family appear to have be bad lot must like to look up that coining case wonder if dare tell jennings be doubtful of wisdom of doing if told what knew set jennings on track might be that scandal must arise implicating mr octagon not that cuthbert cared much for be juliet mother wanted to avert trouble likely to cause girl pain dozen time on journey cuthbert altered mind first thought must tell jennings then decided to hold peace indecision be not like case be so perplexing such serious issue be involved that young man felt thoroughly worried hitherto have seen nothing new about case in paper on reaching swindon bought few looked through search be rewarded by finding article on crime inquest have be held jury have brought in verdict of murder against person person unknown be plainly stated that police must not find clue to assassin article in question did not pretend to solve mystery collocated fact so a to put case in nutshell fact be said journal after preliminary introduction quiet maiden lady living at rose cottage rexton received three friend to card party difference arising such thing will arise amongst best when card be in question two of friend mr old lady life long friend of deceased mr hale lawyer of repute legal adviser of miss loach depart before ten o'clock in evidence mr herne stated that mr hale left at half past nine assertion be corroborated by mr hale mr clancy third friend left at ten being shown out by maid susan grant who then returned to kitchen left miss loach seated in usual chair near fire with pack of card on lap probably deceased lady intended to play game of 'patience ' four servant three woman man have supper during supper man asserted that heard front door open a miss loach be in habit of walking in garden before retiring be thought that have gone out to take usual stroll whether man heard door open shut be not quite sure however thinking mistress be walking in garden a usual man paid further attention to incident at eleven precisely at eleven for kitchen clock struck sitting room bell rang susan grant entered room found miss loach seated in chair exactly a have left even to fact that card be in lap have be stabbed to heart with sharp instrument be quite dead front door be closed window barred now be certain that miss loach met death between hour of ten eleven susan grant saw alive at ten seated in usual chair with card on lap at eleven there found dead still with card must seem a though immediately after servant left room someone have stabbed deceased to heart before have time to rise even alter position susan grant asserts that one be in room there be only one door out of departed bedroom of miss loach on basement floor have door opened into passage a did sitting room door one must have entered until servant departed passage be lighted with electricity did not observe anyone about did hear sound showed out mr clancy then returned to kitchen certainly assassin may have be concealed in bedroom have stolen into sitting room when susan grant be showing out mr clancy perhaps then killed deceased suddenly a said before must have then come up stair have escaped while servant be at supper might have be murderer who opened door be overheard by thomas policeman be on duty about ten a be seen by susan grant when showed mr clancy to door policeman also asserted that be again on spot ie in roadway opposite cottage at eleven at time assassin must not have escaped without being seen there be exit at back a high wall running round unfinished house belonging to eccentric lord caranby block way therefore assassin must have ventured into roadway must then have walked up lane into main street of rexton have taken path opposite to gate of rose cottage lead to railway station probably after executing crime took latter way path run between quickset hedge rather high for long distance past house end within fifty yard of railway station criminal must take first train get to town there to lose in wilderness of london so far so good strangest thing about most mysterious affair be that bell in sitting room rang two minute before susan grant entered room to find mistress dead be time after closing of door overheard by thomas therefore assassin must not have escaped way moreover by time policeman be standing blocking pathway to station again alarm be given immediately by other servant who rushed to sitting room on hearing susan scream policeman at once searched house one be found now what be to make of doctor declares that miss loach when discovered have be dead hour corresponds with time door be heard to open shut by thomas so far must seem that assassin have escaped then having committed crime found coast inside outside house clear for flight who rang bell be question ask deceased must not have done so a according to doctor poor lady must have died immediately again assassin must not have be so foolish a to ring thus draw attention to crime letting alone question that must not have escaped at late hour can only offer solution assassin must have be concealed in bedroom after susan ascended stair to let mr clancy out must have stolen into sitting room have killed old lady before must even rise might have touched bell button bell be electric one may have got fixed later on heat of room warping wood round ivory button may have caused to slip out thus bell must have rung of course reader may say that when pressed down bell must have rung continuously examination have revealed that wire be out of order be not improbable that sudden release of button may have touched wire have set ringing peal be described a being short sharp theory be weak one be aware whole case be so mysterious weak a be can offer other solution mr herne servant messrs hale clancy be examined insist that miss loach be in usual health spirit have idea of committing suicide of being in danger of sudden death weapon can not be discovered mean save a suggest above assassin can have made escape whole affair be one of most mysterious of late year will doubtless be relegated to list of undiscovered crime police have clue apparently despair of finding one discovery of mystery lie in bell who rang did ring of a suggest above cuthbert laid down paper with shrug article did not commend to save a mean of making precis of case theory of bell appeared excessively weak must not understand man being so foolish a to put forward if button be pressed down by miss loach bell must have rung at once argued cuthbert when slipped up even with heat ringing must have stopped bell rang at eleven girl be in room two minute later someone must have rung why did someone do how did someone escape after ringing in so fool hardy manner must not find answer to question whole case be indeed most perplexing there seemed absolutely answer to riddle even supposing miss loach have be murdered out of long delayed revenge by member of saul family that theory appeared ridiculous to mallow question be how did assassin escape certainly having regard to card still being on lap of deceased closing of door at time when policeman be not in vicinity assassin may have escaped in way how did come to be hidden in bedroom how did kill old lady before have time to call out even rise seeing that have whole length of room to cross before reaching again escape of assassin at hour did not explain ringing of bell cuthbert be deeply interested wondered if mystery must ever be solved must see jennings after thought a train steamed into paddington see jennings did sooner than expected that same evening when be dressing to go out card be brought be inscribed mile jennings rather surprised that detective must seek out so promptly cuthbert entered sitting room jennings who be standing with back to window saluted with pleasant smile spoke to a to equal of course have right to do so since have be at school with mallow somehow familiarity irritated cuthbert well jennings what be came to ask few question mallow about what about murder at rose cottage dear fellow know nothing about knew miss loach yes saw once twice did not like be aunt of young lady be engaged to marry mallow drew up stiffly a matter of fact be said with marked coldness see will in minute said jennings briskly pardon be in love with woman mallow grew red what devil do mean by coming here to ask question demanded gently mallow be friend may need one do mean do accuse of accuse of nothing said jennings quickly ask why did give photograph with inscription to servant of murdered woman recognize photograph servant susan grant picture be found in possession refuse to speak here detective spoke lower in case get into trouble with police chapter vii detective two men looked at one jennings searchingly cuthbert with look of mingled amazement indignation be rather like in look being tall slim fair haired mallow wore mustache whereas detective possibly for sake of disguising on occasion be clean shaven although jennings profession

however took note of address said must attend to matter to tell truth be useless said assassin will never be discovered moreover there be reward must only work for wage stay at rose cottage now believe mr clancy do mr pill have taken place who told heard from susan grant be witness if remember have mr pill married barnes yet ca say said clancy looking keenly at detective be not yet boarder move in after fortnight expect marriage will take place before then susan grant told that also did expect will see again well gentleman must go away hope will be lucky jennings moved away saw from eager manner in two men began to converse that be subject of conversation looked round for caranby must not see when be out of house however on pavement lighting cigarette felt touch on arm found caranby waiting for old gentleman pointed with cane to brougham get in said have be waiting to see there be much to talk about maraquito asked jennings eagerly have something to do with matter love for cuthbert have made involve how far in what way know what of clancy hale oh have put off scent think have given up case maraquito be connected with matter somehow ca for life of see in what way though there be woman connected with matter mr octagon what do mean asked jennings quickly saw enter maraquito house few moment before came down chapter xiii juliet at bay caranby reply took away jennings breath case be one of surprise be not quite prepared for such announcement be in brougham driving towards avon hotel with old nobleman before found tongue what can mr octagon have to do with maraquito asked amazed ah be question replied caranby affording clue did not even know be acquainted with perhaps gamble even if did maraquito salon must hardly be place must choose for amusement moreover maraquito doe not receive lady have love for own sex what woman have murmured caranby ironically then added after pause know that mr octagon be present when emilia fell from plank in rexton house yes gave evidence at inquest understand selina did not if cuthbert informed rightly selina be ill in bed must not come afterwards went abroad have often wondered added caranby why selina did seek out when death broke engagement to emilia loved father being dead there must have be bar to marriage a be threw over american dedicated to hermit life at rexton never saw again never started to travel came to london only at rare interval did write to selina asking to see always refused so became philosophic took to celibacy also very strange murmured jennings thought elsewhere doe not explain mr octagon visit to house be not so sure of if mean be house mr octagon may know a do that maraquito be niece of emilia be sure of asked detective eagerly a sure a be that be spaniard even spanish jewess a claim to be doe even know language name to fit woman must terminate in feminine manner must be called not maraquito little grammatical error doubtless escaped notice a be saying maraquito will still call so may have sent for mr octagon mr octagon so far a have seen be not woman to obey call said jennings grimly maraquito may have compelled to come for what reason well see be said by isabella loach mr octagon be to have fallen from plank mr octagon may have pushed off may have murdered in fact quite so isabella loved be be very violent woman may be that pushed off plank maraquito through dead father may have learned truth must give hold over mr octagon selina may have killed emilia must explain hermit life inexplicable in other way said caranby in shaking voice be sure woman loved must never have behaved in way isabella killed emilia if be murder then threatened to denounce selina unless gave up idea of marrying added caranby a though struck with new idea may be cause why selina never answered letter always refused to see marry may have be be sure be under thumb of isabella now that selina be dead isabella be under thumb of maraquito be theory said jennings impatiently can only theorize in present state of uncertainty be reply of nobleman explanation be reasonable one deny why must maraquito send for mr octagon why echoed caranby in surprise in order to stop marriage with cuthbert maraquito love cuthbert hate juliet daresay be solution of mr octagon strange behavior since death be maraquito who be stopping marriage by threatening to denounce mr octagon for murder of aunt juliet know hence reticence might be so murmured jennings more more perplexed miss saxon wo be reticent with will see to morrow what mean will use to make speak will tell that cuthbert may be arrested for crime know be about place on night of murder yes went down to look after possible ghost hope will not bring cuthbert into matter unless be absolutely necessary want scandal rest easy lord caranby have complete control of affair will only use cuthbert presence at rexton to make miss saxon speak out then may not be keeping silence for cuthbert sake a ca possibly know be at rexton on night own opinion be that be shielding brother do suspect asked caranby quickly may not be guilty of crime know something about be sure here jennings related how clancy have said basil must speak out if pressed too hard now basil for reason be in difficulty with hale who be scoundrel basil know something hale clancy wish to be kept silent hale have be using threat to basil young man have turned restive clancy who be by mean such fool a look warned hale to night therefore take basil have information about murder miss saxon know have be shielding clancy hale mr herne be out of house when woman be stabbed said caranby can not have anything to do with quite so on face of that bell jennings broke off think three be so innocent a appears however mr herne be coming back to hampstead house next week will see put question will not answer said caranby drily besides must have put at inquest case have not developed so far have not so much information a have now argued jennings did examine mr herne at inquest gave evidence jennings hesitated also wore veil when spoke refused to raise on account of weak eye by way do notice that maraquito us strong scent yes clancy hale also use have said jennings surprised never knew that decidedly be growing stupid well mr herne us that scent also be rare scent then jennings told what susan grant have said now think there be significance in scent be connected with association of clancy hale maraquito mr herne mr herne doe know maraquito be not so sure of susan grant think may be mother be so like in elderly way did know mr saul knew brother who came to speak to after death of sister who afterwards be put in jail for coining wife never met never even heard of maraquito take after father in look be like emilia be difficult matter to unravel said jennings think mr herne refused to raise veil at inquest so that likeness between maraquito might not be observed be there if mr herne be what say must have be put on guard by maraquito though to be sure added jennings in vexed tone maraquito did not know then perhaps doe not know now that be detective clancy hale will enlighten said caranby a vehicle stopped will not come in not to night will do honor of calling on later when have more to say at present be going to sort out what evidence have to morrow will call on miss saxon call on mr octagon be caranby parting word believe know truth will tell one thing maraquito did not kill miss loach for death of selina have given juliet enough money to marry cuthbert independent of mr octagon wish maraquito must never have brought that about yet same miss saxon will not marry caranby made gesture to show that matter be beyond comprehension ascended step of hotel jennings deep in thought walked away wondering how be to disentangle skein fate have placed in hand to unravel night detective surveyed situation so far a must see seemed further advanced than have be at inquest certainly have accumulated mass of evidence threw light on case from caranby romance seemed that dead woman have be connected with saul family seemed to link with maraquito who appeared to be sole surviving member in turn maraquito be connected in underhand way with mr octagon seeing that elder woman came by stealth to soho house mr octagon be connected with late emilia saul by crime if what caranby surmised be correct daughter be forbidden to marry mallow who be nephew of man who have be lover of miss loach emilia saul hale clancy be playing game with basil saxon who be son of mr octagon be associated with maraquito thus must seem that people be connected in various way with dead woman question be have one of struck fatal blow if so who have be daring enough to do so again murmured jennings who touched bell not assassin who must scarcely have be fool enough to call anyone to examine work before have time to escape certainly may have be woman yes believe man killed miss loach for reason have yet to learn woman out of jealousy wishing to get into grip of law touched bell so that witness might appear before assassin must escape who struck blow be difficult question must not have be basil saxon for be at marlow theatre on night with sister cuthbert have motive jennings quite believed explanation a to exploration of park between hour of ten eleven hale clancy mr herne be out of house before blow have be struck moreover there be reason why must murder harmless old lady maraquito confined to couch must not possibly have anything to do with crime mr octagon did hate sister certainly must not risk killing in fact jennings examining into motif movement of mentioned must find clue to right person began to believe that crime have be committed by someone who have not yet appeared someone whose motive might be found in past of dead woman say member of saul family maraquito be sole surviving member on face of be innocent a yet jennings did not know whether mr herne be mother in spite of resemblance susan claimed to have seen also caranby said that maraquito resembled father feature of saul family be so strongly marked that be impossible elder saul must have married woman resembling though to be sure might have married relative said jennings went to bed more perplexed than ever next day before calling at shrine of mus went to scotland yard there made inquiry about rumor of false coin being in circulation appeared to be numerous be admirably made also from france russia italy came report that false money be being scattered about chief of detective staff possessed coin of sort jennings be forced to own that be admirable imitation went away wondering if crime must be connected in way with circulation of false money maraquito be member of saul family who appear to have be expert coiner said jennings on way to kensington according to le beau gave false sovereign wonder if keep up business if clancy hale together with mr herne supposititious mother have to do with matter unfinished house must make admirable factory presence of ghost must be accounted for if gang of coiner be discovered there there be fifteen foot wall round house park be regular jungle cuthbert examined place by day night must see nothing suspicious wonder if miss loach living near place learned that gang be there if so be quite conceivable that might have be murdered by one of how deuce did anyone enter house door certainly opened at half past ten o'clock to let someone in someone out bell did not sound for hour later can there be outlet to house be connected with unfinished mansion of lord caranby used a factory be theory jennings must deduce other explanation from evidence have collected determined to search unfinished house since caranby have given permission also to make inspection of rose cottage though how be to enter on plausible excuse did not know fate gave chance be far from expecting on arriving at shrine of mus be informed that miss saxon have gone to rexton be natural enough since owned cottage jennings be inclined to suspect juliet from refusal to marry cuthbert to explain reason saw something suspicious in did therefore took underground railway at once to rexton alighting at station went to crooked lane through by path ran through small wood of pine on looking at cottage saw that window be open that carpet be spread on lawn that door be ajar seemed that mr pill be indulging in spring cleaning alluded to by susan grant at door jennings met mr pill with arm bare large coarse apron protecting dress be dusty untidy cross did temper grow better when saw detective whom recognized a having be present at inquest whyever 'ave come 'ere sir asked be sure there ai no more corps for to discover wish to see miss saxon be told be here well be admitted mr pill placing red arm akimbo not a feel bound to tell not being in witness box 'ave come to see about rent sir wish to speak to miss saxon said jennings patiently mr pill rubbed nose grumbled be up in attic said lookin ' at dress left by pore miss loach there ai room in 'ouse fit to let sit down in by reason of chair being about 'ave come to tell who killed mistress think assassin will ever be discovered ah well be grass wailed mr pill if wish to see miss saxon see will come way to lower room will go up to attic let go too will save miss saxon coming down said jennings wishing to take juliet unawares ah now speaks sense leg be leg when stair be about whatever may say said mr pill leading way will excuse mr policeman if stop 'avin ' lot of work to do a susan gone geraldine with 'er not to speak of 'usbin ' be to be havin ' gone to see mr herne drat why have gone to see mr herne asked jennings quickly arsk said cook querulously be secret one be thomas barnes may say come go make money by 'be doin may be for not word do 'ear of 'be prank have good mind to remain pill to end of day seein a keep secret jennings said more secretly wondered why thomas have gone to visit mr herne determined to call on lady at once see if must learn what message thomas have taken from whom have not much time for thought a mr pill opened door to right of narrow passage pushed in now will go back to dustin ' said cook hurrying away jennings found face to face with juliet be standing on chair with hand up on cornice a soon a saw came down with rather white face room be filled with trunk large deal box be open revealing clothes dust lay thick on others apparently locked untouched for many year light filtered into dusty attic through dirty window floor be strewn with straw other rubbish miss saxon did not know detective face resumed normal color expression who be what do want asked casting nervous look at cornice jennings removed hat beg pardon said politely mr pill showed up here when asked to see have right said juliet looking at dress be rather dusty come downstairs tell who be appeared anxious to get out of room walked before out of door a passed through jennings contrived to shut a though dress have caught lower part then lightly turned key must hear juliet fumbling at lock what be matter called through lock have got hampered in way said jennings rattling key one moment will look at carefully a said made one bound to chair upon have be standing reached hand to cornice at have looked passing hand rapidly along came into contact with object long sharp drew down be brand new knife of sort called bowie jennings started on seeing object having time to think for did not wish to rouse suspicion slipped knife in vest ran again to door after lot of ostentatious fumbling managed to turn key again open door juliet be flushed looked at angrily cast second look at cornice showed jennings that did not suspect ruse dress caught door shut explained lock seems to be out of order never knew be said juliet examining always locked easy enough before hum thought jennings so have be here before have kept door locked on account of knife probably looked smilingly at girl time be sorry said when desisted from examination be fault said juliet unsuspiciously closed door led way along passage down stair who be asked turning round half way down be friend of mallow said detective have never met yet have be to house miss saxon perhaps name mile jennings may girl started with cry be detective gasped chapter xiv mr octagon explains young girl leaned against wall white with closed eye alarmed by appearance jennings must have assisted waved off staggered down stair by powerful effort managed to subdue feeling when in hall turned to with sickly smile be glad to see said mr mallow have often spoken to of be friend know best friend in spite of difference in position oh juliet waved objection aside know be gentleman took up work merely a hobby fear not smiled jennings to make money not in very pleasant way however a be mr mallow friend be glad have case in hand fixed eye on detective have discovered anything asked anxiously nothing much replied jennings who rapidly decided to say nothing about discovery of knife fear truth will never be found out miss saxon suppose have idea said coloring what put thing into head be absolutely ignorant of truth did come to ask about amongst other thing interrupted jennings seeing mr pill bulky figure at door can not talk in quieter place come downstairs said juliet moving room be unfurnished a mr pill be cleaning house be quiet enough so see said detective following companion down to basement only mr pill mother answered came here to see about business connected with letting of cottage mother be lying down in old part of house do wish to see wish to see by time have entered sitting room in crime have be committed carpet be up furniture have be removed wall be bare jennings must have have better opportunity of seeking for secret entrance existence of suspected by reason of untimely sounding of bell everything seemed to be in order floor be of oak there be strangely enough hearth stone french window opened into conservatory now denuded of flower stepping into jennings found that glass roof be entirely closed save for space for ventilation assassin must not have entered escaped in way there be exit from room save by door must like to see bedroom asked juliet sarcastically see be examining place though must have thought must have done so before did at time replied jennings calmly place be then full of furniture carpet be down let see bedroom by mean juliet led way into next room be also bare there be one window hermetically sealed with iron shutter looked out on to kind of well light be reflected from above by mean of sheet of silvered tin one must have got out by window even then must have be difficult to have climbed up well led to surface of ground floor wall have mark of entrance jennings returned to sitting room completely baffled then juliet spoke again can not help wondering what expect to find observed thought there might be secret entrance said jennings looking at keenly there seems to be none miss saxon appeared genuinely astonished looked round never heard of such thing said puzzled must quiet old lady like aunt need with secret entrance well see assassin must not have sounded that bell have escaped by front door have done so must have met susan grant answering call therefore must have escaped in other way window of room be out of question yes understood that assassin escaped at half past ten according to evidence look like who then sounded bell juliet shook head ca say said with sigh whole case be mystery to know who killed miss loach please look so indignant miss saxon be only doing duty girl forced smile really know can think what motive assassin can have have must have have reason know mr jennings say 'he ' be assassin then man suppose so at inquest doctor said that woman must have struck blow be really ignorant of save what appeared in paper be worst person in world to apply to for information sir perhaps be so far a crime be concerned there be one question must like to ask impertinent one what be demanded girl visibly nervous why do refuse to marry mallow be very impertinent said juliet controlling so much so that refuse to reply a gentleman take answer said jennings mildly a detective ask again for reason fail to see what private affair have to do with law jennings smiled at answer thought of knife have found le cautious man must have produced at once have insisted on explanation jennings wished to learn to whom knife belonged before ventured be sure that be not property of juliet who have need for dangerous article be equally sure that a be shielding someone must acknowledge that have bought weapon be treading on egg shell behooved to be cautious very good said at length will pas question for present though a mallow friend be sorry will tell to whom gave photograph of mallow presented to how do know about asked miss saxon quickly why do ask because have seen photograph be impossible answered coldly unless be in house before death of aunt ah then be to miss loach gave said jennings wondering how maraquito have become possessed of be though recognize right to ask question mr jennings late aunt be very devoted to mr mallow anxious that marriage must take place gave photograph with inscription put in detective certainly rejoined flushing with inscription intended for alone be unwilling to part with photograph aunt begged so eagerly for must not refuse how did see in first instance brought to show after mr mallow gave to may ask where saw jennings looked at with marked significance saw in house of woman called maraquito how did get there ca tell do know woman even know name who be real name be senora gredos claim to be spanish jewess keep kind of gambling salon to be plain with miss saxon really did not see photograph in house girl called susan grant know late aunt parlor maid well photograph be in box found when servant insisted on box being searched confessed that have taken from last mistress who be senora gredos a gave to miss loach must be glad to know how came into possession of woman really ca tell no more than can say why susan took what be reason mr mallow be handsome man began jennings when stopped with gesture do mean to say will never believe be not going to say anything against mallow character foolish girl cherished foolish infatuation for mallow saw at senora gredos house ah said juliet turning pale remember now basil mentioned that cuthbert gambled did not say where mallow gambled little at maraquito a did brother only difference be that mallow must afford to lose brother must not be sure never heard name of maraquito quite sure said juliet meeting gaze so calmly that saw be speaking truth well understand how got photograph how did woman get never heard aunt mention a maraquito a senora gredos be aunt open with perfectly open have nothing in life to conceal be not so sure of murmured detective well can not say how maraquito became possessed of photograph juliet shrugged shoulder in case may dismiss matter said wiping dry lip ca see what photograph have to do with crime ca see one never know do accuse mr mallow supposing did know mr mallow be near place on night of murder about hour juliet leaned against wall turned away face be not true what must bring there have business connected with unfinished house at back owned by lord caranby suppose anyone saw how do know be here then asked juliet gray agitated confessed to that have be here can talk of later juliet interposed one moment cried do accuse a yet accuse one must get more fact together by way miss saxon will tell where be on night certainly replied in muffled voice at marlow theatre with brother basil quite so think play be to liking what do mean by well said jennings slowly watching changing color of face in house favor melodrama wonder went to see one at marlow theatre writer be friend of ours said juliet defiantly in case might have paid compliment of remaining till fall of curtain juliet trembled violently clung to wall go on said faintly have box a learned from business manager shortly after eight brother left theatre departed after nine went to see old friend in neighborhood stammered juliet ah be that neighborhood one by chance in hansom believe drove away in one can reach place from marlow theatre in quarter of hour did not come here then where did go decline to say where did brother go did not tell did manager inform of anything else merely told that brother left theatre a stated decline to reveal movement do said juliet clenching hand looking pale defiant private business can have nothing to do with a seek to connect with case be business to prove what say refuse to speak will brother refuse have better ask said miss saxon carelessly with effort to appear light hearted inquire into brother doings mr jennings yet heard about gambling see what have to do with matter in hand do accuse basil of having killed aunt accuse one a yet said jennings chagrined at reticence said that before did not speak with aunt on night said juliet positively certainly did not jennings changed tactic became apparently friendly well miss saxon wo bother more be sure have told know juliet winced have idea if weapon with crime be committed have be discovered be strange question for detective to ask very necessary one well know nothing about said in almost inaudible voice do know herne have met once twice here did like can hardly say did not take much notice of appeared to be agreeable be over dressed used perfume disliked have ever met anyone using such perfume before be strong heavy quite new scent to odor gave headache be mr herne great friend of aunt believe so came here with mr hale mr clancy to play hale said jennings forgot hale doe still retain business miss saxon have given over management of property to own lawyer mr hale be quite willing doe brother basil still make friend of mr hale know said juliet changing color again ask about basil doings said that before hark added anxious to put end to conversation mother be coming must like to see mr octagon said jennings will be here in few minute will tell juliet without look left room evidently glad to get away jennings frowned took out knife at looked know good deal about affair murmured who be shielding suspect brother otherwise must not have hidden knife wonder to whom belongs here be three notch cut in handle there be stain on blade blood suppose got further in soliloquy for mr octagon swept into room in most impressive manner be calm cool face wore smile a advanced to detective dear mr jennings said shaking warmly by hand be so glad to see though really ought to be angry seeing came to house so often never told what did might have welcomed have known said dryly be above such vulgar prejudice said mr octagon waving hand airily be sure profession be arduous one when juliet told that be looking into tragic death of poor sister be delighted so consoling to have to do with gentleman in unpleasant matter like why have come last question be put sharply mr octagon fastened big black eye on calm face of detective just to have look at house said readily for be certain juliet must not report conversation to mother mr octagon shrugged shoulder very nice little house though rather commonplace in decoration poor sister never did have much taste have discovered anything likely to lead to discovery of assassin be ashamed to say be quite in dark replied jennings suppose truth will ever be discovered woman appeared relieved tried to assume sad expression oh how very dreadful said will lie in untimely grave unavenged ala ala jennings be not mystified by tragic air be certain knew something feared lest must come to knowledge therefore resolved to startle by blunt question never knew be acquainted with maraquito mr octagon be not at taken aback know such creature a rule said calmly what make think do saw enter house one night last night said mr octagon coolly yes maraquito senora gredos call told have just gone saw in little room off salon where play went on detective be surprised by ready admission at once became suspicious must seem that mr octagon expecting such question be uncommonly ready to answer may ask why went to see woman demanded innocent woman must have resented question mr octagon ostentatiously seized opportunity to clear thereby increased jennings suspicion certainly said in open manner with rather theatrical air went to beg son life from fair siren what on earth do mean basil said mr octagon in deep rich voice be too fond of fair stranger spanish be not say be said cautious jennings mr octagon shot glance of suspicion at at once resumed engaging foolish boy love went on clasping hand becoming poetical heart be captured by starry eye must wed for loveliness ca have sort of thing added becoming prosaic so went told must denounce gambling salon to police if did not surrender son have done so be happy ah mr jennings have mother heart laid hand on own must know to what length will lead woman be glad son be safe said jennings with apparent cordiality though wondered how much of be true maraquito be not good wife for besides be cripple yes said mr octagon tragically be cripple something in tone of voice made jennings look up created new suspicion in heart however said more having learned a much a be possible from tricky woman must go now said have examined house mr octagon led way upstairs have clue none none wish must assist exclaimed indignantly sister be not friend will have nothing to do with matter good day mr octagon sailed away after ushering detective out of door jennings departed wondering at change of front a passed through gate fair stupid looking man entered nodded to jennings touching hat at same time strong perfume saluted detective nostril thomas barnes us hikui also murmured jennings walking away humph be member of gang chapter xv dangerous admission jennings have once witnessed drama by victorien sardou entitled in english version diplomacy therein woman be unmasked by mean of scent seemed to that perfume also played part in case why must clancy mr herne hale maraquito thomas use special odor wonder if meet in dark thought detective recognize other by scent seems very improbable yet ca see why use otherwise that woman must use perfume even same perfume be right enough love sort of thing why must men do so especially man in position of thomas will follow up clue if clue be conversation with juliet convinced jennings that knew of something connected with matter be determined to hold tongue fact that knife be in possession showed that be aware of fact likely to lead to detection of assassin might have found when came after death to rose cottage in case have nothing to conceal must have shown to police instead of hid in attic jennings congratulated on dexterity in securing piece of evidence there be doubt in mind that be very knife with miss loach have be stabbed by man thought jennings woman must have such weapon in possession if bought one to accomplish crime must purchase stiletto pistol must take considerable exercise of muscle to drive heavy knife home jennings considered that only person who must make juliet speak be cuthbert be true that already have declined to make confidant of now when there be chance of being arrested a jennings have hinted might be inclined to confess especially if be cuthbert be shielding detective fancied brother might be culprit on night of murder have left marlow theatre be near rexton juliet declined to say where went might be that have be on spot about time of commission of crime again unless miss loach have admitted assailant must have have latch key to let in from fact that poor woman have be found with card on lap in same position in susan have left jennings be inclined to think that assassin have struck blow at once then have left house at half hour how have entered there did not appear to be secret entrance one must enter by window by door either without latch key further jennings examined into matter more be puzzled never have undertaken so difficult case very difficulty made more resolute to unravel mystery for two three day went about asking for information concerning coining reading up detail in old newspaper about exploit of saul family also went occasionally to salon of senora gredos there constantly met hale clancy also basil came at time that young man now adopted somewhat insolent demeanor towards pair showed that be now out of clutch longer have cause to fear jennings felt sure that basil must explain much half determined to get warrant out for arrest in hope that fear might make confess unfortunately have not sufficient information to procure thing be obliged to content with keeping watch on young saxon man sent to spy reported nothing suspicious about basil doings in perplexity of mind jennings thought must see cuthbert relate what have discovered also hoped that mallow might interview juliet learn truth from inquiry at mallow room showed that have gone out of town for few day with uncle must not be back for two pending return jennings sorted evidence then be surprised to receive letter from mr herne stating that have returned to place at hampstead asking to call understand from mr clancy wrote mr herne that wish to see in connection with death of poor friend will be at home to morrow at four then followed signature jennings put away note with rather disappointed feeling if be right in suspecting mr herne certainly felt little fear else must have declined to see after supposition that two woman four men formed gang of coiner who worked in unfinished house might turn out to be wrong will see mr herne have long talk with said jennings to then will show knife to cuthbert mallow also may examine unfinished house if coiner have be there be there will soon find out mallow hunting for ghost probably made only cursory examination will take drudge to hampstead with drudge be detective who adored jennings thought very greatest man in england be usually employed in watching whom superior suspected jennings must always rely on order being honestly executed in instance drudge be to wait distance from house of mr herne until jennings came out again then on conversation have taken place must depend further order man be silent lean with pair of sad eye followed jennings like dog never spoke unless be required to answer question mr herne did not posse house of own struck detective a strange considering appeared to be wealthy woman always wore costly dress much jewellery yet be content with two room one to sit in other to sleep in certainly sitting room be jennings saw be well furnished apparently thoroughly appreciated luxury of life there be bow window commanded fine prospect of heath here mr herne be seated blind be half way down so that brilliant sunlight must not penetrate into somewhat dusky room when detective entered mr herne excused semi darkness eye be somewhat weak said motioning to seat however if wish for more light laid hand on blind cord not on account said jennings who did not wish to appear unduly suspicious be quite satisfied very well then replied mr herne resuming seat crossing delicate hand on lap can talk be at order be arrayed in blue silk dress of somewhat vivid hue softened with black lace have brooch of diamond at throat diamond necklace round bracelet set with same gem many costly ring such mass of jewelry looked rather out of place in daylight twilight of room made glitter pronounced jennings thought that mr herne must have jewish blood in vein seeing be so fond of gem certainly be very like maraquito even to having eyebrow almost meeting over thin high nose a be hair be gray skin lacked rich coloring of younger woman jennings rapidly took in resemblance commenced conversation more convinced than ever that there be bond of blood between mr herne senora gredos belief helped not little daresay mr clancy told why wished to see mr herne nodded in stately way yes wish to know if be in bedroom of friend on evening well be went in for few minute to take off cloak hat then went in again to resume did see anyone in room have there be anyone must certainly have seen person there be place where anyone must hide not even cupboard there be wardrobe for miss loach disliked cupboard a thought clothes did not get sufficiently aired in wardrobe of course anyone might have hid under bed did not look think added mr herne examining ring that anyone be about miss loach be always very suspicious searched house regularly did then anticipate anyone hiding burglar for instance yes think did nature be warped from certain event happened in early life suspected everyone be on bad term with anyone never quarrelled be quarrelsome person said lady smiling quarrelled with mr clancy who be rude man have made up since a have apologized be mr clancy who told of wish to see do want to ask anything else if mind on contrary be anxious to afford information in power nothing must give more satisfaction than to see murderer of dear friend brought to justice spoke with great feeling there be unmistakable ring of truth about speech jennings began to think must be wrong in suspecting to have anything to do with death same be on guard must not do to let mr herne clever a be pull wool over eye have idea who killed miss loach asked be quite well on evening did not anticipate death in way least of in violent form mr hale mr clancy must have be with till nearly midnight have not quarrelled with mr clancy a be mr hale escorted home about half past nine understand mr clancy left about ten when miss loach be not playing whist bridge never cared about having anyone in house be rather misanthrope did expect anyone evening at event said nothing about expecting anyone did expect nephew mr basil saxon said mr herne looking surprised not that be aware of did not mention name to be sure be on bad term have forbidden house think expected do know cause of quarrel have something to do with money believe miss loach helped mr saxon who be rather extravagant grew weary of demand refused to help further lost temper said thing forced to order out of house did utter threat miss loach never said that did mr jennings remarked old lady bending brow be possible suspect that young man suspect one at present be bound to make inquiry in direction of course if mr saxon be of passionate temper might wish to avenge for being house have temper said mr herne thoughtfully never saw exhibited though met once at miss loach said have lot of bad blood in may have be because hated sister isabella octagon did hate yes think have cause mr octagon behaved very badly in connection with romantic episode of past fancy know about said jennings quickly then added be fond of perfume what strange question laughed mr herne yes be do like scent be called hikui be given to by dear friend who received from japanese attache from friend relative mr herne frowned what do mean by jennings shrugged shoulder oh nothing

nothing else jennings hurried back to town same evening sent wire to cuthbert to address given by servant asking to come up to town next morning at eleven jennings presented found cuthbert waiting for

be war spear revolver sword see see here be empty space what be here by jove never noticed that before forget perhaps will supply gap said jennings held out knife do recognize certainly there be three notch in handle be knife did take off wall chapter xvi juliet story instead of answering jennings looked at mallow be merest chance glanced at wall saw that one of arm form that trophy be missing be also chance suggested blank space might be filled up with knife be sure be property mallow with puzzled expression took weapon in hand examined closely be mine admitted on butt of revolver will find carve notch also did so on bowie bought in new york when went on last big game shoot to rockies marked thing in way so that other fellow must not use by mistake brought back knife although be not pretty ornament fixed up on wall yonder used to cut up game if did not take off wall confess never missed until drew attention to fact that be missing where did get jennings scarcely knew what to say cuthbert talked of matter in so easy manner that be impossible to think have killed miss loach also be not sort of man to murder inoffensive old woman more especially a on face of have motive to commit so brutal act to jeopardize neck struck by friend silence mallow looked up suddenly whether read truth in jennings eye recollection of jennings profession brought crooked lane crime into mind be impossible to say suddenly grew pale dropped knife with look of abhorrence yes said jennings in reply to mute inquiry be knife be used to stab miss loach knife said mallow with gasp how dickens used stronger word did knife come to be used in way must like to explain said detective icily good heaven jennings think what be to think said jennings coldly swear never suspected mallow to own truth suspect now for own sake for own safety explain how knife came to be in miss loach house ca say cried cuthbert vehemently really ca swear never missed until drew attention to blank left in trophy of arm yonder flung into seat passed hand through hair with bewildered air surely jennings think guilty of killing that poor wretch jennings stretched out hand mallow grasped there be answer said detective of course suspect mere fact that own knife be yours show that be innocent fact that particular weapon be used reveals to strange behavior of miss saxon motive mean cuthbert jumped up what have juliet to do with asked went to see explained jennings rapidly be shown up to attic of rose cottage by mr pill miss saxon be standing on chair with hand on cornice managed to place hand in same place matter not how there found that knife cuthbert still bewildered took up formidable weapon how did become possessed of must ask why did not ask must have lied to for sake for sake do mean to say think be guilty yes do said jennings decisively be infernal lie believe juliet must think blackguard unless did not love doe love of course interposed jennings swiftly so much so that have concealed knife so a to a think save now can not see why asked to proceed further in case for own sake thought be shielding brother be belief guilty therefore will not marry think for one moment care about when woman love man will stick to through thick thin if be regular cain will marry bless whole sex be staunchest of friend when love mallow in way mr octagon have learned that have killed never did never did told everything what told may have be told to mr octagon with addition think guilty therefore have threatened to denounce unless juliet give up have done so therefore mr octagon hold bitter tongue reason for wishing to break off marriage discussed that before in first place be caranby nephew hate in second basil want fingering of six thousand year left by miss loach must marry miss saxon know well will look after interest therefore wish match to take place be not quite sure if be basil plan if know so much be quite certain that scheme be of mr octagon concoction now can see why miss saxon behaved so strangely have right to take up position cried cuthbert with fierce look must have be plain with have accused to face do think woman care to accuse man love besides mr octagon may have forced to keep silence so a to make matter more difficult for only way in can clear up matter be to see miss saxon insist on explanation if wo give think will time said jennings with grim smile by now must have discovered loss know well enough that knife be in possession already know threatened to arrest must never do must if meant clearing of character tell mallow be in danger there be conspiracy against using of knife to kill old woman prof to prepare ground for accusation someone stole must fight man enemy may bring about arrest in spite of can do mallow dropped into seat flushed angry have enemy muttered trying to collect wit yes have of worst kind two woman be against two woman mr octagon know hate a caranby nephew because want to handle money other maraquito gredos bosh love be sure have worried enough of course love said jennings satirically love so deeply that must see on scaffold rather than let marry miss saxon be why mr octagon went other night to see mr herne gave different version how do know mr octagon went to see maraquito uncle saw sit down mallow jennings gently pushed back astonished man into seat listen while tell have discovered lately mallow listened in silence saw very truly that maraquito must stick at nothing to gain end however made remark now went on jennings may be that maraquito hired someone to kill miss loach be trying to put blame on so that may entangle in net will be gallows marriage with of course must not kill woman aunt mr herne be out of house hour before blow be struck quite so rejoined jennings dryly may have come back again however main point be that maraquito in way be working with mr octagon on basis to prevent marriage in way have impressed miss saxon that be guilty have shown knife evidence retained in order to save at price of marriage might be so said mallow dazed with view of case certainly seem to be in hole if must see juliet mother prevents have plan to bring together be engaged to girl called miss garthorne be niece of old dancing master who taught maraquito le beau same well learn from peggy be miss garthorne name that be at school for few month with miss saxon peggy in spite of poverty have have good

cold blood jennings have own opinion about mr octagon a be proved by early history be capable of doing much when number one be in question basil be irresponsible hysterical fool in moment of rage might have said jennings breaking off train of thought ca see truth miss saxon know must ask be careful for life may depend upon bunkum said mallow roughly be not afraid then ought to be said jennings quickly be down at rose cottage on night knife be yours certainly have motive mr octagon maraquito will soon find one if fall in with wish however know what have to do jennings rose to take leave first slipping knife into pocket wait bit said cuthbert rising will do what say just drop line when meeting be to be want to tell at metropolitan hotel at brighton met with bank manager what of happens to be manager of bank where miss loach kept money where juliet keep now well said jennings becoming suddenly attentive did tell secret went on mallow got talking of basil manager hinted that basil have have lucky escape from what ca say manager french name be refused to speak more openly of course must if miss loach have not died basil must have got into trouble did put matter exactly in word gathered a much humph said jennings eye on carpet supply motive for basil killing old woman nonsense basil must not kill anything be coward when rat be in corner fight said detective significantly basil may have be between devil represented by miss loach deep sea may call hale may have said mallow nothing will ever persuade that basil be guilty jennings looked doubtful have own opinion a to young saxon capability for crime however whole case be so perplexing that fear to name particular person said taking hat now will see miss garthorne get to write to miss saxon apparently there be difficulty about for in three day wrote to mallow telling to come to pimlico on friday at four o'clock juliet be surprised when received invitation from old schoolfellow of whom have lost sight for year however owing to trouble felt need of sympathetic soul in whom must safely confide knowing peggy be one of rare friend who must keep own counsel juliet readily agreed to pay visit arrived at academy shortly before three o'clock two girl have long talk of old day also juliet told of difficulty not to peggy know how thing will turn out said miss saxon disconsolately everything seems to be wrong will continue to be wrong unless act wisely said peggy in what way must act stick to mr mallow love love see why must surrender life happiness for sake of family of course have not told peggy looked at inquiringly juliet shuddered dare not tell said faintly have to think of other people think of mr mallow first be thinking of then be on account keep silence juliet nodded must

inveigled by treacherous peggy on other hand thing be becoming so serious that knew must have to speak out sooner later especially a cuthbert be in danger of arrest even if confessed must save must only make matter worse thought juliet descending stair will thank day for holding tongue will go so arranged meantime peggy have informed waiting mallow of juliet strange behavior determined to make speak anxious to arrive at understanding cuthbert waited at foot of stair juliet coming down ran straight into arm turned white gasped retreating be here after did not hear miss garthorne tell so asked cuthbert peggy be behaving very wickedly be who be behaving badly said mallow bluntly know much about case be keeping in dark be for own good murmured juliet must allow to be best judge of come in here cuthbert drew towards open door of dancing room tell what know how affect room be large bare empty at one end there be kind of dais on be placed few chair young man walked up to turned to beckon juliet for whom placed chair still lingered at door seemed disposed to fly juliet if go now be over said determinedly cuthbert how can because mean what say thing ca go on like think of brother of mother never give thought to juliet came up room hurriedly be thinking of time cuthbert said angrily keep silence for good in what way murder began then voice died away know know that miss loach be murdered who did know oh juliet dropped into chair be innocent surely never thought guilty think be yet be going to accuse of having be on spot juliet must restrain no longer saw burst out be there also chapter xvii juliet story continued cuthbert be so surprised by admission astonishment held silent for moment never expected to hear that juliet have be on spot seeing went on quickly now can understand why held tongue be at rose cottage on night have enemy who know be there have be threatened must insist on engagement being fulfilled that will be arrested therefore kept away held tongue if have told long ago how must cried vehemently must come say to believe be murderer did believe that juliet asked in grieved tone yes faltered cuthbert know how love must not bring to think be guilty yet proof be so strong be at rose cottage at quarter to eleven be there at quarter past ten tell saw at quarter to eleven be getting over wall into park then there be knife knife how did know be mine by notch told always cut three notch on handle of weapon possessed one day when mother came to afternoon tea at place showed of weapon knife amongst one knife be much like must not have noticed for notch for fact that saw on night hid knife mr jennings found said mallow quite so told did when left attic contrived to then closing of door be trick said juliet in agitated tone might have guessed that took knife have threatened to arrest so miss garthorne say say rightly replied mallow thinking best to make use of knew so a to force to speak freely of course if can explain explain cried wildly sinking into chair what can explain that saw climbing that wall running away apparently from scene of crime found knife by body what cuthbert started up looked at saw body yes be in house in room found aunt dead in chair with card on lap exactly a parlor maid saw near on floor be knife there be blood on blade picked up saw handle be notched in three place then then suspected not till saw outside cuthbert took turn up down dais much perplexed juliet said swear to never killed woman juliet flew to folded in arm knew knew said in spite of letter what letter accusing threatening to tell police about if did not break engagement who wrote ca say save that must have be enemy naturally replied mallow cynically friend doe not write in way have letter with no be at home never thought of bringing will show to soon wish now have spoken before wish to heaven have thought best to be silent said juliet trying to argue feared lest if spoke to enemy whosoever be might carry out threat in letter be letter written by man woman ca say woman write in so masculine way nowadays might be why be at cottage be not went to explore unfinished house on behalf of lord caranby be ghost hunting do remember how asked next day why wore overcoat explained that have cold yes said got from sitting in hot room got from hunting round unfinished house at rexton did not think necessary to explain further juliet put hand to head oh how suffered on day said be watching for afternoon when came thought might voluntarily explain why be at rexton on previous night did not believed silence to be guilty one then when letter arrived when did arrive week after crime be committed well said cuthbert rather pained can hardly blame if loved do love said with passionate cry have not proved love by bearing a thought burden must do more must woman who love a do accuse man love of horrible crime strove to shield from enemy thought be shielding basil jennings thought so also juliet drew back looking paler than ever what do know of very little said cuthbert quickly be at rose cottage on night in question no be not there did not see yet be at marlow theatre with yes left theatre before did sit down juliet tell exactly how came to be at rose cottage on night why went miss saxon seated told knew be way said with more calmness than have hitherto shown basil went to see new melodrama written by mr arkwright what man mr octagon wish to marry yes have written play to make money mother be angry a thought thing be not worthy of sent box refused to go so basil went play be so dull that basil left early saying must come back for do know where went no did not say well play became worse instead of better be weary to death so thought a theatre be near rexton must go see aunt selina then hoped to return to box meet basil be told play being long one must not be over till midnight left theatre at quarter past ten took fifteen minute to drive to cottage then entered quietly to give aunt surprise ah be opening door thomas heard yes at past ten have latch key aunt selina loved very much wanted to come see whenever must so must come go at pleasure without troubling servant gave latch key happened to have in pocket really wished to see about quarrel have with basil what be quarrel about juliet deliberated before replying be small thing said at length aunt selina be fond of basil often gave money mr octagon doe allow basil much mother have enough to do to make end meet basil be fear extravagant know gamble though never told where went to maraquito said cuthbert have met there know said juliet in rather reproachful tone wish must not gamble cuthbert have given up now only played for excitement since engagement have hardly touched card will not play for money again visit to maraquito now be purely in interest of case doe know anything about asked juliet astonished yes replied mallow wondering if girl knew that mr octagon have paid visit to senora gredos mr herne who be aunt friend be aunt of senora gredos never knew that about quarrel basil spent more money than must afford poor boy young scamp murmured cuthbert blame mean well expostulated juliet well aunt gave lot of money always wanted more then refused about week before aunt selina died basil wanted money declined have word ordered out of house be to try make up between called on night be sure basil did not go also think so said juliet doubtfully be on bad term with aunt selina knew must not be welcomed besides have not latch key well cuthbert reached rose cottage at half past ten let in went downstairs quietly found aunt selina seated in chair near fire with card on lap a though have be playing 'patience ' saw that be dead why did not give alarm juliet hesitated thought best not to said faintly seemed to mallow that be keeping something back however be very frank a be so thought best not to say anything well saw be dead yes have be stabbed to heart there be knife on floor picked up saw be yours then thought that have killed thank juliet protested really did not believe that at time must not think why must kill aunt selina be bewildered at time then here juliet turned away head fancied someone else might have killed who ask have ground on to accuse anyone let tell can then may think be impossible cuthbert ask more question mallow thought demeanor strangely suspicious wondered if be shielding mother mr octagon who hated selina loach might have struck blow there be absolutely proof of mallow decided to ask nothing a juliet requested tell what will dear said so long a believe guilty really picked up knife left room after ten minute stole up stair shut door so quietly that one heard see first time did not trouble to do when found that aunt be dead be afraid lest servant must come find there fancied a have knife in hand have entered by mean of latch key might be suspected besides must have be difficult to account for unexpected presence in house at hour quite comprehend said mallow grimly ca all keep head in difficult situation well came out into garden heard policeman coming down lane knew must not escape unobserved way then if took path to station fancied might see in moonlight ran across garden by wall got over fence amongst corn where lay concealed then saw coming round corner climbed wall went into park after waited till after eleven when policeman entered house summoned by servant then ran round field sheltered from observation by corn a know be then high got out at further side walked to keighley next place to rexton took cab home went straight to bed did not see basil till next morning told have come home later did not say where have be did ask be sure unless watch be wrong that climbed wall at quarter past ten insisted mallow might have climbed again at quarter to eleven climbed only once way did come along path from station then walked beside fence on corn side jumping over climbed wall certainly did that murmured mallow remembering what have told jennings did see face knew by height by light overcoat wore that long sporting overcoat be down to heel oh cuthbert what be matter might well ask question for mallow have started turned pale nothing nothing said irritably certainly did wear such overcoat be with caranby before went to rexton knowing room must be heated like furnace took precaution against cold juliet doubted a knew mallow did not coddle in way however have seen overcoat too often to mistake to whom belonged moreover cuthbert did not deny that have jumped wall in way explained well now know what will do asked really ca say said mallow who be trying to conceal agitation ca think who took knife out of room be in trophy of arm on wall never noticed that be missing till jennings drew attention to loss certainly miss loach be killed with knife be positive of said juliet there be blood on handle understand why kept silence yes there be really need will call see mother insist on giving consent to marriage have reason to refuse do know why object simply say doe not wish to marry did not tell what have told did not what be use be because of discovery of knife seeing receiving that letter refused to marry so fell in with mother plan juliet be not engaged to arkwright be engaged to only mean only pretended must not marry mother thought be obeying be really shielding on account of letter give letter love will show to jennings said miss saxon shrinking back get to drop case why asked cuthbert dryly must understand request when thought guilty now that know be innocent jennings be aware be at rose cottage on night surely there be bar to proceeding with case wish faltered juliet cuthbert looked at steadily turned away with sigh be keeping something from said from retorted why did start when spoke of overcoat juliet own cuthbert took hand earnestly there be circumstance in case be very strange innocent person may be sacrificed be best for to have nothing more to do with matter miss loach be dead who killed will never be known let marry dear heart leave case alone be quite willing mother will persuade to consent hope so fear hate because be lord caranby nephew hinted a much know reason do said mallow calmly think may be able to persuade to see reason will meddle more with case what about mr jennings will tell have told what have told then will point out futility of looking for needle in haystack may be inclined to let case drop ought to be weary of by time juliet looked wistfully at ca be plain with one said mallow shaking head have suspicion mine let refrain from talking about matter miss saxon drew breath of relief think be best said expression be reflected in eye of lover when will come see mother next week if objection be question of money can hand over whole of income have inherited aunt selina six thousand year why because have enough money for when caranby dy will be almost millionaire like having money reason have none can tell besides if can buy mr octagon consent with even six thousand year mind said juliet now that know be really innocent take shame to myself for having doubted be willing to marry even though mother withholds consent darling cuthbert folded girl in arm kissed now know that truly love indeed never doubted doubted said juliet tearfully must never have suspected even though evidence be so strong lost head for moment said lover let talk more about matter will pacify jennings get to drop case then will marry take tour round world so a to forget unpleasant matter yes be best said juliet two walked towards door must have

caranby do suspect house be set on fire of course do even though weather be hot think can be case of spontaneous combustion probably tramp said jennings decisively be strange must come to with news one of men have lately be here tell that man be arrested near rexton last night for passing false money have on bottle of petroleum rag ah said caranby quite serene so think there can be doubt about lord man set fire to house people carry bottle of petroleum about for nothing why must set fire deliberately to house at instance of saul family lord caranby sat bolt upright what do mean humph be rather long story man who be caught used particular kind of scent called hikui maraquito us also aunt mr herne mr herne be not maraquito aunt told that be tell that emilia who be dead be only aunt maraquito ever have why doe mr herne say be what be trying to find out said that did not know whole history of saul family know quite enough said caranby gloomily member be abominably wicked maraquito father died after be discharged from jail for coining mother also well lord man who apparently fired house be trying to pas false coin us same scent a maraquito doe leaving mysterious mr herne out of question well what do deduce from believe that there be gang of coiner in existence of man clancy hale maraquito mr herne be member use scent hikui probably be sign amongst in what way be utilized can not say unless meet one in dark recognize confrere by scent see might be so why must man burn house jennings shrugged shoulder can hardly say think coiner used house a factory since be burnt down seems impossible man may have fired out of revenge on account of row with gang else said caranby deliberately knowing that be going to search house perhaps be fired to destroy trace of factory do connect with selina death do believe that learned of existence of factory that threatened to denounce clancy hale mr herne then to silence be stabbed three mention be out of house before death know gave evidence freely enough at inquest have not yet fitted piece of puzzle into one be certain lot be connected from use of perfume also a man who have be caught be passing false money a maraquito probably mr herne be surviving member of saul family who practised coining must not be surprised to find that theory be correct how must anyone know intended to go over house asked in maraquito salon clancy hale be about humph said jennings see various part of puzzle be fitting together excellently probably one of two overheard probably that hale look sly creature capable of much wonder if be related to saul family have same nose same eyebrow meeting over nose said jennings mr herne have similar mark be sure be relative of maraquito if be aunt give leave to call fool said caranby rising know that emilia told have sister what will do next jennings will see man who fired house try to get at truth then be having mr herne watched maraquito ca move from couch so there be danger of escaping now that coining factory be destroyed will find difficult to bring home crime to anyone wish cuthbert must come do expect yes listen lord caranby jennings related episode of knife how have brought mallow juliet together seems to went on detective that cuthbert learned something from miss saxon doe not wish to tell something to do with mr octagon why with demanded jennings suddenly oh because think isabella capable of much be fatal woman what do mean by phrase isabella exercised bad influence on life for must have married selina must not have fallen in with emilia saul must have be happy probably selina must not have met with tragic death do think sister have anything to do with ca say know be that whomsoever isabella came into contact with have trouble do well to call fatal woman humph said jennings must rather call maraquito fatal woman a believe brought about death in way for double purpose of silencing miss loach regarding factory of coin of stopping marriage of rival with cuthbert curiously enough cuthbert be shown into room at moment so interested have caranby jennings be in conversation that have not heard bell mallow looked in good health face wore worried expression without preamble after greeting uncle walked up to friend jennings said calmly have seen juliet agrees with that case must not be gone on with ah doe on what ground because have consented to marry intends at request to make over miss loach money to mother have have quite enough dabbling in crime be sick of think be very wise said caranby unexpectedly let case be mr jennings what did miss saxon tell asked detective irrelevantly mallow sat down in calm voice detailed that have learned from juliet so see throw light on subject have mallow mentioned time at juliet asserted saw climb over wall new light must certainly have be thrown purposely omitted simply said that juliet have seen told be there jennings added quite so said detective certainly nothing new have come out well then leave case alone fear will have to now that rexton house have be burnt down jennings related in turn what have taken place cuthbert listened moodily see said everything be against only wanted mystery cleared up so that juliet might marry now that wish to do so without searching further be not going to do anything else said jennings sadly nothing be to be learned case will remain mystery to end of time caranby rose took cuthbert arm young men be faint hearted said with shrug if want opinion mr octagon killed sister fatal woman tell both fatal woman clever one said jennings gloomily have baffled chapter xix susan discovery although jennings appeared to acquiesce in mallow suggestion that case must be abandoned have not slightest intention of leaving matter alone professional pride be irritated by difficulty swore that must in way learn truth moreover matter did not only deal with death of miss loach with discovery of coining gang from various obvious fact connected with crooked lane crime jennings made sure that gang be in existence that factory have be in unfinished house now that house be burnt down must seem that coiner have lost city of refuge must probably give up nefarious trade a gang judging from number of false coin circulated during past five year have be in existence for long time be probable that member have made sufficient money to retire from so dangerous business wonder if house be set on fire by arrested man out of revenge thought jennings a dressed to go out whether gang finding thing be growing dangerous since death of miss loach ordered to destroy factory can hardly think that a to preserve secret miss loach be assassinated be not likely that after paying so terrible price such destruction must be agreed upon certainly factory may be removed to place humph wonder if can trace best thing for to do will be to go to rexton look at ruin so to rexton detective went found large crowd round wall of park have be broken down in several place so a to admit fire engine jennings found policeman on duty who have be one of first to see fire who have indeed summoned brigade on telling name position man be willing to state knew be on duty about eight o'clock said officially there be high wind blowing night be fine dry while walking down crooked lane intending to take path to station saw light behind wall of park then tongue of flame shot up did need much cleverness to see that old house be on fire almost before must collect wit sir place be in blaze see dry weather heat high wind made everything blaze finely signalled for brigade came up a soon a possible a there be gate in wall have to break down to get engine in there be large crowd by time have help needed by time whole house be flaming like bonfire when got wall down most part of house be gone fire have caught surrounding shrub so must do be to halt on edge of mass squirt water in hope of putting out flame lord bless said officer with good humored contempt might a well have tried with child squirt a see sir everything be gone within wall leastways that big oak near wall be a man said house tree shrub even grass have be swept away by fierce flame within wall have secluded place from world be blackened space covered with debris where house have stood be mound of twisted iron girder charred beam broken slate everywhere wind be lifting fine gray ash scattering abroad a though in sorrow for destruction of previous night jennings took in at glance policeman be on guard at various gap in wall a one be allowed to enter detective by virtue of office walked across bare expanse with inspector trod under foot black ash there be nothing to be gained however by inspection must be seen be destroyed park mound where house have be what of cellar asked jennings well said inspector twining genially suppose there be cellar there be nothing in house be shut up for year by queer nobleman by lord caranby replied detective know suppose cellar be under heap must get lord caranby to allow to clear away expect will be done whether lord caranby came down told one of men that intended to throw down wall let place a building site so when building begin heap will soon be cleared away cellar laid bare there be nothing there said inspector again be not so sure of what do mean nothing have idea answered detective who did not wish to tell man how now began to fancy that factory for safety have be placed in cellar by way did man who be arrested give name no refuse to answer question be a know mr jennings arrested for trying to pas bad shilling there be doubt fired place bottle of petroleum have in possession be empty yes heard that where be now inspector named place near rexton where man have be incarcerated pending being brought before magistrate be going way said inspector if like to come will come said jennings intended to see man there have be lot of talk about false coin being passed lately mr twining nodded began to tell of various case have taken place in district two took train to place where police station to inspector belonged be situated be now after twelve o'clock jennings thought must have luncheon before going to station unexpectedly constable seeing inspector came hurriedly towards saluting a spoke please sir be wanted at station said message be sent to rexton have just come from rexton what be that man who be arrested for coining sir what about asked inspector while jennings listened with ear be far from expecting to hear reply be dead sir said policeman dead what do mean be well enough morning well sir be dead now poisoned poisoned echoed jennings thought have here be undesirable witness got out of way then followed in wake of inspector who on hearing news hurriedly walked towards police station here found that news be true constable left in charge of office be greatly agitated a seemed have be lax in doing duty made faithful report be way sir said trying to speak calmly boy of fifteen very poorly dressed in rag almost came cry asking for prisoner said prisoner be father how did know that when prisoner gave name be arrested only last night boy billy tyke name be so suppose father be called tyke also say father went out last night be always drunkard left boy to starve boy followed later knowing must be on burst went to public house where man be arrested for passing bad shilling there be told that father be in jail came here to ask to let see must have refused have detained boy well be moved by little chap tear said constable abashed so let go into cell be with asked inspector sharply sir left alone for few minute a boy be so sad cut up thought there must be harm in doing well sir boy came out again in ten minute still cry said must get lawyer to defend father did not believe father have passed money then went away later about hour later went into cell found man lying groaning with empty bottle of whisky beside doctor came said thought man have be poisoned man groaned said young shaver have done for then became unconscious died jennings listened to statement calmly saw again hand of coiner person who controlled member evidently thought that man must blab accordingly took precautionary measure to silence without doubt man have be poisoned boy have be sent to do be boy like asked billy tyke sir said constable replying on nod from chief to whom looked for instruction thin boy fair with red rim round eye look starved sir have scarred mouth a though have be cut on upper lip with knife jennings started suppressed emotion under keen eye of observant twining have idea that knew who boy be a yet must not be sure will cut along to public house where man be arrested said jennings suppose will hold inquest certainly seeing man have be poisoned then inspector proceeded to rebuke constable who have performed duty so ill threatened with dismissal jennings left in midst of trouble after getting inspector to promise that must report result of inquest at public house be white horse keighley adjoining suburb jennings learned that man who called rather who be called by presumed son tyke be not habitue of place therefore boy must not have known that supposed father be there apparently information have reached lad whereby be able to trace tyke to prison have carried to there bottle of poisoned whisky jennings returned to town quite satisfied that have clue to existence of coiner also determined to satisfy on point concerning maraquito about have long be in doubt for next few day jennings did nothing kept away from mallow a did not wish that young man to know that be still going on with case sometimes went to maraquito place learned incidentally that a there be chance of being cured be about to give up gambling salon jennings quite expected information assured hale who gave to that be best thing maraquito must do sooner later police will pounce down on place said a be detective wonder have stopped before said hale with unpleasant smile have reason said jennings calmly besides maraquito have conducted place quite respectably suppose added idly will go abroad also what do mean by demanded hale in silky tone mr herne have gone to continent said jennings quietly if senora gredos give up very dangerous business may go also a will be deprived of two of friend mr hale doubtless will go also might one never know replied hale coolly by way asked jennings looking round be admitted by parlor maid evening where be gibber believe senora gredos have dismissed for dishonesty ah really replied detective who have own opinion so seems senora gredos be getting rid of household already hale winced under eye of jennings turned away with shrug be apparently glad to get away jennings looked after with smile will catch whole gang murmured took departure having learned what wished to know to wit that gibber have disappeared without doubt be boy who poisoned tyke said jennings a walked home with cigar for company believe maraquito be head of gang fatal woman caranby talk about heard that tyke have be arrested sent boy to poison lest must blab wonder if be by direction that house be fired well will wait a yet can not get warrant having nothing theory to go on net be being spread unless maraquito friend clear out with mr herne will be caught when be in jail there may be chance of learning who murdered that unfortunate woman in rose cottage later on jennings received report of inquest appeared also that evening in newspaper seemed that tyke have be poisoned with arsenic administered in whisky bottle from appearance be hard drinker doubtless boy have difficulty in inducing to drink tyke have drank freely indeed doctor said have taken enough to kill three men therefore have died almost immediately boy left before have time to speak inspector who wrote to jennings stated that constable who have admitted boy have be dismissed force boy must not be traced must be surprised if have taken refuge in cellar of house said jennings be if factory be there must see caranby get permission to remove rubbish only when have searched foundation of house will suspicion be set at rest unexpected aid came to help in quarter a caranby sent note stating that rubbish debris of fire must be removed next week inviting jennings to be present caranby added that mallow have resumed visit to shrine of mus mr octagon still continued hostile basil however be more friendly daresay commented jennings on reading last sentence have own axe to grind over money be about time that detective received visit from susan grant looked a neat timid a usual appeared at room one morning with request for interview said must help mr mallow if must said when seated oh have anything likely to help not exactly said susan found old paper of father quite understand said detective who did not see what girl father have to do in matter well be way sir father be poisoned five year ago who poisoned that never knew explained susan father name be maxwell when mother married mr grant made take name be supposed that father committed suicide mother felt disgrace dreadful be why married changed name believe father when on point of making rich must swallow so much arsenic a did what be arsenic said jennings recalling death of tyke yes sir be way father be working at rexton at rexton said jennings impatiently yes yes go on at house near railway station can point out mother having seen when went to inquire inquire about what about father secret job have one used to go to for three hour day by agreement with foreman father be very clever must do sort of thing mother never knew what job be father said must make rich yes go on jennings looked at nursing chin other day came across paper said susan taking roll out of pocket proved to be plan of father secret job might have knocked down with feather mr jennings when saw on plan name of rose cottage detective jumped up greatly excited rose cottage cried holding out hand plan plan brought a know miss saxon who now have rose cottage be engaged to mr mallow have got over nonsense yet said jennings who be looking eagerly at plan yes have replied miss grant confidentially be engaged to rising young baker who be just foreman just now hope to save start shop still promised to help mr mallow thought must like to see plan see sir have to do with rose cottage yes do see almost shouted jennings will bag whole lot what be talking about sir ah forgot know said detective subsiding will tell later have made discovery susan plan show secret entrance into rose cottage know doe sir thought miss saxon must like to see know what miss loach wanted with secret entrance though fancy do said jennings rolling up plan father be very clever man susan too clever for people made secret entrance when new wing of cottage be built five year ago who employed gave arsenic by way of reward tyke died of arsenic also so be carrying on same game oh dear oh dear wept susan not hearing latter part of sentence so father be poisoned after who did sir ca tell said jennings becoming cautious have better say nothing about susan till give leave have done mr mallow great service plan may lead to discovery of murderer then miss saxon will marry mr mallow yes will be sorry mr jennings be quite satisfied with baker then tell what susan lord caranby have offered reward for detection of murderer if plan lead to detection will receive sufficient sum to set up in business chapter xx basil while jennings be thus working at case hoping to bring to successful issue cuthbert be resting in happy belief that further step be being taken detective have appeared so despondent when mallow called with caranby that former thought with show of reason that meant what said have known that jennings be still active must have be much disturbed agreeably to cuthbert suggestion juliet have offered money of miss loach to mother mr octagon refused to be bribed a put into consenting to match in presence of mallow expressed greatest detestation for for uncle told juliet must never acknowledge a daughter if married young man poor girl be thus between two fire that of love for cuthbert that of mother hearty hatred for earl nephew under circumstance cuthbert thought best to remain away from shrine of mus for time until mr octagon must be brought to see reason be so obstinate woman that be doubtful if must ever behave in agreeable manner cuthbert returned to room in rather low state of mind knew that juliet happened must remain true to have quite hoped to bribe mr octagon into consenting by mean of inherited money now thing seemed more hopeless than ever juliet although not very fond of mother be devoted daughter from sense of duty must be difficult to bring to consent to match against elder woman so obstinately set face certainly juliet have said must marry with without mother consent now that consent be withheld with violent word seemed inclined to wait however if did not marry mallow knew well that must marry one else least of objectionable arkwright cuthbert derived degree of comfort from small fact wondered if there be chance of forcing mr octagon into giving consent after surveying situation must see opportunity after dinner night cuthbert be thinking of going to see uncle who still stopped at avon hotel when hale be announced mallow be surprised lawyer be not friend of have liking for company however felt certain curiosity a to reason of unexpected visit welcomed man with civility did not ask to have coffee though be on table cuthbert held to tradition of east regarding bread salt wished to leave free to deal with hale a enemy must occasion arise a might hale be far too intimate with maraquito to please young man maraquito attention be far too pressing to make cuthbert feel comfortable in presence well mr hale said mallow coldly why have come lawyer who be in evening suit dressed with taste care took seat although not invited to do so looked cold calm there be excited gleam in large eye showed that calmness masked emotion cause of cuthbert must not fathom have come to see about young saxon said really answered mallow coolly although surprised what can have to say to about be friend pardon can hardly call so be acquaintance only be engaged to sister persisted hale mallow threw away cigarette be lighting jumped up see reason why miss saxon name must be mentioned mr hale mr mallow do then object to mentioning state business go mr hale have acquaintance with ca state business unless mention miss saxon name then will please to take off said mallow hale smiled coldly though evidently annoyed think be to interest to hear said deliberately to interest of lady whom hope to call wife doe business concern miss saxon indirectly doe rather have to do with brother mallow frowned conversation be taking turn of did not approve however knew well dangerous ground upon stood with regard to case thought best to hear what unexpected visitor have to say state business said curtly very good replied hale nursing silk hat on knee see offer coffee cigarette be not friend sir let remind that thrust uninvited on to do service said hale quickly think therefore deserve better reception will please come to point said mallow coldly whatever service may be be quite sure be two for if one for be not man to go out of way mr hale to help anyone hale nodded smiled grimly be quite right now then mr mallow do know that basil saxon be to have inherited money of late client miss loach never knew that understood that miss loach always intended to leave money to miss saxon hale shook well oiled head on contrary mr saxon be favorite in spite of wild way liked however be also fond of miss saxon may thank miss loach mr mallow for having be mean of forwarding engagement what do mean by asked cuthbert angrily mr octagon went on lawyer deliberately must never have consented to miss saxon becoming engaged to have not miss loach insisted that must agree seeing that mr octagon hated sister be not likely to be influenced by see how can be perhaps not nevertheless such be case saw how when miss loach died mr octagon seized first opportunity to place obstacle in way of marriage believe did that on maraquito account mr hale know perfectly well that mr octagon called on maraquito quite so to ask not to let basil saxon play beyond mean certainly maraquito having strange fancy for agreed on condition that mr octagon refuse to let miss saxon marry in case mr octagon hate uncle too much to allow daughter to become wife will never get mr octagon consent unless help echoed mallow astonished annoyed what possible influence can have with mr octagon have certainly seen at house scarcely think know well enough oh yes do hale rose in earnestness see here sir love maraquito wish to marry can so far a be concerned so say said hale bitterly can not be ignorant that maraquito love see what have to do with conversation replied mallow growing red restless have everything to do with matter want to marry maraquito a be rich deeply in love with must have become wife long ago that crossed path lord know why must love commonplace man like doe be that rather personal said mallow dryly beg pardon what wish to say be if marry miss saxon place beyond maraquito reach will be able to induce to marry interest be bound up together now to do must have mr consent can get in what way love basil son more than doe went on hale paying attention to remark to save must do much to save from what basil continued lawyer still not noticing interruption be young fool thought sure of miss loach money be until week before died then came to rose cottage insulted have heard that ordered out of house did miss loach be bitter acrid old woman when fit took however basil insulted so grossly that made new will left money to miss saxon now happens that basil to supply with fund when aunt refused to aid extravagance further forged name to bill what be matter nothing said mallow who have started from chair only intelligence be sufficiently unpleasant can understand sneered lawyer since wish to marry sister want forger for brother in law who doe said cuthbert not telling that be thinking of basil in connection with still darker crime go on mr hale bill fell into hand when miss saxon got money transferred business to own lawyer have to give bill up ah said mallow meaningly see now hold have over basil yes be hold did not want to give up bill have be met a miss loach be dead there be difficulty in proving signature to be forgery therefore gave bill to miss saxon knew of brother guilt see see murmured cuthbert wondering if have be shielding basil a well a poor girl be brave girl said hale in voice of reluctant admiration met fought for brother gave way a did not wish to make trouble why doe matter however see how thing stand basil be forger if mother knew that be in danger of being arrested must consent to marriage then might marry maraquito have come here to tell if miss saxon have bill there be difficulty of proving signature owing to miss loach death see ah not in case basil saxon forged name also hold forged check met said nothing about basil thinking because sister held bill that be out of power be most insolent said nothing of check thought never detected more fool must have fine opinion of business capacity however a check be only for fifty pound probably thought that must escape notice well see how can force mr octagon hand what do say put hand to head quite bewildered by information must give time to think said if consent marry miss saxon ask reward for service want be to get out of way a regard will give forged check on day wed miss saxon can see added hale rising that be somewhat upset with news wonder never thought basil be such scoundrel thought fool never knave dear sir be thoroughly bad man said hale cynically though daresay other people be just a bad however will give week to think over matter good night good night said mallow touching bell without meeting gaze of hale will think over what have said will find to advantage to do so replied hale went out of room at heel of servant mallow remained where be in deep thought be terrible to think that brother of juliet must be such scamp forger perhaps something else here indeed be motive for miss loach to meet with death at nephew hand probably on night in question threatened to let law take course then basil at point of meditation ring came at door in few moment cuthbert step knew rose with agitated air basil entered room young man be carefully dressed a usual in rather affected way face be pale seemed uneasy see have have visit from hale said trying to appear at ease how do know asked mallow abruptly declining to see proffered hand saw hale enter cab a came up stair said basil drawing back even have not seen must know that have be telling lot of lie because refuse to shake hand be lie ah then have be talking be enemy come here to do harm said basil eye flashing came here a friend replied mallow abruptly hale wish to marry sister offer to hand over to certain check if marry know what be talking about cried basil petulantly threw into chair very pale think know very well why have come here basil looked sullen want to marry juliet also came to say that thought must get mother to take money to withdraw opposition so that may have fingering of money oh suppose will give said basil airily began to roll cigarette with deft finger mallow be enraged at coolness basil be scoundrel be indeed nice word to use to future relative how do know will ever be relative suppose refuse hale demand let proceed on check basil cigarette dropped of hand know what check mean declared with alarm there be bill must help myself aunt gave lot of money repaid by forging name also forged hale name ah know what mean now be only for fifty pound have be for fifty penny crime be same said mallow vehemently why did not let help offered to preferred to commit crime fuss to make muttered youth discontentedly bill be in possession of juliet step can be taken on if mother accepts six thousand year will buy check back from hale be scoundrel will do anything for money then can marry juliet can go abroad for few year on income of three thousand mother will allow that coolness of speech almost took mallow breath away man did not seem to be at affected by crime so long a be not found out appeared to think nothing about matter know will marry juliet proceeded basil love too well to give up be true enough said cuthbert who having already spared too long now determined to punish may love so well that may not wish to buy what do mean by buying demanded basil sulkily what say be only to save be to marry juliet marriage must be one of love doe love see added basil complainingly why must jump on chap for wishing for happiness own safety oh bill be destroyed juliet put into fire hale will sell check at own price price be that be to marry juliet so that can marry maraquito suppose know that love hale be crazy about be very hard on whined egotistical youth for want to marry only mother put spoke in wheel dare offer to maraquito bad a be knowing what be cried mallow fairly disgusted oh forgery what of be nothing basil snapped finger maraquito wo mind suppose will have to give up on account of infernal check small one a be too wish have made one hundred fifty must have done so in face of callous behavior be sheer wrongdoing to spare man allude to forgery though be bad enough said cuthbert glancing round to see that door be closed to murder of aunt killed basil leaped from chair with great indignation did not how dare accuse panted because have proof proof basil dropped back a though have be shot yes learned from man that took bowie knife used to hang on wall yonder saw take thought have received permission went to marlow theatre with sister left in box went out after eight o'clock went to rexton to rose cottage after clancy left house aunt admitted killed swear did not said basil perfectly white trembling did liar juliet followed to cottage juliet did not know have gone ah see be there yes said went in order to try make up between aunt believe now went to see if be committing crime be not aware how much juliet know of wickedness basil know only about forgery be not at cottage mallow made weary gesture why do tell falsehood said with scorn juliet entered cottage by mean of latch key found miss loach dead knife on floor dropped there came out saw man of height be of appearance be not unlike at distance climbing wall into park have on alight overcoat overcoat juliet thought be man did not say moment mentioned coat knew be borrowed coat from returned other day now then stop stop cried basil rising with pale lip shaking hand admit went to rexton on night swear be innocent pah cried mallow thinking be lie weak one too basil seized by arm mallow swear by hold most sacred that did not kill aunt selina own took knife wished to frighten into giving money left theatre in order to go to rexton thought might be spotted if came by lane climbed wall of park on other side after nine time after nine be crossing when man chased know who be must not see in bush night be rather dark at moment though clear later dropped knife fell out of pocket scrambled over wall bolted then how did juliet see shortly before eleven came back for knife thought might be traced to that might get into trouble really did said basil seeing mallow make gesture of dissent came back by railway path along by corn where juliet must have be know climbed wall crossed park must not find knife where thought have dropped near house then climbed opposite wall got away home next day heard of death went down to look for knife again never thought have be killed with knife a weapon be found juliet said nothing to about matter because thought knife be mine a be be man who climbed wall be on spot remember telling that when met in street be afraid see now why asked if have be in park at night thought might have spotted when be there about twenty minute past ten well then be there at ten few minute later got away from man who chased time before came be a say at quarter to eleven when came back by time suppose have gone went over opposite wall a did said cuthbert must have run other very close expect be in different part of park said basil swear that be telling truth said nothing about a be afraid of being arrested if like will tell that detective jennings what told will help advice to be to hold tongue keep silent if be traced stammered basil will say nothing said mallow jennings have dropped case will get check from hale must go abroad believe be innocent oh thank thank be scoundrel for when get sent abroad marry sister will have anything to do with if come back to england look out chapter xxi experiment next day cuthbert received letter from jennings intimated that maraquito wished to see that evening if will call at nine o'clock wrote detective will be alone police have decided to close gambling house be making preparation to leave england understand have something to tell in connection with death of miss loach be a well must hear confession on part may save lot of trouble in future mallow hesitated to obey summons thought be strange that maraquito must get detective to write to a knew mistrusted man apart from have wish to see senora gredos again thing be now smooth between juliet comparatively so must not do to rouse girl jealousy maraquito be dangerous woman if paid solitary visit might fall into snare be quite capable of laying such be infatuation that knew must stop at nothing to gain end on other hand maraquito to appearance knew of something in connection with case behooved to learn if wished for peace in future so far a mallow knew matter be at end believed that jennings have shelved affair that further inquiry must be made belief calmed anxiety a greatly desired to save basil saxon from arrest certainly young scamp protested innocence told plausible tale be such liar mallow must not be satisfied might be innocent a said yet fact of visit to cottage possession of knife of overcoat wore when seen by juliet hinted at guilt also forged bill check might implicate in matter did jennings learn of thing must certainly arrest saxon on suspicion for juliet sake cuthbert did not wish thing to happen struck mallow that hale might have confided in maraquito with whom be in love being unscrupulous must probably use information might threaten to denounce basil to subsequent disgrace of juliet if cuthbert refused to marry taking thing into consideration mallow decided that must be best to pay visit learn what maraquito have to say be wild blustering evening rainy damp when mallow stepped out of door shivered a keen wind whistled down street few people be abroad a preferred very sensibly comfort of fireside to windy gleaming thoroughfare wishing visit to be a secret a possible mallow walked to soho turned into golden square shortly before appointed hour did not expect pleasant interview a maraquito be uncivilized sort of woman with little control over very violent emotion altogether anticipated disagreeable quarter of hour be admitted smilingly by woman noticed with surprise gibber page be not at accustomed post put down to fact that there be gambling on particular evening window of great salon be dark senora gredos received in small apartment used a sitting room couch be drawn up close to fire appeared to be in better health than usual standing at door mallow thought made pretty picture have on white wrapper trimmed with gold lace a usual wore profusion of jewelry across lower part of couch be flung gorgeous purple coverlet of eastern manufacture what with brilliant color glitter of precious stone looked remarkably eastern mallow noticed particularly how jewish be in appearance wondered how must have be so blind a not to have remarked before room looked cheerful warm be welcome after chilly dreary street mallow having taken off overcoat in hall came forward bowed somewhat formally maraquito be not to be put off with so frigid greeting holding out hand shook warmly pointed to chair near couch be now few minute after nine how good of to come see said in deep rich voice evening be so dull be not having play evening maraquito shrugged fine shoulder unfurled quite unnecessary fan to keep up fiction of being spanish lady always carried idiot told police what be going on received notice to close police knew long ago not officially police can be silent when suit always kept thing very quiet here ca understand why objection must be made suspect that man jennings told thought liked oh fancied be friend of yours so made best of to tell truth mr mallow always mistrusted be much too fond of asking question for taste then mr hale told that man be detective so understood unwarrantable curiosity will have nothing to do with in future in case said mallow anxious to arrive at truth wonder employ to write letter for woman raised on one rounded elbow looked surprised at speech really think be so foolish said dryly why do say that mallow looked puzzled jennings wrote letter asking to come here evening at nine said wished to see be eye flashed always wish to see said sinking voice to tender tone be much obliged that mr jennings note must have brought here gave authority to write have seen jennings lately asked cuthbert more more

of last half hour to have vitriol thrown be bad enough when act lead to two death for maraquito be already dead seemed probable that lord caranby must follow be enough to shake nerve of strongest mallow took juliet down placed in cab then promised to see same evening to tell of lord caranby progress when cab drove away went again upstairs a went must not help shuddering at thought of danger from juliet have escaped remembered how maraquito have threatened to spoil beauty of girl never thought must have held to devilish purpose moreover must not understand how maraquito in disguise came

medical attendant knowing constitution resisting power will be able to speak more assuredly how did happen cuthbert for obvious reason explained a little a must old woman came to see uncle threw vitriol at miss saxon young lady who be with intercepted stuff fell into fire what demon hope will be caught be dead cuthbert related accident in street doctor have strong nerve shuddered when heard dreadful story nemesis have be le leaden footed than usual in due time dr yeo who usually attended caranby made appearance stated that patient must not live many hour be always weak said yeo of late weakness increased two severe shock have sustained must almost kill stronger man let alone old man of so delicate organization will die hope not said cuthbert impulsively physician looked at benignly differ from declared death will come a happy release to lord caranby for year have be suffering from incurable complaint gave great pain that have so much courage must have killed never complained brave man like never doe complain besides took great care of when came back to london be fairly well think must have done something rash to bring on recurrence of illness within few day of arrival grew sick again in way over exerted think ever did said mallow doubtfully be certain of within week of arrival here have relapse taxed with going out too much with over exertion declined to answer will become conscious again think so in few hour can not be sure however need not be alarmed mr mallow affair be right in view of illness advised to make will said that have done so that everything be in apple pie order be not that doctor wish to ask question will remain here till end replied yeo significantly will not take place for few hour so far a can see wish to go out for hour can with safety certainly lord caranby will live for time yet mallow nodded left bedroom while yeo returned to bed upon lay unconscious form of old man cuthbert took walk to end of street where wreckage of motor car have now be removed asked policeman what have become of victim be informed that chauffeur in dying condition have be removed to charing cross hospital that body of old woman so constable spoke have be taken to police station near at hand be quite dead very much smashed up be man report mallow thanked with crown having learned whereabouts of police station went there introduced to inspector a nephew

of miserable woman in strange mask of age went to see lord caranby in disguise said inspector can see face be made up doe lordship know who be yes mr jennings detective know also perhaps do mr mallow cuthbert nodded be what gambling house coiner have be looking for same jennings can tell more about matter than can will get mr jennings to come here a soon a be on foot will be to morrow most probably why did maraquito throw vitriol at lord caranby jennings can tell said mallow suppressing fact that vitriol have be meant for juliet perhaps have something to do with raid made on unfinished house know belonged to uncle bless so did expect enraged by factory being discovered maraquito wished to revenge on uncle may have thought that gave information to jennings about place might have thought so said mallow be returning to avon hotel if want to see can send for there jennings know everything what about lordship will die said cuthbert abruptly departed leaving inspector full of regret maraquito have not lived to figure in police court looked at matter purely from professional standpoint must have liked sensation affair must have caused when mallow came back to hotel found that uncle have recovered consciousness be asking for yeo must not allow patient to talk much so cuthbert sat by bedside holding hand of dying man caranby have be badly burnt about temple sight of one eye be completely gone occasionally yeo gave reviving cordial made feel better towards evening caranby expressed wish to talk doctor must have prevented dying man disregarded order must talk whispered faintly cuthbert get sheet of paper have made will said yeo rebukingly be not will be confession cuthbert will write out will witness signature along with yeo confession murmured cuthbert going out of room to get pen ink paper what about soon knew for when be established by side of bed with writing material on small table caranby laughed to quietly do know what be about to say gasped if be nothing important have better not exhaust be most important a will hear know who murdered supposed miss loach cuthbert nearly dropped pen who be asked expecting to hear name of mr octagon did said caranby quietly that be impossible unfortunately be true be accident though yeo give more drink must tell everything yeo be quite calm have known caranby for many year be not at disposed to shrink from because confessed to having committed murder knew that earl be kind hearted man have be shamefully treated by three woman in fact be secretly glad to hear that emilia saul have met death at hand of man have injured kept sentiment to after giving patient strong tonic to revive energy sat by bedside with finger on pulse of dying man caranby rallied considerably when began recital spoke in stronger tone cuthbert dipped pen in ink did not dare even to think be wondering how death of emilia have come about also how uncle have gone to unfinished house on same night a have done remembering how basil stated have be chased by someone unknown cuthbert began to fancy saw light however at moment caranby began to speak a moment be precious men forbore to interrupt unless desirous to have clearer understanding on certain point when came back to england said caranby never thought that emilia be alive owing to clever way in substitution be effected by isabella always thought selina lived at rose cottage several time tried to see hoping must marry always refused be puzzled at time now know reason never thought of looking at unfinished house be piece of sentimental folly shutting up afterwards a time slipped by never troubled about looking into matter a cuthbert will tell yeo laziness be vice with go on with story save strength said yeo softly yes caranby heaved sigh have much left well cuthbert told about ghost supposed to be haunting house asked to go down see came here one night left at eight o'clock to go down to rexton never expected to follow why did not come with because be keeping something back from on previous day received letter there be name to writing be disguised advised to see selina loach said must be surprised when spoke to because then must recognize woman believed to be dead exactly said caranby faintly at time knew nothing be much puzzled with letter on night intended to tell did not then thought must go down to rose cottage prove truth of letter went almost immediately after cuthbert what in state of health yes be stronger then have be le strong since murmured yeo understand now why refused to tell how have over exerted have secret to keep said caranby coldly more drink please then when felt better continued yes be wonderfully well strong on night climbed wall impossible said mallow ca believe that nevertheless be truth expect excitement made unnaturally strong suffered greatly when be over be wreck said physician bluntly when what be over asked mallow anxiously event of night to be coming took time to get to rexton long time to walk to unfinished house did not go down crooked lane round by wall did come by railway station path did not took wide detour arrived at unfinished house on side opposite to where rose cottage stood ah murmured young man wonder missed thought be calling on miss loach intended to first thought must assure about ghost certainly have set to perform task a be on spot determined to see for climbed wall not without difficulty found in park about what time be after ten ca say how long really can not be precise a to time wandered aimlessly about park threading way amongst tree shrub undergrowth be astonished to find path struck that someone used park believe miss loach did be emilia said cuthbert jennings learned that in way always be on watch for anyone coming into park learning secret of factory did not know at time said caranby voice growing weaker well walked about sometimes be moonlight at other time moon must be obscured by cloud struggled to get near house succeeded then saw man standing in shadow at once went up to fled who be can tell said mallow quietly young saxon then why did fly be there with very good purpose conscience smote miserable creature said cuthbert go on will wait said caranby vehemently if stop now will never know truth want anyone else to be accused of crime know maraquito hinted that isabella octagon be guilty be not want even isabella to suffer though have be fatal woman to wrecked life happiness voice be growing so weak that yeo gave more cordial after pause caranby resumed with last effort very swiftly a though thought strength must fail before reached end of dismal story followed man though did not know who be wondered why must be trespassing fled rapidly soon lost when moonlight be bright saw that have dropped knife from pocket in stooping to pick up lost sight of man basil crossed park ran away came back for knife afterwards explained mallow juliet saw have on coat wonder did think basil be a juliet did be not acquainted with clothes said caranby dryly a have be absent from england for so long wonder saxon did not find knife picked up be bowie belonging to basil have stolen did know that well went again towards wall surrounding park thought might meet wonder did be about at time park be so thickly filled with tree shrub that missed one suppose interrupt be going write quickly cuthbert then with gasp caranby resumed halted to get breath near large oak fire spared rustling woman came out of shadow of tree wondered who be where have come from moon then came out brightly recognized face with sensation almost of terror be emilia how did recognize after year by jewish look especially by eyebrow moreover revealed to when dying what happened asked yeo sharply be standing with knife in hand emilia seeing be intruder came swiftly towards have revolver in hand did not fire cried out something rushed at in doing came straight against knife be holding instinctively in attitude of defence with point outward rushed at to bear down by weight force of charge next moment dropped to ground dying be not dead then not for moment knelt beside whispered 'emilia opened eye smiled then replied 'emilia yes died did not know what to do then struck that might be arrested for crime though really be crime have not rushed at have not be holding knife must not have met with death wonder did not fire seeing have pistol perhaps recognized said yeo glancing at cuthbert who be writing rapidly have done so must never have attempted to hurt thought be spy searching for factory without giving time to think dashed forward believing must give way fly be over in second made up mind to go at once did not even wait to pick up knife climbed wall came home here what happened then know can tell said mallow maraquito hale came to look for miss loach took body into villa sitting room placed knife at foot card in lap thinking must be thought have be stabbed in room sign sign said caranby unexpectedly mallow hastily brought

with into sitting room what will do with asked doctor indicating envelope with nod will place in hand of lawyer to be put with family paper replied cuthbert be sure agree with yeo that be unnecessary to make content public uncle be dead even be still alive must advise to say nothing replied yeo grimly woman deserved fate even though be accident destroyed caranby life must have married selina loach have be happy man for there think wrong be isabella octagon who be to blame have indeed be fatal woman to poor uncle for must not have be prevented from marrying selina thus have fallen into toil of emilia emilia must not have murdered selina result must not have come out after year in death of uncle at hand of bathsheba saul who be maraquito know whole story do think there be need to repeat sordid tragedy will put paper away say nothing about to anyone save to jennings detective said yeo surprised startled do think be wise may make matter public wo have traced coiner to lair be enough glory for when know truth will stop searching further into case if hold tongue may go on make awkward discovery yes see be best must tell miss saxon will never know let think maraquito killed emilia only jennings will know truth can depend upon silence said yeo shaking cuthbert by hand well what will do now with permission will ask to stop here arrange about necessary matter in connection with laying out of body wish to interview mr octagon evening to morrow will see about caranby remains being taken down to family seat in essex there will be inquest first mind maraquito be dead nothing

caranby with grim smile intend to settle mr octagon once for surely intend to tell of murder certainly not must make matter public at once knowledge of real name of emilia hushing up of murder of

o'clock be informed by butler that miss saxon be in bed with headache that mr octagon have given order mr mallow be not to be admitted basil be out mr octagon likewise cuthbert listened quietly then

evidence to force into decent behavior did not intend to leave room till have mr octagon free consent to marriage promise that must go abroad for indefinite period with hopeful son basil in way cuthbert hoped to get rid of undesirable relative to start married life in peace nothing le than exile will settle matter muttered mr octagon in gorgeous tea gown swept into room with frown on strongly marked face looked rather like maraquito apparently be in bad temper mallow must see that be surprised when entered a thinking lord caranby be incapacitated by accident described by juliet did not know how came to call at so late hour moreover lord caranby have never visited before however apparently be bent on receiving in tragic manner swept forward with mien of siddons when came into room caught sight of cuthbert face in blaze of lamp stopped short how said in deepest tone then became prosaic very angry what be meaning of mr mallow hoped to see uncle know did be dead mr octagon caught at chair to stop from falling wiped away tear dead muttered dropped on to sofa died two hour ago be now lord caranby wo grace position said mr octagon viciously then face became gloomy dead walter mallow ah loved so have strange way of showing then said cuthbert calmly also took seat mr octagon immediately rose forbid to sit down in house lord caranby be stranger oh be mr octagon came here to arrange matter what matter asked disdainfully apparently certain have nothing against matter connected with marriage with juliet miss saxon if please will never marry oh yes will what be objection to marriage refuse to tell said mr octagon violently then somewhat inconsistently went on if must know hated uncle said loved just now so did cried woman spreading out arm loved intensely must have placed hair of head under foot be never worthy of loved selina poor weak silly fool stopped that marriage ended triumphantly a will stop yours think will stop mine replied cuthbert tranquilly be not to be coerced mr octagon seek to coerce retorted daughter will obey will refuse hand care if be fifty time lord caranby juliet must not marry if have money in world hated walter mallow uncle treated shamefully swore never must child of mine be connected with selina wished forced to agree while be alive be dead lord caranby be dead can hing defy defy may a well conduct interview reasonably will not let remain here longer go pointed to door with dramatic gesture cuthbert took up hat will go if insist said moving towards door will return with policeman mr octagon gave gasp went gray what do mean know well what mean be to go have nothing against said violently stop if will tell reason of speech think understand what mean perfectly well said mallow again returning to seat know that sister died year ago mr octagon gasped that emilia feigned to be selina loach perhaps mr octagon will remember how sister died did touch gasped mr octagon trembling emilia saul did condoned crime deny everything go get policeman if like cuthbert walked to door there turned statement of emilia will make pleasant reading in court said mr octagon bounded after pulled back by coat tail into centre of room then locked door sat down wo be disturbed said wiping face upon perspiration stood what do know everything even to letter wrote to uncle stating must see pretended selina loach be chance shot on mallow part told for saw face change in fact mr octagon be only woman who must have sent letter did not attempt to deny sent that letter a be weary of woman tyranny thought must get into trouble must have got into trouble also suppose have lived have told story of selina death must have put rope round own neck said mr octagon in hollow tone theatrical air gone be fool to wait so long for twenty year woman have held under thumb be emilia that made consent to engagement to juliet otherwise added malevolently must have died rather than have consented oh shook hand in air how hate uncle whole of mallow woman scorned see said cuthbert rather cruelly well must be aware that know everything know who killed emilia maraquito said be shrieked mr octagon how dare that be dead a juliet told must have up for libel maraquito killed woman be sure of that coining factory did know of existence did snapped mr octagon knew nothing of emilia criminal doings let bear name of sister why asked mallow quickly not knowing what maraquito have said to caranby know replied mr octagon sullenly emilia be in trouble with law brother mother be afterwards arrested for coining might have be arrested also that agreed to hold tongue emilia pushed selina off plank then turned accused a be known be on bad term with selina might have be accused of crime emilia must have sworn rope round neck emilia made help to change dress said that a face of dead be disfigured be rather like selina certainly be must arrange did not know how intended to blind father father died unexpectedly have not done so deception must not have be kept up a be went to inquest emilia a selina pretended to be ill saw after have strange doctor then went abroad came back to shut up in rose cottage tried to marry caranby emilia stopped that why did because loved caranby in tiger way be why insisted must marry juliet always threatened to tell have killed selina though be innocent if be why need have be afraid circumstance be too strong for said mr octagon wiping dry lip glaring like demon have to give in have known of factory must have spoken out a be wrote to caranby when in fit of rage afterwards be afraid of what have done a thought emilia must tell certainly must have done so have not died so opportunely do mean to say that killed tell maraquito did so what make think that asked mallow
