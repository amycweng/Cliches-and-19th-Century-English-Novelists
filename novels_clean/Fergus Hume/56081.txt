be one of oldest friend how strange said brenda wonderingly have exactly same idea be why went to manor last night when got there told lady jenny have gone to rectory did see said harold grimly waited till nine a have turned up then went back to inn there later on heard of murder went to look at body although have quarrelled felt sorry for poor devil when heard of violent death poor mr malet sighed brenda wonder who killed why well ca say why dear have idea who be that shot who who man mistook for father brenda turned pale remembering father agitation impossible why do think so examined body first before others came up found right hand be clenched by light of lantern opened be grasping scrap of crape scrap of crape what have brenda voice died in throat remember description that old man wore crape scarf chapter v van zwieten show teeth unexpected piece of evidence caused brenda little uneasiness reflected that man with crape scarf have so closely resembled father a to be mistaken for then remembered how father have refused to give information concerning double of there be also fact of avowed hatred of malet do what must must not rid herself of idea through third person so like father be in way connected with murder little a loved thought of shocked terrified told harold what have passed between in study unbosomed herself of suspicion to in reply asked few straightforward question did father refuse to speak of man brenda absolutely sent out of room be uneasy more than uneasy said girl with emphasis be terrified there be great mystery in harold in way father be connected with man for know may be relative be very ignorant of family history h be have seen father morning no did not come to breakfast did not go to study knowing that dislike to be disturbed well must go to study now said harold rising for be sure that man with crape scarf killed malet father may be able to throw light on subject harold think father who can tell brenda must face fact see in

informed very curtly that have gone up to london for day must return that same evening harold looked grave brenda be perplexed be so unexpected mr scarse seemed to be doing must to heap suspicion on own head doe usually go off in sudden fashion asked captain burton yes sometimes tell sometimes leaf note after harold may be altogether mistaken perhaps father know nothing at about hope so brenda from what say certainly know man be strange there must be such striking resemblance between scrap of crape might easily have be torn off scarf in struggle there be struggle said brenda eagerly saw mr malet for one moment when lightning flashed next heard cry be followed at once by shot there be time for struggle heard cry first then shot yes shot must have killed poor man at once did not cry again harold reflected saw dr lincoln morning at manor said slowly deduces from blackened skin singed hair that shot must have be fired at close quarter now if murderer saw malet by lightning flash be close at hand doubt sprang forward clutched poor devil arm while placed muzzle of weapon at temple in case malet must utter cry next moment drop dead in agony might have gripped at crape scarf have torn off piece found clenched in hand be purely hypothetical said brenda fighting against doubt know be seems to only way to account for hearing cry first for piece of crape being in hand of corpse depend upon brenda father can throw light on subject well a be gone to town there be nothing for to wait till come back meanwhile wo say anything about piece of crape to one be going to do now asked a moved toward study door return to inn must like to know if one else saw stranger if mistook a did for father harold harold do be careful implored brenda may be misjudging altogether dear beg of get into trouble on contrary dear object be to get out of trouble if succeed in arriving at explanation of queer confusion of identity police may take up then must be dangerous good bye dear will be back shortly brenda waved hand a left returned to study be filled with ominous foreboding trembled at thought of possible complicity on part of father pronounced hatred of malet agitation at mention of stranger odd idea of crape scarf worn by supposed criminal morsel of in dead man hand thing collectively formed mystery brenda must not fathom looked again at note intimated that father have gone to town from straggling scratching character of handwriting gathered that must have be greatly agitated when wrote afterward went to kitchen skillfully questioned mr daw tilda about master departure declared that have said nothing to about seemed likely then that have made up mind on sudden impulse gone off in hurry brenda wondered vainly what must mean then rebuked severely for suspicion after father must doubt be able to give good reason for hurried departure when returned surrounding circumstance strange a be might prove to be be natural obvious in light of what must have to say dawn have brought wisdom to mr daw housemaid too for longer spoke of giving notice be chattering like parrot about murder many exaggerated wholly imaginary detail of have be supplied by butcher baker milkman brenda learned that a yet one be definitely suspected of crime that villager be hopelessly bewildered at committal about stranger word be said somewhat relieved in mind brenda gave order for day returned to study sat down before fire be lighted a usual in spite of summer warmth gave up to thought of harold be pleasant enough occasionally there must come recollection of van zwieten calm insistence that must be wife then shuddered for man fascinated a serpent fascinates bird there be moment when came upon that might get way in spite of repulsion idly looking into fire noticed fine white ash under grate disposed in regular line at first took heed of presently became aware that be coal dbris eye travelled along line until found unburnt piece of material remainder of be ash growing pale bent down picked up tiny piece of crape undoubtedly be crape there be enough saved from burning to swear by brenda turned faint from long narrow outline of white ash from scrap of material held in hand be certain that father have flung crape scarf under grate have set fire to guessed that scarf be one worn by stranger scarf from morsel in harold possession have be torn

into room through french window looked unusually well pleased with smiled blandly when saw in fact detected exulting expression in blue eye vaguely terrified with instinct to conceal discovery of burnt scarf thrust scrap into pocket turned to welcome van zwieten with smile looked at fire at action seemed to connect two said nothing doubt thought have be about to burn something that have interrupted aha miss scarse said politely have be walking in orchard to have look at spot where murdered that man brenda be annoyed at satire rather foolishly showed annoyance must make allowance for

unhappy lived at poplar under name on small income must allow for year saw very little of robert then took into head to pose a prophet of evil predicting woe to england assumed that snuff colored coat wore crape scarf a symbol of mourning be frequently in trouble with police several time helped out of scrape why shut up again ah friend how must take poor fellow from dying wife year be bedridden dying slowly must not part latterly used to come now again to see at chippingholt usually at night in ordinary dress on one occasion arrived in daytime met lady jenny knew by sight told truth about wife husband be year ago lady jenny be furious believe quarrelled with husband after that be never same to one loved once after must have hated robert be foolish to have told must do good well what then went away for month saw nothing of next heard be when brenda told harold burton have met man like with crape scarf round neck from description recognized robert knew that mind must be more than ever unhinged for to have come down in what called prophetic robe knew must not come to see till dusk waited anxiously did not appear so went out to look for struck that might be lurking round manor gate to see gilbert malet perhaps to do injury searched for long time be caught in storm then found robert in orchard led home told news what be news wife be dead have come to tell malet chapter xiii end of story wife be dead repeated van zwieten without showing much sympathy came down to tell no came to tell malet kill scarse shook head be telling truth said if robert be guilty must admit poor fellow be crazy a know at worst can only be put away in asylum again be not afraid for fear public scandal might shake position force to resign seat robert did not kill man met told truth about what hour be that shortly after nine o'clock met robert wandering in orchard at quarter past took home with malet according to doctor evidence be shot about half past nine at time robert be conversing with in study met malet insisted van zwieten rather disappointed at statement have reason to believe be true yes met malet told that victim be dead malet grossly insulted robert there be quarrel unable to restrain anger robert threw on malet being old man feeble be easily overpowered thrown to ground robert told believe be truth because found crape scarf be torn doubt in struggle malet left lying on wet grass went off must have be shot almost immediately afterward by whom asked van zwieten keenly ah be question have suspicion may be wrong when brenda came home with news of murder guessed that victim be malet servant came to study door found locked robert be with then have locked door because did not want to be seen thought be be talking to said be when afterward came in by front door knew of course have lied brenda asked about still declared that have be with that have gone out of study window to front door told also be man seen by harold burton why did do ca guess to save robert have grievance against malet have be struggling with there be chance that might be accused of murder there be only evidence to prove alibi a be brother dreaded lest word must be insufficient while servant be with brenda in kitchen went back to study put coat of own on robert gave soft hat to pull down over eye then gave money told to catch ten thirty train from chippingholt to langton junction did said van zwieten be watching business through study window followed robert wondering who be watched go off by train then came home to house be admitted a know why did not speak to be not proper moment to

anxious to trap cried mr scarse angrily well know truth now can hing burned crape scarf told brenda be man harold have seen if choose to make scandal will tell story exactly a have told to prove robert innocence at worst can only be put under restraint again wish to make scandal said dutchman mildly more especially seeing that daughter be to be wife can rely on silence if only on account be glad have heard story now want to know who killed malet that ca say said mr scarse gloomily suspect wife lady jenny why robert have note written to saying wife be dead brought with sent up to by boy same evening of course boy thought that robert be see cried van zwieten with shout robert wanted to stir up lady jenny into killing husband be not so crazy to thinking see how intelligence of wife death must achieve added shaking head gravely lady jenny knew about matter have harmed husband there be reason why must do on particular night be what puzzle replied mr scarse lady jenny be out on night did not go to rectory to see captain burton a have intended for gave very unsatisfactory reason that be caught in storm be not probable that met husband killed must not carry revolver if have already met quarrelled about dead woman then be possible might in jealous rage have made attack upon husband with anything to hand revolver must argue deliberation there be nothing sufficiently strong in note brother have prepared for to urge to deliberate murder burton found piece of crape in dead man hand argued scarse lady jenny be wearing crape for father there might have be struggle piece might have come off in hand nonsense scarse lady do sort of thing besides brother wore crape too be more likely that be torn from scarf malet might have kept in hand without being conscious of probably when went to death then think lady jenny be innocent look like van zwieten said with queer smile will let know opinion later on rose to go will keep secret entreated scarse following visitor to door assuredly can make use of thought to find brother guilty seems be not mystery deepens lady jenny true lady jenny well will see with enigmatic speech dutchman withdrew mr scarse went back to chair until midnight sat looking drearily into fire be sufficiently thoughtful to send letter to brenda telling of safety in spite of trafalgar square mob for next few day went about like man in dream although knew very well that van zwieten must hold tongue for have nothing to gain by wagging blamed for having be coerced into confession to dutchman be almost stranger have be drawn to man because be going out to transvaal a official mr scarse have always sympathized with little state in struggle for independence dutchman have drawn so pathetic picture of struggle have spoken so feelingly of boer a patriarchal people who desired only to be left tending flock herd that english politician be touched have sworn to do in power to defend simple people have become extremely friendly with van zwieten in proof of friendship have asked down to chippingholt there dutchman by spying questioning have learned so much of family secret a to have become master a such have forced into confession mr scarse felt if scandal be to be avoided that be at man mercy of course brenda must be price of silence formerly scarse have be willing enough that daughter must marry van zwieten must be noble work for to aid to build up new state in south africa now saw that dutchman be by mean unselfish philanthropist have supposed to be be tricky shifty be iron hand in velvet glove if became brenda husband be by mean improbable that must ill treat did not seem right to force into marriage when loved man after be daughter only daughter scarse paternal instinct awoke even thus late in day to prompt to protect cherish if felt for poor robert woe surely must feel for trouble of brenda musing thus occurred to that might frustrate probable scheme of van zwieten by telling whole truth to brenda then let marry harold defy man at event determined that brenda must be introduced to family skeleton accordingly one afternoon drove to kensington mr st leger be out so be colonel found daughter alone when entered for world like old grey wolf for trouble have aged brenda came forward with look of astonishment in eye usually father be not so attentive a to pay visit must not conjecture meaning of tender expression on face a matter of fact mr scarse be realizing for first time that tall beautiful girl be daughter must not divine welcome to be a usual quite cold how be father said kissing in conventional way be glad to see expected harold be quite astonished when came in disappointed too suppose said scarse in low voice something in tone struck sensitive ear a unusual be glad to see repeated know father there be never much love lost between ah brenda fear that too much love have be lost wish to speak openly seriously to brenda looked at piteously know how to begin be not well

be man men be always susceptible be sure have have enough experience of sighed lady jenny trouble have arisen out of horrid van zwieten being in love with brenda be not much comforted by view of situation hoped rather to move mr kruger by appeal to religious conviction though be of stern cast of old testament however be in very hopeful frame of mind that went on board liner cabled to wilfred at spearman camp telling that be coming out in hope of making thing a safe a possible for husband cabled also to van zwieten surely when received that must hing at event until have seen come to term with what term must be must not guess imagined must include suggestion that must obtain divorce from harold be a well knew quite a obstinate a respected president with none of morality religion in fact brenda be going to pretoria without sort of definite idea save one somehow other must save husband from man be sole object achieve must by hook by crook have confidence in own capacity to outwit dutchman wily a be day of calm peace on board boat afforded ample time for conjecture reflection have grown now to hate man with hatred must only be appeased by destruction made quick run to island sea air did world of good there be many passenger on board to one of did in way confide sad at heart kept very much to herself read indulged in own thought father be socially speaking anything popular among fellow passenger air little england opinion must with result that majority of passenger having relative at front gave wide berth made not single convert whom tried to argue round to own way of thinking be glad enough when got off at kaiser fritz came up to time brenda soon found on way south did not much fancy foreign boat officer crew passenger being pro boer to man be polite enough to english lady took trouble to disguise real opinion captain expressed surprise that must be going to delagoa bay seemed inclined to suspect political significance in doing so though be difficult to see what ground must have have for such absurd idea mr burton did not enlighten left matter to father mr scarse intimated that daughter be going to pretoria to nurse wounded husband explanation seemed to appeal to sentimental german after that be increasingly polite to preferred own cabin father be more companionable even found scant pleasure in outspoken opinion on subject of england inevitable downfall a put even with little england proclivity felt patriotism awake in most alarming manner at way foreigner jeered scoffed smarting under insult developed quite jingo feeling much to daughter amusement ended by withdrawing a much a possible from society of on board father daughter be good deal together looked forward eagerly to end of disagreeable voyage one night when be south of line be on deck together heaven be bright with star great grey circle of sea lay round like trackless desert most of on board be down below two have deck to brenda be disinclined for conversation mind be a usual full of thought of husband only feeling seemed cognizant of be one of joy in thought day be bringing nearer to mr scarse broke silence brenda said did lady jenny say anything about murder very little said that van zwieten have accused her of crime that be innocent of course told that have never dreamed of such thing never must have credited for one moment h be at one time thought that might be guilty said know now be wrong that piece of crape certainly be suspicious poor scarse told that in struggle with malet scarf have be torn never noticed when burned suppose that malet kept in hand without being aware of very likely at event be sure lady jenny be innocent a innocent a uncle be happy hope in asylum yes poor fellow be a happy a can be anywhere have comfort kind treatment fear will not live long van zwieten gave fright by threatening to denounce for murder unless told sad story of did tell not be foolish enough to relate rest of to van zwieten have alternative at time be quite capable of making scandal brenda who did kill malet day thing seems to become more obscure well father ca help thinking be van zwieten lady jenny think so too say so revolver be harold harold left be left case of two revolver behind be in library in mr malet library on night van zwieten came to see took one of with at least be what lady jenny think brenda that sound improbable why must kill malet hardly knew child indeed be wrong there father said knew only too well listen related story widow have told concerning husband treachery toward own country mr scarse be deeply indignant indulged in language unusually strong for little englander though be misguided on many point though might be be honest honorable man must not understand how man in mr malet position must have so deliberately played part of traitor when be in possession of fact quite agreed with brenda van zwieten be culprit then will bring to book said angrily will force to confess will do good father truth can not come to light without story of mr malet treachery being known lady jenny be more than anxious to avoid that van zwieten must be left to punishment of own conscience think will trouble much mr scarse said grimly how have be deceived in man be sure when tell kruger true character will have nothing to do with brenda did not contradict statement although felt pretty certain that foxy old president be very little better how father must reconcile opinion held that kruger be honest harmless old man with fact that have forced terrible war upon england be more than must understand wondered if when father got to pretoria discovery of true aim of transvaal government must be at modified of have doubt be most obstinate of men angel from heaven must not have altered opinion once have be formed knowing never argued with be absolutely futile only caused trouble at cape vessel stopped for time brenda did not go ashore felt too sad heavy at heart to take interest in sight of new scene new people sat on

while to be acting rle of juda toward land have borne thing be almost beyond soldier comprehension 'd have shot with own hand cried striding to fro low blackguard most honest action van zwieten ever did in life be to kill wretch talk so loud harold said wife must keep to ourselves for lady jenny sake yes be right brenda will make quite sure of silence of van zwieten by shooting at sight be certain to come across when do will finish not because murdered malet because tempted to be traitor when at last indignation have cooled down somewhat harold introduced wife to captain other officer without revealing too much related how hearing have be taken prisoner that be at pretoria have started out in search of when have be intercepted by juno received so many compliment on pluck that blushed a have never before blushed in life beauty be greatly admired by susceptible tar harold be considered lucky fellow to have so charming clever brave wife mr scarse after have recently heard of

regret that left juno at durban vowed ever after sailor be finest most delightful of men harold reminded laughingly that belonged to junior branch of service when be leaving captain gave captain

time have to spend in durban before leaving for front harold went off to see if must get permit for wife father to accompany meanwhile wandered about town together be brenda first experience of africa enjoyed be a though have dropped on to new planet wide street with veranda before shop troop throng of kaffir brilliant color of whole scene amused delighted beyond word air be full of rumor of what be doing at front false report true came in frequently so there be lack of excitement even mr scarse caught fever be not so eager in denunciation of government a have be moreover be beginning to find out that boer be not simple harmless creature dr leyds in europe be representing to be in smoking room of hotel heard story about made what remaining hair have stand upright with horror on mature consideration seemed to that if government handed back south africa to boer a little england party wished clock of time must be put back hundred year black race must be exterminated in dismay at idea mr scarse must not help revealing something of what be feeling to daughter be delighted at return to what called sane state of mind openly expressed pleasure wish must bring out dozen men so father men of party mean might teach england be not so invariably in wrong a seem to think dear confessed with show of penitence fear race be too insular have many thing to learn have not to learn how to colonize how to fight father said with true imperial spirit be belief providence gave gift that might civilize world if empire be to dwindle to nought must be bad day for world yes dear must after be only nation that think twice before do anything in short mr scarse be rapidly turning back upon old narrow view to have so long clung with broadening mind true meaning of imperialistic policy be becoming apparent discarding parish politics of clapham took to looking around well in doing so found much to occupy thought old crusted idea can not easily be dislodged to use oliver wendell holmes image mr scarse have be polarized for year harold succeeded in getting permit for wife father in law to go to front be arranged that must start next day in morning captain burton went about military business for have to carry report concerning store back to general mr scarse being occupied in political discussion with south african whom have met at hotel brenda thought must take stroll bought few thing wanted explored principal street a have ample time turned attention to suburb be very hot walked slowly under blaze of african sun red dust rose in cloud there be drowsy hum of insect around patient ox toiled along dusty road there be plenty of colonial about good deal of attention be attracted to mr burton on account of great beauty dress now again body of soldier in khaki must march through street followed by crowd of people kaffir lined up under veranda grinned from ear to ear a rooibaatjes went by although missed red coat have procured name from boer from what must gather brenda learned that kaffir be in favor of english cause for hated dreaded boer small wonder considering how be terrorized by inhuman sjambok at length getting tired of novelty brenda turned step back to hotel be drawing near midday wanted something to eat before left a took turning up side street led into principal thoroughfare saw man standing under veranda tall bulky man with golden hair golden beard be coolly watching shiver passed through a caught sight of for be enemy van zwieten chapter xxii at front van zwieten sin have evidently made difference in fortune appeared to be flourishing like proverbial green bay tree be dressed in smart riding suit with long brown boot smasher hat of approved boer type quite unabashed at sight of brenda crossed road with impudent smile held out hand shot one glance of indignation at drew aside a though to avoid contact with unclean thing proceeding appeared to cause man shame although tried to assume air of unconcern amusement wo shake hand with mr burton said quite jauntily how dare speak to said drawing back wonder be not ashamed to look in face after trick about letter ah be what boer call ' said wincing nevertheless at open contempt for fair in love war know husband have be rather in advance of on occasion plot have failed yes see admit that be plot admit that have failed have nothing to say to said brenda coldly except to tell that if attempt to molest husband further will have arrested a spy looked uneasily down road at stern set face of passing soldier knew that from such men a might expect precious little mercy once word spy have gone out against followed by damning evidence of complicity boer treachery have to be avenged there have be plenty of about did not fancy being scapegoat for others dear mr burton went on calmly wonder spare at why not have arrested now have done with be completely in power be not have to raise voice thing must be done indeed be not at sure must reach jail alive hate spy here be true have good reason to may not have such chance again so cry out upon now revenge on once for for crime crime of loving will not replied brenda firmly give fair warning mr van zwieten that if leave place immediately will at once inform authority about in luring to pretoria made one mistake thought must come unprepared did such thing have ample evidence with to prove in london occupation be that of spy lady jenny gave paper be very much obliged to lady jenny be sure said with bow at pretoria for oom paul must hardly have brought credential calculated to speak more highly in favor must be quick to appreciate service why did wish to come to pretoria know be married yes know be married marriage can be severed a else be severed by death said significantly if have come to pretoria there be need to talk about broke off impatiently be duly informed that husband be missing escaped before must reach tugela take to pretoria where must have be completely in power wrote letter thinking must really find there escaped got telegram one sent to wilfred burton followed down here learned how intended to intercept kaiser fritz see be well informed mr burton brenda be astonished at extent of man knowledge dogged fierceness with seemed to follow harold wondered if must not be wise to have so dangerous enemy arrested at once thought of lady jenny shame must bring upon through deed of late husband van zwieten must assuredly reveal in such contingency prevented from deciding upon so severe course later on have reason bitterly to regret that have not acted upon first impulse have done so must have saved husband endless trouble van zwieten guessed what be in mind made move seemed quite content to abide by decision there be even smile on face a looked at villain a be courage be undeniable pity be that virtue must not have be linked to others then be man over be belated conrad corsair man of one virtue ten thousand crime yet virtue might be added loved brenda loved honestly see know business a spy mr van zwieten said coldly work be thrown away if succeeded in killing husband a seem anxious to do must kill van zwieten turned shade paler for once be moved out of attitude of sneering insolence no said hoarsely think of thing wo harm husband on honor honor honor of spy honor of man who love said with dignity shrugged shoulder have not much belief in love be so selfish in aim so unscrupulous in carrying out of must not argue further with thought conversation be taking turn of personal character highly repugnant to moved away well mr van zwieten have warned if leave british territory will inform authority of london career good bye good bye said took off hat with grand bow a left did make attempt to stay knew already that be going to front with husband have intention of following that must reveal true character did not for one moment believe there have in power for must at once make known gilbert malet conduct must mean shame trouble for lady jenny from brenda be more than anxious to shield a well knew have be good friend to girl have indirectly done great deal to bring about marriage dutchman have more knowledge of woman nature than most of sex found of little service in profession have taken up brenda found husband impatiently awaiting have made arrangement for journey after hasty meal went down to station be in high spirit with harold beside prospect of novel busy life in capacity of nurse be perfectly happy still more of lover than husband thought have never seen look more beautiful concerning journey there be very little to say there be considerable monotony about of scenery be beautiful particularly when got amongst mountain for most part plain extended on side grey dreary kopje humping everywhere amongst karoo bush dust storm too be altogether disagreeable in spite of veil cloak brenda arrived at camp in very gritty condition thoroughly worn out husband saw doctor at once told of wife desire to nurse wounded offer be gratefully accepted for brenda have have certain amount of professional experience stood in good stead now so next day took up quarter in hospital went to work in earnest mr scarse having be introduced to authority amused by wandering about camp enjoying novelty of surroundings to home staying man such a round of daily life at front proved most amusing indeed father daughter be equally delighted with new experience mr burton proved most capable nurse paid attention to under charge husband chafed somewhat at first did not like idea of wife doing such work when saw that really enjoyed that be anxious to be of use in own way to who be fighting for queen country made further opposition moreover have own duty to attend to upon whole husband wife saw very little of other few moment did have be therefore sweeter knowledge that brenda be near safe from machination of van zwieten be supreme satisfaction to harold have yet to learn that dutchman be a active a ever bent upon getting into power since failure to cross tugela general buller have be reconstructing plan be taking ample time over preparation a said there must be turning back time garrison at ladysmith be holding out bravely message showed that be anxiously expecting relief soldier held like hound in leash be longing to get at foe wipe out first failure day passed move be made on side of tugela be safe on other boer swarmed although kept at safe distance from british position to brenda mere fact of living in camp in time of war be sufficiently exciting shortly after arrival captain burton be ordered on patrol duty to scour neighboring country on side of tugela said good bye to wife went off in high spirit be with sinking heart that watched go off on dangerous duty arrival of wilfred however served to cheer somewhat a have be stated young burton be acting a war correspondent for one of london paper have be gathering information about country around have be absent therefore when brother party arrived when came back first thing did be to look up brenda at hospital be struck at once by healthy appearance seemed le nervous hysterical than have be in london for outdoor life vigorous exercise be telling upon big black eye flashed a feverishly a ever did lose restlessness when brenda told of meeting with mr van zwieten at durban to harold have never mentioned knowing too well impulsive nature with brother felt be different already knew so much about man that little information more le did not matter be inclined to blame for having shown spy mercy at what must do expostulated brenda in dismay know that if have have arrested must have revenged by telling knew of mr malet life then think how terrible must have be for lady jenny must take chance said gloomily must be prepared to suffer for country van zwieten will pick up sort of knowledge at durban may be able then to hamper plan think will stay there wilfred told that if did not leave must give information to authority dare face think will be very long in following here added with flush of anger will follow everywhere must not be surprised if be across river now in hope of taking prisoner when camp be moved directly advance begin brenda must get back to durban will never do for to remain here there be going to be pretty hard fighting yes not here will be perfectly safe behind british line perhaps hope so wilfred looked gloomy bit nail abstractedly habit with when be annoyed tell what be brenda burst out be very doubtful about wisdom of advance buller idea be believe to cross tugela try pierce boer centre be afraid wo succeed oh wilfred have more faith in british soldier than have faith in rank file yes in many of junior officer confess candidly that feel altogether same amount of trust in leader mere fact of advance having be decided upon go to prove to that know business country between ladysmith be precipitous know nothing like outside switzerland rockies seems to to be mad thing to lead army over with heavy transport unless army be in overwhelming superiority to opposing force know be whole place be strongly fortified position will have to be stormed be almost impregnable boer know only too well what be about have chosen ground well mark word there will be great loss of life if not great disaster be throwing away life to attempt campaigning in district ladysmith must be relieved know will never be relieved in way even valor of british soldier be powerless against hail of bullet will rain down on from natural fortress ten to one wo see single boer to shoot at in return be devilish clever at keeping out of sight of course be only civilian intend to set opinion against of professional soldier there be such thing a common sense have not have enough of about in conduct of campaign brenda be impressed in spite of do think ought to be done wilfred fall back on durban reconstruct plan of campaign buller original idea of invading free state be by far best if took capital must cut rabbit off from burrow ten to one free stater must be disheartened then again in country must have have more open fighting manoeuvring must have be child play to what be here be sheer madness hurling line after line against impregnable fortress even if be taken can only be at terrible loss believe buller original plan be best only one hear be overruled can take word for if buller make move there will be terrible disaster brenda seemed disturbed at view of thing must not believe that soldier of general buller experience must be capable of so grave error of judgment yet a wilfred put advance did seem to be of unduly hazardous nature there again wilfred be always so pessimistic be not man to look at anything hopefully when must do opposite men be full of confidence knew be looking forward to relieving gallant comrade in ladysmith within very short time now wilfred must be wrong argued be more than likely that general have information up sleeve that one knew anything about at event be not going to look on black side of thing thus comforted somewhat harold returned from patrolling only for short while again again be sent out sometimes into enemy country be in saddle from morning till night brenda saw little of have to put up with continued absence a best must have a happened plenty of work to distract be excellent nurse did good service in hospital not sparing in way indeed so constantly be employed that doctor insisted upon taking sufficient amount of exercise strongly advised to ride commended to for rode well be never happier than when in saddle managed to obtain habit from colonial lady who be also in camp husband managed to procure for capital little animal one of active little pony used by boer so came to make frequent excursion into surrounding country must keep on side of river mr burton said doctor a long a do that be quite safe even beyond camp line cross tugela directly do that run risk ca afford to lose best nurse know brenda looked at sullen

that be being watched must look round see kaffir staring fixedly at happened on several day in succession yet must not be sure that be always same man native be so very much alike to that be impossible to distinguish one from however espionage be in nowise aggressive on contrary if espionage be be done very skillfully might be even pure fancy on part for ever since meeting with van zwieten in durban nerve be anything steady at event decided not to say anything to husband about lest must forbid excursion altogether now that have taken to riding again be very loth to give up wondered if might be possible that van zwieten be about be possible just possible thought not probable must know that wilfred be in camp that must have hesitation in denouncing a spy for reason did not think must be so foolish a to trust within british line at least so long a kept on side tugela must not molest be fool to risk life in mad attempt must mean certain failure so comforted feeling of being watched still remained with at last order to advance be given men tired of inaction joyfully obeyed harold have be absent two day on scout duty time across river warren brigade be preparing to

daughter be safe sound have now returned from durban be staying at same hotel be thankful to know at last be to be spared persecution of van zwieten whose death openly rejoiced in be greatly astonished at news wilfred have killed malet hardly censured so severely a little englander might have be expected to do in circumstance indeed mr scarse be by mean so virulent against country now a have be in past visit to south africa have opened eye to other side of question particularly to many failing of boer have learned from experience that england be not invariably wrong that however might blunder have usually right on side in fact a father politician mr scarse be reformed character harold be terribly distressed to hear of death of brother for long time brenda kept news from fearing effect in weak state day came when must no longer be withheld be obliged to tell truth be glorious tropical morning father have gone out be seated by husband bed holding hand in own beard have

to acquaint with subject under discussion so busy have brenda be in nursing husband that have not found time to tell whole story to father now asked for detail went over again for benefit why did wilfred kill man asked from sheer patriotic feeling answered daughter found out that mr malet be supplying information about defence to van zwieten remonstrated with malet laughed at scruple denied complicity then wilfred searched mr malet desk found paper proved conclusively treachery then be decided to kill to save honor of family well said scarse reflectively murder be terrible crime if ever be excusable surely be in such circumstance a so think chimed in harold man who betrays country must not be allowed to live in place must have acted just a wilfred did be not murder be well deserved extermination be terrible nevertheless read confession brenda said mr scarse can tell story better harold must not be wearied confession be long wilfred have stated at great length reason led to act set out strong defence of never regretted at event go on brenda dear child be anxious to hear how did glanced at harold to see if be listening began need not weary with own defence said a have told from paper in mr malet desk found out that be traitor be supplying van zwieten with information concerning plan of government number of men gun must place in field many other thing transvaal authority wished to know have kruger gang not known that be wholly unprepared must not have dared to defy great britain risk war mr malet appears be responsible for great deal indeed for whole war scoundrel harold said weakly be glad indeed that wilfred shot must have done so to ward off suspicion from doings malet posed a imperialist saw van zwieten only at interval be to obtain possession of paper from malet that van zwieten came down to chippingholt for reason extorted invitation from father thought be anxious to come mr scarse said now can see continued wilfred heard van be at cottage kept sharp eye on malet found out that be to meet van zwieten on night give document then made up mind to kill to save a have said honor of family a well a to punish for wickedness in betraying own country shortly before nine o'clock van zwieten came to manor entered library by one of french window be voice that lady jenny heard when went to see if husband be back from walk indeed be malet who brought van zwieten to library to give paper when lady jenny be on way to rectory to see harold wilfred escorted mentioned that have heard voice in library wondered with whom husband have be speaking wilfred guessed at once that man be at scoundrelly work be more than ever determined to put stop to to get away from lady jenny without exciting suspicion also to prove alibi in case shot man pretended to sprain ankle lady jenny be quite unsuspicious went on to rectory alone a know never reached having be stopped by storm a soon a be out of sight wilfred hastened back to house with intention of confronting men killing malet if did not take paper back from van zwieten also entered library by french window so servant never saw come in found room empty a van zwieten have gone away malet with suppose be to receive further instruction wilfred saw revolver belonging to harold on side table for mr malet have be using afternoon took one found that be loaded hastened after pair knowing that van zwieten be at cottage went first in direction for long time must see of at last caught sight of malet in orchard just before storm be talking with man whom wilfred took to be father brother suppose yes replied brenda be uncle robert heard high word between two saw struggle be when crape scarf be torn undoubtedly malet must have torn held in hand without thinking well wilfred saw malet throw other man to ground just when storm broke hurry away to get back to shelter in manor storm be so violent that took shelter instead under tree wilfred crept up to waited be so dark that must not see plainly enough to shoot straight be of course unwilling to risk failure then flash of lightning revealed mr malet wilfred sprang forward grasped by shoulder cried out heard be only short distance away when darkness closed down again wilfred put muzzle of revolver close to head blew brain out then ran away in darkness tripped over stump revolver flew out of hand lost van found yes wilfred be good deal troubled about for knew that harold name be on feared lest must on account be accused of murder a be indeed said harold yes dear know not officially if for instance have be arrested on charge then wilfred must have come forward have told whole story a be kept silence what did do after have killed malet asked mr scarse went back to place where lady jenny have left waited for time in case must return see to exonerate thought well to keep up fiction of sprained ankle then a lady jenny did not return went home gave out that ankle be sprained did doctor find out truth took good care not to show foot to one wrapped up in wet cloth made great fuss about in excitement over inquest doctor took notice of wonder lady jenny did find out fraud said harold in case wilfred must have owned up to confessed whole thing believe must have minded much if have known what traitor husband be dare say must have applauded wilfred be true patriot be lady jenny said harold with feeble laugh besides on account of robert wife husband have become estranged for many long day did van zwieten never guess said brenda reflectively think did believed lady jenny have done out of revenge must not prove that under circumstance lest own affair must come out thought wiser to hold tongue well be story very painful one be be sure that wilfred acted for best did what conceived to be duty to country family be
