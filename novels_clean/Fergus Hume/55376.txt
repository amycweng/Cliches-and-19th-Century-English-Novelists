designate certain dish much in favour with lodging house keeper in land of free wherein unconsidered trifle left over from six dinner of week be made into savoury stew to serve for seventh being highly spiced deftly concocted be apt to deceive inexperienced novice in lodging house cookery inasmuch a deems dish formed of new ingredient mistaken view a can be seen from foregoing explanation proprietor of hash therefore did in literary sense that be often done in culinary one for by stealing item of news from other source making into spicy little paragraph succeeded in producing very readable paper much in favour with londoner if there be new scandal shocking occurrence hash be sure to have bright witty description of consequently sold capitally be in paper that following item of interest be told to public week after discovery of body in jermyn street high jinks in high life be at again when will british aristocracy learn that must not covet neighbour wife elopement have taken

will give report of inquest in same number of hash longer article appeared headed piccadilly puzzle cain be amateur in art of murder then have one to copy from so clumsiness must be excused crime of

inspector that something chain probably have be wrenched off by assassin be also of opinion that death must not have be thus caused doctor say death be caused by blood poisoning evidence being swollen condition of body protruding tongue discolouration of skin think must be poison make minute examination find on neck slight scratch just on jugular vein greatly inflamed be of opinion that assassin have wounded victim in neck with poisoned dagger knife inspector take description of body for purpose of having hand bill printed to distribute about city exeunt omnes with body to morgue act iii be so long that will drop dramatic style tell in own fashion special reporter be at inquest following be result of inquiry body of deceased be examined by jury following article of clothing be put in evidence sealskin jacket silk dress glove under linen not marked hat brown blue velvet intertwined clasped with silver crescent evidence of spencer ellersby independent gentleman be travelling for year only returned to england month ago be at countess of kerstoke ball on monday last left at few minute past two o'clock walked along piccadilly met friend in st james street spoke to for few moment when left met policeman who guided through fog to jermyn street left policeman went up step thinking be guelph hotel found there body of deceased called policeman body be taken to hospital doe not know deceased in way evidence of constable batter corroboration of evidence of former witness evidence of dr fanton examined body of deceased well nourished deceased have evidently be in good health must say have be dead at time of examination about three hour death appeared to have be caused by paralysis blood be disorganised therefore judged deceased have be poisoned disorganisation be caused by action of virus vein be congested lung full of blood congealed of dark colour face be swollen of dark purple appearance tongue also protruded small wound on neck over jugular vein in not sufficient to cause death thought from appearance that assassin have inflicted wound with poisoned dagger knife hence appearance of body if powerful poison must act in very short time a blood in jugular vein went straight to heart poison must act in about ten minute if deceased have be excited in even shorter time closed evidence inspector said inquiry have be made to find name of deceased clue have a yet be obtained case have be placed in hand of detective dowker who be present coroner summed up woman have be found dead proved by evidence of policeman batter mr ellersby death have be caused by poison proved by evidence of dr fanton poison administered through wound in neck by mean of dagger knife lancet evidence to show who have inflicted wound jury must please return verdict in accordance with evidence jury consulted for few minute returned verdict that deceased have come to death by violence by hand of person person unknown be whole statement of case have entitled piccadilly puzzle will now make comment thereon in first place from appearance deceased be evidently lady not street walker know that many street walker be lady who have fallen into state of degradation unknown woman be not one of in opinion for a far a can learn bore mark of dissipation life must inevitably cause again if have be habitu of street must have be known to police none of be able to identify true face have be swollen disfigured by action of poison so that in case must have be difficult to recognize feature still dress figure might lead to identification result have be arrived at deceased therefore to appearance be lady jermyn street be not particularly busy thoroughfare at time after eleven o'clock be comparatively deserted therefore assassin must have decoyed victim there to accomplish crime in safety might have have appointment to meet while talking to in doorway have embraced might doubtless have wounded with poisonous weapon must only feel pin prick then must watch poison do work must become confused then giddy entertaining idea that carried death in vein then passing into comatose state must sink to ground in dying condition companion have then probably left satisfied that must not call out there seems to have be great deal of devilish ingenuity about committal of crime brings to consideration a to position in life held by assassin hold that be gentleman at least educated man possibly medical man medical student dilettante in toxicology common assassin must have decoyed victim into house murdered in more brutal manner by cutting throat battering head with poker strange assassin secure in possession of weapon more deadly engages unhappy victim in confidential talk whilst embracing cause death in sure manner be juda like crime kiss of friendship heart of treachery therefore say criminal who posse refined fiendish instinct must be educated man also one who must have little knowledge of poison to employ subtle drug did nature of poison can not be discovered a simple scratch corrupted blood there be local sign to tell what kind be employed a to motive of crime may have be love may have be jealousy perhaps robbery a money jewellery be found on body there be mark on neck a though chain have be roughly wrenched off what have set forth be mere conjecture for assassin may be woman think improbable woman must have nerve to commit crime in open street true assassin be favoured by fog hid crime behind impenetrable veil still risk be enormous be assassin man woman there be doubt have in midst human fiend who possessed of deadly weapon namely poisoned dagger can commit crime with impunity slight scratch given in certain portion of body victim be doomed who be to point out assassin unless be actually seen committing crime have not yet heard end of piccadilly puzzle will take acumen ingenuity of london detective to trace secret assassin only dread be lest other victim may fall before terrible weapon though assassin of unknown woman may escape consequence of crime sooner later will thirst again for blood second time may not be so fortunate let remember tho ' mill of god grind slowly grind exceeding small chapter iii dowker detective mr dowker be long lean man of drab colour hair be thin of neutral tint eye watery blue somewhat large mouth drawn down at corner betokened lachrymose nature wore greyish clothes always little threadbare large thick soled boot chosen rather for utility than beauty head gear consisted of sad coloured soft hat pulled well over eye from under scanty hair hung in depressing manner in fact have somewhat sketchy appearance a if have be outlined waited to be filled up with colour stage of development must have turned into thing of beauty be never arrived at general appearance be dismal in extreme wore beard be several tuft of straggly hair be planted in patch over face did not seem to flourish never smiled frequently sighed so that manner a well a appearance be not calculated to inculcate cheerful thought notwithstanding unprepossessing exterior there be cleverer man in london most dexterous criminal must rather have have other detective after than apparently unpromising thief catcher outward resemblance of man be not invariably index of mind puritan physiognomy of mr dowker be very serviceable mask to acuteness brilliancy of intellect consequently when piccadilly puzzle case promised to be such difficult one to unravel be placed in hand of mr dowker whole affair left entirely to dowker be pleased at tribute to cleverness sighed in approving manner a rapidly reviewed evidence have come under eye of police in first place must be necessary to discover name of deceased then by finding out manner of life motive of crime might be discovered pointing to criminal clothing be not marked in way on examining hat dowker found from ticket on inside that have be purchased at shop of madame rne in regent street so wrapping up hat in paper betook to establishment of lady a first step in chain of evidence hoped to complete by discovery of assassin madame rne establishment be one of smartest in london be well known to feminine world who be accustomed to pay exorbitant sum demanded there for good must have be bought much cheaper elsewhere then must not have be stamped with madame rne approval omission be to declare that article be unfashionable madame rne trade mark being thus indispensable lady never ventured to go anywhere else if must possibly manage madame rne flourished greatly dowker entered shop asked to see madame rne to whose presence be conducted at once for detective be well known there haying be frequently employed by madame in mission of delicate nature principally concerning lady of high rank diamond madame be short stout with thoroughly english face

make fuss why not sell necklace be what be going to do a soon a hear from lady balscombe suppose will be divorced marry calliston more fool for be scamp then will want to redeem necklace quietly know where to write to where have gone to hear in yacht to azores said dowker who knew everything will turn up again have doubt then can see what idiot be to give up fair position said madame who looked at whole affair from purely worldly point of view be nobody when sir rupert picked up gave everything made duck drake of money fought result be be gone off with calliston man who be biggest scamp in town yes know got little crib in st john wood said dowker who have hesitation in talking plainly to woman who knew a much about fast life a did so hear never saw mistress hear be beautiful woman there will be row when hears latest escapade will get tired of lady balscombe go back to st john wood establishment always do well whole affair will end a usual said detective with sigh in public scandal divorce want to see about taking hat out of parcel laid before madame be rather striking looking black straw with brown blue velvet twisted together caught on one side with slender silver crescent yes be mine said madame glancing at rather good style think what do want to know name of person sold to humph rather difficult question to answer one might have bought taken away with if left address will soon find out touched bell girl appeared send miss brail to be invaluable explained madame to dowker when girl have vanished wonderful memory forgets nothing find useful in deal with lady milliner business be not bonnet hat a know be more than world doe responded dowker with a near approach to smile a allowed miss brail made appearance decided question at once be sold to lady about two month ago somewhere in st john wood be real lady asked dowker well be more like servant responded miss brail doubtfully must say lady maid be sent asked madame impatiently yes address be in book answered miss brail went out to get book in few moment returned announced lydia fenny cleopatra villa st john wood in spite of habitual phlegm dowker started on perceiving madame dismissed miss brail at once why do start asked curiously when door have closed dowker sighed in usual manner taking out handkerchief twisted up into hard ball sure sign that be impressed in way cleopatra villa be lord calliston place oh said madame in rather amazed tone what curious thing must have be speaking about suppose lydia fenny be lady maid there be lady maid corrected dowker what do mean if hat touching be sold by to lydia fenny be dead dead victim of jermyn street murder what madame rne sprang to foot greatly agitated wanted to find out name of dead woman in order to get clue to perpetrator of crime explained dowker rapidly hat be on head when body be discovered have mark inside showing be bought here so came here to find out to whom be sold tell lydia fenny so logical conclusion be that lydia fenny be victim be very strange said madame rapidly looking at with keen eye may not be lydia fenny at other hat might have be made similar to one lydia fenny might have lent given hat to person there be only one way of finding out said dowker wrapping up hat rising to foot be to make inquiry at cleopatra villa good day detective went out leaving madame transfixed with astonishment humph said at length wonder if lord calliston got anything to do with murder chapter iv st john wood establishment cleopatra villa be pleasant house very expensive one a lord calliston found to cost then presiding deity by name lena sarschine be very beautiful insisted upon having dwelling fitted up in corresponding manner so calliston gave way spent small fortune on bijou residence dowker knew good many of little paradise with worldly wise eve existence of whom be not supposed to be known to polite world so felt quite at ease when upon ringing bell be admitted to garden by solemn looking man servant be well acquainted with calliston life public private side being very reputable then with such advantage of wrong doing a world now offer be hard to be virtuous calliston have come into title whilst in childhood estate having be well looked after during minority found plenty of money to spend when came of age certainly did spend horse racing yachting be two principal pleasure curiously enough name be never mixed up with well known woman few of friend knew except by hearsay of divinity who dwelt in cleopatra villa calliston have fallen in love with down in country year before bringing up to town installed in bijou residence rarely left occasionally went to theatre sometimes drove in park at such rare interval that few people knew who be calliston be very jealous of seldom asked friend to supper be reported by few who have be thus honoured to be very beautiful woman with charming manner general opinion be that must end up by marrying when entanglement with lady balscombe became known henceforward be seen more by lady side than in neighbourhood of st john wood dowker from mysterious source only known to be cognisant of have now come down to discover what connection establishment of st john wood have with murder in jermyn street knew that calliston have gone off with lady balscombe so said have message from must like to see miss sarschine servant showed into magnificently furnished drawing room where awaited appearance of lady intending when entered to ask particular about maid lydia fenny with view to discovering perpetrator of crime being of inquiring turn of mind dowker arose from seat when door be closed folding hand behind back strolled about room lank grey clad figure seeming sadly out of place be not very large apartment luxuriously furnished wall being hung with pale green silk draped in graceful fold caught up here there with thick silver cord carpet also of pale green be embroidered with bunch of white flower window curtain be of soft white liberty silk there be two window on one side in deep recess filled with brilliantly tinted flower white blossom predominating at end of room be folding door opening into conservatory filled with fern in middle of small fountain splashed musically into wide marble basin there be low velvet covered lounging chair about table crowded with bric brac photograph in oxydised silver frame whilst here there on carpet be skin of bear tiger contrary to usual custom in drawing room there be only one mirror small oval glass over mantel piece framed in pale green plush in corner be high palm other tropical vegetation with white marble statue peering from out of green leaf in one corner handsome grand piano on top of lay lot of sheet music room be illuminated by two three tall brass lamp with bright green shade smothered in creamy lace just over piano be number of quaint looking weapon arranged in fantastic fashion highland broadsword indian dagger malay kris be grouped round small silver shield handsomely embossed though at first seemed somewhat out of place against rich silk hanging yet when eye became accustomed to effect be not unpleasant dowker took leisurely survey of apartment then returned to seat to await appearance of miss sarschine to think over curious aspect piccadilly case now presented cogitation ran somewhat after fashion time of discovery of body by mr ellersby be about half past two medical evidence at inquest be to effect that deceased have be dead about two hour so allowing margin for possible inaccuracy crime must have be committed about midnight at time there must be certain amount of traffic through jermyn street then spectacle of man talking to woman in doorway of house must hardly attract much attention if murderer have accomplished purpose by mean of poison there be doubt fanciful description given by hash must be tolerably correct supposing assassin to have wounded victim by mean of poisoned weapon must have become confused giddy finally passing into comatose state in must quietly expire therefore there must be no screaming to attract attention of passer by albeit in case lying down must have aroused curiosity yet fog be so thick on night one must see position of criminal victim now next question be why did miss sarschine not make inquiry after maid week have elapsed since murder girl absence for time must certainly seem unaccountable on non appearance mistress must watch paper to see if anything have happened to must then notice jermyn street murder from description given must have difficulty in recognizing servant since though have without doubt become cognisant of fact that lydia fenny be dead have not come forward to identify body dowker pondered over reason have for reticence ca have committed crime herself said dowker in puzzled tone a must hardly do so in such public place why have be so quiet again must know anything about poisoned weapon must have other reason for holding tongue at moment attention be caught by display of weapon on wall with short exclamation walked across room looked sharply at be arranged in fantastic pattern side being same here dowker noticed with much curiosity that one side be incomplete malay kris having be removed looked at other side there be certainly two arranged crossway on other there be only one dowker be startled by discovery a seemed to point to fact that crime have be committed by missing kris knew malay be savage nation without doubt poisoned dagger so absence of one of must argue that have be weapon used gingerly touched point of kris with tip of finger then drew hastily away might be poisoned muttered looking at finger to assure have not broken skin wonder if be 'd like to find out glancing hastily round room to make sure be alone took kris from wall on other side so that pattern be now equalised trusted to fact to hide abstraction of weapon then took old letter out of pocket tearing up into strip carefully swathed blade of kris to prevent possible accident slipped parcel into breast pocket will go see doctor muttered to a buttoned coat try effect of on dog if symptom of death be same will be proof conclusive that missing dagger be used to commit crime once establish will soon find out guilty party a must have be one in house especially a lydia fenny be servant here walked back again to chair have just sat down when door opened woman entered not at pretty medium height dark hair eye sharp active looking face however be disfigured by mark of small pox be dressed in well made dark costume wore knot of crimson ribbon round throat dowker surveyed lady carefully instantly came to conclusion that be fellow servant of lydia fenny certainly not miss sarschine hang muttered dowker must make love to that newcomer advanced a dowker arose to foot want to see miss sarschine asked looking at detective yes have pleasure be not miss sarschine can let have message wish delivered can not see lady can not be out of town oh dowker looked rather blank then be reason miss sarschine did not come forward to identify body from whom be message asked woman from from lord calliston said dowker in hesitating manner be

crescent soon found house wanted curling up on doorstep waited patiently for chance to deliver myles into designing hand rain continued to pour down steadily a be now dark flip must see window along street being lighted up gas lamp also shone brightly through rain be reflected in dull blurred splash on pavement occasionally gentleman must hurry past with umbrella up ragged tramp must slouch along

turn over paper rapidly with idea of finding dagger hidden underneath nothing however rewarded effort though looked into sideboard examined book case lifted up cover of chair found sign of weapon must be in bed room thought flip scratching head in perplexity wondering how must get in when suddenly occurred to that have not examined mantel piece there be not moment to be lost a myles might return at

lena sarschine idea seemed absurd for woman of such character a lord calliston mistress must hardly have audacity to visit lady balscombe yet pondered dowker know two woman loved same man free lance like lena sarschine must not hesitate for moment in slanging woman who took man away why did not lady balscombe kick up row order to leave house be hanged if can get to bottom of at length dowker decided that best thing to be done must be to find out from servant of balscombe household took place subsequent to lady balscombe departure first however decided on seeing lydia fenny finding out if

lard calliston be of too glaring character to be overlooked even by most complacent husband dowker however did not believe in genuineness of application merely looking upon a clever piece of acting on part of wily scoundrel to cloak crime in detective opinion sir rupert have simulated rage on hearing of wife apparent iniquity have applied for divorce knowing be dead have gone down to yacht with full knowledge that must not see lady balscombe in fact through have acted very clever part in order to ward off suspicion that be guilty of crime of murder what dowker now wanted to find be locket sir rupert have wrenched off wife neck also weapon used in committal of crime have be clearly shown that malay kris taken from cleopatra villa must not have be used by anyone so baronet must have have dagger of own be now doubtless in possession if two thing must be found discovery coupled with evidence of calliston desmond must be quite sufficient to prove sir rupert guilty unless indeed must
