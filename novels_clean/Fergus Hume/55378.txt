get point from whence to start placed idea in form of question answer a follows q be villiers outside on verandah when caprice mentioned where diamond be kept to appearance be q have inducement to steal diamond undoubtedly be poor wanted money proved by calling on caprice asking for said must be revenged because did not give more than sovereign there must be sweeter revenge than to steal diamond a must punish benefit q did know room where diamond be kept yes caprice said bedroom a villiers have be several time to house before knew where be q did caprice know villiers have stolen jewel extremely probably hence refusal to prosecute a be husband of madame midas whom have treated so basely refusal to prosecute villiers might be in caprice opinion act of expiation when have got thus far

bourke street with intention of calling on chinaman named ah goon who kept opium den in unsavoury locality to drinking habit villiers now added that of being confirmed opium smoker be on term of

accomplice give more money cried villiers lurching forward must have laid hand on shoulder of shrinking chinaman when naball stepped out of corner what be matter asked in silky voice villiers turned on new comer with sudden start stared suspiciously at detective being muffled up in heavy ulster with hat pulled over eye did not recognise what do want said ungraciously nothing replied naball quickly be only strolling round chinese quarter out of curiosity heard rowing poor devil poor devil sneered villiers with glance of fury at ah goon who have complacently resumed occupation of preparing opium pipe be rich enough indeed said detective carelessly to lend money what be to growled villiers with snarl s'pose can borrow money if like certainly if have got good security to give

jumped up threw on two trying to separate woman got villiers hand off started to sing out freely so naball began to think of retreating a noise must bring undesirable bully of neighbourhood into unsavoury den while thus hesitating woman flung diamond ornament away from with oath fell at foot in moment detective have picked up slipped in into pocket villiers seeing ornament be gone flung woman from with howl of fury turned to look for when door be burst violently open crowd of chinese chattering in high shrill voice like magpie surged into room ah goon with many gesticulation began to explain villiers to swear woman to shriek so in midst of pandemonium naball slipped away be soon walking swiftly down little bourke street with diamond ornament safe in pocket believe be one of stolen jewel muttered exultingly villiers be thief after humph be not so sure of well will find out truth when see how look on being shown little bit of evidence chapter xi what overheard be said that counsel come in silence of night so next morning mr naball having be thinking deeply about curious discovery decided upon plan of action be evidently no good to go straight to caprice show diamond crescent a judging from general conduct with regard to robbery must deny that jewel belonged to detective therefore determined to ascertain from independent person whether jewel be really property of caprice after consideration came to conclusion that fenton must be most likely individual to supply necessary information be lover argued to a walked along street so ought to know what jewellery be got dare say gave lot hang went on disconsolately know why be bothering about affair nothing will come of for reason best known to herself caprice wo let follow up case ca make out stole jewel villiers did wo prosecute ah woman be rum thing concluded detective with regretful sigh have by time arrived at never say die insurance office on entering door found in large lofty apartment with long

young man knew good deal about private life be anticipating coming into contact with several of in professional manner presently oily clerk returned with request to mr to walk into manager office that gentleman did in leisurely manner shiny clerk closing door softly returned to position behind shiny counter mr fenton sat at handsome writing table be piled up with disorderly paper looked sharply at detective a took seat well naball said in strident voice what be matter ca give more than five minute time money here yes sir five minute will do replied detective tapping varnished boot with cane be

to grave report of inquest be followed with great interest for though be generally thought that robbing be motive for crime yet hinted that considering character of old man there might be more cogent reason for committal of murder one of sceptic be naball in whose hand case have be placed for elucidation believe be robbery said to brother detective old lazarus knew good many dangerous secret must be bit surprised to find that murderer be poor devil whom have in power open safe said detective pish can easily be accounted for there may have be paper implicating murderer robbery might have be blind oh there be dozen of reason however will find out at inquest in opening proceeding coroner mentioned circumstance in connection with murder have come to knowledge of police said that a yet clue

ever from lonely life chapter xxi first night at bon bon faust upset have be put into rehearsal at once three week after murder of lazarus be to be produced mortimer have hurried on production of burlesque with uttermost speed a prince carnival be now playing to empty house bon bon company be kept hard at work what with rehearsal during day performance of opera bouffe in evening rehearsal afterwards till two in morning be pretty well worn out in spite of kitty indomitable spirit be looking haggard ill for incessant work be beginning to tell on system doctor told plainly that be killing that absolute rest be what required in spite of warning never gave moment peace care two straw if die said recklessly to dr chinston have made arrangement for future of child there be nothing else for to live for be determined to make burlesque success worked hard at rehearsal getting author composer to alter thing cut out others making several valuable suggestion a to stage management in way doing best though friendly towards keith yet be conscious of kind of reserve in manner towards thought be due to knowledge that be engaged to eugnie have become reconciled to sweetheart went down day to teach meg at toorak have be arranged that in three month be to go to england with meg kitty guaranteed to pay certain sum annually for salary of governess maintenance of child of course eugnie never meant to take money a have become strongly attached to meg still kept up semblance of poverty till such time a judged fit to tell keith meanwhile in spite of keith opposition lived with caprice led very quiet life for what with state of health constant rehearsal kitty gave sunday reception while stewart fumed fretted over fact of sweetheart staying with woman of bad character like caprice attended to rehearsal of burlesque be silently winding net round detective have made inquiry at skylark club found that keith have be there on night in company of fenton on discovering went to fenton discovered that stewart have lent american knife with crime have be committed to cut wire of champagne bottle afterwards slipped into coat pocket from club went to bon bon theatre a detective knew from keith own admission have left there at half past twelve then said to told wandered about street till two o'clock then saw villiers rubbish went straight to russell street committed crime have taken naball time to collect necessary evidence be only on day previous to production of faust upset that be able to get warrant for keith arrest so determined to let performance take place before arrested if be success said naball to a slipped warrant in pocket will have have one jolly hour to if be failure well will be glad enough to go to gaol so with philosophical conclusion mr settled in own mind that must go to theatre keith wanted eugnie to go to box with in order to see play said must rather go to stall by in order to judge of effect burlesque have on audience after good deal of argument stewart gave way so on momentous night took seat in stall eager to see first bid lover made for fame tulch have be recalled from task of watching stewart a judged that vanity of author seeing work on stage must be enough to keep young man in melbourne tulch true to instinct of finishing job properly took place in gallery kept eye on keith who sat with ezra in private box jew be calm placid a having succeeded to father fortune have not staked everything like keith on burlesque being success still for partner sake a well a own be anxious that must go well crowded house a be everybody in melbourne be there for new play by colonial author be rare thing burlesque by colonial author with original music by colonial composer be almost unheard of critic who be present felt unwonted sense of responsibility to night for a be first production of piece on stage have to give opinion on own responsibility hitherto generality of play produced in melbourne have good bad point settled long before by london critic so be comparatively easy to give verdict to night be quite different thing therefore gentleman of press intended to be extra careful in remark although faust upset be called burlesque be more of opera bouffe a there be absence of pun rhyme about dialogue besides lyric be really cleverly written music brisk sparkling keith have taken old medival legend of faust reversed entirely male character of story made female vice versa there be good deal of satire in piece about higher education of woman devotion of young men to athletics to exclusion of brain work in fact libretto be of decidedly gilbertian flavour albeit rather more frivolous while music be entirely of offenbachian school light tuneful rapid after medley overture containing number of taking melody in piece curtain rose on study of miss faust blue stocking of deepest dye who after devoting life to acquiring knowledge find at age of fifty old maid with one to care for character be played by toltby who be genuine humorist succeeded in making great deal out of part without ever condescending to vulgarity appearance a lank long maiden in dingy sage green gown with wan face tousled hair be ludicrous in extreme opening chorus be sung by number of pretty girl in cap gown on going out to meet lover miss faust overcome with loneliness summons to aid power of evil in response miss mephistopheles appears kitty looked charming a stood in centre of red limelight be arrayed in traditional dress of red a female demon wore petticoat face be also left untouched miss faust fainted in chair miss mephistopheles with bright light in eye reckless devil may care look on expressive face whirled down to footlights dashed into rattling galop song yes be melody ran through opera with assistance of various cosmetic new dress sundry other article of feminine toilet be brought in by number of small imp miss mephistopheles succeeds in making miss faust young show vision of mr marguerite young athlete finally change scene to market place where there be chorus of young men in praise of athletic sport must be useless to give plot in detail a keith followed line of legend pretty closely miss faust meet mr marguerite who be beloved by miss siebel sporting young woman there be garden scene with lawn tennis ground vision on brocken of future of woman with grotesque ballet fantastic dress scene of duel be quarrel scene between mr valentine miss faust after style of madame angot then miss mephistopheles run off with mr marguerite having fallen in love with lover be followed thrown into prison be changed by magic power of miss mephistopheles to race course in scene there be bewildering array of betting men pugilist pretty girl fortune teller miss mephistopheles then resigns mr marguerite to miss siebel want to carry off miss faust to nether region when flaw be discovered in deed everything be settled amicably whole play ending with galop chorus of first number when curtain fell on first act audience be somewhat bewildered be such entirely new departure from story of faust that almost resented a piece progressed saw real cleverness of satire when curtain came down called loudly for author composer who came forward bowed acknowledgment when mortimer heard eulogy lavished on piece drew long breath of relief jove thought be going to fail said believe must have if caprice have pulled out of fire indeed caprice with wonderful spirit reckless abandon have carried whole play with saved at most critical moment young man sitting near eugnie summed up idea of piece in few word be deuced clever play said caprice make go if one else play part theatre will be empty eugnie turned angrily to look for author of remark must not see just a be turning away shrill voice near said ai caprice stunner have seen 'er lot of time at old lazarus speaker be small white faced jewish youth being none other than isaiah miss rainsford pondered over word a walked out of theatre go to old lazarus said to herself be old man who be killed wonder why went there there be crowd in vestibule of theatre saw keith standing in corner looking a pale a death talking to man went up to congratulate on success of performance something in face made afraid what be matter keith asked touching hush said in hoarse whisper say word be arrested arrested what for gasped man standing next to keith interposed for murder of jacob lazarus said in low voice eugnie closed eye with sensation of horror caught hold of wall for support when opened eye again keith detective have vanished arrested for murder of lazarus muttered god ca be true chapter xxii eugnie v naball a rule first performance in melbourne take place on saturday night consequently criticism on faust upset be in monday paper simultaneously with notice of burlesque there appeared announcement that author of piece have be arrested for murder of jacob lazarus keith be very little known in melbourne so arrest personally caused little talk fact that successful author murderer be one same person caused great sensation criticism on burlesque be a rule good though of paper picked out fault yet be generally agreed that piece have be wonderful success sensation of successful colonial production having taken place be merged in greater sensation of discovery of russell street murderer keith stewart protesting innocence of charge have immediately be taken off to gaol eugnie be unable to see until got permission of proper authority feeling certain that have not committed crime called on ezra at penny whistle early on monday morning on sending up card be shown into ezra room there found that be present detective who be fully convinced of keith guilt have called in order to find out for certain from ezra about

success paper with usual kindly generosity towards author declared that be due not so much to intrinsic merit of work a to wonderfully clever acting of caprice last night however have acted badly going through part with mechanical precision without dash usually characterised performance worry of murder case anxiety for future of child pity for unfortunate young man now in prison have wrought on nerve so that felt overcome with extreme lassitude lay supinely in bed with half closed eye incapable of slightest exertion from state of tranquillity be aroused by entrance of eugnie who be also looking pale worn have learned about tracing of five pound note to ezra have now come to tell kitty about room be in kind of semi darkness a blind have be pulled down to keep out dazzling sunlight

in own mind that ezra lazarus killed own father pish dear tell again naball be fool may be observed other woman bitterly be fool on whose folly keith life depends not bit of said caprice cheerfully will find way to save yet only evidence against be that knife believe be in possession at bon bon theatre why not because one must have taken out of overcoat pocket there took coat downstairs by
