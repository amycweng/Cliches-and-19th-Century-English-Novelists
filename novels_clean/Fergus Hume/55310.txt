how clever be denham may assist to unmask felix do think will come to night said going to window letter said to night to morrow then will be to morrow felix must risk meeting at night if have thus betrayed let go to bed to morrow settle matter at first francis be unwilling to retire when landlord came to lock up for night laughed at idea of anyone coming there from marshminster fell in with desire together went upstairs parted on threshold of room be five six door away from mine lock door said a parted what do think will be murdered in sleep like inn dislike face of strent landlord besides continued tapping briarfield breast that girl rose what about know miss bellin goodnight with departed notwithstanding desire for explanation of last word so wearied be that despite suspicion of inn speedily fell asleep chapter ii sequel to adventure at inn be close on ten o'clock when awoke next morning long tramp of previous day have tired more than thought nevertheless be annoyed at oversleeping astonished that francis have not called earlier knew how anxious be about proposed meeting with brother fancied that impatience must have drawn to room at dawn apparently be le curious concerning interview than thought yet leaving out of question ought certainly to have be roused by strent daughter determined to reprove for such neglect after inn be inn one have right to attention for one pay judging from landlord look did not think bill must err on side of cheapness thought passed through mind a hastily dressed opening window looked out on marsh golden in sunshine keen wind be blowing from sea smell of brine struck into heavy atmosphere of bedroom absolute stillness prevailed inside out felt a though have awakened in spellbound palace of sleeping beauty inn of place must be full of bustle noise there be something uncanny in silence reigned in marsh locked hostel hinted trouble felt uneasy in very good temper descended to dining room with intention of apologizing to francis for tardy appearance of rating landlord for negligence to astonishment francis anyone else be seen room be in precisely same condition a on previous night fire be unlighted table not set out for breakfast even window blind be down for moment be sick with apprehension a be impossible to conjecture reason of neglect absence of human life stillness be a absolute a have prevailed upstairs when rang bell echoed throughout house a though mocking effort to summon landlord maid friend twice thrice pulled bell rope without result then somewhat unnerved by silence in found went to back part of premise here condition of thing be same a in dining room kitchen be empty be there sign of fire of food explored whole of ground floor found nobody conclusion forced upon that strent daughter have left inn during night be meaning of sudden flight what reason must be sufficiently powerful to force to vacate premise asking question entered room after room in none of did find answer front door be bolted barred back entrance be in same condition there be key in lock considered feature of case saw that air be full of mystery perhaps of in lonely house must not bring to utter terrible word knew not what have happened during sleep felt certain that event have taken place otherwise there must be reason for state of thing almost against will searched house again must discover strent daughter rose be alone in house francis francis said repeating thought aloud aye francis wonder if have left inn also whether have overslept be still in room to make sure went upstairs to bedroom pray observe that time have not connected thing with crime be true have faint suspicion that there might possibly be foul play a there be nothing to confirm belief abandoned idea declare that when knocked at door of briarfield room have more idea of horrid truth than babe unborn premonition pointed to mystery not to murder yet from conversation of previous night might have guessed what have happened house be a accursed a palace of artid ate bided on threshold stone not until have thrice knocked without receiving answer did suspicion begin to form then took shape in instant tried door be locked ominous silence still hinted at unspeakable horror knocking echoed jarringly through stillness at moment there flashed before eye picture of two figure flying across red horizon against blackened beam of gallows be shadow of future knocked called name finally in desperation at continued silence set shoulder against crazy door yielded with tearing sound entered room amid cloud of fine dust be lying on bed stiff cold have need to call to touch shoulder to place hand on heart be dead with clothes drawn up smoothly to chin lay man with whom have conversed previous night right arm lay outside counterpane on hand glistened pearl ring looked at bauble glanced at waxen face matter be beyond doubt francis briarfield be dead before must further examine body room be forced to run for brandy flask for moment be deadly sick needed long draft of fiery spirit to speed stagnating blood through vein strange circumstance be sufficient apology for such qualmishness lonely inn set on hand breadth of living ground amid quaking bog dead body of what have once be friend solitude by found environed be sufficient to shake strongest nerve look in manner prosaic on black white think of horror of actual experience for moment must formulate idea on subject that friend must be dead be sufficient to stun when reason came back asked how died who be responsible for crime landlord maid brother one of three have murdered francis briarfield in what way examined body be clothed in nightgown clothes lay folded up on chair by bedside face be calm there be mark of violence on throat on frame only on violet lip lingered slight curl of foam smooth bedclothes drawn up to chin forbade idea of struggle looked at right arm lying on counterpane at hand there in palm be ragged wound from thumb to little finger be discolored at edge looked green unwholesome livid appearance made think of poison be not sufficiently doctor to diagnose case correctly yet be certain of one thing francis briarfield have come by death in foul fashion at hand of whom aye there be rub so far a knew landlord have motive to commit crime suspicion pointed toward maid who have wished to speak with dead man after supper yet why must desire death from lip of francis have heard that knew strent rose indeed aught of fen inn hither have be brought by brother letter to keep appointment be a ignorant of inn of inmate of surroundings a must felix have committed crime true if theory be correct have passed off to olivia bellin a francis there be ground for believing wished brother out of way francis must undoubtedly refuse to permit deception to be carried on so be just possible that felix in frenzy of wrath terror at idea of treachery being exposed might have slain brother yet fine theory be upset by fact that felix have not arrived on previous night to keep appointment therefore must be guiltless if so what of landlord daughter certainly have reason to slay stranger who have sheltered under roof for night yet flight looked suspicious if be innocent why did leave inn question pregnant with meaning be reason of being alone in inn have seen servant indoors out father daughter appeared to do work yet be beyond reason that must have assistance where be cook waiter hostler chambermaid house be large one two people with will in world must not thoroughly attend to domestic economy of so great mansion moreover girl have looked unused to work in be suspicious can be thought can be that two hired inn to compass death of francis briarfield that be drawn here a into snare by brother letter on face of look absurd yet in what other way can explain absence of servant mildewed aspect of room now francis be dead without word to have departed must not solve mystery far from doing so more thought more examined surroundings deeper grew mystery door have be locked must find key window also be locked even have not be one must have entered thereby so considerable be height from ground how then have assassin gained admittance yet sure be that briarfield have be murdered by whom be hard to say nay impossible did indeed think that have committed suicide be too wild idea to entertain even for moment when parted from on previous night be in best of health looking forward to meeting miss bellin be passably content with life there be hint of self destruction either in speech action thought that brother have deceived must not have engendered idea rather be determined to unmask traitor regain promised wife by force murder might be suicide be out of question thus far threshed out matter yet arrived at logical conclusion a there seemed sign of landlord maid behooved to consider what must do according to francis brother be due at meeting place that morning so deemed advisable to wait until arrived then explain circumstance to if be in league with strent to murder brother must hardly be able to disguise joy at hearing success of plot therefore determined to watch face during interview if saw therein sign of guilt to there then in lonely inn accuse a second cain by thus terrorizing soul with such accusation with sight of victim might force into confession if be guilty guessed plea behind must shelter that have not be near place on previous night must counter by accusation that emissary have carried out order then sought safety in flight might be that suspected felix wrongly yet after story told by francis must not think be connected in unseen way with death of latter after suspicion be yet vague aimless knew for certain be that francis briarfield be dead swore on instant to devote to finding out punishing detestable assassin having come to resolution propped up open door so a to close entrance to chamber of death descended to lower region finding victual fuel in kitchen cooked meal made sufficiently good breakfast then lighted pipe took seat at front door to watch for coming of felix briarfield whether suspicion must be dispelled confirmed by demeanor be of course unable to say until interview took place be most anxious to know that morning looked down winding road to marshminster saw one coming therefrom not soul be in sight if did for moment think that strent daughter might return declare innocent thought be banished by few hour outlook inn a said before be on slight rise must see far wide human being be to be seen a hour passed grew almost horrified at gruesome solitude to be alone with dead body in lonely house in lonely moor be hardly healthy for mind toward noon took resolution if said mountain wo come to mahomet why then mahomet must go to mountain interpretation of be intended to see felix briarfield at bellin hall marshminster face to face with must force to explain why have not kept appointment seemed to suspicious circumstance perhaps strent have told francis be dead therefore must be useless for to ride to fen inn if be so must go long way toward implicating in crime re entered house locked up everything strapping on knapsack took departure toward marshminster way down road looked back at ruin saw loom more grim ghastly than ever even in bright sunshine must not appear otherwise than eerie be with great pleasure left behind yet under sloping roof francis briarfield lay dead be to discover assassin to avenge death that set face toward marshminster chapter iii felix francis late in afternoon tramped into marshminster be by mean first visit to sleepy provincial town under shadow of cathedral tower dwelt relative with whom have aforetime spent school college holiday house be goal of pilgrimage week rest be to recoup for toil of walking tour tragic occurrence at fen inn altered plan with assassin to be tracked there be time for comfortable idleness francis briarfield have be friend owed to memory to avenge death be easy task have set recognized that from first in place therefore of seeking center of town maiden aunt turned off at outskirt made for bellin hall according to story of francis brother be staying with bellins be necessary must see at once about matter acquaintance with mr bellin daughter be confined to casual conversation at crowded at home during season have hardly right to thrust on uninvited business brooked of delay sooner felix knew truth better must be for if be guilty must punish for crime by denouncing at once to authority if innocent need lose time in hunting down who have slain brother besides wished to put olivia on guard against man masquerading a francis briarfield intended to do in case whether be innocent guilty bellin hall be grotesque specimen of architecture built by jeremiah bellin who have made money out of blacking be uncommonly like factory perhaps deceased jeremiah liked something to remind of origin of fortune keep from thinking ancestor came over with conqueror married daughter of baronet then took departure to next world leaving widow well provided for daughter heiress in own right mr bellin be pretty woman with brain giggling laugh daughter have beauty of mother brain of father so be altogether charming girl how must tolerate silly dolly of mother must never understand perhaps twenty three year of constant forbearance have inured to trial on arriving at front door learned that mr briarfield be within sent up card requesting private interview for present did not wish to see olivia a be intention to warn felix be cognizant of trickery theory be proved correct by following dialogue be mr briarfield within footman yes sir mr francis briarfield have just returned from town after question answer be shown into room observe said mr briarfield footman answered mr francis briarfield now a well knew that man bearing name be lying dead at fen inn be conclusive proof felix to gain hand of olivia be masquerading a brother have just argued out to complete satisfaction when felix made appearance resemblance between brother be extraordinary have difficulty in persuading that man before be not whom have seen dead that morning same pale face dark hair jaunty mustache same gesture same gravity of demeanor actually same tone in voice there be not slightest difference between felix francis one duplicated other no longer wondered that olivia be deceived despite acquaintance with brother must have be tricked a be stared open mouthed at young man be pleasant surprise denham said looking anxiously at did not know be in part of world be until yesterday be on walking tour last night slept at fen inn fen inn repeated with slight start what took to out of way place came by marsh a be belated have to take shelter offered man alive said felix raising eyebrow inn be empty time be turn to be astonished if felix thought inn be empty why did appoint a meeting place for brother knew too much too little so behooved to conduct conversation with utmost dexterity be not empty last night at event retorted keeping eye fixed on face indeed be gypsy encamped there said coolly well not exactly answered emulating calm be in charge of man called strent daughter be news to be always under impression that fen inn be quite deserted have not be near lately nobody go near say be haunted pshaw answered angrily old wife tale yet added after moment thought may well be haunted after what took place there last night begin to grow interesting said felix have adventure yes met with brother impossible brother felix be in paris be talking of francis francis repeated with disagreeable smile francis well denham be francis think be making mistake briarfield said coldly brother francis slept at fen inn last night slept in house quite believe that be felix oh said briarfield bursting into harsh laugh see be making inevitable mistake of mixing up with brother be pardonable under circumstance otherwise might resent plain speaking assurance of man be so complete that wondered if knew that secret be safe by death of brother such knowledge must account for complacency yet be quite impossible that must know of death a certainly have not be to inn knew that from own knowledge if be francis said slowly be engaged to miss bellin be answered haughtily by what right one moment mr briarfield miss bellin gave lover francis pearl ring see on finger glanced down at hand grew confused lost muttered lost time ago be not true do dare to dare anything in connection with what know to be fraud be passing off a brother francis by what right do make mad assertion from what francis told last night tell be francis said savagely know own name if be man assert to be where be pearl ring lost did not never have saw on finger of francis no later than last night think be mad denham said felix white with passion else must be talking of felix who be in paris that untruth will not serve said coldly felix be before francis be lying dead at fen inn what francis dead cried unguardedly ah admit be francis no retorted quickly only re echoed word what do mean by saying thing for answer rose from seat made for door farce wearied where be going denham asked following up for police answered facing yes be determined to find out mystery of francis briarfield death brother decline to help so will place matter in hand of authority upon soul denham said felix detaining be mad drunk declare most solemnly that be francis briarfield from story of yours must think be brother felix who be dead did not know be in paris fine story doe not impose on answered scoffingly listen to briarfield brother francis went out to south america six month ago before went be engaged to miss mother must not hear of marriage so engagement be kept quiet alone knew of took advantage of such knowledge to suppress letter sent to miss bellin through by francis represent to olivia a lover returned three month before time quite believe be supposed to be in paris so that may more easily carry out game be mere raving be truth know a miss bellin did not answer letter francis thought something be wrong returned home afraid lest must find out plot asked to meet at fen inn there either intended to throw on mercy to murder murder repeated fiercely be false will be for police to determine surely denham intend to inform police be going to do so now felix seized by arm dragged back to seat be now much agitated made effort to restrain emotion sit down said in hoarse tone do wrong denham on soul do wrong be engaged be engaged to olivia bellin mother consented to engagement after returned to england three month ago felix believe be in paris know whom met at inn last night be not must not have be felix there be appointment between be not masquerading a francis because be francis believe must can bring forward witness to prove identity may be misled by resemblance remember francis be twin said before say again be mad cried roughly casting off who ever heard of appointment being made at ruined inn one have lived there for month anyone in marshminster will tell so strent daughter rose began when cut short who be never heard of be figment of dream went into ruined inn last night dreamed believe story not one word said felix coolly looking straight in face then believe one word of yours cried jumping up let place matter in hand of authority see who will be believed what be going to say denham say that francis briarfield have died in fen inn wo believe that be francis said evidently making resolve be felix one moment said going to door will prove identity in manner will admit of denial with vanished waited to see what further evidence must bring forward to back up imposture chapter iv olivia evidence here be doubt that felix intended to continue passing off a francis for how long be uncertain perhaps for rest of natural life until made olivia wife in latter event must reveal fraud with impunity revert to own identity must not help thinking that have be informed beforehand of death of brother else must not have dared to keep up imposture with possible revelation so near at hand even assuming such ignorance have now told of death myself so strengthened position regretted have not be more cautious be curious to see whom must bring forward a witness to identity scarcely olivia a if once have suspicion of truth must never rest until be cleared up to satisfaction hardly thought felix must run risk more so a story of losing pearl ring must not stand against assertion that be on finger of dead man if still persisted in declaring to be francis determined that must ride with to fen inn there see corpse of man whose name have so shamelessly assumed must surely settle matter felix be bolder than gave credit for a witness proved to be none other than olivia bellin entered room with assumed lightness face be anxious glanced now then at felix a though to seek aid countenance a be natural wore haggard expression nerve be tensioned up to highest pitch matter of small wonderment seeing that life happiness depended upon interview what be strange story bring mr denham asked olivia greeting coldly in best day be never overfriendly have not mr briarfield told have not have time interposed felix quickly beyond few hint of truth know nothing not even that be felix briarfield felix repeated miss bellin in surprise be making mistake mr denham be francis so say see olivia said briarfield addressing miss bellin denham insists upon taking for brother felix how absurd assure mr denham felix be in paris only received letter from morning impossible said taken aback by authority of tone be quite true continued hurriedly excuse for moment will fetch letter must believe evidence of own eye when left room felix turned toward with gleam of triumph in eye be convinced asked mockingly be puzzled in what way to think how managed to get that letter sent on from paris without being there against stupidity god fight in vain quoth felix shrugging shoulder assure that brother felix be in paris miss bellin be about to produce letter received from only morning yet insist that be not that whom pretend to be be dead be mad here be letter said miss bellin entering at moment see bear date of yesterday be at present staying at htel de trangers rue de st honor talk of going to italy examined letter closely be genuine enough of that there be doubt a bore french english postmark quite believed that be written by felix also that have be forwarded from paris by emissary of young man in order to keep up needful deception certainly felix have marked talent for intrigue if felix briarfield be in paris said handing back letter to olivia who be met at fen inn last night fen inn replied olivia with puzzled look why one life there now mr denham be in ruin have be empty for over two year nevertheless be tenanted last night slept there

francis briarfield single glance will give lie to assertion of man who pretend to be lover felix looked at olivia at seemed to that grew shade paler wondered whether guilty bond existed between a certainly seemed to understand one very well olivia appeared anxious to protect felix from harm really believed to be francis have taken heart from one brother given to other be who spoke first in throughout interview woman played more daring game than did man attitude puzzled for moment be quite in dark a to what be real thought regarding story that of pseudo francis can not go to night said with hesitation tomorrow morning if like will ride out to inn glanced at watch be now five o'clock said will be light up to nine thereabouts there be plenty of time for to ride to fen inn think advisable to do so at once why not to morrow morning objected felix great heaven briarfield have natural affection tell that brother be lying dead there ca understand necessity of attending to so serious matter without delay if have affection might at least have decency decline to believe that brother be dead said briarfield coolly that letter shown to by olivia prof that be in paris yesterday

olivia mean that francis returned from chili few day ago went to fen inn by appointment in order to hear explanation of felix what explanation reason of felix passing off a francis be utterly mistaken mr denham swear that be francis man to whom be engaged can wish for stronger proof asked felix with marked intention of insulting paid attention to sneer turned round to miss bellin asked pertinent

marshminster be kept by bob fundy bow legged little man who have be jockey in youthful day who be great friend of mine expressed great joy at reappearance in marshminster mounted on best of steed be in too great hurry to exchange more than few word with genial old fellow set out at once for bellin hall later on regretted haste a few word of explanation from fundy must have saved much money long journey at ten o'clock be at park gate felix olivia have not yet put in appearance intended to denounce felix a murderer in presence of brother dead body to tell miss bellin of friendship with rose strent jealousy if nothing else might make guess truth prevent felix carrying on shameless imposture in now indulged so insolently once proved identity of dead man by mean of pearl ring olivia must recognize hoped to make short work of pretension of felix be difficult task be now seized with what be known a detective fever determined to run assassin to earth name firmly believed be edward strent that felix be accomplice be questionable whether rose strent have taken active part in commission of crime in few minute saw riding down avenue looked handsome couple sighed to think how outward appearance of felix belied foul spirit olivia looked remarkably beautiful managed horse to perfection a drew near noted haggard look a though have passed night without sleep again thought flashed through mind that there might be understanding between however much olivia knew felt sure be ignorant that francis have be done to death by brother else even must have recoiled from so base scoundrel here be see said felix defiantly a raised hat to miss bellin quite ready to set out on wildgoose chase be afraid will find more serious than think briarfield at event wo find that body speak of be certain will mr felix briarfield still insist that francis be felix said olivia a rode on together be absolutely certain of what about interposed felix reining up horse handing telegram olivia received morning glanced at telegram be from felix in paris to olivia at marshminster stated that be going to italy in few day hoped to return for wedding handed back without remark struck a strange that such matter must have be sent by wire instead of by post telegram to mind be only move in game felix be playing so boldly well denham said restoring to pocket see by telegram that felix be in paris if so must be francis in case said looking at keenly who be dead man at fen inn there be none there answered jestingly yet with lurking anxiety be quick to note have third brother be twin not triplet vouchsafed reply to witticism judged to be in bad taste rode on rapidly by time have left town far behind be way on winding road crossed marsh miss bellin evidently did not desire to talk for pushed forward well in front a felix also relapsed into silence rode on smartly without uttering word more dismal riding party never saw keen wind brought touch of color into pale cheek of olivia have dark circle under eye looked considerably worried felix rode by side addressed now then be too far in rear to know what said felt anything comfortable while in company a regarded with great disfavor never mind thought touching horse with whip once bring felix face to face with dead brother will be forced to abandon air at cost must tear mask off if only for sake of poor girl who belief so firmly in such villain there be change in appearance of fen inn a rode up to save that looked more ruinous than ever solitary building have sinister aspect even in bright sunshine hinted at secret murder noticed how thick grew grass round house thereby marking more strongly desertion desolation sure enough have not be inhabited for considerable period fact alone roused suspicion a to motif of strent daughter must have good design in staying in so haggard dwelling see inn be ruin said olivia pointing toward with riding whip one must find shelter there even for one night did miss bellin be dream answered idle dream may have slept there never met francis within wall be on fool errand said felix derisively thought so all along come see said dismounting at door of inn laugh best who laugh last seemed to that olivia made a though to turn horse head away from house by time hand of felix be already on bridle rein suppressed momentary inclination to flee action revived suspicion with half sigh dismounted with aid of felix entered house be a have left blind be down room mildewed desolate fireplace filled with heap of gray ash olivia drew riding skirt closely round shuddered led upstairs to room of francis here door have fallen down walked on into room to surprise bed be empty well denham said felix after pause where be dead body to whom have given name someone have be here taken away think so absence of body only prof truth of what said from first dreamed adventure before must reply olivia burst into hysterical tear strain on nerve be very great now that climax be reached broke down utterly felix took in arm soothed a best must while utterly bewildered by turn event have taken carefully searched room be in vain must find body clothes aught pertaining to francis briarfield began to think to myself must be dreaming be out of question only conclusion must come to be that strent have watched leave house then returned to make away with body without doubt be strent who have slain unfortunate friend now have hidden corpse in quaking bog when olivia broke down felix led from room went to front door there to find mounted on horse be going back to marshminster said felix gathering up rein thanks to wildgoose chase miss bellin be quite ill trust now sir that be convinced be not convinced that be francis answered doggedly still think be felix asked with sneer withstanding disappearance of body have be made away with by strent firmly believe that francis be dead that be felix briarfield a have seen nothing mr denham said miss bellin coldly must decline to believe statement gentleman be francis felix be in paris very good said quietly then leave for paris to morrow for what reason go to seek felix say be in paris say be now before on horse came to fen inn found body miss bellin go to paris to htel de trangers will wager that will find felix looked at one in silence for few moment remark evidently scared be going to put matter in hand of police asked felix be useless to do so now a body of brother have disappeared will go to paris if find felix there well said seeing hesitated will tell police have neighborhood searched said concluding sentence olivia laughed scornfully rode away while felix preparing to follow uttered last word consult doctor denham at once be mad subject to hallucination with set off at smart trot be left alone at door of inn after extraordinary experience have undergone began to think there might be something in what said nevertheless determined for own satisfaction to go to paris see if felix briarfield be at htel de trangers if be not then suspicion might prove to be correct if be then might believe that adventure at inn be dream chapter vi man in paris having made up mind what course to pursue returned to marshminster took leave of relative left that evening for london there remained two day reviewing strange event in have lately be actor at one moment be in mind to abandon what certainly seemed to be hopeless search for must not see be matter of great difficulty to lay hand on assassin of francis must be better thought to place matter in hand of police let thrash out for two reason prevented taking ignoble course one be that francis briarfield have be college friend be unwilling that death must go unavenged story of love for olivia have told at inn contained element of strange romance fitly capped by tragic end felt certain that felix through hired bravo for must call strent by other name have encompassed death of brother felix be passionately in love with olivia unexpected return of francis not only threatened to take away from also to reveal scoundrelly fashion in have behaved at one blow felix must lose love respect therefore motive for averting catastrophe be strong one that must determine on fratricide be terrible thought there be other course left to by to secure woman loved respect valued be mad action of weak passionate man such a knew felix to be too cowardly to strike fatal blow have hired strent to carry out plan death have be duly accomplished though in what way be quite unable to say be sufficient for to know francis be dead felt called upon to avenge death other motive be perhaps stronger one of detective fever be bachelor have good income nothing to do therefore quest be one of great interest to have often hunted beast man hunt be much more powerful incentive to excitement must hardly sleep for thinking of case be constantly engaged in piecing together puzzle a yet have clear clew to follow first thing to be settled be identity of felix at marshminster with felix at paris once established that point proved conclusively that felix have never left england must be in position to prosecute search in neighborhood of marshminster own that there be additional reason in pique felt at scornful disbelief of olivia evidently considered story pure fiction strange disappearance of corpse from inn confirmed in belief irritated by such contempt be resolved to bring home crime to felix to prove conclusively to that be masquerading a lover dead francis must be cruel blow when assured of truth be better that must suffer temporary pain to dragging out lifelong agony chained to man whom knew to be profligate liar murderer at end of two day confirmed in resolution to hunt down criminal decided a first step to go to paris leaving victoria by night mail arrived in french capital next morning anxious to lose further time hastened at once to htel de trangers in rue de st honor there took up quarter recovered from fatigue of journey partook of luncheon then made inquiry about felix briarfield to surprise not only discovered that be in paris that be in hotel at moment have be staying here for length of time asked manager for six week monsieur now talk of going to italy be astonishing reply to say be surprised must give faint idea of what felt that assertion of olivia must thus prove true be almost impossible of belief if felix be here have be here for past six week must not possibly be whom have met at marshminster assuming to be case who be man of fen inn who called francis head be whirling with endeavor to grapple with thought suddenly idea flashed into brain might possibly account for mystery can be thought that be felix whom met at inn felix who tried to pas off a francis then invented that lying story perhaps be not dead a thought merely plunged into trance when revived seeing uselessness of fighting with francis fled back to paris time stared hard at manager in reality be puzzling out mystery not paying attention to man before however grew weary under regard moved uneasily mr briarfield be now in room monsieur will take to card if please answered mechanically handed to in few moment waiter came with message stating that mr briarfield must be glad to see followed man in state of utmost bewilderment found in presence of felix before knew what to say do be so like francis whom thought be lying dead at fen inn so like man who passed a olivia lover that for moment must hing stare at yet must be of two for one be dead other have left behind at marshminster how be denham said somewhat surprised at strange conduct why do stare so steadily at be felix briarfield gasped out a see answered raising eyebrow surely know well enough to dispense with so foolish question brother be at marshminster believe with miss bellin to whom be engaged why do ask so strange question sat down on sofa buried face in hand be out of mind victim of horrible hallucination certainly have met francis at inn beheld dead under roof a surely have seen man believed to be felix at marshminster yet here in paris beheld individual who be dead friend living lover called felix briarfield must be mad must be mad be must say for moment what be matter denham asked briarfield touching shoulder be ill for answer seized first one hand then other on appeared least scratch yet man whom believed to be francis have ragged wound on right hand theory of trance vanished into thin air at proof that men be distinct astounded by action felix drew back in alarm how strangely act denham said uneasily be there anything wrong do think be mad asked irritably action just now be scarcely act of sane person why did examine hand to see if be cut in way turned palm of hand toward shook head with slight laugh see said smiling be absolutely free from cut wound why do expect to be marred made reply passed hand across brow situation in found be so strange embarrassing did not know how to proceed in presence of fact must not admit that story must sound wild invention come denham said briarfield soothingly be doubtless in trouble have come to for help advice will give to best of ability want muttered in low voice if will answer question wish to ask will oblige greatly briarfield drew back with queer look in eye a if thought madness be increasing however overcame dread action apparently caused answered civilly enough certainly if will do good what be wish to know be in england within last seven day have not be in england for at least six week do know fen inn never heard of in life be acquainted with girl named rose strent even know name when did brother francis return to england from south america three month ago have seen since return frequently in london be now believe at marshminster do know be engaged to miss bellin of course do said briarfield marriage take place shortly be to be best man be if return in time what do mean well be going to italy tomorrow said young man shrugging shoulder be just possible may prolong tour to east in case may be absent from england for at least six month more during time francis will doubtless marry olivia will not be able to be at wedding have not be to england within last six week know fen inn of existence of rose strent summed up then be victim of extraordinary hallucination be very extraordinary altogether retorted briarfield now have answered question pray answer mine why do ask thing be strange story one will scarcely believe let hear thus adjured told story of adventure at inn suppressed mention of belief then entertained that brother have changed name listened attentively eyed with concern at conclusion of narrative considered for few moment before making reply hardly know what to say said at length story be very circumstantial yet must have be deceived by chance resemblance swear that man met at fen inn be brother francis how can that be when francis be at bellin hall olivia said have not be out of house besides say man whom believed to be francis be murdered yet left francis alive well at marshminster thought francis be ah deceived by resemblance doubt yes think so replied not wishing to tell of suspicion well see made mistake francis be at marshminster be here suppose added jokingly be quite convinced that be felix be quite convinced other man be francis great heaven man surely doubt that be felix briarfield cried irritably rising to foot ca perhaps thought be whom met at inn because man met at inn be dead besides have wound on right hand have not be queer business altogether said briarfield walking to fro can not agree with idea of hallucination tell be too real for hallucination then how can explain demanded sharply pausing before ca explain replied helplessly if have discovered corpse when returned to inn there might be chance of solving mystery admit there be corpse there not vestige of one then prof thing to be hallucination said triumphantly if man be murdered who must take trouble to remove corpse strent might have done so to conceal evidence of crime fled previous night by own acknowledgment whole thing be ridiculous if be denham must see doctor brain of yours be in dangerous state in spite of say be certain be francis met at inn how can that be when whom met be dead francis be alive must not be francis a have not be out of paris must not have be then who be stranger doubt in whom saw facial resemblance to impossible so think said briarfield significantly for part think be subject to delusion pursue case friend may find in lunatic asylum will come over to marshminster help to solve mystery certainly not denham plan be made for italy go there to morrow certainly intend to put off for wildgoose chase a wish to indulge in took up hat prepared to go matter be beyond comprehension there be nothing for to return to england do said briarfield in pitying tone give up following will o ' wisp seems hopeless enough well so far a can see seems madness nothing more le brother francis be at marshminster see here so be absolutely impossible must have met of at inn more so a man met be dead be alive yes fact be too strong for said holding out hand good by briarfield many thanks for kindness oh man added with burst of bitterness what doe mean be hallucination said briarfield place at once in hand of doctor chapter vii link in chain of evidence after interview with felix returned forthwith to london have accomplished object of journey did not care about staying longer in paris mind be much perturbed a be quite unable to come to conclusion respecting episode at fen inn beyond doubt have proved that francis be at marshminster felix in paris who then be man whom have met at inn be impossible must be mistaken in identity of college friend yet in face of such evidence a have gathered be ridiculous to cling to first impression there must not be three brother exactly alike in personal appearance yet have beheld three men at fen inn at marshminster in paris who resembled other in respect more pondered over mystery deeper did become more confused grew brain began to think be victim of hallucination a must explain matter in other way with idea be only feasible one left to took advice of felix on return to town went to see dr merrick specialist on disease of brain listened to story with great attention questioned closely on point there be trickery about mr denham said after consideration then think meeting with francis briarfield be hallucination asked eagerly there be hallucination about sir be comforting response seem to a sane matter of fact person a have ever met then if be not hallucination how do account for having met three men exactly alike when know there be only two with special appearance in existence think be trickery repeated merrick nursing chin be more case for detective than for doctor be mr denham must employ good detective probe mystery thoroughly matter seems miraculous to now feel sure when learn solution will be astonished at simplicity if be sane a say a believe to be will thrash out matter better get trained man mr denham from what have told see have to deal with criminal of ordinary intelligence be extraordinary case mused doctor wonder at fascination seems to exercise over be in place be in place seeing hesitated here be setting up for lawyer said merrick quaintly to tell honest truth mr denham have inoculated with detective fever must like to solve problem criminal investigation have always be rather hobby of mine in business meet with queer experience there be more insane people in world than think tell idea doctor will carry out report progress good will be sleeping partner said in amused tone warn mr denham that from what see of case will be one of great difficulty may take month to work out mind that be nothing to idle man like be afraid dr merrick take up valuable time oh can spare few minute said doctor quickly work hard enough so be permitted to even professional man to indulge occasionally in amusement case be so to well idea in first place be inclined to agree with idea of felix passing off a francis have abandoned that idea said dolefully saw felix in paris wait moment replied merrick will come to later on furthermore believe be felix met at marshminster felix who called francis posed a lover of miss bellin saw in paris said again clinging to undeniable fact know did pretended francis of marshminster real felix of paris be one same person mean that followed over cried suddenly enlightened precisely suborned manager of htel de trangers why must do ca see said merrick impatiently felix want to put stop to following up case from story be quite probable that killed brother through strent whole circumstance of lone inn be very suspicious unforeseen arrival night complicated matter saw how unwilling be to admit have not arrived francis must have vanished from world none must have be bit wiser when came to bellin hall felix saw new source of danger not only to character to life asked for night grace during night went to fen inn hid corpse in boghole impossible will stake life that be so said merrick calmly make inquiry a to movement of felix briarfield on night will lay anything will find went to fen inn that then said be reason be so ready to go there next morning with exactly knew well thanks to forethought that there be evidence there to convict of crime must still keep up imposture so far be in favor obstinacy raised new danger said must go to paris satisfy of existence of felix now then remained two day in london yes be not quite sure whether be worth while carrying on matter be pity wasted so much time said merrick for felix took advantage of negligence to slip over to paris lay trap for in plain word disappeared from marshminster a francis reappeared in paris a felix might have done so think must have guessed identity of one with other how must said doctor when twin be alike in respect moreover firmly believed olivia bellin lover be in marshminster if go down at once to marshminster will detect absence of felix so guess what have taken place if go down to marshminster will find felix back again in old place then paris queried uneasily be beginning to see have be duped forget mr felix of paris have gone to italy left address be safe there a said be going to east for six month so there will be plenty of time for pretended francis to marry olivia believe that felix of paris have gone to italy east of course not believe arranged matter to baffle prying then calmly returned to marshminster manager of hotel be in pay of felix will get nothing out of now be certain be explanation be not surprised at simplicity yes be be astonishing never thought of before columbus egg once again said merrick grimly well what be going to do next to drive to marshminster find out movement of felix on night after murder quite so first satisfy on subject of francis what do mean asked what day of month be at fen inn continued merrick on th of june good francis there told that have just arrived from chili now find out what boat came by look up name in passenger list ascertain date on true francis arrived in england point established can prove false francis to be impostor excellent idea said starting to foot will see about at once mind said merrick raising forefinger expect to be kept fully advised of case never fear doctor be excellent at solving puzzle when find nut will bring to to crack do take great interest in sort of case ought to have be lawyer instead of doctor be thankful for own sake be latter said shaking hand good by doctor be greatly obliged for kind interest have taken in case pure selfishness assure replied merrick so took leave before searching shipping list sent two telegram one to manager of htel de trangers asking if mr felix briarfield be still there other to aunt jane inquiring whether mr francis briarfield be in marshminster business having be dispatched took hansom to city saw merchant of acquaintance be old friend willing to oblige in way chamber said when in office want to find out ship arrived in london from chili during present month during june said chamber well there be difficulty about what be name be one of thing wish to find out also name of passenger come with to jerusalem said chamber picking up hat will find there name agent go to agent will supply with list of passenger what be up now nothing particular answered carelessly have reason to believe friend of mine returned from south america month want to make certain well if came under own name will have difficulty in doing so here be jerusalem be well known be shipping club for convenience of merchant tell about ingoing outgoing vessel give information regarding cargo in fact supply kind of knowledge useful to who have argosy afloat chamber be well acquainted with mode of procedure so let do work be now th of june a francis have informed have arrived during month there be not much difficulty in finding what wanted here be said chamber beckoning to only one ship month from chili steamer copiapo arrived on th of june dane paxton devereux lane copied down in notebook refused chamber hospitable invitation to luncheon went off at once to devereux lane here have difficulty in seeing passenger list of copiapo one of first name set eye on be francis briarfield put matter beyond doubt said making note of if francis briarfield did not arrive in london till th of month can not be man now bearing name at bellin hall be now perfectly satisfied that merrick idea be correct in order to confuse throw off scent felix have followed to paris appeared in propria persona for doctor suggestion of shipping list must not have be able to prove now held incontrovertible evidence in hand to prove felix be trading on marvelous resemblance between brother francis have arrived in england on th of june have met at fen inn on th have there be foully done to death by brother through third party be now on trail hoped to run to earth unnatural brother vile tool felt like hero of wild romance on returning to room in duke street wrote off at once to merrick telling of success in proving identity of francis with man who have be slain at lone inn now remained for to go down to marshminster there make inquiry a to movement of felix on night in question felt confident that must pursue search without hindrance a must be quite satisfied must now rest after paris episode man in sens must search for dead man when man have be conclusively proved to be alive so felix doubtless thought rejoiced in cleverness in thus putting end to inquiry mark how ironical be fate felix advised to consult doctor about hallucination a chose to call took that advice saw merrick merrick have nullified plan by solving riddle with felix be trying to baffle be hard on felix to thus be mean of pointing way to own destruction then fate be so ironical that afternoon received answer to telegram first from paris stated that mr felix briarfield have started for italy second from marshminster informed that francis briarfield be staying at bellin hall said on reading telegram felix briarfield did not leave paris for italy for marshminster francis briarfield poor soul be not at bellin hall lying in essex marsh that night at five o'clock left for marshminster chapter viii clew to mystery drama of prodigal son be enacted over again when returned to marshminster aunt have greatly resented sudden departure to paris announced that time intended to keep for week have objection to arrangement a anticipated long laborious task in ferreting out evidence against felix first thing to be done be to learn have taken place in absence information be ably supplied by aunt jane seconded by sister inquired about briarfield fiance bellin hall be to be shut up next week said aunt jane bellins be going to town with mr briarfield wonder stayed here so long when season be on in london said aunt sophia be that foolish mr bellin chose to consider ill so insisted upon remaining here now ca resist attraction of town life longer go next week have to arrange about wedding sophia know take place in july wonder if mr felix briarfield will be back in time to be best man can safely say be impossible said dryly why exclaimed old lady scenting news well have gone to italy from there go to east answered unwilling to tell truth see how can return in time for wedding if take place in july female relative looked significantly at one did tell sophia said aunt jane in tone of subdued triumph yes sister be right sighed sophia shaking head poor young man thought loved olivia who loved olivia asked sharply felix briarfield said aunt jane when brother went to america be always with doubt loved dearly can scarcely wonder at a be so beautiful girl behaved very well when francis came back went to continent be unable to bear sight of brother happiness said aunt sophia sentimentally poor poor young man have doubt heart be broken actually left marshminster before brother arrived from america so a to spare painful sight of happiness saw by conversation that surmise be correct felix have fallen in love with olivia while brother be in america selfishly determined not to give up have devised idea of passing off a francis with in mind have gone to paris pretended to stay there then reappeared at marshminster a francis alleging earlier return from chili a excuse when francis really returned felix asked to be at fen inn so a to rid of brother before must see olivia whether intended to kill francis to merely explain matter must not tell at event francis have be murdered firmly believed that felix be morally guilty of crime suppression of letter substitution of a francis dexterous manner in have rid of corpse according to merrick theory showed that have dangerous reckless man to deal with after clever way in have baffled in paris by resuming name be prepared for villainy at hand have committed so far that must not draw back be compelled to follow crime by crime in order to bolster up position be going to town with evident intention of evading doubtless thought that deceived by episode at htel de trangers have quite abandoned idea of meddling in affair for merrick must certainly have done so now that merrick saw matter in same light a did be determined to go on resolved to give hint of to felix when left marshminster must pursue inquiry at leisure already have be too rash in revealing intention for have not mentioned journey to paris felix must not have be put on guard baffled so adroitly have at least gained one important piece of information in be sufficient to break off match passenger list of copiapo proved conclusively that francis have not reached england before th of june shown to olivia must show that felix be passing off a lover with such proof must stop marriage immediately preferred to wait until gained further evidence implicating in murder of brother believed merrick theory to be true quite expected to find that felix have ridden out to fen inn for purpose of hiding brother body in one of bogholes by way asked aunt jane a parted for night how doe miss bellin look like happy bride eh by mean replied aunt solemnly look ill miserable know marriage with francis be love match must say disliked idea of becoming wife doubt thought doubt olivia mistrust felix already said good night to elderly relative went off to bed instead of turning in lighted pipe leaned out of window thinking deeply must be possible that olivia have discovered imposture if so why did tamely submit to marry man whom must know be guilty of brother lover death moreover if be assured of must also have condoned deception at htel de trangers conduct seemed strange yet must not bring to believe that knew truth if did be a bad a felix must think be really francis felix be in paris thought surely must not willingly go to altar with man whom know to be villain no have thrown dust in eye made believe what plea must save poor girl from such fate perhaps in spite of outward semblance instinctively feel that felix be not francis woman have instinct know of other reason why must look pale ill cogitation be cut short by aunt jane knocking at door telling not to waste candle be used to little idiosyncrasy of aunt so answered that be going to bed put out light at once rest of night be passed in wakeful state truly have bad attack of detective fever for next few day kept very quiet a be unwilling to rouse suspicion of felix at length aunt who entertained suspicion of design informed that have gone to london with mr miss bellin coast now being clear ventured out began to work out carefully laid plan in first place went to bob fundy to hire horse be intention to ride out to fen inn thoroughly examine room a fancied felix might have hidden corpse in house from fundy gained piece of unexpected information want to ride to fen inn sir said scratching head why come over old ruin everyone seems to be going there what do mean fundy first mr briarfield now said fundy blessed if can understand though to be sure rode there at night go in daytime did mr briarfield go to fen inn at night asked seeing be on eve of learning something important have not forgotten merrick theory that did sir rode there two night over week ago curious said with assumed carelessness be not attractive place dare say only rode little way out of town sir said fundy decisively went to fen inn told so a noticed horse be so done up look here added fundy opening day book see on th of june have horse on th at night did not return till midnight mounted horse rode away thinking deeply if felix have gone to fen inn on th then felt sure that have actually murdered brother hitherto have believed strent be guilty party now thanks to evidence of fundy saw that felix have committed crime have also ridden to inn again on th in order to conceal body merrick theory be thus proved to be correct link by link be putting chain together have proved that francis have not arrived in england till th of june so made certain of identity of felix have discovered that felix be at inn on fatal night also that have concealed body now wished to discover how murder be committed fen inn be quite deserted a evil looking a ever in spite of searching discovered sign of dead body of friend clothes have seen folded on chair beside bed be also gone there be not slightest thing left to excite suspicion must have hidden body in marsh thought after vain search will see if have left trail struck by feasibility of idea went out at front door examined ground be moist muddy owing to incessant percolation of marshy water path leading from marshminster be marked confusedly with horse hoof so be quite useless to look for trail in direction looking from door of inn path trended to right on left where there be path noticed hoof mark also that lush grass be trodden down here be trail said mounting horse took body to left following trail carefully be plainly discernible owing to dampness of ground rode straight out for considerable distance spongy marsh jetted black water under foot of horse seemed a though be in danger of being bogged nevertheless a trail still continued in front of followed where felix must go must follow have evidently placed body of brother across saddle ridden with in direction wondered at nerve of scoundrel unexpectedly trail turned off at right angle led toward broad pond of water slimy sullen in appearance on verge of track ceased then knew that saw before tomb of francis briarfield into black water murderer have hurled victim doubtless if pool be dragged body must be found determined to do before taking further step in matter then mr felix briarfield said riding back to inn then will see how much astuteness will avail be late in afternoon when got back to inn cold vapor of marsh made shiver a be subject to rheumatism be afraid of future suffering so having brandy in flask determined to light fire for purpose of heating water comforting with hot drink there be plenty of fuel about have match in pocket began to rake dead ash out of dining room grate when disturbed oblong piece of flint rattled on to earth idea of lighting fire be forgotten a stood with in hand be arrowhead handled gingerly for knew well that be steeped in poison that with francis have be murdered saw at once what have taken place felix have arrived have gone up to brother room holding flint with razorlike edge outward have shaken hand with brother so wounded quarrel have ensued francis not thinking be poisoned never dreamed of danger then have fallen dead felix placing body on bed have returned to dining room flung poisoned arrowhead into fire most astounding thing be have not be awakened by outcry of francis suppose be quite worn out by walk in too deep sleep nevertheless be strange that have heard arrival of felix struggle must have taken place possibly have be drugged with damning piece of evidence in pocket wrapped up in paper for feared poison rode back to marshminster wondering how felix have hit upon terribly ingenious fashion of removing brother so far a knew have not traveled much must not be likely to have savage weapon in possession yet must not have owned flint arrowhead in ordinary run of thing puzzled greatly returned horse to fundy without making remark thoroughly tired out went early to rest still puzzling over arrowhead before dawn solved mystery in entrance hall of bellins house perfect armory of savage weapon be arrayed against wall there be club arrow bow mat grinning heathen god doubtless felix knowing arrow to be poisoned have taken flint head of one in order to put brother to death a early a must went to bellin hall to satisfy on point hall be show place a possessed fine picture gallery so have little difficulty in gaining admission from woman in charge requesting permission to examine warriorlike implement patterned against hall wall narrowly observed arrow be a thought one of arrow be missing felix have stolen in order to kill brother did not take much interest in picture after discovery talk of housekeeper fell unheeded on ear finally gave sovereign left house impatient to be alone think over discovery have now sufficient evidence to prove that felix have killed francis quite sufficient to warrant having arrested if pool be dragged body must be found with ragged wound of flint arrowhead on right hand must prove finding of arrowhead in ash how have be taken from bellin hall fundy must give evidence to felix having taken horse to fen inn on th also on th altogether evidence against felix be clearly sufficient to hang still did nothing rashly before taking further proceeding returned to london to consult merrick advice knew must be judicious chapter ix surprise dr merrick be delighted to see again so speedily assured that have thought of nothing else lone inn crime peculiar circumstance of case fascinated greatly decidedly must be detective said laughingly have be inventing kind of theory in connection with matter by way idea of searching shipping list be good one excellent received letter did with much pleasure so francis did not arrive in england until th of june therefore be francis whom met at fen inn who be killed by brother be felix who now pass off to olivia bellin a francis doe not guess imposture so far a can see firmly belief felix to be francis be also right about hiding of corpse say so cried merrick highly delighted did felix ride out to fen inn hide body a surmised did have evidence of livery stable keeper to prove that hired horse on th did not return till midnight during time disposed of brother body precisely tracked horse hoof mark to pool wherein be convinced body lie hidden egad be wonderful man denham did have pool dragged for body not yet wish to tell discovery before doing so many thanks be so interested in case that be great pleasure for to follow step by step wish thanks from merrick said heartily be rather other way a reasoning have led to important discovery first that felix be in paris second that francis did not arrive from chili till month third that felix corpse by must never have discovered so much have made one most famous discovery yes be know how crime be committed by whom say so exclaimed merrick in much excitement have seen strent be not strent who killed francis briarfield mean to say be rose strent be felix merrick uttered ejaculation of surprise remained silent for few minute said that felix never came to inn on night objected so thought appears that be mistaken fundy livery stable keeper told that felix hired horse from on th th of june on occasion did not return till midnight now francis be murdered on th corpse disappeared on th felix be therefore responsible for murder concealment of body be purely circumstantial evidence laid down arrowhead on table be proof positive said triumphantly with piece of flint francis be killed really said merrick skeptically picking up arrowhead with clumsy instrument must have bungled job considerably not at arrowhead be steeped in virulent poison deuce cried merrick dropping hastily why did not warn of danger might have cut gone same way a poor francis briarfield how do know murder be so executed told about discolored wound in palm of right hand merrick nodded well continued be cause of death a there be scratch violence on other part of body picked up that arrowhead in fireplace of dining room of fen inn where have doubtless be thrown by felix after committal of crime where did get arrowhead be just what puzzled for long time fortunately remembered that entrance to bellin hall be decked with perfect armory of savage weapon made excuse of looking at picture gallery so gained admission to hall did find anything likely to confirm suspicion yes found that arrow have be removed from wall how must tell that because weapon be arranged in pattern one of pattern be incomplete moreover on comparing that arrowhead with on wall found be precisely similar in appearance humph said merrick thoughtfully there be only one deduction to be taken from felix stole arrowhead knowing to be poisoned rode off to fen inn to kill brother be clever scoundrel very clever indeed answered dryly for merrick must have baffled altogether think have time said merrick laughing now what do intend to do next have pool dragged for body felix briarfield arrested before doing so must be advisable to find rose strent father why so because only can give positive evidence a to committal of crime failing felix may slip through finger wo show up give evidence for own sake in case must be found forced into confession said doctor quickly what about felix miss bellin be now in town mr miss bellin in swansea square felix at chamber in jermyn street wonder if felix be still in communication with rose strent queried merrick half to be not impossible whatever rose strent be be be not waiting maid believe guilty bond unites pair that rose assisted felix in scoundrelly scheme out of pure love hardly responded merrick thoughtfully if rose loved felix must not assist to marry olivia by removing francis certainly did so how must do to see felix at chamber bully into confession wo manage that man be too clever ca do much against proof in possession will deny anything at event will try merrick evening will call on felix swear that be going to have arrested for murder of brother will bring to knee might might not better look for rose strent if anyone know where be to be found be felix ca do better than see try by mean said doctor doubtfully be afraid wo get much satisfaction out of first find rose strent have pool dragged body found then what with evidence of fundy that arrowhead will have difficulty in getting warrant for arrest at present felix will simply order out of room will run risk of answered shortly afterward took departure must not now complain of lack of interest in life took time to keep many detail of case in mind there be doubt have already solved mystery that felix be guilty of brother death yet a merrick said must be necessary to find body thus establish conclusive proof of crime before murderer must be convicted when be done evidence in hand must be sufficient to insure condemnation for part believed that must be driven into corner forced to confess complicity in crime firmly convinced of man guilt be determined must not marry olivia crime have be committed for sake seeing that have behaved in so cowardly fashion be fit retribution that must not achieve purpose be use warning olivia a to true character of felix a firmly believed to be francis must decline to believe story under circumstance judged advisable to see felix at chamber warn that knew terrified by predicament in found might leave england thus olivia must be saved from lifelong misery punishment for crime must occur later on a notwithstanding flight must be arrested on continent while extradition treaty be in force after dinner therefore went to call on felix room be in jermyn street a mine be just round corner in duke street have not far to go visit be paid on chance of finding in a did not wish to put on guard by notifying wish for interview a twin in spite of constant disagreement occupied same room must not wonder at nerve of felix in coming back to apartment where familiar object must remind of fratricidal act be just eight o'clock when reached door of chamber at foot of stair found caretaker ensconced in glass box like insect to addressed be old friend of mine rather oddity in way be mr briarfield within mr francis briarfield be in room said caretaker mr felix be in paris of course guessed that must be answer secretly admired dexterity with felix have carried out plan doubtless in end when brother did not return rather when pretended self did not reappear must account for by accident in eastern desert however business be with felix alias francis so made comment on caretaker remark pray take up card to mr briarfield said want to see at once ca take up now sir said caretaker civilly mr briarfield be engaged gave particular order that be not to be disturbed ah doubtless be engaged with friend of mine hinted ambiguously be lady friend of yours sir lady thought at once reverted to rose strent then chance be that might be olivia yes miss bellin be young lady sir to whom mr briarfield be engaged asked caretaker who be confirmed gossip yes be not sir know well by sight a have be here with mr bellin be lady surmise be right felt confident that while stood there felix be having interview with accomplice must not disturb yet wished to assure of identity of rose strent when found out about there might be possibility of solving mystery well matter answered carelessly stuffing card back into case will see mr briarfield time will leave name sir doe matter will call about nine on chance of finding in having thus baffled inquiry of caretaker strolled into street taking up station at corner kept eye on door if rose strent be with felix must certainly come out in short time then intended to follow up speak to if got chance failing briarfield might possibly extort confession from weaker vessel in about quarter of hour woman came out wore veil a be still fairly light have difficulty in seeing face passed hurriedly by in direction of haymarket without observing recognized at glance be a thought rose strent none other in place of waiting maid linen dress be arrayed in smart tailor made costume looked very fashionable indeed face wore triumphant expression a though have be successful with felix guessed interview have be for purpose of extorting blackmail with knowledge of secret felix be certainly at mercy following up at little distance went down hay market turned into one of side street turned off there into dirty little alley finally disappeared into swing door over be lamp inscribed with letter looked up saw written thereon stage door actress said went round to front of theater to inspect play bill be frivolity theater be playing burlesque of a like glancing down list of character saw that orlando be played by miss rose leading lady thought transfixed with astonishment burlesque actress doubtless in receipt of good salary what in heaven name took to fen inn question be of course unable to answer guessed have something to do with love felix briarfield leaving matter alone for few moment secured stall entered theater when orlando came on be thoroughly satisfied rose strent be rose gernon have seen play part of waiting maid at fen inn on th of june that fatal night of murder chapter x woman scorned when told dr merrick of good fortune in finding rose strent to use stage name rose gernon be considerably astonished case have taken hold of so completely that must think of nothing else have large practice attended fairly well to patient informed that did so in mechanical fashion more a brain be busy with fen inn mystery be now wonderfully familiar considering short period of acquaintance be doubtless due to interest took in case upon word denham said merrick rubbing head irritably wish have not come near with hallucination instead of attending to business think of nothing mystery sooner unravel riddle better will be for be idle bachelor so doe not matter much to be busy medical man infernal business worry greatly at moment ought to be attending to patient instead of be wasting time with will go away confound wish to see end of affair will get peace of mind be too late to remedy matter so must have curiosity allayed by learning in out of enigma come let begin have found rose strent yes be burlesque actress play at frivolity theater name in programme be set down a rose gernon be doubtless stage name rose strent be real one be not so sure of said merrick sharply if went into fen inn business with eye open doubtless took false name so a to baffle inquiry then what about landlord who called edward strent oh must find out about also doubt name be false also did look like father well ca say that there be much likeness between looked to like valet valet muttered merrick reflectively queer wonder if really be valet valet to felix in case must be with now be not impossible have felix in power can stay on just a like be opinion will stay till be pensioned off case of blackmail fancy think rose gernon be blackmailing felix also quite so what else can expect else added merrick looking straight at be case of love marriage what do think felix promised to marry rose if helped to get rid of brother think might lead to believe must do so be absurd merrick said sharply felix be in love with motive of crime be to gain possession of olivia hand rose must not help felix if knew that precisely if knew be opinion that doe not know believe felix gulled into belief that must marry if gave assistance have not slightest intention of keeping promise what excuse must make for wishing to murder brother ah there have know that of course be aware of real motive of crime rose be ignorant of think know doubt be certain have be put off with lie ca keep information from forever even if keep quiet someone be bound to tell felix be engaged to miss bellin there be wrong said merrick with grim jocularity everyone think francis be engaged to miss bellin yes rose gernon know well enough that francis be dead that engaged man must be felix posing a francis there be truth in admitted doctor looking puzzled suppose must have kept that fact from so far a see what possible explanation must give always assuming be in love with said musingly oh a to be certain be so woman like rose gernon drawing good salary must not mix up in such dangerous business merely for money there be stronger motive be love will lay anything continued merrick in sporting phrase will lay anything that be madly in love with fellow well olivia thinking felix be francis love madly also if two woman come together there will be trouble for felix eureka cried doctor jumping up excitedly very thing when thief fall out know adage let bring two woman together see upshot there will simply be row said what be use of retorted merrick sharply that when rose find have be betrayed will reveal mystery out of revenge assure olivia that felix be not francis that be not bad idea merrick also might occur that olivia reveals something in turn impossible ca possibly know man villainy else must not think of marrying suppose not yet added reflectively must be surprised if be cognizant of felix movement on th th certainly stuck up for in most amazing manner at first interview of course did because belief be francis depend upon denham know nothing if bring rose together there will be revolution revelation be worth trying at event how can be managed by working on natural jealousy of sex tell olivia felix receives woman in room evening oh hang merrick said reddening must be delicate even to married woman let alone girl of course mean to put to in barefaced manner said merrick hastily handle matter delicately wrap up in sugar leave to own judgment in case must rouse jealousy of miss olivia bellin induce to come with to chamber of felix when be interviewing rose must come without mother then bring mother along with be serious matter doe do to be squeamish then do said angrily said taken aback know miss bellin be proper person besides be better that must know truth even at cost of shock to delicacy than be tied to brute like felix a certainly will be not if rose can help ca help if doe know only way to spoil game of felix be to bring two woman face to face mutual jealousy will do rest instead of going to altar felix briarfield will find bound for scaffold true enough well will try merrick be job like laughed at scruple tried to show be really doing olivia service in being so plain spoken in spite of argument departed from house in low spirit did not relish idea of interviewing olivia on so delicate subject yet saw be imperative therefore made up mind to carry through business at cost of personal inconvenience to myself be worst of being amateur detective one feeling be not under sufficient control next day called at swansea square sent up card to olivia a so happened mother have gone down to hurlingham with felix remained at home on plea of headache sent down message to effect that be unwell asked to excuse scribbled few line on card asking particularly to see time servant returned with information that miss bellin must see for few minute be shown into drawing room

that miss bellin saw there said in hope of startling did not move muscle of face be keeping well in hand be cognizant of fact that felix have gone to paris for purpose of deceiving if so must have known be not francis also that story of lone inn tragedy be true be on tongue to ask if be aware of terrible truth on reflection judged best to let event evolve fate must manage thing better than mere mortal knew must see there said coldly can not conceive why must desire to convince that spoke truly because miss bellin believe that man who call francis be really felix same old story said impatiently be mad if saw felix in paris must be convinced that be making mistake well miss bellin will waive point for present will call man to whom be engaged francis a be interpolated imperiously

truth will be revealed truth be stranger than even suspected chapter xi transformation interview with olivia passed off better than have expected if have ordered out of house must only have looked on a just punishment for what must have appeared impertinent interference in what did not concern very fact that listened so quietly proved that suspected felix be masquerading a lover must only be assured of by overhearing interview with rose gernon therefore accepted invitation to go to jermyn street room if tenant be francis must resent intrusion of rose if felix two confederate must doubtless talk of guilty secret thanks to sovereign judiciously bestowed on caretaker have discovered that rose gernon intended to visit felix at eight o'clock how caretaker found out know in mysterious way servant seem to gain information concerning doings of superior sufficed for that rose must be in room of felix on evening that olivia must catch in trap have pity for guilty pair be genuinely sorry for olivia little knew torture be about to undergo did almost regretted that have interfered in matter however consoled with reflection that be better for to suffer few hour pain than lifelong misery that agreed to go to jermyn street at hour without chaperon proved how desirous be of learning truth delicately nurtured gently bred must have felt horrified at risk be running of losing good name seeing that life happiness depended upon knowing flung etiquette to wind came when found at foot of stair at eight o'clock admired respected from bottom of heart be late asked

remark be aware of truth repeated slowly before must question flitted up stair there be time for to ponder over word a be now past eight o'clock rose gernon might descend at time therefore spoke few hasty word to caretaker telling wished to see mr briarfield followed at once in two minute be standing before door of briarfield room be locked said olivia faintly never mind answered producing latchkey key of mine open door be a be aware great friend of francis learned time ago key fitted lock of room have not forgotten circumstance so come in useful now see turned key door opened

succeeded in most fortunate manner nothing remained for to do to listen to important conversation now taking place felix standing with back against mantelpiece looked anxious angry while rose gernon hand on table faced fiercely evidently conversation be not progressing in satisfactory manner to be saying rapidly will accept money for what have done know only reward claim love can not give to said felix doggedly know that a well a do do cried passionately do dare to say that to after vow protestation why did tell loved if be lie did not tell so yes did felix did remember hour day when swore

better than do woman continued rose not heeding interruption woman must have killed be not woman of kind will stay marry impossible be to marry miss bellin promised to give up miss bellin if helped to see brother at fen inn god muttered olivia trembling violently hush whispered now will hear truth have changed mind retorted felix in answer to last remark of rose may be have not mr felix briarfield fulfilled promise went down with strent to lonely inn brother came know that never left again have fulfilled promise now require to fulfill yours make wife can not can not said in faint voice wiping brow for heaven sake take money offer leave have mixed up with crime for sake offer to put off with money be useless promise have that promise require to keep else else will tell truth to police thus involve in ruin with care said sullenly anything must be better than torture be enduring at hand what will tell police asked felix in unnatural voice know well enough will tell how killed brother be false said passionately neither saw laid finger on brother indeed then if be innocent who be guilty know did not come to fen inn on fatal night when francis came yes never saw saw killed be lie be

explanation from felix paid attention to remark simply stared at in stupefied manner olivia said in low voice how did come here brought mr felix briarfield said stepping forward denham for what reason pointed to rose gernon who stood quietly by with malignant smile on face there be reason retorted meaningly miss bellin miss bellin will speak for herself said olivia in peremptory tone miss bellin speaks of what doe not understand interposed rose vehemently because deny that francis killed felix questioned olivia no because deny felix killed francis what do mean miss gernon asked rapidly mean that man whom miss bellin think be lover francis be felix briarfield felix briarfield continued be lover said felix hurriedly be not true expected to see olivia grow angry in place of bright smile irradiated face a looked at felix must not conjecture meaning of action began to grow uneasy rose also looked anything comfortable evidently have met with match in olivia overheard part of conversation said olivia addressing pointedly very honorable be sure retorted rose with sneer honor be thrown away on woman like answered scornfully be glad listened for enables to protect man love against art be not man love said rose spitefully lie in marsh surrounding fen inn slain by hand of brother be not true swear be not true cried felix approaching nearer to olivia be quiet francis said quickly let hear what have to say have to say that felix briarfield loved cried rose angrily loved long before ever saw when crossed path wanted to leave impersonated brother francis who be at time in america poor fool did not discover deception be quite right did not replied olivia calmly go on when brother francis came back month thought must be discovered implored to save told of plan whereby intended to decoy brother to fen inn on pretext of explanation there intended to kill olivia made remark placed hand within of felix wondered must do so seeing that be accused by accomplice of hideous crime made denial went down to fen inn with man called strent be not real name interrupted how do know that said sharply never mind know that be so decline to tell real name said rose darting furious look at call strent by name knew knew at fen inn certainly did not expect rose strent waiting maid to change to rose gernon actress be too meddlesome mr denham said coolly must do better to mind own

see wait one moment miss gernon before make accusation said olivia say that felix be lover do promised to assist in removing francis if married did for what reason when removal of francis must enable felix to marry under false name promised not to do so thought if helped to kill francis must force to marry love greatly love better than anyone else in world be sorry for said olivia with touch of pity because felix be dead felix dead said rose incredulously then who be man man be lover francis briarfield who returned from chili on th of june chapter xii back from grave for moment felt little

spoke truth be francis briarfield who stood before dead man be felix how change of personality have taken place be unable to guess nevertheless felt that be true rose gernon with look of disappointed rage be first to speak stamped foot laughed scornfully be ridiculous said contemptuously be francis who died francis did not die a well know interrupted young man felix fell into own trap for safety assumed name believe be aware of along how can that be if really did know be francis why did not say so because did not wish to betray for aught know slew brother be quite capable of accusing of murder rose evaded question tossing head with sneer moved toward door before must reach blocked passage not yet miss gernon said meaningly though have discovered felix to be francis know how former met with death can not tell think can said olivia quickly seeing felix by own confession made arrangement with yet felix be dead scoffed rose fell into own trap know how died said resolutely a regard

hope of mercy compromised matter let have night to think over entreated anxiously said francis olivia in one breath must tell now there be time urged be late a be must go let speak briarfield interposed seeing be about to refuse again want to make public scandal of a yet francis consulted olivia with look turned to know more about case than anyone else said quietly miss bellin be quite prepared to leave matter in hand very good then miss gernon can go to duty undertake that will be forthcoming tomorrow oh yes miss gernon added ironically have made plan knowing be mixed up in case

miss bellin added turning toward olivia wish joy of bargain that man be francis briarfield sure enough knew along played on fear for own end be coward felix be worth dozen of for mr briarfield have nothing contempt with parting shaft sailed out of door closely followed by detective be waiting on other side of street followed closely rose glanced uneasily from side to side not one word must speak did wish to talk having quite enough on mind for present when arrived at stage door of frivolity theater halted on step in light shed from lamp above must see scornful face what have promised will do mr denham said spitefully to morrow can tell nothing with cleverness a spy have discovered nothing mare nest when entered theater turned round to detective whom found at elbow know what have to do said imperatively yes sir saw face in light can depend upon sha lose sight of be to come to mr briarfield room to morrow at noon be right sir will see be there good be very careful be clever woman must baffle devil wo baffle said detective confidently so departed on mission having thus provided for safe keeping of rose gernon returned to briarfield room found alone miss bellin have taken departure during absence where be asked glancing round olivia have gone home explained francis if be back before nine mother will never hear of escapade so put in cab sent off better said taking seat now that be alone wish to hear story of transformation from francis to felix told be francis all along said reproachfully yes in such way thought be felix answered ironically might have trusted briarfield must have be better for have doubt must answered francis gloomily be afraid lest must think have killed felix knew be incapable of such thing thank said gratefully have known be so true friend must have made confidant a be when remembered wild threat of killing felix dreaded lest finding dead might accuse of murder who killed know when saw be dead strent rose have left house what time be about six in morning be not up till ten o'clock have plenty of time to fly put into head to place dead body of felix in bed be long story hardly know if will understand motif yes do be afraid of being accused of crime be foolish of to mistrust must have aided rather than blamed see that now be kind of to try avenge death unfortunately industry be dangerous to have to baffle certainly did so very adroitly tell story be anxious to know what took place francis be quite unnerved by late interview before continuing poured out glass of brandy then pushing bottle toward began strange narrative without further preamble when went to bed night said slowly must not sleep for ever so long kept wondering if theory must possibly be true about treachery of felix if be considered how must punish brother while thus thinking fell asleep did wake up till close on six o'clock in morning trouble came on with full force know how much worse thing look at hour than in broad daylight there be chance of further sleep so put on clothes went downstairs first thing saw be brother felix lying dead on floor have idea who killed not slightest thought be strent girl so went in search of have fled for found horse gone so flight confirmed in suspicion at first determined to wake up explain remembering foolish talk of previous night thought might think guilty of brother death be foolish idea well put in place must have thought a not bit of must have have more moral courage have at moment thought must denounce must be hanged so took step to secure own safety went outside found brother horse at side of house strent daughter have taken mine overlooked brother in hurry of guilty flight saw mean of escape took what about substitution of for felix did that to throw off scent guessed that idea be right felix be masquerading a so thought might go back with safety a felix be far cleverer than be certain have provided reason for absence of real self while passed off a whole plot unrolled in moment before saw in carrying through lay only chance of safety must have be far easier to have trusted to friendship see that now said francis penitently did not then wanted to leave house without waking so took body of felix softly upstairs undressed laid in bed then folded up clothes on chair beside bed dressed in suit pearl ring have to part with so a to carry out deception therefore slipped on finger of dead man then locked door of bedroom came downstairs again in few minute be on way to marshminster how did get horse back to fundy stable what made think of going to bellin hall a to first found fundy name on saddle so knew felix have hired horse took back to stable owing to resemblance to felix easily managed to deceive hostler then a felix in letter have told be staying at bellin hall went there be there suspicion none at told footman have be out for morning ride asked to bring brandy soda to room needed drink after have gone through principal reason for asking be to find out room how so well made carry tray upstairs in front of of course took to room of felix thus gained point without exciting suspicion baggage clothes etc of felix be in room knew about a have seen plenty of time then dressed in morning suit went downstairs to find olivia did guess truth not at first saw there be something wrong a kept referring to event of previous week about knew nothing luckily mr bellin did not come down to breakfast so be able to tell when servant left room have recognized that felix be masquerading a have more le be not quite certain when told have occurred believed at once in instinctive way knew be really lover then set to work to concert measure for safety olivia told felix be supposed to be in paris at htel de trangers showed letter so be decided a wisest to keep up fiction told have taken place during absence by time came be thoroughly fitted into skin of felix then came insisted be felix yes see told truth so did olivia when said be francis of

so that might force to marry yes little arrangement did not come off idea be that saw felix when arrived at inn asked straight out if have arranged to marry olivia must hear of engagement while passing through marshminster on way to lone inn doubt felix lied about matter lost temper may be that did not intend to kill having poisoned arrowhead in hand forgot how dangerous be threw on put out hand to keep off so be wounded then died terrified at what consequence might be strent left inn what about blackmailing francis guessed what francis have done saw chance of securing aim by putting murder on to have so compromised by foolish action that of course be afraid to denounce still why did want to marry loved felix not francis be opinion loved of said merrick dryly simply wanted to marry for respectability do think will denounce strent will denounce anyone to save wo come hear confession merrick not respectable practitioner like have business to be mixed up in such criminality hitherto have be sleeping partner in affair have carried through idea excellently well continue to do so then come tell about very pleasant for grumbled have hard work merrick laughed pushed out of

spoke truth faculty for learning thing be marvelous decidedly merrick must have be detective opinion about rose gernon coincided with mine one have only to look in face to see what be at jermyn street found francis eagerly waiting for arrival have sent down to marshminster police said quickly instructed to drag pool near fen inn be afraid will get into trouble over briarfield care said francis doggedly have be coward too long have trusted told there must not have be trouble if police arrest can just do so will leave to to see through hope will learn truth from rose to day be possible not probable will lie like devil whose daughter be be not too sure of if be guiltless will be only too anxious to save own neck why must risk liberty for sake of man strent who be have least idea then will make rose tell today have arrested there be not sufficient evidence against objected francis yes there be will take risk of before rose gernon leaf room have to confess truth be only chance of safety believe killed felix police may forget how highly suspicious action have be rose know have be passing a brother will be sure to make capital out of will see through denham said taking hand can be sure of answered shaking heartily wo rest till be safe murderer of brother be in jail who killed do think know rose doe will make tell discussed matter extensively of must come to conclusion when clock struck noon rose gernon true to appointment walked into room without waiting for invitation sat down in chair scowled at that man of yours be outside said savagely be be following about everywhere watching house night perhaps will ask to go away depends on result of conversation be not out of danger yet miss gernon be not aware that be ever in danger mr denham be going to accuse of killing felix might even do unless tell truth oh said with sneer be that game sir then suppose do tell truth say killed felix be quite capable of doing so one must believe so wild tale have reason to kill felix briarfield then what motive have for so doing be best known to answered tartly weary of fencing be waste of time talking like interrupted francis must be aware miss gernon that stand in very dangerous position not more so than do replied with superb insolence pardon think otherwise by own confession went down to fen inn to assist brother in getting out of way said that last night before two witness miss bellin mr denham talked at random muttered did not intend that crime must be committed perhaps not nevertheless brother be dead know how died know cause of death know who killed if know one thing must know other when felix arrived showed strent arrowhead said be poisoned be arrowhead asked producing out of thick piece of paper yes where did get found in ash of fireplace where threw be not true said miss gernon angrily did not throw into fireplace never even have hand idea that be poisoned frightened pray go on with story miss gernon see believe flashed out defiantly be telling exactly what took place felix said be going to kill brother with poisoned arrowhead told must have none of sort of thing that only consented to play part of waiting maid in order to deceive brother into meeting said francis must marry miss bellin be to marry after that jeered said intended to marry miss bellin then grew angry struck be in real earnest for mouth be set hand be clenched not pretty sight by mean remembered merrick idea conceived that might be possible woman before have killed man who flouted not intentionally in fit of blind rage struck with arrowhead hinted did have laid that down on table struck with open palm said if killed brother must denounce to authority a murderer then must go to scaffold instead of altar with miss bellin what did say nothing at first then saw look pas between strent seemed to understand one felix said must return to marshminster let brother marry miss bellin did not then know have be passing off a added turning to francis if have must have guessed be lying a be thought spoke truth kissed then went to bed afterward said francis seeing paused well never saw felix again till be dead in morning hour after left strent knocked at bedroom door asked to come down guessed by voice be afraid so dressed hurriedly came downstairs felix be lying dead by table must not see strent went to look for be out at back door mounting francis ' horse asked where be going said felix be dead did not want to stay in order to be accused of crime did say have killed have time to ask went off at gallop left alone with body be horribly afraid a thought francis must wake up accuse of crime besides must not account for presence in house without suspicion so put on hat cloak fled to marshminster how did fly there be trap horse in strent have brought provision to inn harnessed horse drove back to marshminster there returned to owner went back to london by early train what became of strent know have never set eye on since do think killed felix yes believe have row killed did not admit francis looked at one whole business be so queer a to be hardly believable nevertheless saw rose gernon have told truth what made come to asked francis thought have escaped from inn wished to ask have become of brother body then saw wore clothes of felix guessed whole game particularly a listened to theory at fen inn said yes answered quickly be conversation put idea into head saw that felix have passed off a francis afterward francis acted part of felix wished to marry said francis whereat rose laughed tried game on to get whole truth out of wished to admit be felix for have promised to marry however did not fall into trap now added standing up have told may go consulted francis with look consented mutely yes said also rising may go detective will still watch for how long till strent be found think know said tossing head be wrong till met strent at marshminster never saw before do know where now be take off bloodhound when strent be found persisted not till then looked wrathfully at rushed out of room chapter xiv hunting of man be nearer truth than before rose gernon have told nothing new comparatively speaking certainly declared to be innocent of crime accused strent if found strent might declare innocent accuse one other of must necessarily be guilty a alone have seen felix on fatal night rose be being closely watched by detective so that must obtain evidence at moment now remained for to find strent hear story francis believed strent have killed brother have doubt a must see motive for committing crime whereas rose in fit of blind anger might have done so merrick theory a to guilt be more in accordance with belief hitherto have kept case from being meddled with by police now began to handle matter informed by francis a to whereabouts of body dragged pool near fen inn recovered corpse of unhappy young man then inspector wrote peremptory letter to francis requesting to come down attend inquest there be note of suspicion in letter francis must not very well help obeying summons requested to come with have intention of doing settled time of departure before going saw olivia dr merrick mr bellin have not be informed of death of felix did suspect that anything wrong be going on under very nose thanks to wonderful resemblance between twin accepted felix a francis francis a without slightest suspicion at first have objected to engagement afterward learning that briarfield possessed good income consented to be sure must have be better pleased have olivia married title a daughter declared must marry one francis mr bellin gave way with good grace a to olivia be terribly dismayed when heard francis be going to marshminster dreaded lest must be accused of brother murder action of francis have be so very peculiar that be afraid to tell to inspector lest must think young man guilty at same time be impossible to keep secret a francis have thrown body of brother into pool must have to explain to inspector how got there only chance of proving to be innocent lay in finding strent where be to be discovered none of knew merrick clever brain discovered clew to destination of fugitive did ride to fen inn from marshminster asked francis have come by train to marshminster must have gone to bellin hall where brother be staying seen before olivia be pity did not go there said merrick thoughtfully trouble might have then be avoided well how did get to fen inn took train from london to starby horse there rode to fen inn how far be from starby to fen inn about twelve mile from fen inn to marshminster ten mile much about muchness said merrick did tell strent have ridden from starby yes have reason to conceal movement quite so well according to rose gernon be horse strent took to escape be wonder did not take horse of felix for very simple reason knew when alarm be given that denham must go to marshminster therefore to hide trail better went back with horse to starby do think so be sure of go to livery stable at starby where hired horse be certain will find there restored by strent well said in wise satisfied suppose trace to starby will be use doubt took train there to london very probably said merrick coolly waited there for rose gernon have not seen since fled from inn so say be not true for when killed felix evidence seems to point to a murderer told rose to take gig go to marshminster then rode off to starby rejoined in london why must conceal movement because know too much about crime said merrick decisively did be afraid of speaking did wish to screen why must wish to screen man who killed lover ca answer question said merrick irritably finding at loss be pure theory think be so be certain there be understanding between rose strent if detective watching rose only knew strent be certain must catch paying visit why not give detective picture of man suggested francis why not indeed retorted derisively because have got picture have one at room said francis where did get drew while waiting for felix at fen inn know denham have skill in catching expression watching face fellow struck a smug scoundrel penciled caricature of while moved about dining room be not photograph certainly still think be sufficiently like capital said doctor rubbing hand be good thing employed leisure in way mr briarfield may do great service think be in danger think stand in perilous position replied doctor gravely very effort to preserve secret baffle denham will score against with police must tell seeing knew where body be to be found will tell do best can said francis turning pale rose can prove be never out of room ca rose went to bed for aught know might have come down quarreled with brother afterward only chance mr briarfield of proving innocence be to find strent if give portrait to detective watching rose gernon believe will lay hand on be mere chance there be mean of identification said strent be lame so if lame man call on miss gernon detective aided by picture will know be strent well go try plan said merrick shaking francis by hand hope for sake mr briarfield will be successful when left doctor francis looked pale upset be just beginning to realize predicament in stood be afraid that when be known must be arrested own action looked black though knew be done out of pure foolishness have only trusted at time trouble must have be averted a be determined to stand by to end cheer up briarfield said clapping on back if merrick solved so much of mystery may be sure will find out rest be newspaper be thinking of said ruefully if foolishness get into press mr bellin will never let marry olivia think mr bellin will have much say in matter answered dryly olivia be not kind of woman to give up lover so easily particularly when know truth will stick to a intend to do a to press forget that inquest be at marshminster only posse weekly paper know editor can keep detail out of cheer up thank denham said poor fellow gratefully be best friend have faith did think so at paris briarfield have doubt that there cursed by god for meddlesome fool at laughed began to pick up spirit saw detective who be watching rose gernon gave picture drawn by francis with full description of man wanted especially did lay stress on lameness in end detective promised that must nail man answering to description gave address at marshminster told to wire when found out whereabouts of strent also told to wire to merrick a doctor be anxious to know if theory must prove correct next day went down to marshminster by permission francis stayed with at aunt jane house learning that be in trouble two old lady made much of saw inspector of police who be friend of mine learned that body of felix briarfield be at morgue of marshminster inquest be to be held next morning arrangement have be made when inspector have supplied with information sat down told whole story a have be here set forth listened with much astonishment expressed to end never read novel to touch said staring at francis truth be stranger than fiction after greatly resemble unhappy brother mr briarfield be body much decomposed asked seeing that francis remained silent be recognizable only replied inspector acted very foolishly in matter of why did not come tell about at once be afraid of being accused of killing brother said francis faintly have made ten time worse now said inspector dryly have wished to damn must not have gone to work in more pig headed fashion be going to arrest there be not sufficient evidence against besides quite believe story still added with hesitation have to face coroner to morrow may not believe so easily a what do think be best to be done asked dismally well judging from what have told must think best thing must be to find strent said inspector be only man to solve mystery failing 'd better get rose gernon down evidence may go to prove mr briarfield be in bed at time felix be in house will wire for to come down at once said jumping up will be a well will send man over to starby find out if strent delivered horse to livery stable keeper wish to heaven denham said inspector raging at that have told about at first acted for best have doubt did replied ill temperedly hate amateur detective simply muddle thing 'd have straightened out coil long ago have taken in hand have doubt of said dryly went off to telegraph office there sent telegram to rose gernon asking to come down by early train next morning also informed detective wished to come knew quite well must not dare to refuse moreover detective must send man to watch while waited round house for possible appearance of strent when got back to inspector room found that ill temper have vanished be doing best to console francis have seen man in worse plight than be yours mr briarfield be saying when entered yet came out all right in end cause of predicament be similar what be said francis looking up lack of moral courage have told denham at time then of have told might have laid hand on rose gernon strent a be gave time to make up plan get away rose have got away said grimly be safe enough will be here to morrow wish must say same about strent said inspector do think be guilty asked francis upon word sir after experience of law be afraid to say who be guilty who be that theory of dr merrick regarding rose gernon be feasible enough certainly seems to have have more motive for killing brother than have strent be opinion said that there be relationship between strent rose in such relationship lie secret of crime silence humph there be something in said inspector might be man wife brother sister suggested francis even lover said nodding head jealousy on part of strent might have spurred on to killing felix however be theory parted for night without coming to decision a to who be guilty party in morning received telegram from merrick went off with at once to inspector ran thus have secured strent be bringing down with rose arrive at noon hold over inquest if possible by jove sir said inspector that man be lost a doctor ought to be detective chapter xv what really happened at fen inn see be right said merrick when met at station have be right in instance answered inspector here quite agrees with that must be detective where be prisoner not prisoner replied merrick shocked at word be guest traveling companion what will not prisoner still see detective attends on said a strent rose gernon came along platform be a well to take precaution how be francis briarfield rather downcast be afraid of being arrested for murder fear of answered merrick casting glance at strent gentleman evidence will exonerate fully strent smooth unctuous a ever rubbed hand bowed rose gernon turned back on with gesture of disgust evidently have not forgiven hurried departure from inn what be waiting for said sharply let go on to inquest wish to get over a soon a possible return to town took hint walked along to room adjoining morgue where inquest be being held introduced merrick to inspector after short conversation went into morgue to examine body not caring to see so ghastly sight remained outside with francis in quarter of hour doctor inspector returned former rubbing hand with well pleased expression latter looking somewhat astonished what have passed in morgue know not a merrick refused to gratify curiosity wait till hear evidence of strent said significantly jury be made up of well to do marshminster tradesman who took profound interest in proceeding a dead man be brother of miss bellin future husband bellins be great people of neighborhood tradesman hoped to serve hall when mr mr briarfield settled there be therefore excessively polite to francis frequent mark of attention only drew from bitter smile must treat in way if knew whispered to will never know answered in same tone have spoken to inspector in turn have talked seriously with coroner latter have be told whole story though astonished at folly of francis yet found in heart to be sorry for young man said must not question francis more than be necessary hoped to carry through inquest without exposing underlying romance first witness called be local doctor who deposed to having examined body of felix gave a opinion that young man have died of poison explained state of blood with lot of medical technicality none of jury understood be said doctor case of blood poisoning deceased have be wounded in hand by sharp instrument have be steeped in poison came next narrated how have stayed at fen inn on night have met there francis briarfield who be waiting there for brother then told of discovery of corpse finding of arrowhead in fireplace said nothing about tracking trail to pool if possible wished portion of evidence to be passed over in silence fortunately jury be dull headed lot submitted quietly to guidance of coroner only asked question pertinent to death without going too deeply into subject at point produced arrowhead francis explained that have arrived from chili on th of june have gone at once to fen inn at request of brother felix brother have not arrived on night have gone to bed be unable to say how brother have come by tragic end then came critical point wished passed over in silence did see brother at fen inn mr briarfield asked coroner did not see brother alive be evasive answer perhaps body have be put in pool by murderer said one of juryman in case mr briarfield must not see did not go to pool on night replied francis adroitly evading remark be later on learned brother body be there at once gave instruction that pool be to be dragged at point mr briarfield be asked to stand down inspector evidence be taken deposed to fact that mr briarfield have instructed to drag pool for body that be found there piece of evidence quite put jury off scent a if francis have placed body in pool must not have told inspector where to find critical point be thus glided gently over coroner called rose gernon once jury knew how crime have be committed must forget about hiding of body in pool so that folly of francis must not be made public must say that rose gernon gave evidence very clearly said be intimate friend of felix briarfield statement rather shocked moral tradesman of marshminster felix asked to go down to inn a have prepared for brother wished to see there about family matter inn be ruin interrupted juryman miss gernon said that be very true still be habitable mr felix briarfield have sent on fuel provision a former proprietor have left furniture room be fairly comfortable must not say why felix did unless be that wanted to see brother privately such talk be very weak juryman looked significantly at one knew fen inn must not conceive that anyone must be so mad a to dwell in even for night be said to be haunted though such superstition might be scoffed at yet not one of present must have passed twelve hour of darkness in ill omened place be not afraid when saw lone inn asked juryman rose shrugged shoulder laughed contemptuously be afraid of nothing said coolly there be such thing a ghost besides have brother with brother yes edward strent inspector gave low whistle catching eye nodded significantly remembered what have said on previous night now agreed with theory that secret of committal of crime lay in relationship existing between rose strent be appeared brother sister saw kind of possibility now that tie be made clear meanwhile rose proceeded with evidence mr felix briarfield came to inn said after brother have gone to rest saw spoke with afterward went to bed understood that be going to stay night see brother in morning be alone in room when left be with strent hour so after retired strent came to door asked to go downstairs did so found felix lying dead on floor brother have left room on going out at back of house found mounting horse of mr francis briarfield asked what have happened just said felix be dead advised to fly lest must be accused of murder that suppose be also reason of flight so told when saw in london then declared innocent of crime be afraid must be accused of crime so took horse gig in have come to fen inn drove to marshminster from there returned to london why did not give alarm be afraid of being accused of murder here inspector whispered something in ear of coroner nodded again spoke to rose gernon why did not tell mr denham where to find strent when be apparently guilty strent be brother said rose quietly a told be innocent did not wish to be arrested for crime that visited yesterday be seen by men set to watch must never have be caught examination lasted considerable time coroner did not succeed in eliciting anything new from persistently held to same story so in despair examiner desisted be told to stand down in place edward strent be called then for began most interesting part of case knew have be said hitherto did not know how crime have be committed waited to hear what strent have to say quite believed to be guilty yet hardly thought must accuse of crime first corroborated story of rose a to going to inn narrated have occurred up to time when be left alone in room with felix when found alone with briarfield proceeded have quarrel with about what about sister have promised to marry yet a well knew be paying attention to miss bellin miss bellin be engaged to brother remarked juryman know that be about miss bellin wished to see brother insisted that must marry sister refused have hot word be on one side of table on other between lay arrowhead have brought in pocket why have brought arrowhead there know replied strent lying with utmost promptitude took arrowhead out of pocket said be poisoned laid down on table do think intended to kill brother because stood in way with miss bellin asked inquisitive juryman of romantic turn of mind really know sir replied strent looking juryman straight in face said nothing to be quarreling over shabby way in have treated sister arrowhead be on table between be position of arrowhead asked coroner prompted by merrick be leaning against book be on table point be uppermost said to mr briarfield 'will marry sister said be if will ' while saying brought down open palm of hand on arrowhead gave cry of pain when lifted hand have ragged wound across from thumb to little finger wished to bind up pushed away cry out be dead man in three minute be lying dead on floor threw arrowhead into fireplace tried to revive be use be dead be afraid must be accused of death a mr denham mr francis might have heard quarreling together lost head altogether only thought of flight ran up to sister room told felix be dead then saddled horse when came to door be mounting told to take gig fly to marshminster must explain in london fled like coward suppose did said man sullenly be beside with terror rode to starby gave horse back to livery stable keeper then went to london saw sister agreed with that be best to keep quiet so did not come forward to give evidence have not be for detective who watched sister must not be here now evidence practically ended inquest merrick be called to prove that wound in hand be one a might have be made by downward stroke of hand on sharp point evidence be substantiated by local practitioner who have examined body with dr merrick there be doubt that affair have happened a strent said felix briarfield have slapped open hand on table to emphasize refusal to marry rose gernon unfortunately came in contact with poisoned arrowhead flint have edge like razor being steeped in virulent poison acted like snakebite on unfortunate young man felix have not be murdered died by misadventure be verdict brought in by jury so whole of strange affair came to end thanks to astuteness of inspector delicacy of coroner jury be quite unaware of what have happened between death of felix inquest reporter of marshminster gazette merely put in short statement of affair in few day people ceased to take interest in fen inn crime be lucky escape for francis think lesson be thrown away on rose gernon brother went back to town same evening never saw strent again frequently have pleasure of seeing sister performing on stage be now engaged to be married with knowledge of action at fen inn can not say envy bridegroom after burial of felix went abroad with francis whose health be quite broken down by strain put on during last few week returned in six month married olivia be told have taken place in lone inn kept information to herself mr bellin never knew that felix have substituted for francis be best man at wedding by particular request saw happy pair start for honeymoon hope will be happy be sure deserve to be seeing through what tribulation
