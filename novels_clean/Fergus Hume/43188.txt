of echo to please intendante whose daughter wished to marry for dowry lady be plain father be rich so captain velez be quite willing to sacrifice good look bachelor freedom on altar of matrimony provided be well paid for doing so don rafael be in highest of spirit at prospect of seeing dona carmencita kept thing going by liveliness of sally while colonel garibay smoked endless cigarette spoke little after excellent dinner be done full justice to by hungry spaniard went on deck sat down to smoke talk first foremost paid sir philip handsome compliment about beauty speed of bohemian then drifted gradually into one subject of hour war with embassy to xuarez certainty of punishing xuarez begad philip whispered tim who be smoking villainous black clay pipe be xuarez nothing else be only man opposidores have so appears replied philip leaning back in chair whole row seems to hinge on xuarez be that not opinion don rafael what be mi amigo understand english xuarez be only capable man on side of opposidores ladrons interrupted don alonzo with stately spite intendante think otherwise xuarez be clever senor one be so clever a tejada canalla canalla echoed velez removing cigarette one be so clever a tejada don jose be being deceived by xuarez said rafael ruffled at allusion to proposed father in law be pompous old fool if be wise will leave acauhtzin with family place under protection of republic wo do replied garibay decisively be of too much service to xuarez opposidores have little wealth tejada be rich man well matter senor intendante will arrest carry in chain to junta be afraid will be more difficult than imagine senor said rafael dryly xuarez be adored by townspeople of acauhtzin have passably good army friendship of indian who be being urged on to war by prophetic opal capital fleet with at command must be fool to yield at mere reading of decree war will be long one difficult one be doubtful if in end don hypolito will not conquer garibay frowned looked sternly at young man be sympathy with opposidores senor by mean see in xuarez possible tyrant unscrupulous scoundrel be not so blinded a to overlook talent already have scored heavily against securing of fleet gaining of acauhtzin to interest without blow believe colonel speak truly when say xuarez be foe to be dreaded will not dare to defy decree of republic said intendante pompously when read added don alonzo tapping breast pocket where lay official paper will yield certainly echoed velez parrot like will yield carambo dare not defy don alonzo do think xuarez be second montezuma to yield in presence of army senor cried rafael vehemently tell be alone must resist arrest how much more so then when supported by devotion of hundred be true subject of republic hate dread scorn don hypolito despise will be napoleon of cholacaca let republic beware ah bah said colonel garibay while don alonzo snorted with indignation xuarez may be clever man be general why doe not even make first move no bides time when doe move tlatonac will hear of mean will bombard city yes will explain excuse one moment senor go for map of country don rafael ran down to cabin during absence intendante captain velez scoffed at idea that xuarez must be dangerous enemy have duet in braggadocio vein will yield senor when read decree troop of tlatonac alone can crush added velez confidently will swallow rebel at mouthful intendante say so war will be mere military promenade said echo so said french at outbreak of franco prussian war interjected philip grimly made mistake what be opinion colonel agree with don rafael replied garibay slowly be by mean inclined to undervalue opponent xuarez be a cunning a satan a ambitious first move in war have resulted to own advantage therefore be not so confident of speedy termination to campaign a be gentleman fire cracker such a reading decree will not frighten man like xuarez then think journey useless asked jack who be of much same opinion absolutely senor believe be on eve of terrible struggle to whom will result advantage know not if junta be a faint hearted a don rafael must yield without blow said intendante bitterly without blow from velez in same tone carambo be wrong senor cried colonel with fiery earnestness be not faint hearted will fight against xuarez to last be wise to scoff at man a be doing tell be master spirit such a rise once in century a such be powerful even against great power of republic be one of men who change destiny of nation napoleon garibaldi washington from soul senor trust will win save republic be a well to look on side of question blind security be not wise por todos santos senor cried garibay rising to foot in excitement see how man have already succeeded acauhtzin most important town next to capital be in hand fleet have gone over entirely to side have forgotten treachery of marina pepe full plan of fortification of tlatonac be before if can do much can do more till end will support republic resist possible dictator sneer at xuarez tell be great man be unexampled outburst for ordinarily calm colonel sank back in chair with look of agitation on usually impassive face intendante velez be for moment impressed yet soon recovering obstinate belief in invulnerability of republic must have replied at moment don rafael made appearance with small map pardon senor have be so long apologised rafael sitting down promptly spreading out map on own philip knee look now mi amigo will tell how campaign will be conducted how do know senor be in confidence of xuarez be gentleman traitor replied rafael haughtily to insulting question of intendante know something of don hypolito plan because spoke of to don jose de tejada before revolt of fleet be visitor at house of gentleman so learned much have don jose known must remain true to republic must have be more cautious a be spoke sufficiently clearly to let understand broad outline of campaign a designed by xuarez bueno said intendante politely ask pardon don rafael plan behold said rafael tracing with finger various point here be acauhtzin there tlatonac at extreme south see janjalla last town will be attacked first reason carrai can not see senor garibay between tlatonac acauhtzin be nothing mountain road open space giant hill terrible precipice few path made by indian inhospitable desert where land happens to be flat for few mile how then can xuarez convey army to capital in direction true true most of soldier be dragoon certainly must attack tlatonac with indian who be used to rugged country savage a xuarez well know can do little nothing against trained troop in conjunction with own army can do something alone be almost useless bueno see will not attack from north why attack janjalla instead of tlatonac asked tim who be anxiously following discussion pencil note book in hand look to south replied don rafael promptly mountain between janjalla tlatonac nothing rich plain broad space on army can manoeuvre now if xuarez conveys troop by war ship south to janjalla can bombard perhaps take city intendante deny impossible to take janjalla echoed velez nodding head wisely rafael shrugged shoulder be next to impossible to argue with obstinate people who must only look at one side of question will grant that janjalla fall into power of xuarez said garibay impatiently afterwards afterwards resumed young man xuarez will garrison town concentrate troop there thus leaving acauhtzin open to attack said jack satirically by mean war ship will prevent troop getting to town can not get to by land sea will be blockaded by rebel fleet unless torpederas true unless torpederas arrive replied rafael significantly be doubtful a to whether junta xuarez will get however be only supposing thing being in favour of opposidores bueno will look at matter from don hypolito point of view said philip quietly troop be concentrated at janjalla between town tlatonac be open plain added philip dryly army of republic certainly let presume for sake of argument that xuarez make three simultaneous attack with regular army on plain with indian from north on tlatonac from sea by bombardment from war ship dios muttered garibay biting finger that man be general troop of republic will conquer everywhere said don alonzo gravely everywhere repeated umbra be to be hoped so senor said tim significantly republic will need help can get to defend in three place at once in opinion observed rafael calmly there be only one way to end war be by naval victory junta must secure torpederas must have more war ship cripple don hypolito power on sea then will be unable to convey troop to janjalla unable to bombard tlatonac remain shut up in acauhtzin where can crush at leisure garibay disagreed with view of matter accused rafael of looking solely at matter from naval point of view hot discussion ensued in possible attack repulse strategy battle be talked over far into night philip jack grew weary of incessant argument slipped down to saloon where chatted about dolores overhead heard hot tempered spaniard arguing fiercely several time thought must come to blow so warm grew discussion egad jack be glad voyage end to morrow said philip a turned in will certainly murder one grunt be jack unsatisfactory reply be almost asleep already dreaming of rescuing dolores from clutch of don hypolito after time on deck grew tired of such unprofitable talk one by one came down to snatch few hour sleep in space of fifteen minute everyone be snoring yacht flew northward with cargo of sleeping men benker be in charge of

be perfectly calm night star moon placid sea yacht swirling through liquid plain with slight roll to right infinite expanse of water heaving against horizon to left long low line of coast with dim mass of foliage here there snow clad mountain peak benker twirled wheel chewed quid looked now then in disgust at sleeping form of soldier encumbering white deck of yacht moonlight starlight throb of screw singing of wind through rigging hiss of wave seething past be wonderfully beautiful boat sped onward like shadow amid world of shadow most prosaic soul must have be touched by profound beauty of watery world not so simon benker be used to regarded nothing work soldier then east began to palpitate with coming dawn line of dim light low down on horizon yellow band melted to pale green flushed to delicate rose colour higher higher coming day dyed sky in opaline hue star fled westward wan moon paling before fierce splendour hid face behind bank of cloud dark world of water became tinged with rainbow hue then one thick yellow shaft of light smote zenith with heavy brilliance ray after ray shot out like spoke of wheel suddenly intolerable glory of sun leaped from nether world yonder said

tim who have glass up gave exclamation of surprise what be tim three war ship be lying in harbour thought a much replied philip calmly will have to run blockade tim pointed upward to union jack if fire on that said slowly xuarez be not clever man take to be what do say jack say repeated jack who be looking ahead with clenched fist that one of three ship be pizarro dolores be on board chapter ii acauhtzin here where mingle rock sand phantom like city stand looming vague ghostly pale through dawning misty veil day night night day at foot of rampart grey just stone throw up shore ever hungry surge roar a must rejoice to tear from height that city fair where engirt by forest green proud sits laurelled queen dim mighty fabric gleam a thought built in magic dream be palace city hoary famed in song for golden glory at dawn will fade away in traitor light of day city of acauhtzin be not unlike capital in appearance though differed from tlatonac in being built on projecting point of land instead of on hill on side be mountain partially enclosing deep basin wherein war ship be anchored on tongue of rock jutting into centre of pool city be built wall white glistening arose sheer from rocky cliff above only few steeple tower must be seen wall encompassing tongue of rock formed kind of citadel then ran along inshore for distance on side terminating in well defended fort at back of

side of cortes whereat tim uttered exclamation of rage be insulting flag be blank cartridge replied philip shrewdly be saluting union jack don hypolito evidently want to stand well with england see be dipping flag three war ship lowered pennant for moment in salutation to english flag then ran up again to masthead philip have by time brought bohemian directly under gun of fort so that in event must be safe fort must not depress gun sufficiently to damage war ship must not dare to fire lest must injure rampart of town making everything safe by artful manoeuvre philip with sanction of don alonzo hauled down union jack to hoist republican banner at first fort thought english ship be responding to salute several gun thundered welcome to stranger while crowd on shore cheered lustily greeting however be changed to cry of anger when yellow banner of tlatonac flew up to masthead of bohemian without doubt have yacht be outside war ship must have opened fire on audacious vessel to make pay for

shape with purpose firm aid due fulfilment till therefrom new heaven earth be formed ancient thing crashing to ruin a foundation serve whereon to build earth future destiny there be doubt that don hypolito laid due stress on ceremonial observance a necessary to consolidate pretension on ground that gomez have broken constitutional rule by held position xuarez proclaimed saviour president of cholacacan republic not being in possession of tlatonac constituted acauhtzin capital for time being there assumed air of ruler called by title of president personal staff intimate friend constituted kind of revolutionary junta building in illegal assemblage met for conference be dignified with name of palacio nacional in respect machinery of lawful government be copied at acauhtzin that town be regarded by opposidores a true capital of country until such time a xuarez must enforce pretension by marching in triumph into head city of republic a in middle age two pope ruled one at rome other at avignon so allegiance of cholacaca be claimed by two president gomez at tlatonac xuarez at extraordinary man who avowed saviour of type country possessed in marked degree power of dominating with whom came in contact by personal charm of manner daemonic influence be peculiar characteristic of great men without must not hope to accomplish mission napoleon changed map of europe mahomet created religion caesar consolidated roman empire luther tore civilised world from grip of ecclesiastical rome great event sprang in first instance from strong personality of men who accomplished hence performance of what appear to be miracle don hypolito xuarez son of spanish adventurer indian woman possessed daemonic influence gifted with such power arose from obscurity to full glory of supreme power nowhere be authority more noticeable than in acauhtzin year before political adventurer have be accepted by people of town a deputy to junta acauhtzin always jealous of superiority of tlatonac be desirous that seat of government must be transferred thither from city of opal ambition be fostered by crafty xuarez who saw therein safe way of gaining love of northern capital after have accused gomez in junta of breaking rule of constitution came northward to claim protection of constituent protection be freely accorded to one who have interest so much at heart cunning don hypolito saw position how must better casting fortune on one bold stroke assembled townspeople in great plaza harangued with marvellous power of oratory gomez have tampered with sacred constitution of cholacaca gomez be therefore unworthy to occupy presidential chair one man alone must save country that man be let throw in fortune with resort to arm to inforce elevation to supreme power then must transfer seat of government from tlatonac to acauhtzin northern port must become greatest city in central america dazzled by vision townspeople elected don hypolito president with enthusiasm vowed to stand by to end end never for moment doubted must be victory over established government transference of seat of power from tlatonac to acauhtzin firmly believed in don hypolito a man of future when by skilful stroke of diplomacy secured support of regimiento de huitzilopochtli of fleet triumph be complete who must do so much must do more admiring townsfolk swore by brilliant adventurer when message carried by don alonzo arrived at northern capital crafty mestizo be idol of populace ironical part of whole affair be that have intention of fulfiling promise made to trusting constituent jack owing to long residence in tlatonac be already acquainted with xuarez tim philip be exceedingly curious to behold man of whom have heard so much who seemed to hold destiny of republic in hollow of hand in great hall of palacio nacional so called beheld for first time waiting to receive emissary of government surrounded by brilliant throng of officer alone be plainly dressed uniform gaudy tint decoration yet personality raised high above by whom be encircled supporter of xuarez be mediocrites xuarez be great man revolutionary leader be small of stature ungraceful in appearance leg be short body be long so that rather waddled than walked at first sight ungainly figure ungraceful gait be apt to bring smile to lip of onlooker that smile faded before grand countenance surmounting misshapen frame be a though head of greek statue have be by mistake joined on to body of polynesian idol first be so noble latter so grotesque roman head such a tradition ascribes to caesar napoleonic face calm powerful terrible a impassive countenance of sphinx broad forehead prominent nose large eye full of fire determination beard moustache to hide contour of cheek strong curve of mouth skin of marble whiteness whole surmounted by mass of waving hair dark a eye beneath such face be seen on coin of caesar on painted wall of egyptian tomb on carven wall of assyrian palace belong alone to king to hero to conqueror nature mark great men thus when such face of terrible calm appear at interval of century mankind tremble recognise scourge of god destined to whelm world in wave of blood philip came to see xuarez looked lo napoleon struggle be unequal whispered to jack a don alonzo unrolled paper yes replied duval in same tone force be too weak to stand against power of junta philip smiled scornfully what can junta do against face said contemptuously there stand greatest man in cholacaca d n muttered engineer fiercely have carried off dolores silence boy growled tim in voice of subdued thunder don speaking intendante be not particularly brave man hardly liked position in now found mission have appeared to be great grand glorious at tlatonac now assumed quite different complexion to utter threat against rebel xuarez when in society of friend be one thing to order follower of revolutionary president to give up to punishment in middle of army be don alonzo cebrian hummed hawed cleared throat to get down nasty lump impeded speech don hypolito saw confusion said nothing did not even smile sat serenely in chair impenetrable a sphinx at last intendante screwed up courage delivered decree of junta sufficiently badly be true still delivered a legally qualified representative of junta of cholacaca in congress assembled hereby order in arm against republic to surrender to government to deliver up for punishment body of rebel hypolito xuarez for did not finish sentence low murmur of rage arose from supporter of rebel leader half drawing sword looked towards xuarez for authority to cut down daring man who have thus insulted in midst of army don alonzo turned pale at sight of half bared weapon shrank back among friend xuarez leaning chin on hand stared steadily before waited seeing impassive demeanour be not clever enough to know be more dangerous than outburst of rage don alonzo regained spirit more unfitted diplomatist than cebrian must scarcely have be chosen need not speak at great length said rapidly order of excellency francisco gomez be that town of acauhtzin surrender to government deliver up rebel xuarez for punishment submit to clemency of junta if be done at once junta will be lenient if not opal standard will be unfurled inhabitant of acauhtzin will be treated a rebel be decree of don francisco gomez on part of junta of cholacaca delivered by intendante of xicotencatl then cebrian having delivered message sufficiently badly rolled up paper with air of man who have done duty waited reply of rebel leader on side of xuarez frowned heavily made demonstration of wrath at insolence of message waited to hear don hypolito speak mestizo arose to foot addressed not to emissary of republic to own supporter senor said in singularly mellow powerful voice hear decree of so called junta of cholacaca lest must mistake purport of message delivered by don alonzo cebrian will repeat shortly be to lay down arm surrender body to junta trust to tender mercy of rival of tlatonac for judgment be condition if not accepted will bring on thunderbolt of war from government who have not navy scarce army answer hitherto have spoken in low tone clear distinct distinguished by oratorical fire at last word however voice rang through hall like thunder repeated with emphasis answer senor viva xuarez viva el gefe abaja gomez don hypolito listened to

to regard prisoner a kind of samson have profound respect for physical strength for physical beauty splendid frame of young englishman in conjunction with evidence of muscle inspired don hypolito with great admiration bueno senor duval said in frank tone of man who cherishes animosity be difficult person to deal with have broken chain have not arrived thus opportunely might by time have broken out

giving way to righteous indignation while admiring self restraint of young man be doubtful a to meaning of such diplomatic conduct experience have taught don hypolito that only way to fathom feeling of others be to make talk freely listen attentively draw conclusion from chance observation method now applied to jack asked to proceed in grave tone of voice time keeping ear open to find out underlying meaning of impassive demeanour discovered nothing because there be nothing to discover jack spoke truthfully bluntly giving voice to real feeling xuarez accustomed to double dealing to

to start for coast without knowing geography of country be sheer madness jack stamped foot with rage a thought of mile of trackless forest lay between freedom to push one way through virgin forest be difficult in case to make attempt without arm companion food guide be quite impossibility that there be secret way to coast be plain a indian came hither to shrine from tlatonac way be known only to

unpleasant a be position almost forgot peril in contemplating wonderful building around architecture of house be similar to of ancient egypt long range of squat pillar decorated with vivid hue mural painting religious warlike in character massive wall of reddish stone sloping inward a gained height colossal flight of step leading up to cyclopean door way everywhere grotesque image of aztec god from flat roof of house arose truncated tower carved rudely with hideous form of obscure mythology from one must see vast expanse of city interminable line of terrace falling one below other to narrow street great square crowded with people dominated by teocalli by palace far off sombre length of wall stretching across canon while beyond barrier winding cliff of gulch shut out view of world beyond be vague awesome terrible city wore menacing aspect even in cheerful sunlight confused murmur rising upward from street seemed like lamentation of countless victim moaning of countless generation tortured terrified blinded by blood stained deity of anahuac if senor so plea will go to teocalli said cocom after have quite exhausted commercial portion of city there behold opal must like to see

pleasant little programme said duval grimly be pity must not be carried out a propose to run away guess will be hamlet with dane left out bueno cocom let view shamble indian assented having crossed over bridge walked up straight narrow street led to central square such people a passed immediately prostrated on ground in case suffered jack to walk over young engineer felt inclined to kick so enraged did feel at being thus perpetually reminded of probable fate a such conduct must scarcely be politic managed though with difficulty to restrain soon emerged from street between two colossal

not cry out at be going to show said indian disregarding jack remark know what be going to show promise will keep silent bueno senor juan let go ascended step slowly followed by jack who be much puzzled to know reason of warning cocom however have proved to be true friend so duval trusted implicitly be quite satisfied that indian did not speak without cause up interminable step went till jack thought must never reach summit being still weak from illness have to pause three four time during ascent at last arrived at top cocom making jack sit down to rest went into temple during absence of old man patient amused in examining teocalli admiring splendid view outspread before far below must see dual city like map intersected by stream cut clean in two street running at right angle made look like chess board on side of river be great gap of square surrounding green of forest grey worn peak sharply defined against blue sky reddish coloured city in hollow made up inexpressibly beautiful picture must see figure of men woman animal moving like ant through square bright coloured dot of crawling life to ear came hoarse roar of river dashing on rocky bed confused hum of voice faint cry of merchant thin song of woman seated on distant flat roof hither ascended mingled murmur a though busy city exhaled huge sigh of sorrow fear in ear of god whose burden be so heavy upon then turned to view teocalli found not unworthy of regard indeed whole pyramid aroused admiration vast mound of earth faced with coating of adobe covered with silvery cement be feat of engineering at first

star bird fish bow arrow blazing sun be also carved with wonderful skill out of dull hued stone directly over door flamed painted opal darting ray of diver hue a arabesque be gaudily coloured effect may be imagined jack eye ached a grotesque confusion of crude tint blazed in strong sunlight in front of teocalli to left be large serpent skin drum used for summoning devotee of god jack did not look so much at a at object viewed with horrified repugnance be huge block of jasper slanting polished on many unhappy being have be slain on be destined to suffer only by strong effort did keep eye for moment on couch of death then averted with shudder rising from seat walked towards door of temple be met at entrance by cocom indian threw glance down staircase to see that one be ascending then stood on one side to let jack pas into shrine can enter now senor speak with safety be time before jack eye became accustomed to gloom for shrine be only lighted from door in vast apartment twilight

harlequin opal depending from roof by gold thread great jewel twisted slowly round in front of altar height of man from ground with revolution colour changed like of chameleon now must radiate bright green flame then blue ray must flash like streak of lightning through gloom at time whole stone shone yellow a sun oftentimes fierce tongue of red must dart from breast change be caused by constant twirling of cord by be suspended even in half light splendid gem scattered tint on side with utmost brilliance fascinated by magnificent jewel jack stepped forward to examine closely just a laid finger on heard voice beware be woman voice turned in alarm saw woman standing near doorway light fell full on face jack rushed forward with loud cry of joy to clasp in arm be dona dolores chapter vii

meeting here priest suspect nothing trust to cocom will tell plan of escape adios must hide when will see again angelito said jack kissing hurriedly to morrow night in secret way adios ran rapidly towards shrine vanished behind image of war god while jack followed cocom out on to vast platform of pyramid midway on step saw old high priest painfully climbing upward will not find dona dolores in there cocom thus guess have met senor come to see that sacred fire burn that opal yet spin before god if fire must go out opal stand still great calamity must befall city only doe opal pause when

frequently left alone yes senor save at festival be deserted priest climb to temple five hour to see that sacred fire burn see ixtlilxochitli be near be cautious lord when jack paused on downward way priest coming up at once knelt on step to show reverence tell old fool to get up said jack angrily being weary of such mummery lord bid rise ixtlilxochitli translated cocom more politely priest arose with hand folded across breast with downcast eye addressed cocom have lord seen holy shrine thrice sacred chalchuih tlatonac yes lord have be graciously pleased to look at thing be well lord must know well sacred shrine so that on great day be prepared to act part a saviour of city with dignity deuce take dignity cried jack in rage when polite speech be translated say cocom can not knock old

blandly that will not keep longer from sacred office of god be well see that lord have thing cocom city be be for on sacrifice to holy god doe existence of totatzine depend cocom did not deem politic to translate speech to jack fearing lest young man must thereupon carry out threat kick old priest down step already be so exasperated at being perpetually reminded of awful position that must take little more to make kill bland servile priest to punish at least one of enemy before be slain many men must have be paralysed by thought of sacrificial stone peril only more firmly braced jack nerve relying a did on cocom help own energy be determined to escape from totatzine in way meeting with dolores have inspired with fresh energy after leaving ixtlilxochitli climbing step hurried cocom to palace where be living with idea of hearing what plan of escape indian have conceived now that duval have seen dolores reserve hitherto maintained by cocom entirely vanished professed eager to explain design with instinctive caution however refused to converse in lower room where jack habitually slept fearing lest must be overheard be true constantly spoke spanish tongue of priestly spy be woefully ignorant ixtlilxochitli be quite crafty enough to employ coast indian a eavesdropper therefore be wise to put such possibility of betrayal beyond doubt with intent ascended to flat roof of palace even here cocom felt doubtful of being absolutely safe in end climbed mirador sole tower of palace where be quite impossible that must be seen heard from below crouching on hunkers below low wall of tower platform cocom gravely took out cigarette wrapped in maize husk presented to jack who be lying full length against opposite parapet in few minute be smoking talking earnestly priest senor said cocom

to depth of valley ceremony must not take place precisely at dawn a be time before sun rose above peak of surrounding mountain presence be indispensable to ceremony a heart of victim have to be held up by officiating priest for benediction of ray jack rather shrank from witnessing horrible rite particularly a unless succeeded in effecting escape must probably be forced to take part in same function curiosity triumphed over repugnance looked forward eagerly to beholding extraordinary spectacle in grey light of dawn be awakened by thunder of serpent skin drum for hour roared continuously springing out of bed hastily put on clothes have just finished dressing when cocom entered room old indian be arrayed in white cotton garment with chaplet of flower on grey lock have wreath of red

gorgeous feather work adorned person with collar earring girdle bracelet of gold set with rough gem summit of teocalli be unoccupied a priest in sable vestment be waiting for victim at foot of great staircase constant thunder of drum shrilling of discordant trumpet added to wild character of scene jack have sooner made appearance than multitude recognising sacred victim of cycle parted to let pas through immense wave of movement swept across sea of white garment flung on face not even daring to look at august presence of incarnate deity attended by cocom jack passed up avenue opened by religious awe in living mass ultimately gained step of teocalli here saw ixtlilxochitli who waved hand to intimate that have better ascend staircase did without further remark seated on parapet surrounding platform of pyramid jack looked down on throng of people whose dark face be turned upwards to shrine of opal shuddered involuntarily a thought of fanaticism have drawn concourse together devoutly did pray that cocom scheme might be successful a be terrible to think that in presence of such savage must be slaughtered by wild looking priest morning be slightly chilly a valley be yet in shadow beyond rim of mountain jack must see ray of rising sun shooting up in roseate sky trembled held breath a single trumpet bellowed below leaning over parapet saw that procession of priest be now escorting victim up stair case cocom manifested emotion be half civilised after horror of coming deed did not strike a particularly awful men must die sometime be cocom philosophic view of matter a well might death take place on sacrificial stone a in other way jack felt flesh creep at idea of what must soon behold cocom with folded arm stood like statue of bronze silent indifferent unmoved up staircase climbed that ghastly procession victim handsome young indian tall slender seemed indifferent to fate bore part in ceremony with becoming dignity a ascended height one by one threw away ornament rich robe chaplet of flower bracelet earring girdle mantle of feather work cotton robe of white be strewed on step like wreckage when arrived at summit of teocalli be completely naked with splendid muscular development immobile face absolute repose standing nude by jasper stone of sacrifice looked like magnificent bronze statue jack must not admire stoical resignation with met death ixtlilxochitli vanished through open door of shrine sable clad priest looking like demon in religious frenzy held up arm to east wild barbaric chant flowed from mouth weird ear piercing rising falling like wave of sea chanted long line of invocation to sun be answered by confused roar from multitude below so fierce so savage be music jack shuddered closed eye with victim made sign then high priest clad in scarlet robe holding knife of itzli in hand came forth from presence of god made sign to officiating priest rim of sun be just seen above height when five priest darted forward seizing impassive victim flung on altar stone appealing cry to huitzilopochtli arose from worshipper drum rolled trumpet bellowed ixtlilxochitli rapidly opening breast of young man tore out heart multitude prostrated humbly immense sigh exhaled upward from thousand breast after holding bleeding heart to sun now full in sight high priest flung at foot of idol jack felt sick with horror at consummation of tragedy closed eye for moment when opened again dead body of victim be rolling down step of teocalli to plunge into sea of white boiling in square horrible muttered to cocom priest be devil hush senor replied indian in low voice be cautious now consult opal wiping perspiration from forehead duval leaning on arm of cocom entered shrine be crowded with priest made way for respectfully a great drum outside commenced to roll out thunder knelt in presence of deity even cocom bowed before god jack be only one standing small fire of coal burned on altar thereon ixtlilxochitli flung priceless gum storax copal odorous resin rich perfume spread through temple thick cloud of white smoke rolled upward veiling hideous face of war god hiding now rapidly revolving opal chant arose sad melancholy a sweeping of wind through tree supplicating sorrowful appeal to terrible deity who have be thus propitiated with blood with heart of man thin shaft of sunlight entering temple through unseen opening smote great gem with fierce fire causing to glitter with blinding splendour eye be fixed on opal continued spinning incessantly darting ray of red blue yellow green jack at glance saw how miracle be done priest cunningly twisted gold string attached to roof a slowly unwound great gem revolved whether left colour be to show when still to chance jack did not know must have have trick to make pause when chose for felt certain red side of stone must ultimately reveal in semi darkness kept gaze on jewel twirling in yellow glare heard a in dream roar of throng far below waiting announcement of god will teocalli be a island in midst of sea against huge base living wave beat without intermission at first opal spun rapidly throwing out spark of coloured fire then gradually slowed down a string unwound slower slower twisted sparkling ray of emerald green dazzling shaft of blue glory of golden haze at last motion be hardly perceptible worshipper held breath in reverential awe moved slightly paused began to revolve slowly backward then with slow oscillation hung motionless from roof from out white breast shot fierce glare of violent crimson will of god be war amid dead silence ixtlilxochitli stalked forth to verge of staircase now wearing only black garment held up scarlet mantle a sign that opal be red frantic shout of delight roared upward to sky multitude below broke into frenzy of joy religious ceremony be at end festival have commenced por el amor de dios let go back to room whispered jack in ear of cocom if stay here will assuredly smash that idol kick old ixtlilxochitli down step unwilling to risk scandal cocom hurried charge out of temple at once ixtlilxochitli came forward a jack departed evidently expecting to be congratulated on successful performance young engineer with gesture of repugnance turned back on old villain sprang down step of teocalli high priest looked grave dissatisfaction of visible deity be bad omen place be hell upon earth cried jack throwing down on couch how many victim do sacrifice to infernal deity cocom old man counted on finger senor about one hundred in year more le how terrible yes don juan more be offered up in old day be said by priest at dedication of great teocalli in mexico seventy thousand victim be offered to huitzilopochtli butchery tell what cocom if get safely back war be concluded in favour of junta will get don francisco gomez to send army to stop sort of thing cocom smiled scornfully nay senor army must reach city of totatzine be hidden secret way be narrow a will see besides don juan must not aid army to come city be sacred believe in devil worship senor still be religion of father wish destroyed jack saw that proposition be distasteful to old indian so did not make further remark fearful of raising anger in cocom breast if one friend refused to assist dolores must hope to escape therefore jack be wise held peace shortly afterwards intimated desire to sleep in order to prepare for fatigue of midnight journey so cocom left departed to make arrangement for escape day long festival continued even through massive wall of room jack must hear shriek yell of worshipper a maddened with pulque aguardiente once have curiosity to ascend to flat roof look down on square be filled with mass of frenzied human being who danced sang bellowed wildly cut with knife others climbing up to summit of teocalli flung headlong down staircase great fire be lighted in square ring of indian men woman danced round singing frantically everywhere priest long haired sable robed inciting worshipper to fresh frenzy constantly wild piping of barbaric music rumbling of drum be horrible sight madness of multitude after glance so jack descended to bedroom to think over future be anxious to regain tlatonac see friend once more philip peter tim must be grieving for loss doubt thought that be at acauhtzin not pent up in city of devildom jack knew well that philip must never have turned bohemian nose south unless have be compelled to do so against heavy gun of ship fort bravest man must hing yacht have be forced to retreat doubtless philip have steamed direct to tlatonac insisted on army being sent to acauhtzin to release friend dolores must not be a jack felt sure there be transport to take soldier northward by sea inland route be impossible how have war gone have torpederas arrived have don hypolito sent war ship filled with soldier southward to attack janjalla from thence forced way overland to capital campaign must probably be conducted a theorised by don rafael xuarez must first capture janjalla march troop northward across plain to effect conjunction with indian before wall of tlatonac then bring war ship up to capital in way city must be assaulted on side bombarded by war ship stormed by regular troop of opposidores indian tribe must escape thought duval a restlessly tossed turned on couch last order of opal will send indian army to wall of tlatonac know most of plan of xuarez when tell to don francisco may be able to thwart be now two week since be taken by infernal don hypolito can not regain tlatonac for at least five six day if indeed then three week be long time many event may have happened hope fellow be right once get back will manage to baffle xuarez in way thought be not conducive to slumber during afternoon managed to obtain few hour of sleep herbal medicine of cocom have completely restored to health now felt strong enough to undergo hardship of journey to coast dolores however be delicate jack dreaded to think how must suffer still be case of life death so be best to make attempt anything be better than certainty of horrible death for one constant imprisonment for other at cost must escape be case of pike peak bust said jack recalling favourite expression of american comrade hope to lord wo bust trip towards sunset cocom came to wake for great attempt brought very gratifying report a to state of population who be drunk worn out with religious frenzy priest be scarcely better in three hour not soul in sacred city must be capable of observation movement be true that in commercial half of town across torrent many people might be on alert fortunately entrance to secret way be on sacerdotal side of bridge so that two lover must escape unseen jack be delighted to hear that thing promised so well proceeded under supervision of cocom to disguise a indian be not particularly agreeable task for have to strip to buff sponge from head to foot with liquid so a to darken skin be also forced to sacrifice moustache a central american indian have hair on face jack sorely rebelled against demand recognising that there be help for shaved clean a directed stained face dyed hair at length stood out very athletic young indian being thus physically perfect assumed sandal of hide short white cotton drawer loose cotton shirt ample scarlet woollen mantle crown of peacock feather cocom also adorned with plentitude of bracelet jingling ornament thus arrayed jack be supposed to be penitent under vow of silence travelling to coast with sister hope cocom there wo be rain said a followed indian out of room might wash dye off fear no rain replied indian confidently staining will hold senor now not word be dangerous so long have perfecting of disguise taken that be now considerably after eight o'clock moon be shining brilliantly in sky guided by old man jack stepped lightly across square be cumbered with human body in kind of position sleeping heavily from exhaustion others from intoxication whole of immense area looked like battle field strewn with dead men in midst arose huge mound of teocalli menacing formidable not sound broke stillness save sigh of sleeper restless turning of under clear sky lay field of dead a jack stepped gently across prostrate body must not help shuddering remembering cocom caution however uttered sound followed indian towards bridge here in shadow of wall found dolores stained a be lover fantastically tricked out in savage finery when saw jack tall form with nodding plume on head must not restrain exclamation of surprise in moment be clasped in arm peace dear one whispered jack fondly kissing keep heart brave must not wait moment ala querida feel doubtful that will bear fatigue of mountain fear not juanito answered hastily drying tear virgin will sustain protect in wilderness with thee by side have fear cocom impatient of delay made clucking noise with tongue so at once sprang towards guided little distance past bridge towards left paused before high wall pierced by dozen more gateway with massive door grotesquely carved by trick known only to old man opened valve of one door motioned to enter on doing so found in immense oblong court yard decorated round wall with nothing huge statue of god huitzilopochtli cocom have closed outside door standing in open court fugitive must see mode of ingres egress moon shining brightly made thing a clear a day around at interval of yard arose mighty image between be smooth wall be trap out of one must hope to emerge worshipper senor explained cocom in low voice be admitted into court from secret way on right when court be full bandage be removed one can tell how entered how can go out confuses then bandage be replaced be thrust out of many door on to street guided to great square when see behold great teocalli can not tell way by came can dweller in totatzine for none be admitted to court secret way asked jack anxiously be behind one of statue senor jack dolores looked blankly at long line of hideous image against opposite wall one statue be a like other a two pea be absolutely impossible to tell one concealed entrance jack turned to cocom shook head if life depended on must not tell eh senor life doe depend on said cocom grimly enjoying little joke behold walked slowly forward to appearance chose statue at random touching spring in protuberant stomach of idol massive image swung outward revealing dark passage two lover ran forward be stopped by cocom passage senor end with precipice said with emphasis if went down there must fall into torrent misleading way said duval shrinking back with shudder at horrible imagination of idea be there others replied cocom causing several statue to swing out of place passage see don juan snare for unwary let put image back again so now senor observe image of huitzilopochtli have representation of opal in forehead be mark of way throughout see statue swung round cocom stepping boldly into yawning cavity disclosed beckoned to to follow with terrified dolores on arm jack did so found at top of flight of damp looking step once inside cocom pressing spring restored image to proper position then taking jack hand led down staircase clasping dolores tightly cautiously descended into pitchy gloom seemed to be proceeding into bowel of earth down down still down until hoarse roar of torrent struck ear emerging into darkness little le dense than in passage found on rocky ledge below huge structure of bridge almost on level with water at foot swirled foamed flood raging over sharp pointed rock to right path led upward in gentle slope to left similar path descended cocom pointed to latter trap senor said grimly ending in canon take that path must die follow one to right will lead to great platform beyond mountain from thence can descend by great way when in forest track path by scarlet sign of opal always opal senor go nowhere where sign point will remember replied jack confidently take wallet senor contains food for day cacao leaf strong drink will last until reach cave whereof told wait there for will come shortly remember always rule of silence that be penitent sign thus lip forehead now go senor depart to scatter clothes on narrow way spread false report of death in torrent while escaping in four day senor expect at cave adios lady of precious stone senor sprang backward into darkness up stair left lover standing in gloomy inferno with torrent roaring below huge masonry of bridge high above to right perilous way must tread to reach safety duval expected dolores to give way at thus finding in such danger to surprise be brave gay strong come querido said cheerfully let go at once must reach forest before dawn if possible will exhaust terribly angelito probably still must keep up if only for sake come querido let depart moved simultaneously towards right oh interminable passage long narrow always ascending thought must never end at length terminated at foot of waterfall down from great height thundered great mass of water smashing to foam in basin below spray rising fine mist like be damp on face must not hear speak owing to roar jack grasped hand of dolores to give courage turned off abruptly to right where entered passage cut out of solid rock still gently sloping upward path lead out into vast clearing girdled on side by great tree moon shone bright a day across grass ran indistinct track following found great flight of step leading upward under bough of mighty tree pine oak hemlock throwing giant branch across almost shutting out moonlight sky staircase be crumbled old wonderfully built of great block of stone jack must not restrain admiration at titanic work how did do said to dolores a painfully climbed up superb stair must have known lot about engineering toltec to swing block into place must have taken derrick complicated machinery wonderful work wonderful race how philip must enjoy think senor felipe must rather be where be in tlatonac replied dolores wearily must be in casa maraquando cheer up heart will be there in few day will carry cara dios be already laden be a light a feather eh juanito must not find that after carrying for hour so be still able to walk be stronger than think steadily climbed up staircase at length entered narrow gorge described by cocom here jack made girl sit down drink wine did so much good that in few minute declared ready to resume journey thus fortified entered gorge cautiously following winding at length emerged suddenly into circular space so unexpectedly did enter that a passage opened out in direction must not tell by way have come pit for be little else hewn out of rock be fifty sixty foot in depth must have represented year of toil on side innumerable passage darted out like ray be thought caused jack to exclaim be like opal dolores space be stone passage ray so serf double purpose to mislead runaway yet be symbol of chalchuih tlatonac fortune favoured fugitive for moon directly overhead sent down full glory into pit have arrived later must probably have have to wait till dawn a blackness must have be too intense to permit to find true outlet moonlight by happy chance be so strong that after carefully examining side of several entrance jack at length hit on sign huge crimson blot with scarlet ray blazed on passage to right here be dolores cried duval joyfully be right way must be careful not risk snare one can never tell what infernal indian be up to with great caution entered tunnel indicated by sign feeling step before for whole place be intensely dark moved onward at snail pace tunnel wound hither thither until felt quite bewildered for time passage be level after series of turning began to slope gently downwards so continued to entrance hope to heaven there be branch tunnel said jack anxiously must easily go off main track in gloom be sure there be side tunnel replied dolores decisively even priest must not find way through place otherwise than with one way if there be other tunnel must lose that must not care to risk well let move on at event tunnel be getting straighter remarked jack hopefully wish cocom have given torch what be yonder cried dolores pressing arm gleam of light bueno be exit come dolores say word lest when emerge on to platform there must be indian waiting there remember vow of silence encouraged by sign of deliverance hurried rapidly forward quite certain that ground be safe in few minute stepped out of tunnel mouth on to mighty platform half way down mountain jack cast swift glance to right left area of masonry be quite bare be only human being thereon turned to speak to dolores found staring motionless at magnificent scene before platform jack guessed be fully quarter of mile in length enormously wide have first be hewn out of living rock then faced with masonry flagged with stone here be adopted same device for misleading stranger a have be done in court of god at entrance from totatzine whole face of cliff at back of terrace be perforated with tunnel now that have moved to verge of platform of must tell tunnel have come out of saving one passage led to death destruction only one be safe that tunnel distinguished by opal sign one ignorant of sign must have escaped death wonder totatzine remains hidden said jack thoughtfully whole of path be mass of danger snare now however will have clearer way turning towards east beheld vast stair case sloping downward to broad road at side of be giant image of god in pale moonlight looked like demon so frightful be aspect in long line like pillar stretched away eastward into forest ending in dim obscurity on side dense foliage away in distance sea of green tree there be nothing trackless wood great road piercing into emerald profundity like wedge behind arose tall red cliff crowned with ancient tree tunnelled with black cavity from thence spread out platform with huge block of stone wall covered with hieroglyphic statue of fierce god vast pile of truncated tower below forest roadway staircase what terrible place dolores said jack drawing long breath be like abode of demon come be now after midnight moon will soon be setting while have light let try to reach end of yonder avenue one moment juan replied dolores drawing forth something from bosom while cocom be with went up to shrine of huitzilopochtli took in between finger in pale moonlight flashed faintly with weak spark of many coloured fire jack bounded forward harlequin opal exclaimed delighted have taken harlequin opal chapter ix fugitive sun go down twilight wane with reddened spur hanging rein urge steed across plain for be flying far from who must loving mar prison with bolt bar sigh not dear one look not so white castle stand on yonder height will reach e'er morning light future joy night be born wed thee in early morn laugh rival twain to scorn be fifty mile from totatzine to coast dolores being woman weak jack owing to illness not being quite so strong a usual found difficult to do more on average than two mile hour to make up for slow walking stretched out pedestrianism to twelve hour between dawn eve thus reaching sea shore in two day arrived at cave spoken of by cocom be harbour of refuge to in sore distress completely worn out body soul garment still felt certain amount of comfort in three consolation first have escaped from totatzine with life secondly wallet be not yet exhausted of meat drink so that be in danger of starvation thirdly cocom always supposing must hoodwink priest a to share in escape must arrive within twelve hour thereabouts thus fortified with food hope stayed thankfully in cave waited arrival of old indian a to journey from platform to cave have be horrible dream nightmare of hardship of weariness of many pang starting from terrace shortly after midnight have traversed avenue in three hour be five mile in length proceeding at rate of two mile sixty minute can be easily seen that must gain shelter of forest long before dawn great road ended abruptly amid confused heap of ruin forest tree tangled undergrowth doubtless in old time have continued even to coast time indian have obliterated trace of magnificence five mile down former did because be invariable custom to so treat human work set up a enduring for ever latter played havoc with relic of ancestor magnificence so a to hide city of totatzine from eye of white destroyer who have trodden out of existence same ancestor nature have also done share in work of destruction sent wave of green tree across straight line of cause way therefore road began so proudly at foot of great staircase ended suddenly after five mile in tangled wilderness journey from totatzine to point have be long arduous moon have set behind hill so that be now dark to explore unknown forest in such gloom must have be foolish therefore jack insisted that must take rest in midst of old palace constructed bed for dolores with aid of own cloak after seeing safely bestowed therein lay down at entrance so a to act a sleeping sentinel if such thing be possible nothing particular occurred however when awoke sun be already high in heaven then made frugal breakfast resumed journey way being no longer clearly defined progress be necessarily slow from point to right on trunk of tree appeared sign of scarlet opal a before pictured on rock so to right went at once even at few step from causeway found in heart of wild tropical forest there be something terrible to two civilised being about primeval savagery of vegetation exuberant foliage dense tangled almost impenetrable reminded jack of wood grown by fairy power round palace of sleeping beauty that forest however be to keep lover out ala served to keep lover in lay between coast quite thirty five mile of wild growth at time dolores almost despaired of breaking through barrier not so jack be hopeful of ultimate success being strengthened in faith by constant appearance of opal sign on side of rose giant tree of hoary age trunk seemingly supporting verdant roof above head at time so dense be leaf sky sun kindly light be shut out entirely moved through translucent twilight of tremulous green from trunk bough depended liana like rope binding forest giant together dropping to ground formed ladder up climbed most exquisite flower splendid tree fern drooped gigantic frond on high springing thickly from tall pillar rough brown hairy below ground be thick with brilliant blossom seized chance offered by rock liana trunk to climb upward to light excluded by sea of foliage overhead at step forest changed appearance a though be enchanted wood here be savagery gloom step forward lo wide sunny glade one moment be surrounded by moss covered rock next noble avenue of palm opened vista before pool of water sparkled here there babbling brook winding capriciously in out in wayward circle at time sudden gleam of waterfall threading downwards in white streak from giant rock again miasma of swamp black evil looking in whose water rolled trunk of fallen tree everywhere flower bursting into bloom everywhere new leaf swelling into being everywhere exuberant life of tropic climate atmosphere be warm damp clammy air permeated wood whole place be one vast hothouse where fecundation went on unceasingly throughout rich perfume pervaded air heavy sickly languorous fortunately jack sight have be rendered keen by profession else must have be difficult to have discerned sign on trunk of tree mossy rock scarlet be noticeable colour have opal sign be only red hue in forest there must have be difficulty in matter everywhere scarlet flower made fire of intense emerald of foliage grass dazzling mass of crimson verbena glared fiercely in dim gloom vermilion blossom burned like lamp in dense brushwood wreath of ruddy leaf made streak like vein overhead ground blazed with pink carmine purple of infinite variety of blossom be difficult to pick out red opal sign amid constant repetition of same tint jack by careful observation managed to do so being guided at time by well defined path indeed often be tempted to ignore sign go only by path a numerous branch led off from omphalos of great road be afraid of going astray so kept reckoning by opal alone for two day travelled through zone of verdure at length by salt smell in air became aware that be nearing ocean at time met indian gaudily dressed with painted face deadly looking weapon on observing scarlet mantle of pair receiving sign on lip forehead stepped aside to let pas recognised that traveller be proceeding eastward by will of god under vow of silence superstition stronger than greed cruelty protected from savage of wilderness journey be not dull in spite of anxiety dread of being followed on side forest be full of life dolores be delighted to see constant flashing of humming bird green red yellow glory darted through still air like flying gem once saw yellow hide of jaguar black spotted sleek terrible jack have nothing knife given to by cocom regretted that have not revolver with knife be poor weapon to do battle with terrible foe to relief however animal only eyed for few minute in startled surprise then slunk away among undergrowth other peril from wild animal have none sometimes whole air must be alive with butterfly purple yellow spotted azure striped fluttered everywhere one must have thought flower be alive flew from stem to stem peter a jack thought must have be in element forest be true paradise of butterfly have time to admire skill fecundity of nature resolutely following opal sign pushed onward through forest saw on side puzzle monkey tree with sharp spike ombu tree whose shade be so dense aloe whose branch spread outward like seven stemmed candlestick of revelation palm mango wild fig tree cactus burning with fleshy scarlet blossom willow laguna swampy pool of water filled with sedge rush slimy weed din be constant monkey swung from bough to bough overhead chattered without ceasing parrot gay plumaged harsh voiced shrieked discordantly in ear roaring of jaguar puma sounded faint in distance like muffled thunder ever rasped stridulation of restless grasshopper unseen noisy such wealth of invention such overpowering luxuriance wore out sens wearied soul jack dolores be glad when sharp salt smell of sea struck knife like through enervating atmosphere have be travelling since dawn now at noon on third day of departure from totatzine beheld great waste of water flashing like mirror in sun jack must have greeted a did hellens of epaminondas with joyful cry of thalatta thalatta have forgotten greek be too weary to feel poetic at stage of journey met with many indian who here landed in order to proceed to shrine of opal dolores be much afraid of secret being discovered even jack be somewhat doubtful of efficacy of vow of silence in case a in others fanaticism proved safeguard for passed unharmed even unspoken to through mass of savage on arriving at verge of sea jack at once sought out cave described by cocom leading dolores thereto for short space of time be in safety from point a jack have learned in totatzine city of tlatonac be distant about twenty mile down coast a there be plenty of canoe drawn up on beach must have be easy for to have proceeded at once on journey gratitude to cocom however prevented remained that night in cave in order to await arrival hiding place be natural cavern of wide extent after making dolores a comfortable a must jack retired to entrance kept guard lest must be surprised by wandering savage throughout perilous journey nothing must exceed tenderness chivalry with duval behaved towards dolores be tireless in effort to spare fatigue in keeping up spirit in guarding from annoyance consequent on travelling ill provided through dense forest dolores said nothing at time took silent note of courtesy over over again breathed thankful prayer that man whom loved have proved so noble in hour of danger be disagreeable position to girl brought up a have be in strict observance of etiquette jack came triumphantly through ordeal gained rather than lost in eye by nobility of character by rare delicacy of behaviour only thing that duval feared be that loss of opal might cause priest to mistrust cocom story send out word far wide that sacred gem have be torn from temple be true that have gained twelve hour start owing to delicacy of dolores constitution have travelled very slowly to coast at moment messenger with news of theft might arrive on scene in such event indian on coast must be examined a to whether man woman have passed seaward in company owing to clothes being scattered in gorge priest supposing did not trust sign of death must know be disguised a indian therefore dress must avail little must vow of silence be of much use a in crisis must be questioned a to whom be to what tribe did belong a of must speak word of indian situation must become serious only hope therefore that have of safety be of arrival of cocom without delay if arrived next morning must be well if not jack discussed advisability of taking canoe proceeding at once to tlatonac at dawn next morning be eating hurried meal in cave talking over advisability of making retreat while be yet time a soon a find out opal be missing whole country will rise in arm said jack emphatically indian will be questioned closely within without town news wo reach coast for time juan question very much if have not reached coast now replied jack trifle drily from end of road be many other path to coast so swift messenger might have passed in way let hope however that be not case cocom will be first to bring news that opal be lost cocom will guess have taken opal doubtless question be whether will permit to take to tlatonac why not juanito be guardian of opal be mine querida be wrong be property of huitzilopochtli be only guardian mere honorary position doe not entail possession of stone proper place according to indian superstition be in shrine of totatzine cocom be christian will not care about taking dios be not so sure of dolores cocom by own profession be brought up idolater old habit cling be true that be converted by good padre have doubt catholicism be very fair for indian if doe not worship war god at least belief in prophetic quotation of opal thus believing may resent being taken from shrine then will say nothing about useless angelito cocom know that other person than must dare to steal chalchuih tlatonac be with time so will know can not be naturally enough will think be therefore betray think will do after trouble must be foolish of to now play traitor for then concurrence in escape must become known get into bad odour with priest be possible that might insist on leaving opal behind to be sent back to totatzine cried dolores decisively will rather throw into sea now that gem be away from shrine horrid priest may stop sacrificing men to idol besides added naively be mine ah be sufficient reason replied duval smiling like woman querida be fond of gem like to part with one be very beautiful sighed dolores taking stone from breast see how glitter juanito ah what be that long shrill whistle sounded outside cave cocom cried jack starting to foot hide opal for present dolores be indeed cocom who entered cocom looking much older than usual quite worn out with long journey from totatzine saluted gravely wrapping in zarape crouched on floor of cave with eye intently fixed on expression of face be a usual jack be quite unable to decide whether approved of resented rape of shining precious stone look tired cocom said jack passing flask of aguardiente take drink of will do good old man greedily seized flask drained to

jack out on jasper stone like corpse on dissecting table be quiet chamber of horror said baronet angrily mention such thing there be one great good gained out of much evil observed don miguel reflectively possession of opal strengthens greatly against xuarez how so asked philip curiously because priest ixtlilxochitli will not be able to manage indian for without stone be afraid senor mischief be done said jack gravely opal declared war now indian will join don hypolito be pity ca get up counter prophecy make opal declare peace remarked philip quietly then indian must take part in war fancy be impossible said miguel shaking head must must be so if indian must only keep quiet xuarez must find great difficulty in accomplishing plan must janjalla fall xuarez concentrate own men indian before tlatonac will be hard to beat back janjalla will not fall cried rafael in fiery tone there be brave men defending will hold out till reinforced regiment march southward to morrow torpederas iturbide go next day between two will conquer rebel will try at event son said maraquando smiling at young man enthusiasm meanwhile be best to look on side of question with opal stone in tlatonac can not fail declared jack have seen senor maraquan yet dolores be too agitated to show to here be cousin said rafael rising to foot brings opal with before finished sentence dolores now

not to tell of love seeing be englishman heretic now however if have done anything to deserve gratitude ask in presence of friend to give consent to marriage of dolores don miguel be silent for few moment then turned slowly towards niece do love don juan dolores raised head looked not at questioner at jack yes replied simply have loved long time senor said maraquando with great dignity be true

rafael for janjalla in torpedera montezuma peter have also be invited to visit seat of war although man of peace decided to go a be anxious about tim that redoubtable warrior be at janjalla with general gigedo busily engaged in wiring sensational account of siege to morning planet tim be particularly anxious that janjalla must not fall into hand of don hypolito a be spot whence started telegraph wire for south if xuarez captured town force of junta must be driven back to tlatonac a likely a not wire must be cut by rebel therefore tim must be unable to transmit news to england a be made good use of time took full possession of telegraph office in janjalla a to philip decided to march by land with regimiento de los caballeros of corp be now officer colonel garibay commander of regiment be already at janjalla having be sent there by president gomez on special message to general gigedo regiment be therefore under command of captain velez who be great admirer of philip made much of altogether reinforcement amounting to close on thousand men be now on way south to assist general gigedo in holding janjalla torpederas in company with armed cruiser iturbide be to proceed there by sea in order to destroy if possible three ship of enemy now bombarding town there be doubt that war have begun badly for junta be fault of president gomez more obstinate man never existed having made up mind that xuarez must attack tlatonac without delay have foolishly withdrawn garrison from janjalla puebla de los naranjos chichimec other town for protection of capital be in vain that don miguel warned by son represented that be more than probable xuarez must attack janjalla first in order to concentrate troop in south so march across plain to tlatonac president refused to take view of matter by withdrawal of garrison left whole of southern cholacaca in unprotected condition effect of policy be most disastrous warned by spy feeble defence must be offered by janjalla don hypolito sent southward without delay transport filled with troop convoy of three war ship hoped to capture garrison janjalla with own men before junta became aware of design thus secure important town a basis of operation at acauhtzin be hemmed in by mountain unable to march troop overland to capital in south between janjalla tlatonac be vast alluvial plain over must lead army be intention to effect conjunction with forest indian before wall of opal city having ordered war ship to bombard by sea thus attack capital on two side at once between two fire deemed that city must speedily yield becoming aware that war ship have gone south don francisco speedily saw how foolishly have acted ordered five hundred men to at once proceed to janjalla to defend against rebel sent back troop to garrison inland town thus hoped to stretch barrier between rebel capital whole danger lay in south for a yet indian be quiet rising be apprehended on part though jack be doubtful a to advisability of trusting to appearance quite believed that campaign must be conducted by xuarez a have be prophesied by don rafael must not help deploring that incompetent man a gomez be at head of affair if must only leave thing alone not interfere said to philip on eve of departure general know more about warfare than doe man as be with there replied philip heartily have made muddle of thing already who as must send only five hundred men to janjalla when be about to be bombarded by three men of war attacked by two thousand rebel troop even reinforcement be not strong enough sending troop southward in dribblets will end in being cut to piece must not be surprised if even now xuarez be in possession of janjalla with such basis for operation will make hot for republic what do think ought to have be done be speaking to colonel garibay came to same conclusion don francisco ought to have taken warning of rafael concentrated most of troop at janjalla capital be well defended by fort can look after janjalla on other hand be in fit state of defence to resist heavy gun of three ship pounding at wall a take great aim must be to prevent don hypolito from getting footing in south by capturing janjalla then must have nothing sea acauhtzin for field of operation in north owing to mountain can hing now have torpederas can not have own way at sea well supposing capture janjalla philip shrugged shoulder result be plain enough instead of mountain between tlatonac have nothing plain on can manoeuvre troop will capture intervening town seduce to cause then will arrive at tlatonac while be besieging from inland fleet will bombard from sea be if torpederas sink ship of course be talking of campaign from don hypolito point of view one thing be certain if capture janjalla war may be prolonged for month think of ruin will mean to country philip spoke truly hitherto cholacaca have enjoyed immunity from horror of war from year when under leadership of zuloaga republic have thrown off yoke of spain there have be peace for period of forty five year fratricidal war constantly convulsed community of south america be not to be found in history of cholacaca republic kept well within border be at peace with neighbour under rule of wise ruler devoted to improving material condition be true that greater part of country consisted of wild forest filled with unconquered indian cholacacans have always be able to keep savage at bay coast line of north immense alluvial plain of south be thoroughly civilised covered with thriving town two secondary capital janjalla in south acauhtzin in north looked up to respected powerful sister city tlatonac who held seat in central portion of sea board must be admitted that bore grudge against a nearly commerce of country poured into wall from thence to be distributed over civilised world why must tlatonac be capital when be equally suited for post have rich country behind exported good far wide have municipal institution wall rampart palace magnificent church why therefore must be forced to send ship to port of tlatonac there to pay toll custom duty junta have constituted tlatonac starting point of vessel according to law ship from north south be forced in going coming to report at capital by mean tlatonac dominated sister city held firmly under thumb reason that tlatonac be chosen to be capital by zuloaga be very plain be situated in centre of coast line thus commanded equally north south have be shrine of opal tradition of stone closely interwoven with history of country greatest reason of harbour be finest in cholacaca moreover road from most of inland town diverged to capital thus rendering communication easy while janjalla environed by swamp acauhtzin girdled by forest be more le shut off from heart of country when inland trader must transport good to tlatonac at cost must take to of other two town be not likely from commercial point of view that must ever forsake capital under circumstance can well be seen that gomez have good reason to doubt fidelity of janjalla northern town have through jealousy of tlatonac sided with rebel be just possible that southern city might follow suit only thing in favour of janjalla remaining faithful be that while town be jealous of capital be equally jealous of one populace of janjalla knew well that if xuarez conquered that must transfer seat of government to acauhtzin out of gratitude for help must certainly not assist cause calculated to elevate rival city republic be very wealthy exported tobacco coffee cacao cotton rice maize cattle plain be covered with grain mountain be rich in ore population extremely industrious with exception of area covered by forest whole country be cultivated now formation of railway through forest up to acauhtzin promised opening up of northern land already fifty mile of railway have pierced enormous belt of timber lying between acauhtzin capital from main line branch be to extend to different town so a to connect with seat of government unfortunately promise of prosperity be now interrupted by war there be doubt that don hypolito be source of infinite trouble to country indian coming from sacred city of totatzine be now revenging on descendant of conquistador for treatment of ancestor have genuine cause for dissatisfaction a at time when raised standard of revolt country be thoroughly prosperous wealth gained by export of republic be used by president to open up interior of continent to supply tlatonac with refinement of civilisation army be well drilled well clothed well armed wall of city be built on most approved system of engineering science principal square be lighted by electricity million have be expended on drainage in formation of interior road in construction of proposed railway to acauhtzin republic have even formed nucleus of navy have already three war ship in hand two torpederas coming when war broke out now war ship have revolted to xuarez northern capital be bound to cause ambitious indian assuming name race of spaniard have plunged country into what promised to be disastrous war effect be ruinous business be at standstill export be stopped capital be declared in state of siege whole country resounded with tramp of army clash of arm thunder of cannon industry be paralysed many of country people crowding to capital rendered food dear to avoid horror of famine ruin threatened republic be absolutely necessary that xuarez must be crushed at once president gomez be warrior certainly be judicious ruler in time of peace saw at once terrible calamity likely to ensue must war be prolonged already regretted folly in not taking advice of don miguel so far a be possible repaired mistake thousand men be sent to relief of janjalla by land iturbide in company with torpederas left for seat of war by sea if reinforcement must succour janjalla in time if torpederas must sink rebel ship then there must be hope of war being brought to speedy conclusion a be whole danger lay in probability of don hypolito capturing janjalla from whence must threaten capital intervening town jack be very anxious that philip must come with in montezuma baronet be obstinately set on going with regiment will be in janjalla before jack for between town lie war ship while have to march across easy plain in safety yes if indian stop nonsense there be chance of be not so certain philip don hypolito have spy a know when hears that reinforcement be advancing southward will probably send word to ixtlilxochitli to have intercepted a know plain be fringed to west by forest so indian must break out from thence perhaps exterminate troop what exterminate thousand soldier armed with rifle impossible well doe seem impossible however a wo come with go a please will meet at janjalla of course will see from wall being chased by pizarro cortes be talking in patio of casa maraquando philip be tricked out in bravery of uniform looked remarkably handsome eulalia sighed a thought be about to leave coquetry have be laid aside have confessed that be deeply in love with americano philip fully returned affection intended on returning from janjalla

lady eulalia hastily snatching bunch of jasmine from breast let drop when be directly underneath baronet dexterously caught pressing kiss on blossom fastened in jacket in minute so disappeared round corner of street on way to puerta de la culebra from whence troop marched southward to janjalla after disappearance of philip eulalia took further interest in proceeding of day retired to room followed by dolores who strove to console jack not caring for sole companionship of dona serafina excused on plea that wanted to ride after troop give philip message to tim dona serafina graciously permitted to depart dashed out of house flung on horse be waiting at door be about to ride towards puerta de la culebra when don rafael came riding at full speed out of plaza young man seemed much excited in headlong rush knocked down two three people so crowded be street never heeding cry raced past jack waving hand to montezuma mi amigo news of war ship anxious to know what fresh event have taken place fearful that janjalla have fallen jack spurred horse after rafael at break neck speed clattered down street to sea gate scattering crowd in direction outside sea gate rafael headed to left where torpedera montezuma be lying jumping off horse threw rein to peon called boat jack followed example in few moment be pulling for torpedo vessel carambo mi amigo said jack breathlessly ride like devil what be matter now excellency have just received news that two of war ship have returned to acauhtzin what have given up siege be acting a convoy to transport xuarez be sending more troop south knowing that torpederas be not ready think that pizarro single handed be sufficient to blockade janjalla then have landed other troop said jack a sprang on board montezuma ship gun have evidently silenced fort permitted rebel to get on shore precisely what matter reinforcement be now on way by land friend will start to morrow by sea to smash up pizarro will torpederas be ready must be ready cried rafael stamping foot may never get such chance if can only sink pizarro will dishearten troop of xuarez now besieging janjalla can be easily defeated if can manage that will be sad blow to don hypolito dios so must think replied rafael laughing gaily will come south with more troop find janjalla occupied by way barred by two torpederas iturbide then pizarro loss wo please carajo bueno forget pizarro have search light torpedo netting not last mi amigo interrupted rafael quickly told before netting be left behind in tlatonac when war ship left for acauhtzin a to search light can keep on iturbide on other torpedera then friend montezuma will make thing unpleasant for be mere chance rafael quien sabe retorted young man shrugging shoulder warfare be mere chance come look over boat a fitting of torpederas be somewhat complicated engineer have be sent out from england in charge being paid heavily by junta remained to manoeuvre boat among jack discovered scotchman from aberdeen with whom struck up friendship gentleman whose clan be mackenzie showed over boat spoke in term of great affection of whitehead torpedo eh mon observed to jack a surveyed triumph of modern warfare jouist gie shove will smash hail boatie to bit into sma ' bit be if ship propose to smash doe bring heavy gun to bear on boat hoot hoot mon montyzumy can gang ain gait nineteen knot hour ma certie wud tack braw gun to catch like o ' when returned on deck from inspection of ship note be brought to rafael from captain pedraza of iturbide requesting presence on board dropped into boat be speedily clambering up giant side of cruiser being conducted to state room found captain pedraza surrounded by officer reading message from president ola mi amigo cried captain gaily be just in time senor juan be servant don rafael leave tlatonac for janjalla to morrow afternoon why in afternoon carambo so a to reach janjalla at night pizarro be lying there in harbour under cover of darkness may be able to sink either with gun by mean of torpedo will torpederas be ready asked jack for second time may be certain of said rafael significantly will guarantee that montezuma will be able to start at appointed time can say same of zuloaga observed slim man in whom jack recognised commander of other torpedo boat think senor can be looked on a certain that three can depart after babel of talk ensued concerning chance of surprising pizarro proposed one place amid excitement jack growing weary of arguing slipped out of saloon went ashore so a to have a much time a possible with dolores before departure strolled along sea shore met cocom just outside sea gate old man saluted gravely senor said mysteriously approaching jack beware of ixtlilxochitli what do mean cocom asked duval rather startled indian senor be now on war path to south added cocom significantly great heaven ejaculated young man horror struck intend to surprise reinforcement be so senor cocom have sent runner after to warn senor bueno cocom be safeguard of cholacaca not senor chalchuih tlatonac oh have much belief in don juan said cocom significantly indian obeyed stone implicitly be sacred what speaks do red be burned war be proclaimed senor if flamed blue then must indian be at peace before jack must say word cocom mysteriously slipped away leaving young man sorely puzzled a to meaning that confounded opal said a resumed way towards casa maraquando meet one at turn say opal be unlucky certainly chalchuih tlatonac have not brought much luck to a yet chapter xii naval engagement new style wot fightin ' said sailor man to be wooden legged close on eighty three why bless sir who know what fightin ' be when iron pot be classed a men of war kittles sail sea without spar such wessels be not seen at trafalgar old nelson said sailor man to be lying like hatter must see be with when frenchies line broke with wooden ship sailor heart of oak great three decker cannon voice awoke minute a thundered thro ' smoke oh blow said sailor man to language admit be rather free now sends black torpedo seek to hit wessel sideways then leak sink while sailor prays shriek wot fightin ' why be murder yah sneak on leaving cocom jack at once went to don miguel informed of indian rising maraquando thought little of affair a be unlikely unarmed savage must dare to attack force of one thousand soldier besides journey to janjalla be through civilised cultivated country indian raid be improbable nevertheless at jack urgent request spoke to president gomez about matter though excellency took same view a did maraquando yet sent on messenger to overtake reinforcement inform of possible danger next day at three o'clock vessel be to leave for janjalla when hour came be found that torpederas be far from ready be true iturbide be in state of efficiency must have left tlatonac at appointed time complicated engine of montezuma zuloaga be somewhat out of gear though engineer worked day night to get everything in order yet be not until three day have elapsed that squadron be ready to start delay made rafael feel very uneasy lest consort of pizarro must return south before must sink by torpedo reckoned out matter with jack dios mi amigo three day have gone since cortes columbus passed tlatonac with transport to north be three hundred mile to acauhtzin boat steam at rate of twelve knot hour true interrupted jack significantly transport be so juan let reckon accordingly steaming at rate of twelve knot war ship must probably reach acauhtzin in twenty five hour allowing for slowness of transport say thirty hour in twenty four hour will be able to take in troop provision horse gun make fifty four hour steaming south to tlatonac thirty hour eighty four hour to janjalla from here be hundred mile say twelve hour in ninety six hour divide by twenty four be exactly four day at rate rebel ship can not possibly reach janjalla before to morrow midnight when do leave here about three o'clock said rafael glancing at watch torpederas can knock out eighteen knot full speed of iturbide be fifteen will reckon at so by leaving here at three can reach janjalla long before midnight bueno will have clear twenty four hour in to sink pizarro twelve contradicted rafael captiously must attack in darkness le risk better see that make much difference retorted jack grimly if pizarro can fight two torpedo boat armed cruiser be mighty clever ship look upon pizarro a lost so do juan replied rafael with sad expression flitting across face be ship know be sorry that fall to lot to sink perhaps will surrender not while be commanded by de galvez be first lieutenant be a obstinate a devil dios there be noon have not much time in to make adieu go up see dolores mi amigo return by two o'clock jack gladly took advantage of permission have long interview with dolores who wept bitterly at idea of parting with again be already low spirited through having comforted eulalia now that own lover be going away broke down entirely promise will take greatest care of querido dearest will ask rafael to wrap in cotton wool indeed cara need not fear will be a safe on board montezuma a in tlatonac will be gone many day week at most if succeed in sinking pizarro will steam north to meet other war ship try luck with will pray for juanito will look after beetle of don pedro jack burst out laughing at incongruity of such coupling have don pedro asked to look after rubbish yes juanito be to take very greatest care be precious in doctor eye be more precious than opal by way where be peter have said farewell departed with uncle must must come down to boat querido dare not never knew such particular people a tlatonacians muttered jack somewhat vexed well angelito must say good bye here will take opal for good fortune juan take opal dear dolores must be frightened out of life at carrying treasure with keep opal with in tlatonac then will good fortune of city be assured will take ring turquoise ruby pearl said dolores drawing off finger be mother querido now be thousand thousand thanks alma de mi alma replied jack slipping on little finger will remind ever of ruby for lip pearl for teeth ah what for turquoise said dolores seeing be rather nonplussed for eye be black well will say turquoise for peace blue ray of opal mean peace now good bye dearest own one adios juanito soul heart jack not trusting to speak further kissed passionately hastily left house fortunately met one much to gratification a be too agitated to say word went to house put necessary together then in company with peter went on board montezuma at three o'clock fort saluted squadron iturbide followed by torpederas stood out to sea crowd on beach watched vessel until be mere speck on horizon then retreated within wall with loudly expressed hope that must return with rebel ship in tlatonacians expected much more than be ever likely to obtain three vessel stood out about ten mile from coast steamed southward at great speed a pedraza did not wish to fetch janjalla until darkness have set in a two warship transport have gone to acauhtzin be probable that pizarro must be only vessel left in harbour vigilant watch must be kept on board lest torpederas must come on unawares rebel commander knew perfectly well that torpederas have arrived must soon be in chase of ship did not expect that must be able to attack while other war ship be away still be probable pizarro must make good use of search light pedraza wishing to come to close quarter unexpectedly have to exercise greatest care a drew near harbour towards nine o'clock be off coast of janjalla intense excitement prevailed on board three vessel plan of attack have be settled at general counsel on board iturbide before left tlatonac be arranged a follows iturbide be to steam silently into harbour of janjalla followed by torpederas come to close quarter with pizarro if possible must be discovered by search light of latter be then to steam boldly ahead concentrate attention of rebel on pizarro thus being busy with cruiser must not notice torpederas must then steal silently within five hundred yard launch whitehead so result must be obvious torpederas with twin screw powerful engine manoeuvred with wonderful rapidity darting here there in darkness like black shark be armed with hotchkiss gun four whitehead torpedo tube while strong search light protected against unexpected approach of enemy painted dark colour to escape notice must steal silently within striking distance of vessel sink with one of deadly explosive only chance of safety for pizarro lay in sighting at considerable distance keeping at bay with heavy gun a must be fully taken up with iturbide must be difficult for to do worst of have defence against rapid darting torpederas a net have be left behind in tlatonac when deserted to rebel xuarez a to cruiser be handsome vessel with spar deck filled with bow chaser gatling gun carried crew of ninety men including officer also two hundred soldier who have embarked at tlatonac to be landed if possible at janjalla fifteen knot be usual speed if necessary must stand to seventeen be fleet of junta now manoeuvred ten mile from town of janjalla waiting signal to pounce down on unsuspecting pizarro fortunately night be cloudy dark at interval moon emerging from behind heavy cloud cast pale light over scene be far down in west must soon drop behind low lying shore so pedraza who wanted complete darkness for project waited until disappearance before gave signal to steam into harbour light be extinguished on vessel so a to avoid attracting attention of enemy if necessary search light must blaze forth in instant torpederas be to attack warship one on port other on starboard side be now close upon midnight a moon showed half orb above shore waited signal in breathless silence what be to be done if sink pizarro asked jack a stood by rafael watching for signal from iturbide quien sabe replied maraquando shrugging shoulder expect will wait in harbour till daylight then see if can land troop there wo be much chance of comandante said duval drily between janjalla two thousand rebel troop lie encamped can not break through barrier forget mi amigo there be close on thousand troop of junta in town by time reinforcement must have reached destination so will make two thousand if attack rebel from janjalla land two hundred men under cover of iturbide gun who know what may not be able to crush scoundrel before warship transport arrive from acauhtzin bueno always presuming that reinforcement have arrived safely fear indian carambo surely thousand well armed soldier be match for horde of naked savage reinforcement be safe in janjalla by now be sure of believe don juan will exterminate rebel first will have to exterminate pizarro hold interrupted rafael joyfully signal rocket shot up from iturbide scattered fire in dark air moon have entirely disappeared intense gloom prevailed over land sea hardly have rocket trail of fire disappeared when iturbide screw began to spin followed by torpederas moved cautiously towards harbour at half speed at end of hour three vessel be within sight of town through gloom sparkled light of janjalla between incoming vessel lay huge bulk of pizarro glare of search light shooting up into dark like two gigantic sword of pale flame iturbide be leading by three hundred yard crept cautiously forward so a to pounce on prey unawares whether noise of screw reached ear of on board pizarro that marked coming through darkness be impossible to say just a steamed within eight hundred yard search light swept round like spoke of wheel in moment glare revealed whereabouts in radiance stood out like phantom ship seeing that be discovered pedraza cracking on steam swept past pizarro in wide circle heavy fire be at once opened by rebel doubtless deemed that foe be not alone for keeping one light on cruiser swept sea with other in search of possible companion on board iturbide must hear yell of mingled rage terror a light struck low bulk of zuloaga darting through water evil looking venomous broadside be poured on torpedera now left unprotected by iturbide be circling to left in inner part of bay owing to dexterity of zuloaga manoeuvring none of heavy gun must hit skimmed grey wave at full speed like swallow search light of pizarro be much put to in following be like dancer in theatre followed by lime light one moment torpedera must be swallowed up in gloom next moment darting ray of electric light must stab through darkness pick out other ray followed iturbide kept steaming slowly backwards forward on port side firing armstrong whenever got fair chance zuloaga sent off bow torpedo passed harmlessly under stern of pizarro without doing damage nevertheless crew of rebel ship seemed much alarmed a well might be seeing that single torpedo striking amidships must sink iron ship in few minute foolishly enough never occurred to de galevez to sweep starboard with light be quite unaware that second torpedo vessel be stealing up in darkness indeed what with following iturbide zuloaga with search light de galevez have enough to do kept torpedo boat at bay with heavy gun occasionally shot from iturbide must pas through rigging of rebel ship damage be done de galevez great desire be to keep at distance wasp like torpedo circled round rapidly everywhere trying to plant sting while drama be taking place on port side montezuma on seeing iturbide be discovered moved up on starboard at distance of four hundred yard when abreast of pizarro slowed down engine crept up within pistol range have not be for incessant firing of gun on board pizarro must surely have become aware of danger a be thought safe while kept zuloaga at distance tremendous broadside be directed at torpedera at iturbide be last discharge for next moment be struck amidships by torpedo from montezuma there be cry of frenzied fear search light flashed round to starboard only to see montezuma slipping back into gloom three minute afterwards pizarro sank vessel of junta at once flashed electric ray on spot where moment before have be magnificent vessel now saw nothing wide expanse of cold black sea dotted with drowning men boat be lowered by iturbide few soldier sailor be rescued so suddenly have pizarro gone down with exception of dozen survivor whole crew officer soldier in three hundred men be drowned must be impossible to describe joy on board loyalist ship at successful termination of contest rafael jack went on board iturbide to receive congratulation of pedraza for success officer of zuloaga also hastened to participate in general joy large state room of cruiser be one mass of excited men drinking champagne wildly embracing one victory must surely damp enthusiasm of rebel raise of loyalist to fever pitch don hypolito have now two ship of war must not surely stand before valour of iturbide with two torpedo vessel viva be deafening rafael a commander of boat have sunk pizarro be nearly stifled by embrace of brother officer a soon a excitement have somewhat subsided went on deck iturbide stood in to shore with idea of seeing how matter stood in rebel camp flying opal flag lest fort must open fire on one of own vessel cruiser turned light on to beach saw that be lined with rebel force under arm noise of firing flashing of light have attracted attention of on shore fearing that attack be contemplated by enemy rebel encamped in front of janjalla be now on alert one must understand reason of sea fight a seemed quite impossible that torpederas must have arrived from tlatonac in so short period general in command of troop of xuarez did not know what to think have to wait till dawn before must make up mind what course to pursue a light of iturbide struck distant town long line of wall surmounted by crowd leaped out of darkness search light from fort be flashed on to ship in janjalla recognising opal flag cheered vociferously saw three boat flying ensign of tlatonac pizarro then guessed what have occurred be glad accordingly rebel soldier on beach stamped swore with rage a saw loss being without boat must hing save parade under arm till dawn so a to be prepared against possible attack by victorious loyalist bueno cried captain pedraza who have night glass up there be one good thing mi amigo opal flag still fly over town so a hold out what be next to be done comandante asked jack who be standing near with rafael must wait till dawn senor americano then find out if reinforcement have arrived at janjalla afterwards will steam back to tlatonac if possible meet cortes columbus coming back in event must go to tlatonac to report victory to junta will land two hundred troop caranto why not because camp of enemy lie between town two hundred men can not do much against two thousand true senor if be impossible will not attempt at dawn will signal to general gigedo to make sally from gate down to shore men will land effect conjunction so with small loss ought to get into town especially under cover of gun of fort see what use will be pedraza interrupted rafael bluntly caro senor excellency ordered to be done so must be done rather useless task think said jack dryly however be not sorry a wish to get into town senor comandante what will do wait till troop be safe with gigedo also ascertain if reinforcement have arrived then will sail north wo wait for warship transport carajo what use will find on way to tlatonac after conversation rafael jack returned on board montezuma former slightly gloomy in spite of victory so unexpectedly achieved caro juan said reflectively if lose war will be through don francisco gomez be good politician bad general what use be there to sacrifice two hundred men to morrow be rather like charge of light brigade certainly replied jack with smile a foolhardy a brave what be mi amigo whereupon jack related glorious charge to rafael thereby stirred up excitable spaniard to fiery enthusiasm oh what men be english cried stamping foot be story worthy of cid to morrow friend be rare be brave like story there be good to be gained perhaps gomez want to frighten rebel by showing how dauntless be men dios be not wise sinking of pizarro will frighten without risking two hundred life however a be ordered must be done don juan will go assuredly mi amigo wish to see senor correspondent felipe will be killed be a may be rafael did not escape peril of totatzine to fall in skirmish before wall of janjalla see mi amigo be nearly dawn let snatch few hour sleep bueno replied rafael leading way to cabin first must call friend together toast victory once more be done accordingly chapter xiii without wall wall of stone like mountain rise grey against morning sky still royal banner fly watched with hate by rebel eye around rampart grey in mist army lie set in battle wild array at dawning of day traitor to sovereign who must loyal subject slay hold city a slave under democratic sway cannon thunder banner wave a come on foeman brave 'neath wall to find grave yet city will save never let be prize of coward fool knave shortly after dawn jack went on deck to have thorough examination of coast line situation of janjalla be peculiar to right willow river meandered seaward through low lying swampy ground discharging sluggishly by several mouth desolate plain stretched for league on left to base of distant mountain between swamp plain city appeared built on rocky height directly in front of wall sandy ground fell rapidly towards sea on extreme verge of be compact mass of hut forming kind of sea port wharf shot out suddenly from miniature town lay along hollow of beach above in near distance rose grey wall of janjalla from rocky cliff above dome of church tower of house highest of expanse of bluish sky grey with chill mist of morning in beach hollow army of xuarez be encamped partly in house partly in tent whitely dotted desolate shore owing to rapid fall of ground from rampart invader be quite safe from cannon of fort must defend town against attack of ship be unable to be depressed sufficiently to command spot where rebel be encamped thus in very jaw of danger lay besieger in comparative safety jack surveying through telescope be astonished to see that engineer who have constructed defence have be so foolish a to leave debatable ground between rampart sea perhaps deemed that cannon must not permit ship to approach near enough for disembarking of hostile troop seemed to have forgotten that heavy gun of man of war must silence fort perhaps have not be done a cannon on rampart still defended city there be doubt in jack mind that don hypolito have landed troop under cover of heavy fire from three ship directed at fort once encamped on shore besieger must bid defiance to line of cannon whose ball passed harmlessly over head ola senor juan said rafael gay voice behind be up early good morning mi amigo replied jack turning with smile have be up at least hour examining town place forsaken of god be not dios to think that fool must have to be capital of cholacaca swamp there sandy plain yonder holy mary how can compare with tlatonac be first time have be so far south think much of country town oh situation be good for defence be not so sure of rafael be true that city be built on rocky height well defended by swamp desert look how safely enemy can lie under wall eh what must juan muzzle of gun can not be depressed sufficiently to sweep beach then why did engineer build two fort right left in order to command intervening ground dios thus knock other to piece true well then have one fort see mi amigo on right wide swamp be sufficient protection against approach of enemy have constructed defence of town must have run arm of fort between desert that sea fort thus double line of cannon must have commanded beach even if enemy did succeed in landing in face of fire of town fort must not have encamped there a have done be true juan replied rafael who now have telescope to eye be now too late to deplore lack of defence rebel have landed be safely bestowed within stone throw of city look at number of on alert santissima wo feel very happy morning now that see pizarro be lost surely said jack taking notice of last remark surely pedraza doe not intend to land two hundred men directly in front of town be foolish admit answered rafael shrugging shoulder what with sally of troop from town gun of boat playing on beach may be managed doubt two hundred men may land under cover of fire believe rafael fifty will not break through living barrier enter town grant that a said last night be useless waste of life excellency must have surely forgotten situation of janjalla when gave rash command what else can be done save obey order obey by mean not in way commanded what do mean jack be sweeping shore right left with telescope did not reply for few minute at length spoke indicating several point mentioned with hand behold mi amigo said pointing towards desert to land there must be foolish a enemy must march along to defend point while boat pulled in same with central position be madness to land in teeth of two thousand men look to right why not land troop up coast let swamp lie between enemy bueno replied rafael seizing idea at once how do propose to enter city ah ca say not knowing geography of place have map below come with juan will invent plan then go on board iturbide to interview pedraza be with in trying to prevent sacrifice of two hundred men by landing in jaw of danger went down to cabin rafael after hunting about for few minute found map of southern portion of cholacaca spread out on table began to examine at once here said jack drawing finger along paper here be janjalla here swamp river beyond be kind of rolling prairie if land troop here can march parallel to river into interior country be so mi amigo see river be ever between troop city if enemy see men marching on side can march on other so keep men from entering city not if pedraza signal to fort forget that rebel be only safe so long a keep in hollow of beach if march up on right expose to heavy fire consequently fort can keep in check troop marching along on right bank of stream can surely find ford by to cross then gain inland gate of janjalla by detour como exclaimed rafael in lively tone rolling up map be not at bad idea let board iturbide explain plan to comandante who command expedition asked jack a hastily snatched up brace of revolver heavy cloak don sebastian de ahumada be great friend of mine in fact added rafael laughing be cousin of dona carmencita de tajada poor rafael suit doe not progress much in quarter not with don jose perhaps be content to wait till war be ended so far a angel be concerned will be true to a to by way mi amigo know that don jose be now governor of acauhtzin in absence of don hypolito did not know be don hypolito yonder not now be on board cortes have gone back to acauhtzin will doubtless come south again to personally conduct war must like to get shot at said jack grimly brute will never forgive for treachery well who know perhaps recruit may chance to shoot great general bonaparte what say asked rafael puzzled at line be recited in english nothing nothing something to relieve feeling be that boat never going to be ready be ready now said young man gaily in with mi amigo row to iturbide benito so give way men oar dipped into water a sun arose in east boat shot away from montezuma over flood of gold rafael be in great spirit chatted gaily time jack thinking of peril of proposed expedition be graver besides be anxious about safety of philip tim by way said rafael suddenly don pedro did not return with last night pedraza asked to sleep on board iturbide see there be looking over bulwark can tell by flash of sun on spectacle dios how strange will don pedro go with into town certainly not replied jack decisively be too risky take back with to tlatonac assuredly aunt must never forgive if harm came to don pedro rafael laughed heartily at idea for undutiful nephew be much amused at flirtation between peter serafina will marry juan be sure of then will have four wedding when war be over rafael four wedding por todos santos what mean dolores dona carmencita pedro aunt senor felipe dona eulalia eh mi amigo cried rafael in lively tone doe sister favour cavalier dios what say father doe not know anything yet a have consented to receive one heretic into family can surely stretch point receive two como may be who know ah here be at iturbide come juan climbed up side of cruiser be received by captain pedraza peter buenos dia de dios ustedes senor said pedraza greeting heartily be glad to see a wish to land troop at once senor pedro desire to go also what nonsense peter said jack in english turning to friend be too dangerous stay on board go back to tlatonac will not returned doctor indignantly be going so why must not besides wish to see tim to be certain that philip have arrived safely want killed peter protested jack wo be killed more than will be jack be not bit of use talking be going with have medicine chest with oh well obstinacy have own way replied duval touched by proof of peter friendship tim will pitch at for bringing into danger tim will be glad enough to have doctor at hand why jack must have be at totatzine to cure cocom be good at pinch quack muttered peter scornfully must not forgive cocom having cured jack so rapidly be case of professional jealousy senor duval said pedraza approaching jack don rafael tell have hit on plan to land troop without danger jack signified that have such idea in head in company with pedraza went below to look at map don sebastian followed after long discussion comandante decided to accept suggestion iturbide raised anchor steamed short distance up coast so a to land troop beyond swamp signal having be made to torpederas remained in former position before town when rebel saw iturbide moving northward shouted with joy thinking that be about to leave harbour delight be turned into rage a saw boat after boat drop from side laden with troop make for shore number ran along beach to verge of swamp here progress be stayed a be impossible for to cross quagmire must only remain quiet gesticulate with anger though many fired gun two cannon be brought along shore in hope of doing damage a yet be safe from fort being too much in hollow when pedraza saw cannon brought up opened fire with armstrong signalled to torpederas steamed abreast of swamp at once did considerable damage with rapid firing hotchkiss gun under cover of cannonade whole of troop be duly landed in admirable order with utmost celerity then jack peter don sebastian prepared to go on shore pedraza gave de ahumada sealed order for gigedo from president rafael occupied in saying farewell to english friend have revolver mi amigo said anxiously sword good cloak ah be well have also flask of aguardiente will need sustenance march to inland gate may be long one adios adios replied jack dropping over side give love to dolores when return to tlatonac will not fail don pedro have message si senor replied peter in hesitating spanish dona dolores escarabajos beetle echoed rafael in great astonishment what doe mean by beetle curiosity be not gratified for already boat be making rapidly for shore jack standing up in stern be waving adieu to on board by time sun be far above horizon already heat be becoming unpleasantly great don sebastian at once formed men into marching order little company proceeded along bank of river towards interior of country before spread kind of rolling down with undulating hill sparsely covered with vegetation here there patch of yellow sand streaked with fine white dust on one side stretched illimitable plain on other ground marshy treacherous sank imperceptibly into bed of slow flowing river beyond interval of firm land for considerable distance then rocky shelf on janjalla be built in front stream meandered in erratic manner inland away in extreme distance appeared dim line of forest above arose snowy cone of xicotencatl over arched cloudless blue sky with sun flaming hotly in east rebel have be considerably cut up by incessant firing of ship have wisely fallen back into camp when however saw loyalist moving inland along bank of stream troop of cavalry hundred strong galloped towards swamp to intercept if possible cruiser torpederas be still in former position a cavalry turned fatal corner to make for inner country opened heavy cannonade considerable damage be inflicted particularly by hotchkiss gun number of rider be soon struggling on ground with wounded horse in few minute however troop nothing dismayed escaped beyond line of fire galloped parallel with loyalist between swamp wall defile proved to be perfect death trap for within town having observed landing of reinforcement chase by enemy opened fire from fort shattered compact mass of horse men a steadily galloped along at length however have to cease fire a rebel artfully kept abreast of loyalist at time ball swept across swamp played havoc with soldier of don sebastian only thing to be done therefore be to let cavalry go free trust to hand to hand combat when on sandy plain at back of town ship fort however be determined that more of enemy must join in pursuit for heavy cannonade be kept up a troop tried to follow effectually held back bueno said don sebastian when saw have to deal with abreast of more can follow cavalry against infantry mi amigo be unequal particularly if try to cross river perhaps in town will come to assistance suggested peter who be trudging along manfully be probable replied de ahumada when remark be translated into good spanish by jack see be now nearly at end of town yonder be land gate if remain here assistance may come while cavalry be defending against friend may be able to cross river yes be if cavalry get reinforced by own men coming round other side of town dios exclaimed don sebastian grimly reinforcement certainly can come way will be forced to make wide detour in order to keep out of range of fort gun by time come up may be inside wall fervently trust so senor replied duval who though coward did not relish idea of engaging two hundred infantry with double number of cavalry city be enclosed by wall of considerable height be shaped in triangular fashion base being towards ocean land gate at acute angle inland have now walked distance past gate on other side of river wide sheet of water rolled between enemy on side spread sandy plain wall of city rose suddenly from flat surface in most unexpected fashion on left bank halted cavalry of enemy prepared to dispute crossing don sebastian be sorely puzzled a to what be best course to pursue be madness to cross in face of don juan well if cross at once will be reinforced from other side then will be worse look jack look cried peter at moment gate be open just a spoke body of cavalry debouched from city came rapidly towards rebel at once turned to meet new danger thus attention be drawn off infantry upon seeing don sebastian waited few minute until opposing force clashed together then gave order to cross river must strip asked peter ruefully looking at three hundred yard of water before strip man said jack laughing unless want to enter janjalla naked can swim at least must at bedford of course can swim said peter testily hate getting clothes wet oh hang clothes river be slow flowing so be easy to get across see advance file be in already in with peter did not need second admonition waded into water beside jack don sebastian cavalry otherwise must have shot down a swam across be fully occupied with loyalist regiment from janjalla already in extreme distance dark mass might be seen rapidly moving along be reinforcement for rebel making detour on other side of city there be not moment to be lost in remarkably short space of time whole of infantry have crossed be now standing high dry on other bank not even giving time to shake water from clothes don sebastian made kneel open fire on rebel in rear fortunately man have piled musket ammunition on head while swimming so arm be in excellent condition cartridge unwetted fusillade burst from line wrought considerable damage in rank of enemy taken thus between two fire rebel found in exceedingly hot water trusting that comrade must soon reach turned tried to ride down infantry soldier immediately sprung to foot scattered widely firing into troop whenever got chance fresh troop of loyalist cavalry poured out of gate made for scene of action what with being pretty nearly equally matched with cavalry exposed to galling fire of infantry rebel began to lose heart breaking into disorderly mass spread over plain gate of city be distant quarter of mile seeing that reinforcement of enemy be close at hand don sebastian shouted to men to close up make for shelter of wall seeing rebel reinforcement darting between moving loyalist gate tried to cut off be met in turn by mounted troop from janjalla plain be strewn with dead dying incessant cracking of rifle yell of combatant thick cloud of pungent smoke added to horror of skirmish huge trooper rode straight at peter rolled in dust jack being close at hand shot horse with revolver pulled friend out of harm way by time be near gate peter being somewhat stunned by knock down be dragged along rapidly by jack who wanted to get into shelter a speedily a possible be now dangerous for infantry to fire a friend foe be blended in inextricable mass so forming line a speedily a possible ran for gate at length reached in safety seeing that be now out of danger cavalry of janjalla began to retreat towards portal to left of town great mass of reinforcement be moving up must have be madness to have opposed with small force of loyalist outside cavalry galloped back a by time infantry have fled inside wall gate be closed at once jack jack peter cried well known voice a tim grimy with
