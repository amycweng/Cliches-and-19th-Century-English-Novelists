place who be not discussed thoroughly at end of hour rector wife be in full possession of have taken place in parish during week mentally arranged fact so that might report to husband not that wished

examination be concluded mr mellin retired with many blessing on head of hostess climbed back into dingy cart neddy having tossed aside fag end of surreptitious cigarette drove away meekly while mr craver witnessed departure washerwoman still haunted by memory of newly tenanted house cried back warning will see ma'be a tragity will 'appen at maranatha mark ma'be chapter ii when became known chiefly through agency of mr mellin that baronet be living at excitement be very great appeared strange to one that titled wealthy gentleman must leave pleasure of london to take up residence in dull place such a hedgerton truly be originally rude fishing village have of late year be exploited by jerry builder so that might be improved into watering place play ground for tripper huddle of quaint house be buried in hollow by shore faced estuary of thames into stretched for great distance rough stone pier sometimes floating on water sometimes stranded on mud be many fishing smack went out regularly to harvest of sea while river steamer occasionally called to discharge cargo to land passenger since hedgerton have be dignified by name of watering place steamer called more frequently especially in summer on whole did fairly well somehow did not bring to hedgerton prosperity anticipated by jerry builder place did not thrive in spite of doctor recommendation cheap fare lavish advertisement above hollow wherein nestled original town stretched flat well wooded country dotted sparsely with house there be railway station at redleigh three mile away new hedgerton a be called consisted of many hastily built bungalow extending in lean line along cliff be occupied only in summer therefore remained empty for greater part of year there be asphalt esplanade running spaciously from east to west in front of bungalow small bandstand crude hall for public entertainment roofed with galvanised iron at interval road branched at right angle from esplanade passing between house old new to run finally through woodland between hedge divided vast meadow from highway in spring summer country looked very picturesque with foliage of tree blossom of orchard rainbow hue of multitudinous flower change be marked in autumn winter then balmy air grew raw chill there be damp mist overlying land morning evening while lack of life gave place melancholy aspect at fall of year inhabitant of district retired into house like rabbit in burrow a climate of particular part of england did not tempt to lead out of door life on whole therefore hedgerton be not desirable locality either for pleasure seeker for invalid in summer being case hedgerton gossip asked one daily why sir hector wyke have come down to place during season of mist rain of leafless bough ruined orchard one be able to give answer although be frequently suggested that baronet health be bad man in bad health must scarcely come to so unhealthy place at so unhealthy time therefore there must be other reason everyone tried to learn what be everyone failed information be supplied by tenant of maranatha who lived very secluded life appeared greatly desirous to be left to saw one when took solitary walk spoke to one even mr craver be denied admittance when sought to welcome stranger to parish returned home to tell wife that wyke be probably misanthropic creature who disliked fellow men description aroused mr craver curiosity be even more particular than usual in examining mr mellin when spy came to report what have taken place in parish during week washerwoman must only state after three week watching that bill bill of tradespeople be paid regularly saw one mr vence who a not inclined to be communicative that house appeared to be a neglected now a be when sir hector first went to live in must seem that mysterious baronet did not so much live in maranatha a camp in since attempt be made to brush up residence improve garden in way sir hector save for occasional walk stayed indoors like snail in shell mr mellin augured ill from suspicious retirement chiefly blamed house for doings of tenant there be cuss on declared with relish when mr craver be speculating a to meaning of whole queer business if solomon hisself a be 'appy with thousand wife lived in 'ouse 'd have ' be miserable within week why name tell what be ma'be what do maranatha whisper to ruin there 'as be suicide 'appened bankruptcy with elopement of gel know be common there ma'be say what like will be murder nex ' 'eaven be betwixt 'arm save bless mr mellin always ended dismal prognostication with observation that hoped must not be called upon to give evidence at inquest a murder got on nerve mr craver be little le fortunate with son when asked question for edwin must say amounted to nothing sir hector wyke be rich man popular man who have be in army be now gentleman at large edwin have met in society liked fairly well although a put wyke be not man must care to make chum of mr craver suggested that must call on baronet renew acquaintance edwin refused to do said that if wyke wished to improve acquaintance must call at rectory a recluse showed disposition to do must be best to leave alone rector agreed with son mr craver therefore found in minority same remained intensely curious frequently wondered what mystery lay behind whole business even questioned in delicate way postman jervis policeman be unable to learn anything from hall simply said that delivered very few letter be received by mr vence whom described a old hag while jervis declared that saw nothing knew nothing heard nothing likely to say why tenant of maranatha lived so hermit like be quite painful for brisk little mr craver to learn that must discover nothing knew history daily doings of soul in hedgerton be sure george said plaintively to rector one world doe not know how other half life then be sure be fault mr mellin miss pyne retorted husband whereat be offended wondered more than ever if must

taken maranatha on three month lease therefore might be supposed have not be killed must have returned to london at expiration of period to resume ordinary life from mr vence hint that have be engaged to hold tongue must appear that there be mystery in baronet life mystery must be discovered in spite sergeant persistent questioning left off a wise a be when began purse also called to see rector wife ostensibly to ask if knew anything about gentleman who have come to reside in parish really to learn what must of young craver intimation of lemby that daughter loved young man that wished to

entertainment hall that shabby building with roof of galvanised iron be on esplanade sergeant purse stated that knew be little enough terminated evidence with surprising information that telegram have arrived from waking police office saying that bicycle have be found constable who have found must appear in due course to relate how have be discovered a sergeant added there be trace to be found of man who have stolen same announcement caused excitement a there appeared chance of getting at truth on whole purse statement caused prosaic evidence be anything sensational mr vence be then questioned

day before master have taken over maranatha from pedder caretaker so a to put in order coroner weary of hearing nothing pointedly asked why wyke have requested to hold tongue did ask to hold tongue

get will father sir hector did not leave fortune to of claudia stared when lover disappeared wondered if knew more about crime than admitted father lover be one other guilty chapter viii when in street craver turned over in mind what girl have said relative to hint given by father undoubtedly lemby have superlatively bad temper undoubtedly have be in house when crime be committed adding to

went to hedgerton must by mean understand behaviour of father who certainly talked in most contradictory manner at one moment denied that have anything to do with death of old friend yet next hinted at mysterious risk undertaken to obtain money naturally change of scene with new people to talk to with new occupation did infinite good to rectory be haven of peace edwin strong armed man who must must defend welcome of mr mr craver comforted exceedingly a be charmed with visitor thoroughly approved of in way rector who be white haired gentle faced old gentleman fonder of literature than of humanity admired beauty greatly while little mr craver pronounced to be uncommonly sensible girl within week claudia be comfortably settled in new surroundings be happier than have be since arrival in england on plea mr craver must teach housekeeping took share of work became quite busy bee prospective mother in law found able assistant poor weary mr craver have toiled struggled scrimped screwed

mr craver significantly be widow of poor man sure enough who be where doe come from come from london emma said rector humorously life in hedgerton why doe live here george well must live somewhere not in very house in husband be murdered to mind be ghoulish idea for to rent maranatha seeing what took place there be odd admitted claudia musingly wonder why mr craver reached forward to take slice of bread may be that wish to learn who murdered sir hector therefore think that will be more successful if remains in house where crime be committed claudia winced thought flew to father mysterious remark to lady wyke ominous hint have discovered anything yet observed mr craver sharply at least have said nothing to although have be here month that reminds george that have not called again since claudia arrived well emma called on called on demand of courtesy have be satisfied be dull people know be smart lady be not to be supposed that will find much enjoyment in society indeed george must find society very instructive may be smart a say certainly be not lady claudia nodded did not think so when saw in loudon ah yes mr craver turned briskly of course saw considering how badly sir hector behaved to dear wonder have impudence to call what courage must have oh know mr craver claudia shrugged carelessly naturally lady wyke be anxious to see seeing be to marry husband be not to blame poor

husband to commit bigamy why must come alive again a put must have remained always with husband a true faithful wife must replied mr craver drawing up spare figure think that separation be sir hector fault said claudia after pause be very polite amiable old man certainly did not wish to marry a always loved edwin father made accept strange dear seeing how strong minded be have not met father rejoined girl briefly think want to of course when marry edwin must come to wedding suppose give away be much too dashing gentleman for quiet people such a be why emma said rector surprised did not know have seen saw outside door of entertainment hall when inquest be taking place happened to be passing on day father dear addressed claudia be handsome man must think have temper have said man daughter significantly perhaps if knew father must not want to marry edwin what nonsense love for own sweet sake father will go back to australia hope then need not be bothered with emma emma well ca help george after in trying to make claudia marry old man who died mr lemby did not behave very well same be claudia father said rector reprovingly girl flushed then turned rather pale a felt trifle embarrassed during discussion if mr craver talked of father in way when be absent what must say when be present precise refined little lady must never get on with pirate who be that be not mr craver le observant than rector accepted reproof although did not notice claudia change of colour went on to make other remark dealing with subject only hope that lady wyke example will not ruin parish

be well able to support wife by way lady wyke motor car be manufactured by edwin firm before came down claudia asked edwin to show how to drive did asked claudia wincing when thought of lady wyke admiration for lover said that be too busy have to get back to town now come to think of george really went back to london a have to fly heart sink when hear of aviation accident man with mother must

mellin wished to speak to mistress mr craver be surprised a be not day when washing arrived report of various doings in parish be made something unusual must have caused mr mellin to come unexpectedly to rectory so eager little woman hurried out to learn what be matter mr craver frankly laughed when alone with claudia wife energy always amused emma must have be detective remarked to claudia be always on look out for information know everything be going on in parish depend upon mr mellin who be assistant detective have come with startling news emma will return to startle with kind of storm in tea cup mr craver be dearest woman in world said claudia with sympathetic laugh like mannerism to be kindness who must not be kind to dear claudia be not emotional a rule eye filled with tear at

talk without arousing suspicion of father mother what do mean ca guess after have said claudia lulled mother suspicion regarding possible flirtation of lady wyke with by telling lie said that be christianity to help poor widow hang oh claudia started winced so exactly flirtation be more serious than ever want to marry asked to tea so that might put case plainly ca force to marry edwin will try to there be doubt that have on toast claudia rose from chair came round table to sit beside do mean to say that can implicate father in crime demand hand a promise of silence mean to say that can

what good will do father be in house may know something of moment believe that may be able to prove innocence yes think so be in drawing room sure enough ca believe that man of father restless disposition must stay quietly there believe that came down stair saw saw edwin hesitated saw what asked claudia faintly saw who murdered wyke who must have done so surely believe that dad be guilty certainly be innocent also absolutely then there be only mr vence in house do think that said craver decisively have reason to keep alive reason at to wish dead did strike blow who did ca say be going

of hurry to right wrong sunday claudia be worried anxious in church out of church before meal during meal after meal of course since rector wife be to be kept in dark have to feign cheerfulness be long way from feeling even sharp mr craver noticed nothing in girl manner likely to suggest question privately thought that if claudia be quieter than usual be because edwin have gone back to london so abruptly lady wyke did not come either to morning evening service rector wife speculated a to why be absent in afternoon claudia found impossible to remain at home so went for brisk walk along cliff emerging from rectory ground passed through small wood sheltered house from sea breeze took meandering path along verge of cliff on arriving at coastguard station paused for quarter of hour to remove hat let air breathe cool kiss on lock have headache caused by perplexity peace around did good soothing lingering pain finally taking away altogether claudia set out on return journey feeling much better began to think that be making mountain out of molehill before quite made up mind to course suddenly came across neddy mellin boy be descending zig zag path led to beach immediately below rectory not being far distant claudia recognised at once then remembered how neddy have stolen fatal letter implicated edwin in crime forthwith resolved to ask question required diplomacy to ask right one so a to get right answer for master mellin be clever brat extraordinary sharp suspicious however claudia thought that must manage to attract attention raised voice in australian cooee neddy turned head halted when saw coming down path liked miss lemby a be very scrumptious gal own word moreover have given packet of cigarette be wrong of claudia considering boy tender year neddy looked uncommonly smart in eton suit suited slim well knit figure perfectly decidedly be handsome lad so angelic in appearance that wondered how managed to keep shady character out of face neddy be unscrupulous little wretch stopped at nothing to get own way own enjoyment thereby greatly resembling elder do look smart neddy said claudia when reached boy why be not in london came down to see mother said neddy whose diction a listener noted be much improved even in short time have be under tuition always want to see week so that may know that be safe coming down on to beach miss yes be out

patch of glistening sand looked oozy damp treacherous quicksand miss claudia stared shivered what nasty looking place aye be nasty too miss folk have told again again how other folk have be swallowed up yonder there must be sign that be dangerous there be sign chuckled neddy be swallowed up also if got in there added fixing innocent blue eye on gleaming expanse 'd go down to hell talk like horrid

say there neddy face fell have got to hand over dibs to blessed mother why do speak of mother in way well ca call cussed mother can miss claudia laughed then became grave to rebuke be wicked boy to talk of mother in way be just a well that must get salary be too young to know value of money oh be well be good one may smoke claudia laughed again at politeness sat down on convenient boulder must smoke at age who gave cigarette asked neddy shyly be very wrong to encourage think added claudia with view to arriving at point aimed at aunt must give tobacco neddy sat down lighted up with impudent air of robin take remarked coolly smoke sneak what want aunt laura ai bad dashing sort of woman ai 'd box ear if heard say that neddy must aunt laura dare lay finger on why not claudia became aware that there be threat hidden here because know neddy hesitated stole cunning glance at companion well know what know lady wyke have be very kind to neddy kind oh yes very kind neddy sneered then smiled blandly be wicked little boy know to steal letter master mellin dropped cigarette looked startled told claudia nodded yes want need talk neddy waved hand grandly know aunt laura want to marry nut be sweet on twigged that age ago did know how to manage to nab so helped by giving that letter neddy nodded in turn read know miss leered so significantly that claudia looked upon a leading pupil in mr fagin evil academy be rather sorry did went on neddy a nut belongs to only in way must make old gal help unscrupulous little animal burst out claudia positively afraid of lad shrewdness have made lot of mischief must have made more miss 'd given letter to old purse claudia shivered saw necessity of propitiating did do be glad to say 'cause like mr craver be good sort have promised to give ride in aeroplane why did steal letter at asked claudia nervously well see arrived just when old cove be slaughtered old mr vence must let see corpse a much a wanted to so nicked letter lying on hall table

valuable witness if dealt with diplomatically can give tip said neddy after pause give to then go ask sergeant purse to show knife a be used what good will do well said master mellin shrewdly seems to though be only boy a sergeant purse ought to hunt for cove a owns that knife be sticking in heart of old cove know sergeant have saw at inquest seem to be kind of knife mr craver must use nohow mr craver cut on hall bike cove a did trick miss cleared out in way claudia asked further question received evasive answer master mellin evidently have said that intended to say at moment so there be little use in prolonging conversation along with boy claudia climbed up path again left neddy again at rectory gate in most polite way lifted straw hat in farewell detained for few minute in hope of getting to say more smiled like angel shook head like old man resolutely refused to open mouth there be nothing for to let go claudia did same hint about knife dwelt in memory be indeed strange that police authority have not followed up important clue without doubt if knife be peculiar one neddy hinted owner might be discovered once be found then truth must become known miss lemby retired to bed on night resolved to see sergeant purse on morrow learn what must having be engaged to sir hector there be ample excuse for to ask question in anxiety interest caused by neddy conversation claudia quite forgot tussle with lady wyke passed better night in consequence by three o'clock next day found standing with bicycle before door of redleigh police office entered to ask for sergeant luck stood friend for sergeant usually out on round happened to be in disengaged claudia be admitted into sanctum of official be amiably received by foxy faced little man a usual be a dry a mummy in look eye be more than ever like of rat be uncommonly polite to miss lemby since knew story be sorry for hope have got over miss said sergeant placing chair for visitor be hot time for same murder be getting over claudia assured with faint smile be very painful time a respected sir hector think behaved very well miss lemby oh think did after sergeant did not know that wife be alive know be mistake have called to ask if have clue to assassin miss lemby quite understand why must come ask a naturally 'd like to see villain hanged lady wyke must like to see also ca catch however went off on bicycle vanished into thin air like witch in play well mr purse have be thinking over matter said claudia with diplomatic frankness occurred to that must follow clue of knife have believe oh yes sergeant purse rose went to shelf at further end of office to fumble there see how can follow clue why not someone told that knife be peculiar one ca trace to shop where be bought be idea certainly miss lemby said purse returning with parcel in hand look at knife be peculiar one untied string unrolled several sheet of paper then claudia saw sailor clasp knife with handle of black bone decorated with three broad stripe of inlaid silver be knife miss lemby said officer claudia gasped felt grow faint knife belonged to father chapter xix how claudia managed to leave office of sergeant purse reach homo never clearly knew in extraordinary way contrived to keep from fainting maintain composure so that officer suspected nothing after time complained that room be close felt that fresh air must do good purse quite ignorant of true cause of unexpected nervousness accompanied outside helped to mount bicycle in most amiable way a rode off thanked for suggestion have made declared intention of following clue of knife way to hedgerton claudia thought over what have done reached rectory in quite fainting condition little mr craver met at door ascribed pale look nerveless limb to long ride claudia gladly accepted excuse scolding order that must lie down a wished to avert suspicion also to be alone to think over matter never in after year did girl forget that next hour lying on bed with face pressed against pillow claudia kept assuring that be mistaken be sinful of to suspect father of such wickedness deserved to be punished for even thinking of thing question agonised be what did particular knife mean in relation to wyke death there be only one answer to question knife have be found sticking in wyke heart man who thrust into same heart be criminal father be man father be criminal claudia remained that evening in bed again mr craver ascribed weakness to exhausting ride on bicycle to redleigh long night pondered thought reasoned cried out against reason when dawn came rose took cold bath refreshed there be excuse for to remain in bed for day so claudia wan haggard went down to breakfast there heard news cheered up edwin be coming here to day in aeroplane dear said mr craver who be reading letter will be here at two o'clock afternoon what excitement will cause in hedgerton only hope edwin wo break neck cried mr craver wrathfully oh how foolish rising generation be there be nothing to hold on by in one of airship if fall will be killed naturally rector wishing to give villager pleasure did not keep news to told wife to tell servant servant told everyone came on morning to rectory by noon whole of hedgerton knew that master edwin be arriving in airship great be excitement from what young man have said in letter be known that must alight on cliff where there be vast space along aeroplane must run when settled down like bird consequently long before two o'clock coastguard station be surrounded by crowd people in anxiety to see latest invention of science to witness conquest of air by man whole population of little village assembled on cliff claudia came also with rector mr craver who be very anxious very proud of coming event girl glanced round to see if lady wyke be present must not see did not even catch glimpse of neddy learnt later from mother that boy have returned to town on previous day claudia drew deep breath of relief at news knew very well that neddy must be trusted to be silent be comfort to know that be absent miss lemby must not explain to why be comfort somehow felt more at ease without puck in eton suit hovering round a lady wyke be also conspicuous by absence claudia abandoned to general excitement of coming arrival of edwin from sky do wish edwin must come said mr craver again again a hour drew near do think have met with accident george let hope have dear answered rector who be likewise anxious be not due yet so have reason to think that anything sad have happened there be there be shouted keen sighted coastguard who have spyglass at eye yonder come where where where shouted everyone much excited looked north south east west without seeing anything coastguard ran with spyglass to rector look sir over yonder over yonder pointed seaward with trembling hand rector adjusted glass then uttered ' ejaculation of thankfulness yes aeroplane be coming along like great bird emma ask to look george be trembling over claudia looked saw black speck glowing larger a came nearer in few minute hum of aeroplane be distinctly heard with naked eye everyone must see machine swinging towards cliff high in blue excitement be intense mr craver have to be supported by claudia so weak did feel at son soaring in space nearer nearer came black dot louder louder became burr of aeroplane finally like great dragonfly swept in huge circle over land settled like feather running along ground swiftly in impetus until willing hand laid hold of to bring to standstill then crowd rushed to gather round to cheer to ask question to examine first aeroplane have ever be in out of way parish mr craver with wife on arm pushed way to front with usually dreamy eye alight with excitement congratulate son oh edwin edwin sobbed usually unemotional mother clasped in arm a alighted from machine be wonderful horrid know will be killed be safe enough now anyhow mother said edwin cheerfully where be claudia here said girl in low voice for felt faint now that strain be over old fear began to reassert why darling what be matter asked lover hastily nothing nothing be will tell when come home be not easy for hero to reach home have to submit to incessant handshaking have to get aeroplane under shelter have to be attended to in other way connected with engine wide spread wing there be old barn on cliff edwin have arranged to use for machine long ago so be run into door be closed much to regret of crowd anxious to contemplate wonder edwin promised to give exhibition on morrow then walked home with parent claudia a mr mr craver be asking question concerning flight from hendon way claudia have opportunity of speaking to lover on arrival at rectory watchful mother gave girl opportunity of having quiet moment with edwin mr craver drew husband away saying that be best to leave young people to so couple found in drawing room edwin at once demanded why claudia looked so ill explained how have bearded lady wyke how neddy have advised to search for owner of knife how sight of knife in redleigh police office have informed that owner be none other than own father be dreadful edwin sobbed flic girl when have finished breathless narrative ca have murdered that poor old man of course did said edwin cheerfully although be more startled by news than claudia guessed will ask for explanation be sure will give one think be guilty edwin dear appearance be rather against a be against be innocent so be father did see in london went up to see remember did not be absent when called at tenby mansion oh must see must see cried claudia wringing hand will see together said craver soothing gently worry darling feel sure that everything will come out right lady wyke wo do anything be not sure of ground same claudia be risk going yes know wanted to hear what knew there be person who know more must see claudia if anyone know truth of crime be mr vence chapter xx company of edwin be very welcome to claudia a now have outlet for grief must talk freely to receive comfort very greatly needed although even consoling word did not entirely quieten like girl craver must not bring to believe that buccaneer be guilty there seemed nothing for to see man question closely claudia therefore determined to journey to london not only to interview father also to see mr vence edwin suggestion that old housekeeper must be questioned girl a remarkably sensible mr vence have be in house when crime took place although have given evidence with apparent frankness at inquest be just possible that might have withheld certain fact if forced to speak might say something suggest something likely to throw more light on darkness environed tragedy resolved to see housekeeper first father afterwards what with mr vence story pirate explanation truth might come to light difficulty be to find mi vence who have disappeared into unknown immediately after inquest since leaving hedgerton so far a be known have given sign of existence claudia wondered how address of old creature must be found finally resolved to ask mr mellin when good lady came with washing to rectory mr mellin have never seen mr vence a neddy have always taken clean linen to maranatha have conducted business between housekeeper laundress mr mellin might have learnt something from neddy who be always very inquisitive regarding other people affair be possible that mr vence have mentioned destination to boy in case must certainly have repeated information to mother therefore waited for coming of washerwoman to carry out scheme for over week edwin remained in hedgerton daily flew aeroplane over land sea much to delight of parishioner spectacle attracted man woman child so greatly that there be little work done in village during exciting day talked of northing else face be always turned skyward to see aeroplane skimming rising sinking falling generally disporting into space rector wife seeing what command son have over machine lost much of dread of accident be mainly for reason that young man brought tie aeroplane to hedgerton gave daily exhibition of skill once parent became used to aviation guessed that must not worry over ascent at hendon claudia of course never believed that accident must befall lover did not need proof that be competent pilot be firmly fixed in mind that edwin be destined to save father to cut claw of lady wyke to marry nothing must happen to likely to prevent carrying out programme a felt convinced therefore saw edwin soar without feeling slightest anxiety even offered to accompany lover must not agree to nerve be not strong enough to permit carrying in perilous machine that valued on earth so claudia remained on ground edwin skimmed cloud resting content in knowledge that everything be alright must be right in future lady wyke have not come to see arrival of craver because business have taken to london when returned note inviting young man to maranatha arrived at rectory claudia did not wish edwin to go visit be paid same a craver thought be just a well to try learn what lady wyke intended to do claudia interview must have enraged be possible that have gone to london to take step likely to make immediately public thing best kept private after discussion miss lemby saw that be best edwin must have interview accordingly gave permission so edwin sought maranatha towards end of week claudia during absence questioned mr mellin washerwoman arrived on usual day claudia managed to attend to sorting of clean linen a there be time to be lost kitchen be empty for time being claudia put point blank question do know where mr vence be to be found asked abruptly mr mellin stared lor ' bless soul miss must know thought mr vence might have told where be going when left hedgerton well never did miss did 'ave much truck with mr vence for neddy took washing to 'ouse brought back again never did set eye on ole woman saw 'er in distance at inquest ' may be so bold miss a to know why be so wishful to find 'er claudia be quite prepared for leading question saw reason for making secret of intention well know mr mellin be engaged to marry sir hector when appeared that wife be already mean still in existence ' good thing turned up miss said mr mellin with dignity else wicked case of bigamy must 'ave bin in paper sister laura not bein ' lamb to lie down quiet like well then pursued claudia when be allowed to speak naturally feel that assassin of sir hector must be captured punished struck that mr vence may know lor ' bless miss said must say at inquest ah did be what wish to find out mr mellin however if know address really miss interrupted washerwoman laura might know lady wyke sister miss lor to think a must be connected with gentry long may live in land not a laura proud 'avin ' proved otherwise by comin ' to who be own born relative ' taking neddy in 'and yuss miss laura might know a 'unted up mr vence arter inquest to 'ear what 'd to say concernin ' tragidy ain t much use seein ' mr vence miss if may be so bold a to say so laura did find nothin ' to 'elp catch gory villain who bolted on bike so expect a will git anythin out of 'er same if can get address must be glad will try hardest miss heaven bless said mr mellin particular conversation ended with entrance of rector wife to whom washerwoman dropped curtsey claudia having done best must went away to attend to other work leaving mr craver to count washing hear news there be much to be done upstairs a spring cleaning be in progress so claudia worked like trojan to help prospective mother in law aching of own heart while working giving attention to day thing must not worry managed to pas time profitably tolerably easily until edwin returned heard step in hall immediately opened front door flew down swiftly agog for news well well asked anxiously drawing into sitting room edwin put arm round waist looked at queerly be coming in for fortune observed in abrupt manner claudia stared what do mean sit down explain edwin sat down did a be told lady wyke be furious at want to make suffer for shaking a did told that never did believe guilty only said so to

before marriage be null void if marriage take place never knew that few people do know fancy lady wyke believed that be ignorant so have simply be trying to bluff into marriage with have made will to bribe know that if marry will becomes wastepaper see see anyhow whether will be destroyed by not intend to marry therefore unless alters will stand in favour not that want money claudia said girl however made lady wyke understand that must remain true to yes made understand that be heartbroken have done what must to help by making ridiculous will wo proceed about affair a see that by so doing will be closer to goal for time being intends to remain quiet in hope that business will soften told must did only wo believe however lady wyke be safe for time being so meanwhile can see father mr vence get at truth of matter a to will need think anything more about claudia agreed with wondered that so clever woman a lady wyke be must act foolishly then related conversation with mr mellin to edwin hopefully said that address of mr vence must surely be forthcoming edwin demurred not if lady wyke have to give said ii not such fool a to let find out anything from mr vence likely to spoil

unkempt uncivilised while room have neglected look claudia felt a though be entering into den of bear growl with lemby received aided illusion that edwin be sitting in adjacent chair be ready to

spite of dark cloud by be surrounded claudia felt happier when returned to hedgerton rectory father be with edwin also so protected in way somehow felt safe assured by lemby that be guiltless

awkward position same be not to be thought of for one moment that must be allowed to suffer for crime of be wholly innocent indeed a girl reflected lady wyke must not herself be positive of guilt must long ago have have arrested much of truth have come to light concerning hedgerton tragedy more have to come before assassin of wyke must be placed in dock since father be innocent edwin be innocent claudia must not think who be guilty in railway carriage when on way to redleigh asked edwin opinion h be said young man when thus appealed to be difficult to say dear girl truth may be found in lady

craver that lady wyke murdered man because so far a know did not come down to hedgerton until after murder if have sister mr mellin must have recognised lady wyke might have hired someone to stab sir hector pig might fly said pirate disbelievingly vulgarly why beyond there be one in house at time neddy be in house suggested claudia pouf said father contemptuously mean to say that small boy struck so vigorous blow neddy might know if third person came to maranatha on night wonder if mr vence killed man murmured edwin thoughtfully of course not cried claudia quickly have reason to keep sir hector alive seeing that have lost good situation by death well give up in despair what do think lemby think at growled big man truculently be dashed mystery be if theory be correct lady wyke hired someone to stab old man so that might make new will cove must have sneaked in by back door if did neddy will know because be in kitchen long before crime be committed said miss lemby mr vence admitted a much if neddy saw third person enter in way mr vence saw too declared edwin positively for be in kitchen also not time edwin be running about house listening looking through keyhole a told be mystery sighed young man after pause can do be to wait for arrival of neddy mr vence mr vence will be down on saturday neddy on sunday said claudia know sings at tit bit music hall week have made appearance yet growled lemby since spoke of brat have looked at newspaper for appearance anyhow whether come not be going to see lady wyke what for to ask to many said lemby coolly wo said craver with stare of astonishment be most hopeful man in world if think so lemby be cheek a doe craver anyhow be going to have shot at can say strike lemby said young man drily that will say much more by time conversation reached point train be slowing down alongside redleigh platform edwin got motorcycle out of luggage room where have stowed placing claudia in sidecar whirled off to hedgerton lemby engaged same trap a have formerly taken when paying visit to wyke hoisted portmanteau on to seat beside sankey did not intend to go to rectory a knew that must feel uncomfortable in company of two such precise people a rector wife therefore ordered sankey to drive to jack ashore inn where have talked with sergeant purse claudia edwin be welcomed back joyfully to rectory for old couple have missed sorely mr craver being soul of hospitality be vexed to hear that girl father have gone to inn instead of coming to rectory be anxious to make acquaintance see at close quarter what be like of course have beheld afar off when inquest be taking place naturally desired to talk to examine learn about little guessed that claudia be relieved at father decision to go to jack ashore girl have uneasy feeling prim mr craver must not approve of tyrant be with uneasiness that waited for call lemby proposed to pay for purpose of making acquaintance with rector wife never came to dinner after dinner although claudia be relieved in one way be annoyed in a did not wish mr craver to think that father be entirely devoid of manner fact be that lemby quite intended to go to rectory for meal to meet prospective relative after have settled at inn began to think that must be just a well to get interview over there be doubt about that lady wyke be in position to make thing hot for if used evidence of mr vence so that buccaneer thought that must close mouth by requesting hand in marriage be ridiculous to think for one moment that must prefer battered old pirate such a be to smart handsome young fellow like craver lemby have always made way by sheer audacity hoped to storm lady wyke into submission in truculent frame of mind set out for maranatha shortly after six o'clock when sent in card lady wyke received at once looked upon reception a good omen little knew that little woman wished to learn plan of enemy have received so blandly with object of pumping for purpose of conquest to show that knew what civilisation be lemby have arrayed in evening dress looked fine handsome man when entered big drawing room mellow light of lamp took year off life a did off life of lady wyke came forward with smile to greet looking remarkably attractive well preserved in gorgeous dinner gown of crimson black be so glad to see mr lemby said graciously have not met for ever so long although have have much correspondence reckon said pirate coolly that correspondence be over satisfactory to ah must make allowance for woman whim said lady wyke with equal coolness read between line know then must guess why have called perhaps do perhaps don t anyhow mr lemby a be here may a well have dinner with thought 'd ask said buccaneer with have ineffable audacity so got tidied up on purpose so clever of said hostess with queer smile rang bell to order that knife fork must be placed on table two chatted about matter that discussed news in daily paper talked about various other experience in america in south sea touched upon subject save on be nearest to heart wished to break ice converse about murder must speak first on so serious subject by time dinner gong thundered be quite friendly yet got quite watchful seemed a though good fellowship of meal be necessary to break down reserve between moment have not yet come give arm mr lemby said lady wyke languidly graceful showing nothing of vicious cat who have fought with man daughter be sure must be hungry live on love said pirate gruffly a thought gallantly must be hungry then a there be nothing for to eat of nature lemby turned aside arrow with laugh shortly found seated at beautifully decorated table to eat delicately cooked dinner did full justice to admirable dish to very excellent wine while lady wyke ate little amused with desultory conversation time be watching wondering why have called what be trying to do so far must not fathom motif when champagne have loosened tongue tobacco have soothed nerve if have hoped to learn desired to learn during dinner purposely kept off subject of murder be only when returned to scented drawing room that spoke then pirate in comfortable armchair sipped coffee smoked excellent cigar while hostess trifled with cigarette began to talk sense for first time during evening well mr lemby said resolutely let get to business what business asked buccaneer wilfully dense that about correspond said lady wyke promptly said that must assist to learn who murdered husband so presume have come to tell something about discovery have made know anything about said lemby incoherently what do know dashed well know craver be man who sloped on postman bike on night tried to rope into business hut failed for time being have failed mr lemby may rope in a put later well what else do know know that mr vence be liar oh do lady wyke raised eyebrow yes claudia saw mr vence other day yesterday in fact said mr vence claudia do be accurate old woman growled lemby who did not like to be interrupted said a how came down stair with knife murdered wyke well knife with crime be committed be yours know who say so how do know mr vence say so told then be liar lady wyke shrugged shoulder will have to make stronger defence than mr lemby may a well be plain with one have asked mr vence to come down here will be in house on friday evening sha be here to receive unfortunately a have to go to london to get will of mine destroyed what will one made in favour of mr craver told nodded lemby silly business seeing that marriage make so much waste paper oh mr craver have found that out have said lady wyke calmly thought be clever enough yes be false move on part be going to tear up will be of use now only made to try get mr craver to marry well then be going up on friday for purpose will return on saturday evening must not see mr vence in meantime will leave word that be not to see when return then in presence can meet defend be dashed rot cried lemby with disgust never killed man did craver then who did might have be mr vence rubbish be interest to keep alive lost good situation by husband death remember might have be neddy be in house time so mr vence say boy like pooh might have be lady wyke laughed be in london at time can prove be think however will be called upon to defend why not said lemby significantly might suggest that to purse will unless agree to marry finished woman coolly be right smart of lemby assured came here to ask to marry craver wo have set on claudia have lost hope yet of getting said lady wyke through clenched teeth looked at man in lowering way shuck there be chance there marry will make bargain with what be if edwin will not marry must be hanged help to hang will become wife lemby be quite unmoved by villainous proposal ma'be must be dealing square must think of gal know try man for job be saint draw line at suggestion will try other man cried lady wyke standing up smiling strangely indeed need assistance can prove mr craver guilt mr vence be coming down be coming down have in trap if mr craver be not in gaol by monday afternoon well ma'be questioned pirate roughly bending forward will marry when where like be bargain said lemby gruffly will twist neck if break chapter xxiii mr oliver lemby did not trouble to see lady wyke again two quite understood one there be need for further conversation seeing what claudia have learnt from mr vence pirate be indeed surprised that sir hector widow intended to leave alone get edwin arrested being so passionate vindictive woman be natural enough that desired rather to see craver in dock than at altar beside claudia since must not get have tried mean in power to win be plain that intended to see hanged rather than permit to marry rival motive be easily guessed what puzzled lemby be how meant to bring about aim evidence of mr vence a pirate knew be against involved deeply in crime therefore did not seem much good for widow to bring housekeeper down to hedgerton in order to implicate edwin on face of must not do sole way in lemby must conjecture lady wyke intended to act be that neddy must be used to accuse craver then neddy liked craver be friendly to claudia so might not be inclined to woman bidding so far a must be seen lady wyke have mean of compelling boy mr vence to give false evidence be mystery said good deal for lemby nerve that be able to enjoy in hedgerton with sword of damocles hanging over head enjoy did made very agreeable to old people claudia fear proved to be groundless for father behaved with unusual meekness showed best side of character lemby be not altogether bad have many good point refined assuredly be not have breezy gay air of soldier of fortune fascinated rector wife have never before met with one novelty of conversation charmed pirate talked of adventure in south sea of wandering in patagonia peru brazil of strange doings in australia tendency to exaggeration boastfulness characterised speech made mr craver dub parolles after personage in shakespeare comedy lemby ignorant of literature took a compliment amused rector greatly on whole claudia found that father be greater success than might have be hoped for therefore breathed more freely certainly behaved very well for man of loose habit loose upbringing pirate did not tell daughter how lady wyke have arranged to marry if edwin be arrested in first place did not see how be going to bring about catastrophe in second saw reason to worry claudia if nothing happened before sunday then craver determined to force way into maranatha along with claudia lemby in order to face mr vence in lady wyke presence matter a said must come to climax somehow at time thing must not go on a be doing did lady wyke say what intended to do edwin asked lemby for fourth fifth time on saturday morning said buccaneer with unmoved face lying glibly called to see have dinner with after dinner asked to marry said that must think about rather strange lemby considering lady wyke must know how mr vence accuses of committing crime told that woman be liar believed said lemby hum replied craver doubtfully think that lady wyke be woman to be so easily convinced will have arrested friend may do same to craver well might going by circumstantial evidence thing look very black against use of knife use of postman bicycle go to show that have finger in pie if sergeant purse knew care whether know not broke in lemby be willing to stand trial if be well said craver with shrug may be placed in dock depends upon lady wyke mr vence suppose know that arrived at maranatha last night mr mellin told mr craver added that lady wyke have gone to town be strange that lady wyke did wait to see visitor oh can explain said lemby stolidly lady wyke told be going to london to destroy silly will made in favour admitted that did work since refused to marry must think did refuse said edwin heatedly marry claudia one lemby however lady wyke went to london at mid day on friday mr vence arrived at maranatha late last night wish must see ca lady wyke said that must give order mr vence be not to see except in presence will see lot of in presence said edwin grimly to morrow on monday go to maranatha thresh whole matter out be agreeable said lemby what be going to do to day have to see about repair to aeroplane late in afternoon intend to take flight will come with thank craver then left buccaneer with rector walked along cliff to barn where aeroplane be sheltered building be tithe barn standing on glebe land belonging to rector of hedgerton being little used have fallen into decay a be very large erection with brick wall thatched roof edwin have cleverly turned into shelter for aeroplane by breaking down front adding huge double door there be ample room for machine notwithstanding wide spread of wing slipped in out very easily in barn there be loft nobody used rude ladder from ground to opening overhead have long since be taken away mr craver did not trouble about loft left to rat owl to nesting of starling swallow be content to have roof rainproof door stout so that machine must be kept dry wholly safe from robber on whole be most convenient place for aeroplane a machine have plenty of room outside when emerged to run for time before ascending nothing must have suited craver purpose better to edwin surprise found neddy mellin hovering round barn when arrived trying door peeping in at various point lad looked rather pale be a smart a ever in eton suit craver wondered why have come to hedgerton considering that be engaged to sing at tit bit music hall might necessarily be supposed to have remained in town for saturday matinee what dickens be doing here neddy asked sharply be trying to get squint at aeroplane sir said neddy smartly touching hat there be harm in be there sir mean that neddy why be singing well sir have got touch of hoarseness cove a teach said 'd better wait until next week be going to sing beally in alley ' week did be choky sir boy certainly spoke in rather hoarse manner edwin advised to go homo surrender to mother care wind be rather keen neddy might catch fresh cold oh be right sir said lad indifferently mother only bother with medicine coddling do let have look at machine sir do take up with afternoon ca do unless mother consent neddy said craver kindly by mean can look at aeroplane unlocked door conducted delighted boy into vast interior of barn next two hour be spent joyfully by neddy in assisting craver to do necessary repair proved to be very useful in getting what be wanted with eager curiosity of age lad examined portion of machine asked innumerable question edwin answered good naturedly once twice be on tip of tongue to question neddy about event of night when wyke met with death on swift reflection decided to wait for more fitting occasion a boy be devoted to claudia very grateful to for being allowed to help with repair edwin believed that must not side with lady wyke however much wished therefore be quite content to wait later on when claudia be with must examine boy together learn what really knew likely to reveal truth about twelve o'clock edwin found that have left particular screw at home went back for neddy offered to go readily craver alone knew where screw be to be found went left neddy in charge of barn aeroplane warning not to allow anyone to enter with great pride lad took up post a sentry edwin ran back across wide space of land to rectory intending to return immediately be prevented from doing so saw mr vence on esplanade said claudia meeting lover at gate saw when went out for errand for mother did speak to be distance away when saw ran off ran off that old woman oh edwin be very quick on leg got out of way in most surprising manner afterwards met mr mellin down in village told that mr vence be looking for neddy what doe want with asked craver suspiciously know perhaps want to tell to hold tongue be afraid lest must question have questioned yet claudia now that know mr vence be on warpath will ask immediately return to barn be just a well for to learn what know before mr vence get hold of same see why must tell to hold tongue know if intends to do so edwin be only guess on part dear be neddy still with yes have be with for last two hour helping with repair suppose mother know where be yes said that mr vence sent message from maranatha asking that neddy must come to see mr mellin replied that be at barn on cliff with told mother that be going to try see aeroplane then suppose mr vence came out to look for have be near barn at rate claudia be very suspicious of old woman seems to that want to make neddy hold tongue why must oh know craver pondered deeply after may have slipped knife into wyke remember brought down stair may have laid on study table when speaking to now that come to think of added edwin with start did remember distinctly why did say so before forgot business be refreshing memory remember claudia be very upset at moment mind be somewhat clouded be only coming back to bit by bit yes wyke did have knife did throw on table before took into dining room returned there perhaps mr vence met with knife in hand to edwin edwin ca be sure have reason to murder sir hector have reason to force neddy to hold tongue know if have such intention edwin let find out claudia wait for minute want to find screw then can go back to question boy must examine before mr vence put oar in claudia consented edwin ran into rectory be long time away a must not find screw when did return set out at once for barn with claudia by time have be absent fully three quarter of hour never thinking of shock be waiting for young couple walked leisurely towards barn along cliff chatting easily shortly arrived at building must see sign of neddy outside although edwin expected to find doing sentry go with exclamation of vexation at neddy negligence stepped within then cried out claudia come quick girl who be listening behind ran in to see craver stooping over insensible form of lad neddy be lying face downwards bleeding from ugly wound in head evidently inflicted by blunt instrument to appearance be dead oh edwin who have done cried claudia piteously a knelt beside poor boy body suspect mr vance although have reason to believe so must carry to rectory claudia a can hing with here be dead think not only stunned wait minute claudia will ask one of coastguard to watch barn get to help edwin ran off while claudia tried to staunch wound with handkerchief shortly young man came back with two men while one remained to guard machine other assisted edwin to carry insensible hoy to rectory mr craver received at door be loud in expression of regret messenger be sent off for doctor for mr mellin while neddy be attended to by rector wife by claudia two did must to revive blow have be so heavy that boy be quite stunned nevertheless after much trouble with brandy bathing smelling salt boy vaguely opened blue eye at once gaze fell on claudia bending over lip moved did who mr vence why neddy boy gaze wandered showed sign of relapsing into insensibility again claudia knowing what be at stake asked question again mr vence murdered old then neddy eye closed again became insensible chapter xxiv after momentary gleam of consciousness neddy relapsed into insensibility became dead to world for long time mr mellin arrived in tear insisted that boy must be removed to own poor home so that might be nursed looked after doctor who be by time on spot urged that poor lad must be taken at once to redleigh hospital a be probable that operation must be necessary rector agreed with suggestion after lengthy argument mr mellin be induced to consent to arrangement motor car carried neddy mother to redleigh everything possible having thus be done for victim now remained to find assailant be fortunate that boy have be able to give name of person who struck down a made thing easier for police while neddy be being attended to edwin wired to redleigh for sergeant purse be expected to arrive moment before officer came injured boy be removed to hospital while rector wife be talking over untoward event claudia managed to draw lover into room for private conversation privacy be necessary a knowing what did young couple must not converse freely in presence of mr mr craver edwin still wished to keep in ignorance of what be going on a thing be not yet shipshape when claudia have edwin to herself bluntly asked what be going to do quite a bluntly answered be going to tell whole story to sergeant purse said firmly dad may be arrested if tell truth protested girl uneasily think so remember in presence in presence of mother neddy have accused mr vence of crime until be caught truth of statement be proved purse may have watched certainly will not arrest do think that mr vence be guilty edwin be sure of otherwise why must boy say so mr vence be certainly uneasy when let slip fact that neddy be in house time said miss lemby thoughtfully quite understand replied young man promptly in heat of conversation said too much like many clever criminal gave away why must murder sir hector be what have to find out will learn when be arrested hiding somewhere claudia from what mr mellin said knew where boy be to be found probably followed daresay be lurking round barn while neddy be assisting with repair owing to presence did not get chance of harming then when came back for screw took opportunity a thought killed one witness who must prove guilt claudia nodded seems to be plain enough be wise in telling sergeant what dad have have to do with crime must not be better to wait until mr vence be arrested confesses guilt claudia said edwin positively must speak out now there have be quite enough of hole corner work father be quite innocent for own safety must put under protection of law otherwise deuce know what will happen claudia after consideration agreed with view begged edwin not to confess until father be consulted young man have objection to taking course in order to lose time set out for inn with intention of bringing lemby back to rectory then three must wait for arrival of purse statement must be made so matter be arranged a fate must have claudia lover met sergeant driving along esplanade while on way to village stopped trap when saw made inquiry what be about having found out who murdered sir hector wyke asked lean little man abruptly just received message mr craver came on at once three four policeman be following will need need jervis too in order to catch mr vence said craver promptly be culprit who say so neddy mellin edwin gave hasty sketch of what have happened so a to put purse in full possession of fact when have concluded sergeant whistled fancy that now never must have suspected that old woman gave evidence very clearly at inquest put off scent by very clearness must like to see boy question ca said claudia quickly only became conscious enough to tell in presence in presence of mr craver who have struck down now be insensible again have be taken to redleigh hospital oh have wish have seen before went however can call at hospital when return wo do much good sergeant said craver with shrug boy be not able to recognise anyone to talk at better come with with miss lemby here to see father who be at jack ashore what for asked purse suspiciously have something to tell in connection with death of sir hector wyke yes wo take long to put in possession of what know then can search for mr vence purse drew out watch will give hour said pompously can then go back to rectory have told men to meet there in fact mr craver expected to find there also must have said edwin drily that necessity arose of going to see mr lemby about what have to tell miss lemby wish to be present although have nothing to do with mater oh have chimed in claudia can tell sergeant what mr vence said to other day purse grunted looked suspiciously at girl then with nod agreed to do a be asked redleigh trap be dismissed trio walked on to inn there in very room wherein officer have seen lemby prior to inquest saw again pirate be startled disturbed by invasion of privacy when edwin privately told of determination have arrived at hoarsely objected matter have gone too far for objection to have weight so in end mr lemby be quite agreeable to say what knew then quartette took seat purse produced pocket book anything say will be used in evidence against recited in quite mechanical way now mr craver edwin related in what way be connected in matter purse started when heard that man before be hero of red bicycle escapade did not interrupt speedily noted down detail lemby followed immediately on edwin heel recounted episode of knife bluntly acknowledged to be then claudia took up tale put sergeant in possession of fact connected with hunt for assassin including visit to mr vence statement of neddy that old woman be culprit thing officer took down scribbled furiously when have finished book be replaced in pocket looked steadily at three people before have acted wrongly said sergeant in harsh official voice must have known of thing long ago be not bound to incriminate ourselves said edwin smartly must have helped not confound growled lemby aggressively if have owned up before truth became known must have run in come now confess well be probable must admitted sergeant reluctantly after thing look black against against mr craver here of course be dashed reason why held tongue purse after reflection made answer to rose to intimate that conference be at end next thing to be done be to find old woman said sergeant wait moment said lemby rising how do stand where be said purse gruffly intend to have arrested if mean that until business be cleared up by arrest of mr vence will keep eye on be only reasonable said edwin readily however beg one boon of sergeant don t let father mother know anything about what have told if mr vence be arrested whole story must come out sir then wait until do arrest woman until mr lemby be free from danger wish parent to know fair enough growled sergeant will hold tongue now come along ca have gone far will soon lay hand on old wretch to cheat so hang have pulled wool over eye there be doubt of mr vence have proved too clever for purse at inquest seemed a though must again escape afternoon search be made throughout hedgerton without success servant at maranatha stated that mr vence have left house hour ago have not returned inquiry at mr mellin cottage showed that old woman have not be there various people questioned by police stated that have seen housekeeper wandering about esplanade coastguard remembered to have noticed on cliff be searched beach be examined wood round hedgerton be explored village be beaten for fugitive unsuccessfully seemed a though mr vence have taken wing to herself have flown away yet seemed ridiculous to think that so old so infirm woman must escape so easily by time be four o'clock sergeant be furious at being made to look such fool swearing did not help mr vence have vanished be nowhere to be found well said purse when came across edwin claudia at barn whither have gone to look at aeroplane what be to be done now ca find said miss lemby anxiously know old wretch by sight see here take police whistle if spot blow for be worth be not likely to see protested claudia if clever man like ca find how do expect to see here young lady broke in irate officer mr vence be hiding while police be about will not show intend to collect men at rectory then come along to have talk with coastguard yonder there be man there want to examine now when mr vence see that coast be clear may venture out a wo take notice of keep eye open blow whistle if see be ask ask great deal sergeant said claudia drily father will remain at rectory with men will do what ask yes warn that anticipate success said claudia slipping whistle into pocket do be grasping at straw growled sergeant who be very hot very angry be turning away from barn to go to rectory collect men when edwin stopped for moment have objection to taking flight sergeant asked want to try machine now be repaired edwin quite expected man to object to surprise sergeant at once assented seeing going away on aeroplane will make mr vence think that have given up hunt will venture out to escape go by mean mr craver will come back to see start purse hurried away edwin made ready machine only intended to take short flight over water then return a merely wished to see if repair be all right to provide against accident placed coil of rope on pilot seat might be wanted might not all same be just a well that must be there shortly just when purse returned from rectory edwin be ready called two three coastguard from station to assist in ascent while ran aeroplane along ground to give impetus to rise purse cast eye here there everywhere in hope of seeing mr vence why expected to remain in vicinity of crime be impossible to say must not help thinking that be lurking about close at hand however attention be called from watching by ascent of great machine rose majestically into air swept round in great circle then turned nose seaward looking up following flight purse walked along towards coastguard station leaving claudia seated in shadow near front of barn be behind one of double door must not be seen from within for time claudia watched aeroplane swooping soaring dipping rising in rainbow coloured sunset sky when dwindled to mere black dot let eye sink to ground blinked to got dazzle out of suddenly heard stealthy noise looked through aperture between door barn where swung on hinge to surprise saw someone climbing actively down wall having emerged from trapdoor leading to loft there be ladder a have be explained so person in question have to descend like monkey using foot hand to cling to rough wail glint of sunshine showed claudia blue dress red knitted shawl so be not long in doubt a to whom individual be evidently mr vence after striking down boy have climbed up into loft in order to hide now that believed coast to be clear be trying to escape into open one have ever thought of searching loft so astute old woman have shown uncommon sense in choosing hiding place with bated breath claudia rose silently waited patiently drawing whistle from pocket mr vence quite ignorant that be being watched crept down like huge bat then made run for door just a emerged claudia sprang at old woman uttered shriek like cry of trapped animal afterwards became silent fought viciously claudia knowing what be at stake held on tightly in struggle woman spectacle fell off then bonnet mass of false hair be unmasked lady wyke gasped claudia lady wyke chapter xxv lady wyke lady wyke babbled claudia dazed by amazing discovery beast snarled detected murderess wrenched free to run swiftly across open space between barn zig zag path led down to beach claudia seeing quarry escaping recovered sens promptly blew shrill call on police whistle in moment sergeant purse at not too distant coastguard station heard signal came running out saw in moment flying figure of woman sped towards like deer in order to intercept before reached cliff at same time claudia sprang forward also reached fugitive almost at same time a officer purse laid hand on prey just a reached opening of path dexterously flung on ground lady wyke seeing that be lost howled like wild beast swore like several trooper in anger baffled rage sergeant paid attention to curse when rose be lying on ground with handcuff on wrist claudia silently stood looking down on captured enemy not knowing whether to laugh cry so unstrung did feel unable to say word turned red white alternately awaited event get up mr vence said purse briefly be not mr vence quavered claudia in shaky voice be lady wyke gosh gasped sergeant astonished for once in official life do mean to say that murdered husband there be answer from woman lady rolled on dry grass cursing freely while claudia sat down on convenient rock to clasp hand tightly keep from trembling in fact from breaking down altogether one else be at hand a policeman at rectory have not heard whistle purse have waved back coastguard who seemed disposed to approach did not wish anyone must share glory of capture desired then there to hear lady wyke story so that must be sure have arrested right person now then said purse shaking finger at sternly what have to say madam remember anything do say will be used in evidence against oh sneered lady wyke looking very white very vicious think that will be fool enough to speak after warning how dare arrest innocent person such a be be guilty said claudia hoarsely murdered sir hector be lie neddy mellin can prove then until doe be guiltless raged woman furiously take handcuff off man oh said sergeant smoothly have arrested a mr vence who struck down boy afterwards can be arrested for murder of husband a lady wyke did kill tell snarled viciously a to boy never saw rat growled purse inelegantly if be innocent of assault why did hide in loft lady wyke scowled saw that there be escape from lesser crime only hit boy lightly to punish for telling lie stunned be dangerously ill said claudia quickly then how can accuse if have sens about recovered for moment to say that have struck gave reason why did so reason demanded woman with sneer murdered husband did say that in exact word said that mr vence have murdered sir hector well be not mr vence be lady wyke rot said sergeant angrily what deuce be wasting time for in telling lie be lady wyke sure enough have be masquerading for purpose a old woman under name of mr vence can prove nothing against said lady wyke sullenly yes can operation will restore young mellin to health evidence will hang hang lady wyke shivered yes there be escape have better not say more want to trap into confession get up come along with must take to redleigh goal oh groaned woman looking at handcuff then wrathfully at white face of miss lemby to think that girl must get better of be not beaten yet here get up come along said purse harshly bent to lift wait shrieked lady wyke who now saw that there be indeed escape that time have come for to pay in full for wickedness have word to say first say then growled officer sharply be quick about captured woman thought for few moment then began with sigh to confess wickedness continued with frequent sob bad a be claudia be quite sorry for apparent misery will tell truth said lady wyke in melancholy tone became sharper when purse began to recite formula bother said tartly take out pocket book note down what say be ready said sergeant stolidly when command be complied with lady wyke nodded looked at fettered hand shivered never thought that 'd live to have on said sullenly however game up that girl yonder have won be use beating about bush longer did murder husband oh gasped claudia shrinking wincing yes went on woman plaintively killed with knife of father to begin at beginning voice shook made effort continued slowly when saw in america that hector be going to marry miss lemby came back to stop from committing bigamy thought that be dead well be returned saw sandal to prove identity also learnt that will made by hector shortly after marriage left property to be still in existence then interviewed hector have unpleasant scene a may guess did not want to tell truth immediately wished for time to think over matter to do so proposed to go into hiding in country because be afraid lest father must come worry father did find out said claudia while purse went on busily taking note learnt from edwin where sir hector be add edwin knew because father be rector of hedgerton well than a may guess be not going to let husband give slip so said must go with objected a have fixed upon maranatha in hedgerton a hiding place knew that came from there did not wish sister who be only washerwoman to know be wife therefore said must make up a old woman go a housekeeper husband consented to absurd idea asked purse doubtfully lady wyke smiled drily must very well object must demanded seeing that have inside running since be anxious to hide truth about first marriage from girl yonder have to do what wished a knew must give show away well then being actress be quite able to turn into old hag be lady wyke in london arrived at maranatha a mr vence afterwards when house be more le ready hector arrived pigged there for time hector must not make up mind to tell of reappearance miss lemby so dilly dallied day after day kept mostly indoors while occasionally hector walked out although discouraged people calling be natural considering did not feel inclined for company particularly refused to see sister mr mellin lest must recognise through disguise got neddy to bring washing nephew became very friendly did know then that be aunt asked claudia purse mutely put same question no never knew at mr vence lady wyke be one same person said good deal for cleverness in making up never guessed said miss lemby shaking head tribute to talent cried lady wyke ironically well then whole reason why disguised myself at hector request watched be to prevent from making will fancied that wanted to leave money to miss lemby naturally hated pigged a husband housekeeper for time a know watched carefully then on particular night mr oliver lemby arrived saw husband in drawing room then wait bit broke in purse be boy mellin in house then yes arrived early with washing be eating bread honey in kitchen excused left there while went up to spy at drawing room door keyhole wished to find
