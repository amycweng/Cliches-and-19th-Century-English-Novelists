eye of pale blue few tuft of white hair covered sparsely baldness of skull ear hand foot be large ill shaped dressed in rusty black wore carpet slipper wisp of white ribbon did duty a collar last

from lack of brain of eloquence perhaps from quilpish look have failed to gain a much a curacy in lieu thereof have earned bare subsistence by making note in british museum for various employer be while thus engaged that edermont have chanced upon again out of sheer pity owner of red house have taken unlucky joad to kent there permitted to potter about library garden vegetable existence completely satisfied unambitious brain of creature be devoted to god who have given ease odd part of arrangement be that edermont must not permit hanger on to remain in house at night punctually at nine mr joad betook to small cottage fronting gate there ate slept until nine next morning when presented again in library to read dust arrange catalogue many book for twenty year contract have be faithfully carried out by pair of college friend from nine to nine daylight joad haunted house from nine to nine darkness remained in tumbledown cottage being now on duty admitted dora lover after closing gate stood staring at with book hugged to breast cunning look in eye swollen red nose suggested trembling hand bloodshot eye drink so that on whole be by mean pleasant spectacle to behold dora threw look of disgust on disreputable dirty silenus whom particularly disliked addressed sharply according to custom where be mr edermont said stepping back from immediate neighbourhood have brought dr scott to see julian be still in bedroom replied silenus in voice of surprising beauty volume doe not wish to see anyone least of doctor oh never mind that mr joad said allen good humouredly come a friend to inquire after health of mr edermont quite understand grunted other will make medical suggestion in guise of friendly remark so like father be father mr joad did know asked scott considerably astonished yes think added joad with spice of maliciousness that have advantage died when be five year old replied allen sadly so remember very slightly be strange must have known month without becoming aware of fact that be acquainted with father be beside point broke in dora severely want to see mr edermont afterwards can talk to mr joad will be glad to do so there be many thing wish to know about father then why ask dr scott when julian be at hand mr edermont refuse to answer inquiry in case said joad with great deliberation must ask lady burville young man be so startled by speech for moment must say nothing by time have recovered tongue joad be already halfway across lawn scott must have followed that dora laid detaining hand upon arm later on allen said firmly in meantime see guardian dora lady burville name again hint hint at manner of strange thing allen know that a well a do tell what dear coming of woman be about to cause change in life dora on what ground do base supposition on ground that know returned distinctly can give others have belief premonition call what will that lady burville coming be herald of change if must know more ask mr edermont who be why fainted at sight of by time be standing on step of porch whence wing of mellow red brick spread to right left facing sunlit lawn square framed window extended along front above below upper one of over porch be wide open a allen dora stood by step wild white face peered out saw in sunlight have looked up must have seen mr edermont have refrained from further conversation fate so willed that talked on unconscious of listener be allen who reopened subject of new patient who have be referred to by edermont joad in so mysterious way after said allen meditatively see why must have premonition of change that lady burville must know mr edermont be nothing to quite so that lady burville must know something about late father be something to did mention anything about morning not word replied be strange that must not have done so not stranger than that must have be called in to attend be purely accident think so said dora deliberately at least not in face of mr joad remark dr scott looked puzzled what do make out of lady burville asked before dora must answer question voice spoke to from above talk more of woman cried mr edermont with tremor in tone come upstairs allen have something for private ear then heard window hastily closed a though mr edermont be determined that forthcoming conversation must be a private a possible go up at once allen whispered dora pushing towards door speak to guardian will question mr joad about lady burville mind must tell mr edermont say to there may not be anything to tell said allen doubtfully dora looked at seriously be sure that what be told will change life mine said dora know something allen know nothing be going simply by premonition be not superstitious said scott entered house be not superstitious a stated yet at moment might well have be so for in mere act of ascending stair be entering on dark tortuous path at end of loomed shadow of death when gray tweed vanished up stair dora turned eye in direction of mr joad be seated in straw chair under cedar tree looked blot on loveliness of view else be blue sky stretch of emerald green golden sunshine multicoloured flower untidy disreputable creature huddled up mass of dingy black seemed out of place for dora be glad be within speaking distance alone so to speak be key to problem be then perplexing problem of premonition that healthy breezy young woman must posse so morbid fancy seems unreasonable dora took view of matter be troubled rarely by foreboding by premonition vague fear nevertheless there be superstitious side to character hitherto in tranquil physically healthy existence there have be chance for development of particular side now from various cause betrayed in feeling of depression mr edermont fainting mention of lady burville that lady fainting anxiety concerning recluse finally mr joad assertion that lady burville have known allen father fact hinted that something be about to happen dora did not know what something must possibly be felt vaguely that must affect life of herself lover therefore be anxious to know worst at once accordingly going out to meet trouble walked forward to silenus on lawn joad saw coming looked up with what be meant to be fascinating smile disreputable old creature have passion of youth in spite of age in senile way greatly admired ward of patron admiration took annoying form of constantly forestalling wish if dora wanted book paper chair bunch of flower joad be always at hand to supply want at first accepted attention carelessly enough deeming little kindly pertinacity of amiable old man of late have found joad attention rather troublesome moreover obsequious demeanour leer oily courtesy made feel uneasy nevertheless did not dream that old creature be in love with beauty so absurd idea never entered head joad be in love for cherished ardently hopeless passion mr joad said dora abruptly coming to point at once who be lady burville dear miss carew cried old man ignoring question rising to foot pray be seated in chair sun be hot here will be out of glare never mind about glare chair said dora making unconscious rhyme asked question who be lady burville lady burville repeated joad seeing must no longer escape answering let see mr pride said something about oh yes be wife of sir john burville celebrated african millionaire believe be guest of sir harry hernwood at hall go on said dora seeing that paused what else do know nothing what repeated be only pride gossip be ignorant of lady history if come to miss dora added joad with grotesque smile why must not be ignorant

be saying be wilfully deceiving mr joad why must miss dora if knew anything about lady must tell willingly so happens that know nothing spoke a though knew good deal retorted dora angrily spoke at random young lady if why what be matter with julian be little wonder that asked question for edermont have opened window again be hanging out of cry gesticulating like terrible punch lambert lambert shrieked come help will kill kill joad shuffled towards house a quickly a old leg must take be followed by astonished dora be about to step into entrance hall when allen scott came flying down stair be wild eyed breathless a gray in hue a clothes wore allen cried dora recoiling at mad look what be matter stop for god sake said doctor hoarsely avoiding outstretched hand fled hastily down garden path click of gate have not be locked by joad vanished from sight dora stared at joad looked back at with malicious grin at flight of lover overhead at open window heard hysterical sobbing of julian edermont chapter iii to man own fear after pause of astonishment at inexplicable flight of lover dora ran upstairs to room of mr edermont be imperative that must learn truth of disturbance in absence of dr scott guardian be proper person to explain matter have dora glanced back at joad who followed closely might have gathered from malignant expression that be likely also to afford explanation in anxiety went directly to door of mr edermont bedroom be wide open occupier be still sobbing by open window what be matter cried dora hurrying forward why have allen edermont lifted up white face wet with tear flung out two thin hand with low cry of terror then with sudden anxiety in eye staggered rather than walked across room closed door sharply joad have already entered still hugging book stood looking grimly at swaying figure of patron with back to door edermont interrogated ward friend have gone be gate closed be locked barred have gone gate be safe said joad for dora be too astonished by oddity of question to reply edermont wiped sweat from forehead nodded weakly finally subsided into armchair here bowed face in hand dora caught drift of word muttered in low voice be of favourite prayer from litany battle murder from sudden death good lord deliver ' moaned man then in measure recovered serenity seized with sudden anger at abject terror have displayed at shameful accusation have levelled against lover dora stepped forward faced mr edermont with indignant look now that feel better said coldly perhaps will afford explanation edermont looked at in dazed manner be little man scarcely five foot in height have noble head seemed out of place on so insignificant body with long white lock streaming beard be quite imposing figure when seated when standing smallness of body of hand foot detracted from majesty of patriarchal look also eye be timid restless silvery beard swept breast hid weak mouth stripped of venerable disguise mr edermont must no doubt have looked what be puny irresolute insignificant animal a be imposed on everyone until knew better dora have long since fathomed narrow selfishness of nature saw for what be not a appeared to outside world be fair to add that always treated with deference in public at present moment there be need to keep up appearance dora spoke brusquely to little man in heart have a great contempt for a have disgust for joad be objectionable considered have one redeeming point noble head of edermont noble voice of friend beyond first be more of rabbit than man second rather satyr than human being never have dora detested pair more than did at present moment be waiting for explanation mr edermont said again a did not reply have explanation for retorted guardian wearily go away dora leave in peace girl took seat folded arm leave room until know why allen left house said firmly what have to do with cried edermont in shrill anger conversation be about private matter be about lady burville what do know of woman

julian be joad reply can guess why allen scott left house must not help be oh be afraid muttered edermont passing hand over eye have cause to be afraid now retorted joad with look of contempt at shrinking figure of friend turned left room dora waited until heavy footstep died away then turned again to edermont why did allen leave house asked with obstinate insistence be business mine also have right to know why have driven away man whom be about to marry edermont burst into unpleasant mirth be over done with dear said staring at allen scott will never marry now what have told gasped turning pale have told something will keep away from house something will prevent from ever seeing again what do mean mr edermont have risen to foot be standing over with flushed face indignant eye to

father mother be dead that inherited five hundred year that mr edermont be guardian until reached age of twenty one fact be known to beyond nothing now must seem that mystery be connected with dead mr edermont be about to divulge did parent do that must be sorry for asked pointedly will never tell what did dora have hinted too much already be sufficient for to know that sinned that sin will be visited on how dare speak to like cried dora clenching hand what right have to terrify with vague hint demand explanation will never obtain one from said edermont in quavering voice if be wise will seek one nowhere else will ask allen be bound by promise to not to tell then will question lady burville edermont rose with bound gripped arm with strength of have not thought capable girl cried

know must learn what be that threatens future happiness of allen ca sit down with folded arm await bolt from blue must know must consider must act against two people edermont have warned have omitted to specify third out on lawn under cedar dora saw black figure of joad must appear from parting word to patron that knew what have be told to allen dora be on point of crossing to wringing if possible

given to edermont why will tell must tell said with angry stamp will go into canterbury at once glanced at old clock in hall chimed half past two will go at once repeated dora went for bicycle at gate

under thirty minute made sure must be able to overtake allen before must escape there be vague idea in mind that owing to what have be told by edermont whatever might be did not wish to submit to

good for part prefer to keep silent about past be fair to mr tice silence be more than fair to in case said old dame looking steadily at eager face of young girl be merciful merciful be strange word to use be only word can be used replied mr tice emphatically ask more dear young lady secret hold be not own to tell must mr allen give permission to reveal will do so otherwise prefer to be silent one must have thought that speech be final dora be too bent upon learning truth of allen strange behaviour to be satisfied urged cajoled threatened implored to purpose whatever be that mr tice knew detrimental to past of mr edermont be determined to keep to herself evidently there be nothing left to wait until allen returned from experience dora knew that must wheedle anything out of easy going lover do know anything about lady burville asked dora finding must not persuade mr tice into confessing what knew know nothing not even name said housekeeper why do ask because lady burville have something to do with quarrel between mr edermont allen can safely say that know nothing on point miss carew lady burville be complete stranger to must say to mr allen have never heard speak of mr

dora returned home more mystified than ever like everyone else mr tice hinted at secret of past likely to affect future yet refused explanation of such hint edermont joad acted in same unsatisfactory way allen to avoid questioning absented from presence be very tiresome thought perfectly inexplicable only one fact stood out clearly in dora mind namely that lady burville be responsible for confusion therefore argued lady burville must hold clue to possible disentanglement be logical have dora obeyed impulse of nature must have gone directly to cause of perplexity have demanded unravelment must have put question in crudest form thus guardian be moved by sight of order to avoid name formed gist of conversation between guardian lover with result that mr edermont tell will never marry allen mr tice who be ignorant of inexplicable influence asserts same thing creature joad hint that knew be father on surface matter appear to be disconnected incoherent feel certain that word from will render explicable must say that word to since be upon that trouble have created have descended so dora thought ranging fact in such vague order a ignorance permitted a did not know lady burville have plausible excuse for seeking be forced to remain in ignorance for want of explanation felt sure woman must have supplied in present dilemma dora with usual good sense recognised that there be nothing to be done to remain quiescent wait later on allen must return from london indeed mr tice expected back day then must be forced to explain conduct explanation might put matter in plain light do away with fiat of mr tice edermont regarding impossibility of marriage with allen come what might dora be resolved that must not give up lover spoil life pending explanation resultant adjustment of situation held peace waited future be future dora knew more than for week after day of mystery life progressed a usual at red house joad came went with usual punctuality eyed dora in furtive manner with distinct avoidance of explanation edermont recovered nerve to extent moved in accustomed petty orbit dora lacking other interest attended to household duty to casual spectator thing must seem to be going on a usual life must have appeared tranquil dull be surface calm beneath dangerous element be at work later on be destined to be use to recur to hackneyed simile of sleeping volcano seven day nothing be heard of lady burville of allen former still continued to be guest at hernwood latter still remained in london not line have be received from by dora hurt in maidenly pride became offended by continued silence extraneous circumstance have led to behaviour have not caused breach for breach considered between twice thrice have determined to go over to

contained only two entrance one from road tall gate with spike on top other little door far down right side house like gate be kept always bolted barred mr edermont confessed to fear of robber bearing in mind particular prayer in litany dora be certain in own mind that greater fear than moved to take such precaution when joad have retired to cottage at nine o'clock mr edermont accompanied personally to gate saw that be bolted barred afterwards examined side postern then retreated to mansion where closed iron clamped shutter locked door throughout house woman who cooked cleaned did work

allen in stated that must return on second of august must see next day mean to explain thought girl putting welcome letter away in desk in two three day will know why quarrelled with guardian why mr pallant warned against must scold allen for neglect communication relieved greatly of late have be so bewildered harassed that have almost doubted whether allen loved truly yet have told so hundred time be satisfied that spoke truly from subtle instinct never deceives woman loved adored none other than must ever be wife before belief dismal prophecy of mr tice edermont strange warning of pallant counted a nothing dora believed that allen loved must explain away mystery of past week in belief be content to wait time mr edermont be surprisingly bright weight appeared to have be lifted off shoulder looked ten year younger be scarcely past fifty notwithstanding white lock hoary beard began to talk of leaving retirement going out to mix with world once more dora knew that have large income must afford to live in most luxurious manner have often be surprise to that have lived so long in seclusion almost penury from sundry circumstance gathered that have for year be labouring under dread of death by violence hence anxiety that house must be carefully locked up now that dread have be removed a more than hinted by communication from pallant must take life easily looking back on fear have haunted twenty year dora no longer wondered at cowardice terror of puny creature rather be astonished that with so terrific shadow to fight have kept out of lunatic asylum stronger men than succumbed to such influence from force of habit edermont still locked up house at night still sent joad to cottage over road no longer trembled at tremendous prayer of litany did look round church searching for possible danger mystery of life must be dora be quite unable to guess that mystery have be done away with edermont talked of fraternizing again with fellow creature one thing struck a odd when recovered from excess of joy caused by communication of pallant wrote lengthy letter be particular to post a rule joad attended to despatch of such rare epistle a be sent from red house so dora be astonished that guardian must be so anxious about especial letter occurred to that might possibly have be sent to lady burville with whom felt certain guardian be connected in underhanded way

lip will hear that can never be husband until then decline to consider engagement a broken said dora very pale firm be not going to be dupe mr edermont will force to explain forbid to to speak to like cried edermont shrinking back will speak a choose be tired of selfish tyranny if allen doe not make wife will go out into world to earn own living at least have enough to live on enough to live on replied slowly perhaps yes perhaps what do mean sir demanded imperiously crafty smile played over face of mr edermont shrugged shoulder wait till allen come then may learn more than care to listen to now go to bed by way what about toothache toothache joad said something about be impatient remark told that toothache kept awake at night very true night have be sleepless for last few week have heard

marriage with allen what must be use of knowing obstacle dora will never get rid of take word for now good night good night replied dora thinking useless to argue further think might kiss before go grumbled edermont stand in place of father without word dora returned touched forehead of old man with fresh young lip a passed through door glance back showed picture never left memory in afterlife edermont noble head with white hair leaning on hand sat by bureau in gloomy thought single candle served rather to show than to dispel darkness in gulf of pale glimmer hollowed out of gloom man looked like famous portrait by old master burden of year be visible in silvery hair sweeping beard of burden of sorrow marked in hollow eye wrinkled cheek forehead wasted hand looked incarnation of eld a seen in spectral light in tenebrous atmosphere dora never forgot that sight once in room lost time in getting to bed sleepless night of past week have worn out now that pain have left tooth be glad to take advantage of respite at first thought about guardian untold misery afterwards of allen strange behaviour lastly thought wandered to joad sly look hinted terror until sleep rolled like wave over weary brain became oblivious of material world nature revenged for many vigil soothed into sound slumber how long have be asleep did not know suddenly for inexplicable reason woke with start sat up in bed nerve strung to utmost tension faculty on alert seemed to that have heard muffled cry for help wild appeal for mercy now that be listening with will must hear nothing be dark quiet not sound broke silence of still night after moment two dora believed that have mistaken dream for reality laughing softly at own folly lay down again to sleep a head touched pillow deep bell of hall clock chimed one

amid blood lay pistol near to hand of dead man many paper be scattered about tossed in confusion from bureau mr edermont have be nothing more to dora than legal guardian have be selfish cowardly creature who have done nothing to win love yet a dora looked at body lying there red with blood battered beaten bruised felt at once sorry angered first so harmless so far a knew creature have be so cruelly done to death second that assassin have escaped however a deed be done man be dead time be to be lost in raising alarm be just possible that murderer might be secured if prompt measure be taken dora knew now that cry have heard in night have be no fancy dreaming terrible reality striking of clock immediately afterwards enabled to fix exact time when crime have be committed however be wise enough to say nothing on point until called upon to do so raising with aid of meg dead body on to sofa sent woman across road to summon joad hardly have issued order when voice of very person in surprised tone be heard in drawing room off study considerably astonished at early arrival for be not yet eight o'clock dora ran into next room at door paused in sheer amazement glass door at side of

always afraid that must be murdered by certain person who that person be why must desire julian death know more than do dora only believed half of statement from what have seen must appear that joad have be completely in confidence of dead man denial seemed to be unnecessary however made comment on speech with sudden suspicion asked joad how be have come to red house before usual time guessed what be in mind laughed slyly if think know anything of terrible deed be wrong said slowly be not likely must kill only friend have in world reduce to beggary good heaven mr joad never accused of

time dora finding so unsatisfactory took to own sitting room sat in chair then spoke bluntly with anger be surely natural be glad to see allen said abruptly a wish to have explanation of singular conduct have none to give said flushing indeed then why did come over to day heard of murder for one thing said allen slowly for wish to put end to engagement dora started remembered prophecy of mr tice of dead man have come true sooner than expected in fashion did not anticipate many thing might have arisen to prevent marriage if allen be true to one hoped to overleap obstacle here be man man who have vowed thousand time that must not live without proposed to part must hardly believe ear from outraged pride tear sprang to eye thought loved allen said then flung on sofa sobbed a though

bathed stretch of green grass clump of stately tree in golden ray a in mockery of puny grief trivial ruin contrast struck a so ironical that burst into bitter laughter mirth thus wrung from breaking heart ended in sigh of regret why do laugh allen asked dora scared by cruel merriment why do not answer laugh because of contrast between joy of nature own sorrow replied turning pale face towards did not reply because be thinking heard what said took hand within own looked at anguished face with great love in eye heard agree said softly god bless for good woman dora for have behaved nobly many

allen must not bring to enlighten dora on subject if thing looked black against must have to put up with situation a best must to justify conduct by telling truth must not do so in mercy to herself spared that revelation if allen remained absent others did not when fact of murder became known quite stream of morbid people set forth to view scene of crime thanks to presence of police stubborn

advance vied with in amiability on part mr tice viewed comedy with displeasure nevertheless made attempt to interfere although be unwilling to be active party in revealing truth to dora yet be by mean displeased that girl must learn from third person dora be deeply in love with allen sooner realized that there must be union between better must be to come to understanding be necessary that must learn secret when be possessed of such knowledge housekeeper be satisfied that even if dr scott did desire match dora must refuse consent thereto therefore mr tice preferred being spectator to actor for day dora pursued amiable tactic joad fell deep deeper in love be well aware in own heart that girl young enough to be granddaughter must never consent to be wife for that put restraint upon

forcing into plain speaking revelation made be one be far from expecting beginning of whole matter lay in fact that discovered joad in library worse for drink be not that be confused maudlin for man brain speech be clear be filled with dutch courage made more audacious than usual dora reproved for vice must be ashamed of drinking so much brandy mr joad said severely have not touched brandy for

refuse to pocket fifty thousand pound allude to reward dear lady can not gain that be not so sure of inability to do so said dora coolly with knowledge of mr edermont past life must know who be feared if know name of person know who killed with knowledge why not apply for fifty thousand pound be not so omniscient a think miss carew will suppose for sake of argument have such knowledge what must benefit to gain fortune must do good with must gain love dora turned away with flushed face feeling delicacy of position must not talk to like mr joad said with great dignity why not love then ought to be ashamed to say so be affianced wife of man allen scott yes said dora with emphasis dr allen scott bah why must think of have stood by in trouble not left to fight matter out by besides there be reason why must not marry dora heart beat rapidly be about to learn truth have rebuff brought about desired result must old man reveal what so long have be hidden believed that such be case must scarcely manage so intense be excitement to ask necessary question to lure on to full confession however by effort of will managed to keep voice fairly steady be there special reason that know of several snarled joad rubbing hand together with evil glitter in eye must be glad to hear said in tone of empress dare say must intend to tell what be why not demanded dora trying to hide disappointment at unlooked for result because choose to speak until be pleasure to do so said joad insolently oh can see what be up to miss carew be trying to force truth out of for purpose of own sha sha sha old creature stamped with rage face grew so red in excitement that dora really thought be about to have fit looked at in astonishment while strove to control anger assume dignified demeanour such conduct be not to be tolerated dora walked towards door of library will return when know how to conduct said coldly before must open door delinquent shuffled after in state of childish repentance go go cried piteously be very sorry indeed be very sorry then why do talk such nonsense said dora seeing that have gained advantage do think want to know secret foolish old man yes yes be foolish old man repeated catching up word eagerly be angry with love oh dora dear sweet dora love whining in fashion old man fell on knee rise mr joad be foolish get up at once insist not until promise to be wife

will tell name will gain fortune will give to only consent to be wife wife cried dora shrinking back with visible repugnance ah know that be old said joad piteously reflect there be much to be gained by can not live long must soon be widow must leave money think how rich must be must marry if offered million said dora with contempt love one man only only will marry joad rose in fury tell name shrieked know allen that miserable wretch will never marry never how can prevent marriage by telling truth by gaining fortune stepped forward seized wrist hold life of lover in hollow of hand what do mean panted dora explain wish to know secret well will tell one one only will make heart sore face white who killed julian who came here in dead of night struck foul blow who allen scott allen scott murderer curse chapter xiii denial then be weapon joad have reserved to strike last blow by denouncing scott hoped to win fortune by keeping silent for dora sake thought must force to marry in case stood to win with indifference to money preferred girl to fifty thousand pound only remained for to accept hand in order to save lover from death on gallows a yet be doubtful certainly bolt have be shot must bolt fall waited with fixed eye bloodless face dora retreated slowly backwards at length reached wall leant against overcome with mingled feeling of terror astonishment joad hand hanging loosely by side stood looking at with doubtful smile on pale lip seeing that did not speak repeated accusation in different form be now calmer lover be murderer of guardian said watching effect of word something in malice of tone brought back courage to dora heart with rush flushed up bravely stepped forward boldly joad did not move came close to so close that must feel breath on withered cheek for final taunt spoke again murderer fine young man lover just think of lie brought out word coldly without least display of passion knowing scott a did charge be so monstrous that must hardly forbear from breaking into hysterical laughter a be controlled admirably merely repeated word lie mr joad said steadily accusation spring from malice can not substantiate lie without wasting time in asseveration joad simply raised finger to emphasize word related without preamble ground upon based accusation listen said in rich deep voice remember day on brought scott to see julian very good a know have serious quarrel heard that julian called out for protection scott wished to kill at moment why why stammered making vague gesture with hand ah ask more than can tell be not present during conversation know however can guess what took place refuse to tell much dare speak julian cast certain reflection on dead parent of scott mentioned something took place twenty more year ago at christchurch murmured looked surprised know who told so much said brusquely admit that information be correct at christchurch miss carew episode took place be not creditable to dr scott parent have episode to do with mr edermont can not tell be speaking of ground for suspecting lover what passed before matter nothing suffice for to understand julian quarrelled with scott be afraid lest young man must murder heard cry for help well said dora seeing that paused well replied joad with suave smile did murder believe where be proof joad darted imperious glance at shrinking form be about to produce proof declared calmly on night of second of august left here at nine o'clock assisted julian to lock gate behind if remember went to cottage have supper afterwards waited for mr pride who have promised to look in on return from canterbury ten o'clock eleven o'clock twelve o'clock struck still pride did not come thought that have arranged to stay night in canterbury shortly after twelve went out on to road to see if be coming did not see did see dr scott allen cried dora disbelievingly be coming down road on bicycle how must recognise in dark moon be up recognised in moonlight did see be standing in shadow be astonished to see near red house at midnight watched passed gate got off bicycle at end of wall then turned down side path lead to postern gate waited to see if must return a did not be about to follow when pride arrived unwilling to say anything about what have seen lest must compromise lover took pride into house there got talking to till after two o'clock in interest of conversation quite forgot scott visit next morning looked at in crafty way heard of murder found postern gate open what inference do draw from murmured dora with white lip infer that scott called to see julian with reference to previous quarrel perhaps to demand proof a to episode of christchurch believe that climbed wall entered house through glass door of drawing room julian have not locked have doubt that found julian in study that julian told story of episode be locked up in bureau doubt scott insisted upon having paper revealed dishonour of parent placed in hand julian must naturally refuse then quarrel must recommence end of must be well added joad with shrug know rest julian be killed bureau robbed of paper what further proof can desire that dr scott murdered guardian dora heard story with suffocating feeling in throat felt a though net be being thrown round allen a though must be tangled in mesh be true that have returned from london on night of murder must not understand why must have visited red house at midnight then remembered that allen have gone to town on business connected with terrible conversation with edermont what if have that edermont have spoken truth regarding dishonour of parent have returned to revenge on old man thought occurred to with lightning rapidity in end gave place to one must save at cost to do so must close joad mouth why did not speak of before asked in trembling voice wished to tell first know that love wish to be wife if marry scott will be safe if not if not what must do duty said solemnly situation be frightful dora felt that must scream if only to relieve tension of nerve if joad denounced allen doctor must be arrested what defence must make what explanation must give for coming to red house on night at very time of committal of crime said nothing trying to collect thought while joad blinked at through half shut eye after must marry declared suddenly be guilty have yet to be proved said dora faintly can not believe that allen committed so horrible crime motive motive will be found in paper stole said joad brutally come answer consent to be wife go to police evening must give time stammered joad nodded be only fair said gravely will give week if promise by time well lover go to scaffold how dora got out of library climbed stair to own room did not know there be humming in ear place seemed to go round round with access of despair threw on bed tried to face situation allen be innocent be certain although proof of such innocence presented at moment on face of conduct appeared to be suspicious what be doing at red house at midnight why have come there by stealth if joad denounced dora must see hope of saving life still must protect by becoming wife of disreputable silenus whom loathed with soul held allen life in hand poor young fellow be doomed unless must make defence defence sat up suddenly thought have not yet heard allen side of question perhaps must explain give reasonable excuse for presence in study at so untoward hour remembered that edermont have written asking allen to call see might not have appointed conference for midnight have left postern gate glass door open so allen must enter without attracting attention be feasible enough might be put forward in defence on second thought dora gave way to despair even so straightforward tale must be against presumption of innocence assuming that have be in study at appointed hour how must prove guiltless fact of previous quarrel be known to herself joad nothing be more likely than might have continued dispute perhaps edermont might have threatened allen with pistol to protect scott might have torn knobkerrie from wall have struck blow have dora closed eye with faint cry to shut out vision of horror thought conjured into existence without doubt allen have be present in study at time of murder joad saw after twelve o'clock dora knew that crime have be committed minute so before one be just possible that allen have left house before time who must prove that have so departed dora rose from bed paced to fro distracted by hundred thought swarmed in head like hiving bee murder be committed before one o'clock said aloud can prove that striking of clock came almost on top of cry for help must allen have gone away before then must have done can not believe that must murder inoffensive old man provocation must make commit so brutal crime be cool collected be not passionate impulsive allen be innocent left guardian alive well allen went who remained have two people be present dora remembered that edermont have written other letter at same time a to allen perhaps have invited third person to be present at midnight conference if so when allen departed third person might have remained to kill edermont rifle desk if such be case allen must know name of third person why then did not denounce that person to police not so much for gaining of fifty thousand pound a to accomplish act of

assassin saw in flash terrible position in be placed have quarrelled with edermont here be in private room at midnight standing beside dead body might be accused of murder condemned on circumstantial evidence for on face of must make defence a looked with horror on scene with thought in mind candle flamed up in one expiring flash then died out in blue flicker be alone in darkness with dead man seized with sudden panic surely excusable under circumstance turned fled rapidly in two minute be on bicycle running full speed for canterbury be know dora dora considered for few moment after have finished be sure that there be nobody else in red house on night asked after pause allen hesitated did not intend to speak murmured for own sake must tell when be coming into chillum met woman going towards canterbury on bicycle woman allen at midnight alone who be at time passed did not know said doctor rising on return journey when have left house after murder met again by railway bridge be wheeling machine down hill called out to to help tyre of back wheel be punctured got off at once notwithstanding anxiety to get home with aid of guttapercha soon mended tiny hole then rode on together until road parted do know who be asked dora for second time yes said allen quietly recognised at once produced brooch from waistcoat pocket found in edermont study where have doubt be dropped by how do know by putting two two together look at brooch dora did so be slender bar of pale gold to two letter formed of small pearl be attached uttered exclamation of astonishment a read out lb said that stand for for laura burville finished allen quickly exactly laura burville be woman met coming from chillum by evidence of brooch laura burville be woman who be in edermont study on midnight of second of august chapter xv pearl brooch so long expected have happened at last inevitable woman appeared on scene dora be hardly astonished to hear of lady burville connection with crime have always believed that sooner later name of woman must come into matter nevertheless be terrible that must have killed wretched man with whom in mysterious fashion have be associated twenty year before with pearl lettered brooch in hand dora considered position in be placed discovery have made do think that lady burville really did kill allen asked in hesitating voice who can say answered scott wearily must be loath to accuse on insufficient evidence look at matter a stand lady burville fainted at sight of edermont asked question a to whereabouts on night of murder visit a be proved by finding of brooch in study immediately after passing on road enter house to find edermont dead so far a know one else be in house on night so inference must be drawn that woman murdered guardian yes said allen thoughtfully think there be strong case to be made out against lady burville motive allen expostulated dora must not commit so terrible crime without motive can not guess motive dora be a ignorant of lady burville connection with dead man a a be allen said dora hesitating be not name mentioned by mr edermont during conversation yes asked where be staying gave information about have nothing to do with bar to marriage at least think so then be not certain said allen in low voice can not say that be certain dora looked at impatiently sigh escaped evidently be determined to give clue to unravelling of enigma what discovered must discover unaided nevertheless did not lose heart took up burden have laid down why did not tell before allen how must said vehemently by visiting red house on night be in dangerous position if movement have be known might have not only lost what little practice have have be in danger of arrest even now may be called upon to exonerate must man joad speak joad will not speak said dora quietly at event not for week a said before great deal may be done in seven day must let take away brooch allen looked at with air of astonishment why do wish to take away brooch asked will answer question later on lady burville be not now at hernwood hall believe not replied scott returned to london think shortly after discovery of murder of edermont to mind sudden departure seems suspicious on face of agree with that doe assented dora from what have heard of medical evidence doubt if lady burville killed murder be so brutal be right there assassin must have have brutal instinct strong physique now lady burville be small delicate not sort of woman capable of using that heavy knobkerrie striking so terrible blow then dora added allen with puzzled air if lady burville be innocent who be guilty there ca have be anyone else in house on night why not mr edermont wrote letter to other people besides do know name of person to whom wrote replied dora promptly be careful to post letter dora expostulated allen why must edermont convene meeting of so many people at such late hour can not guess explanation may be contained in stolen manuscript guardian action be wrapped up in mystery there may be more people connected with matter than dream of be not point can take away brooch a please said allen indifferently except to exonerate in eye must not have betrayed lady burville murderess a believe to be must win fifty thousand pound by doing so blood money said scott angrily dora wish to build up fortune in way on ruin of others say must joad denounce must keep silent one must save one own neck if possible otherwise say nothing hing thing thought about done can not gain hand rest may go well dear allen said dora pocketing brooch refuse to tell secret have promised not to press if ca marry at least can save by becoming joad wife no by seeing lady burville looked at in surprise dear dora said after pause have reasonable excuse for seeking interview with lady burville have just given excellent excuse allen pearl brooch lady burville will know have betrayed doubt will show that have done so to save own life allen thought what do intend to do asked abruptly force lady burville to confess share in mystery will not do said scott shaking head on surface be frivolous little creature from what saw of be inclined to believe that such frivolity conceals strong will doubt allen must be clever merciless woman to plan carry out so dexterous crime see why must save life at expense of own leave to deal with will force to speak must have arrested for crime if joad denounces will denounce said dora quietly there may be necessity for such extreme course wait until see know where to find oh can get address from late host sir harry hernwood with decision dora took leave here one may pause to reflect on difference between character difference accentuated more by circumstance in found entangled can not be denied that dora bore better of two shrewd cool determined saw way to definite end strove steadily towards attainment allen on other hand be dilatory wavering knowing of bar to marriage must have informed girl what bar be have left to judge of insuperability be exactly what shrank from doing preferred to wait turn of event to refrain from action until be forced upon allen scott be not heroic character dora knew despite preference for above other men indeed a be way with good woman loved better for such weakness however a matter now be arranged allen sulked like modern achilles in tent dora went forth to take action with characteristic decision have determined upon future course to get address of lady burville from sir harry to call on lady burville in town to learn must of event of night from lady burville before leaving house be programme sketched out adhered to by dora carew a first step towards accomplishment of purpose turned off main road took that led to hernwood hall reached before half past six awkward hour for call on inquiring for sir harry be shown into drawing room here be saluted by man came to see to whom apologized for lateness of visit must excuse sir harry said dora calmly be miss carew of red house leave for london to morrow by early train hence calling on at so late hour if must be so kind a to give address of lady burville must esteem favour abrupt speech be hardly graceful one under circumstance dora be so taken up with intrigue in found involved that paid attention to necessary social observance sir harry dapper little man mincing polite be not at indisposed to grant request especially to so handsome woman charmed to oblige miss carew said in gallant fashion will pardon may ask why wish for address certainly replied dora prepared for question have picked up pearl brooch on road be afraid to state actual finding place have reason to believe belongs to lady burville wish to return to in person may see brooch miss carew certainly handed to in silence sir harry examined noted initial returned with polite bow required information address of lady burville said amiably be jersey place mayfair be sure will be greatly obliged to for returning brooch recognise a one usually wore doubt dropped on road when out on bicycle if must save trouble miss carew must be happy to forward there be necessity thank replied dora rising to take leave be going up to town to morrow in event so can easily return good evening sir harry thank for good nature in seeing at hour kindness in giving address pray mention dear miss carew be delighted to be of service to during conversation sir harry have discreetly refrained from remarking on tragic end of julian edermont knew that miss carew be ward of dead man afraid of scene detesting trouble judged wiser to ignore fact in same way gave address of lady burville at once a be anxious to rid of visitor sir harry hernwood in word be fool for reason dora be successful in mission wiser man must have withheld address of late guest until better assured of errand of inquirer dora thought of thing a rode homewards congratulated that sir harry have proved so foolish weak have address of lady burville must obtain interview sought now remained to force woman into confession of crime by mean of pearl brooch must be difficult for lady burville to explain presence in study without inculpating in murder mr tice said dora night when joad have departed be going to town to morrow very good miss carew said housekeeper placidly will return in evening probably if will send wire want to conceal from mr joad have gone to london will not tell miss carew if wish to know why if may be so bold oh said dora with peculiar look will tell that when return will tell on return repeated mr tice looking shrewdly at companion hope nothing be wrong miss everything be wrong be endeavouring to put everything right will be difficult dear young lady in present state of ignorance know dora laughed know more than give credit for mr tice allen have told something ruddy face of housekeeper blanched suddenly not not secret stammered not secret know of replied dora be still ignorant of bar to marriage then what have mr allen told asked mr tice reassured on point ah that secret if will not confide in see why must confide in mr allen must have said nothing very dreadful be mr tice reply have talk together on evening returned from london told everything then doubt said dora who be pleased to stimulate housekeeper curiosity did not tell thing for simple reason that beome thing have not happened remember mr tice night of allen return be night of murder murder repeated mr tice in scared tone yes allen did not tell what knew about said dora left room chapter xvi dora be startled next day dora excused absence to joad on plea of visit to friend living other side of canterbury stated furthermore that must not return until late that evening be absolutely necessary to make such statement a knew not what conclusion must be drawn by old man did learn that true destination be london suspected of knowing more of lady burville than chose to confess with such knowledge might guess intention if so might be that must warn lady burville did know address be by mean unlikely therefore dora be resolved to keep in ignorance of plan to blind joad be easy task a be artful dangerous more than suspected merciless to avert suspicion rode to selling on bicycle there caught early train to london resolved on economy purchased third class ticket have just time to stumble into carriage before train started then became aware that have one companion in compartment man turned head a train began to move saw with astonishment annoyance that be mr pride never mind thought returning greeting with stiff nod can tell joad on return if plea will then be too late for old man to do anything a will have seen lady burville like joad man be protg of edermont who have procured for small post in private school at chillum pride be not unlike late patron being short insignificant looking with white beard hardly so luxuriant a of edermont silvery white hair in distance resemblance be striking closer inspection showed difference between two men a pride be plump rosy with mild eye good natured smile rubbed one fat hand over over saluted miss carew in usual cheery fashion be glad to see looking so well miss carew said brightly go to london only for day mr pride replied dora coldly ah doubt wish to get away from pest who swarm round red house in hope of gaining fortune amateur detective said dora quietly do think will discover truth who know be pride reply will do best to do so fifty thousand pound be worth earning dora considered for moment then turned on suddenly be at canterbury on night murder be committed till close on eleven returned pride easily then walked back to chillum went into mr joad house did be with at one o'clock did meet anyone on bicycle a walked to chillum from canterbury why replied schoolmaster after moment pause met two people rode bicycle one man be riding towards chillum other woman be making for canterbury did know who be dear miss carew said pride in great surprise why took particular notice of in first place in second flitted along so swiftly noiselessly be hardly aware of passing suppose have clue to assassin said dora abruptly if have must not scruple to earn fortune can conjecture motive for crime mr pride be afraid not said pride slowly knew mr edermont well there be nothing in past life likely to endanger safety thought otherwise mr edermont be always haunted by dread of violent death knew that miss carew monomania dear lady monomania must not be monomania if came true said dora impetuously why not replied pride in argumentative tone monomania be dwelling on one particular idea until fill thought life of thinker mr edermont may have have reason to suppose that life be in danger original cause may have passed away nevertheless habit may have continued so added pride with shrug may reasonably ascribe friend death to creature of imagination argument be weak replied dora spiritedly mr edermont believed that must die violent death what believed came to pas doe away with sophistry miss carew cause of fear be done away with before guardian died how do know joad told be discussing possibility of existence of unknown enemy whom mr edermont feared joad mentioned that mr pallant have set that fear at rest do mean to say that mr pallant told enemy be dead joad thought that such be case then must see cried dora triumphantly that supposition doe away with theory of monomania evidently mr edermont fear be founded on fancy on fact well will agree with for sake of argument said pride hastily granted that say be true brings nearer solution of mystery admitting that enemy whom mr edermont feared really existed if such enemy died a suppose mr pallant told poor friend who killed verified lifelong prediction that must come to violent end understand meaning be dora reply think talking in world will aid to discover actual assassin what be belief mr pride can not say have particular belief miss carew criminal problem be too intricate for wish to earn reward must not mind doing so replied pride with good natured laugh man in sens must lose chance of gaining fifty thousand pound same be not clever enough to win see where to begin do think that manuscript in bureau be motive for crime why must anyone have killed mr edermont to gain worthless manuscript might not have be worthless to assassin objected dora contained story of mr edermont past life what have past life to do with violent death everything forget that mr edermont believed to be threatened man so get back to starting point of argument laughed pride dora laughed also finding that be arguing in circle changed that particular line of conversation knew mr edermont well asked after pause yes for quite fifteen year be very good to helped to post now hold did know mr edermont at christchurch christchurch repeated pride slowly did not know then did live there believe so said dora curtly closed conversation evidently there be nothing to be learnt from pride knowledge of edermont only extended back fifteen year dora believed that motive of crime be to be found a far back a twenty moreover if knew anything conclusive must be certain to utilize for own benefit thus gain reward under circumstance dora hardly regarded pride in light of important factor in course be pursuing took further notice of from point of view chatted on indifferent subject until train arrived at victoria station here pride took leave dora went forward on mission jersey place be easily found by asking convenient policeman dora be impressed with magnificence of house by aristocratic seclusion of square if possible be even more imposing than surrounding mansion a dora rang bell must not help thinking that be undertaking difficult task here be rich titled lady evidently power in society fenced round a be by wealth position yet proposed to accuse powerful personage of crime intended to save lover at cost of casting down formidable goddess from pedestal be dangerous almost hopeless task dora did not shrink from fulfilment too much depended upon issue of coming interview for to retreat at eleventh hour be introduced by footman into small anteroom on left of entrance hall there remained while took card up to lady burville in few moment returned with information that mistress must see dora followed man upstairs be shown into drawing room be empty at moment have ample leisure to survey splendid room still more splendid furniture apartment be sumptuous in extreme everything that art luxury must supply be gathered together between four wall east west have contributed to adorn house be more like palace than residence of private person gave dora large idea of wealth of sir john burville portrait a guessed hung in conspicuous part of room strong burly man appeared to be with shrewd coarse face parvenu be writ large on whole personality dora must guess from lowering look that possessed violent temper portrait be not prepossessing left to look at picture of frail delicate woman without doubt be lady burville suspicion be confirmed in few minute for a be contemplating portrait door opened to admit original lady burville be small slender usually a daintily tinted a statuette of dresden china at present moment face be pale eye filled with alarm looked apprehensively at dora from under loose fringe of golden hair arrayed in tea gown of white filmy material looked like ghost a glided towards girl dora put terrified look down to secret knowledge of guilt believed in own mind that lady burville have really slain mr edermont again thought be impossible that so frail creature must have struck so deadly blow yet why be so terrified miss carew believe said lady burville trying to smile with white lip will not be seated thank lady burville replied dora stiffly be obliged to for granting interview be only too pleased be ward of mr edermont believe be ward lady burville yes yes how stupid of forgot about terrible murder dora deliberately produced pearl brooch from pocket held out towards other perhaps will refresh memory said slowly brooch said lady burville in surprise how did come by how did find did not find dr scott did really where on floor of room in mr edermont be killed lady burville face turned even whiter than be before understand stammered shrinking back can explain continued dora pitilessly visited red house on night of second of august dropped brooch there there killed guardian did not who dare to say such thing dare said dora calmly say again killed mr edermont what what proof have gasped lady burville seizing chair to keep from falling proof of brooch evidence of dr scott who met returning from red house need not deny lady burville believe to be guilty will denounce can not dare not why lady burville fell at foot in passion of tear be mother cried unhappy mother chapter xvii story of past mother echoing lady burville exclamation dora stepped backward surveyed with amazement weeping woman kneeling at foot situation perplexed must not believe that lady burville spoke truly in claiming so close relationship deemed that be trick to avert danger of being arrested for crime frowned a thought came into mind turned away coldly believe lady burville parent be dead father be dead said lady burville rising slowly mother life be really truly mother why must say what be not true oh have enough excuse to do so said dora quietly hope to close mouth escape consequence of crime crime believe then that killed mr edermont do be in room alone with left house hurriedly when dr scott be coming from canterbury met met twice said lady burville calmly once when be coming from chillum again when assisted to repair bicycle then deny that be at red house can hardly do so in face of discovery of pearl brooch be mine thought have lost on road a be found in mr edermont study admit be there on night of second of august if be guilty must not admit a much even to own daughter be not daughter give proof that be mother what proof do want asked lady burville helplessly can not alter existing fact if choose to listen can tell so much of history a may convince that what say be true seated on near sofa put frivolous lace handkerchief to eye dora looked at woman so frail so helpless so devoid of brain courage pity entered soul if be indeed mother relationship be nothing to be proud of yet must confess to thing if be not true dora must not answer question resolved to suspend judgment until have heard promised history with pity seated beside feeble little woman be willing to hear story said kindly first must assure of innocence innocence oh a to murder yes be innocent never touched julian did not kill must not kill fly who say be guilty dr scott saw saw interrupted lady burville impatiently deny did see dead body of mr edermont since be so sure of guilt found brooch lying by dead body ah what be doing at red house on night when left julian be alive well doubt dr

husband here eye wandered to stern faced portrait be so afraid of husband said with burst of tear mr pallant be merciless oh dear dear if must only help tell story may be able to do so said dora cheerfully be beginning to believe that lady burville spoke truly that be really mother seemed doubtful a to whether be guiltless guilty dora be prepared to hear side of question before judging even if lady burville proved truth of assertion dora be not prepared to take for parent be sentimental over discovery mother daughter have be so long parted estranged that revival of maternal filial feeling be possible dora pitied mother be sorry for did not love in meantime lady burville told story in usual flippant manner with many tear woman nature be willow in extreme be married to father at

rubbing hand will have to marry see allen scott in gaol a murderer when be man wife will find out way to tame proud spirit dora partook of supper with mr tice answered that good lady question in perfunctory manner housekeeper be anxious uneasy visit of dora to town struck a strange more so a connected with recent event before departing dora have promised explanation of movement mr tice waited for fulfilment of promise dora said nothing ate supper talked on general subject finally took off to bed without word of explanation mr tice be annoyed miss carew said following to door beg pardon promised to tell why went up to town to day did said dora carelessly have changed mind then see why must keep in dark miss exclaimed housekeeper in mortified tone if cast back memory to last conversation will see mr tice be keeping in dark so by acting in same way towards be only giving roland for oliver same must do worse than ask advice miss carew have asked refuse to help now must see after thing in own way will get into trouble if be not careful said mr tice sharply will be thanks to if retorted dora bitterly have refused to help what must have do girl cried mr tice forgetting respect in anxiety dare not tell know mr allen made promise to be silent allen be acting in very foolish manner so be said dora quietly seem to think that be child to whom secret can be confided in ordinary case must not matter to a be least curious of woman a happiness be at stake must strive to learn what must want concealed will do no good if do find out said mr tice sullenly perhaps not at least discovery will throw light on mystery of murder there be wrong miss carew will do such thing dora have argued point before therefore made reply with weary nod prepared to leave room again mr tice laid detaining hand upon sleeve tell dear said timidly what be mr allen said to about murder have better ask mr tice be good coming to unless tell what know will keep silent a to knowledge doe mr allen know anything about crime yes doe know great deal doe know who killed mr edermont doe know also gasped mr tice shrinking back knowledge have nothing to do with matter have knowledge anything to do with father mr tice gasped again sank into chair for moment closed eye when opened again dora be gone housekeeper wiped face who can have told about father meditated if get to know about there will be trouble then drank glass of water put away work thought wandered what have come to said to herself again a made safe for night there be worried look on face anxious expression in eye why did go up to london can have learnt anything about past mr allen know mr joad know none of three will tell still question about father be very very strange in meantime dora be leaning out of bedroom window looking into soft darkness of night overhead sky be fleecy with cloud between rift of twinkled cold star below between tree top dry grass hovered thick gloom of night must see nothing in shadow be a indistinct a unknown a strange a mystery be torturing life have gone seeking have learnt much that mother lived father that latter have be incarnation of deadly fear have haunted dargill alias edermont throughout long life wonder have changed name have hidden in red house have prayed for deliverance from murder sudden death when man of violent passion have hunted hot footed through world dora remembered what despicable coward dead man have be no longer marvelled at fear what did wonder at be change have come over edermont after pallant visit then have declared that shadow be lifted from life that must henceforth mix with fellow men dwell in safety such joy must only mean that enemy be dead yet edermont be dead also of very death feared there be doubt in dora mind that father have killed seemed cruel thing for after in marrying mother edermont dargill a be called have sinned unconsciously why must father have so ardently desired death dora began to think that mother have not told that there be something still hidden something might account for persistent desire of carew for death of edermont again have not asked mother what be bar existed to prevent marriage with allen dora thought mother knew might reveal obstacle then must be forced to tell portion of story have hidden must do so dora be doubtful for weak little coquette be a strong a steel in aught concerned unblinded by filial love dora estimated mother character at true value there be further hope of learning truth in quarter who then must tell allen joad mr tice must be forced to ask one of three to speak since knew so much might a well know more fuller knowledge might enable to save allen to marry allen to revenge death of edermont to win fifty thousand pound yet dream dream vain vain dream sighed dora went to bed in a hopeless frame of mind a can well be imagined fate always arranges matter much better than here be dora at dead stop knew not what to do in direction to turn seemed that one must advise a to future that must be content to lose allen accept humiliating position of joad wife while be steeling heart to face dreary prospect fate be at work next morning pallant appeared came to point out road dora be surprised when mr tice informed that gentleman wished to see be still more surprised when pallant be shown into morning room where sat old supercilious look be on face old cynicism be looking out of blue eye a stood bowing with strong sunlight glittering on red beard looked a worldly evil man a must be imagined dora remembered how have extorted money from weak mother for over two year rose to meet with stern face what have brought here sir asked coldly have said pallant calmly taking seat saw lady burville yesterday gave gist of conversation see how can interest said contemptuously can not get out of have not got be poor mr pallant more be pity replied quite indifferent to shaft with beauty brain might do worse than marry marry marry forgot be in love with foolish young doctor said in sleepy voice be pity at first meeting warned to beware of allen scott know did why did warn ah see mother did not tell everything miss carew else must not ask question warned lest must give heart must be foolish to do so because can never marry why be secret tell know be not worth while dora looked at scornfully be worth while to blackmail mother pay pay said pallant shamelessly must live know lady burville be greatly afraid of present husband so keep well supplied with money to hold tongue where did learn mother history said dora disgusted with brutal speech from best of authority first husband father father george carew met in san francisco year ago be drunkard gambler miss carew have dealing over card for must know that be gambler also though be to credit that drink one day in fit of maudlin fear told story how be seeking for julian dargill mr edermont precisely man who have taken away wife wanted to kill to kill echoed dora starting did did father succeed in carrying out intention be george carew who killed mr edermont not exactly miss carew responded pallant dryly for simple reason that before father must accomplish object died died be father dead dead buried said pallant concisely dead buried chapter xix more mystery when pallant made remarkable statement looked up sharply to see how dora be affected by face have flushed hotly eye have brightened in place of sorrow whole expression be that of relief gladness pallant must not forbear cynical remark on want of feeling seem sorry to hear that father be dead miss carew know why must display sorrow feel replied quietly must remember mr pallant that parent be nothing to be taken away from when be year old have feeling of love towards be glad that father be dead may ask why because have lived might have be guilty of murder at least be spared dishonour of having criminal for parent pallant chuckled seemed about to speak however thought better of merely turned away face to hide peculiar smile dora took little notice of action being absorbed in own thought be what told mr edermont in conversation have with yes be sorry for miserable little creature thought of carew roaming earth in search of be constant nightmare did not matter to whether knew not certainly did not affect plan so never inflict useless cruelty miss carew told truth that lifelong enemy be dead buried that henceforward must sleep in safety result proved assertion to be false what be to said pallant with shrug be prophet to foretell day hour of man death said that carew be past harming be true carew did not kill then who did dear young lady if must tell must be richer by fifty thousand pound on point be a ignorant a be held father in arm when died saw buried be not carew who killed dargill alias edermont there be nothing in story told to by father likely to throw light on mystery think mother killed faltered dora pallant scoffed at idea must little hand wield heavy club must weak muscle deliver so terrible blow miss carew mother be too weak too if dare say so cowardly to do thing be a innocent of death a father dargill fate be not due to vendetta of past must be due to something of sort mr pallant one have interest in killing so harmless man one in neighbourhood mean yes have lived here life know everything about guardian have few friend lived quietly among book flower beyond constant fear lest father must find out never saw distressed in way in thing mr edermont be a transparent a child if have be threatened by person about here must have known of then think death must be due to what took place twenty year ago think so mr pallant miss carew replied red haired man quietly if father have lived might have held different opinion knowing story of past can see for that excepting carew one have motive desire to kill dargill then what be own theory asked dora rather confounded by argument burglary yes mr edermont be known to be rich house be in lonely situation dare say burglar made acquainted with garrison of mansion two woman one old man small odds against sturdy villain inspector jedd of canterbury be also of opinion burglar burglar broke in ransacked desk killed edermont who interrupted then bolted be theory miss carew agree with replied dora calmly forget that nothing be taken out of bureau that manuscript containing story of past how do know that manuscript be in bureau mr edermont said so in will nevertheless might have changed hiding place said pallant coolly information that enemy be dead might have induced to burn a useless with death of carew ceased necessity to keep story in writing again miss carew how do know money jewel may have be hidden in bureau be possible not probable replied dora cautiously think mr edermont kept anything there save bill letter doubt preserved also packet of letter wished to obtain gave to lady burville said pallant very possibly be vexed at not getting letter what information did contain much that know answered pallant related to to cried dora in surprise what about ah said pallant grimly be exactly what wanted to find out however lady burville have now will keep made speech in tone of such genuine regret dora saw be in earnest be use questioning upon matter of be ignorant so changed subject warned once against allen scott said after pause did that mean believed to be guilty at time made remark edermont be alive why warned be to make give up idea of marriage with know from lady burville that scott be here on night crime be committed for believe to be guilty be thankful to hear say so mr pallant need not be replied pallant coldly if thought scott be guilty must have hesitation in denouncing see what motive have to commit so terrible crime must not win for wife by doing so must not gain fortune must be running into danger without hope of reward allen scott be innocent believe be said dora emphatically know mr pallant refuse to tell secret mr edermont confided to prevents marriage be quite right to do so miss carew know that secret also must do no good to learn besides that knowledge have nothing to do with death of mr edermont what about paper taken out of bureau if be not destroyed said pallant be hard to say what became of manuscript a be told by will contained story of mr edermont past life now through carew know that story therefore content of paper excepting carew know one who must have killed guardian for possession of written information undoubtedly murder be committed to gain possession of manuscript agree on point said pallant granting for sake of argument be so that be exactly why ca name assassin if possession of paper be essential to safety if name be mentioned in in connection with past of mr edermont be ignorant of of past evidently carew did not tell be just a well did not said dora curling lip have made bad use of what do know oh man must live know retorted pallant coolly a rose to take leave prefer to get money without work if can do will put stop to quite right be insolent answer if can see dear young lady ca after remark pallant bowed out of room dora accompanied a far a gate a passed through asked question have be in mind time of interview why did come down here asked abruptly be not to condole with be candidly admitted pallant want fifty thousand pound thought might help to get decline to do so said dora coldly see how can help a decline to give aid said pallant quietly there be necessity to discus matter fancied might be able to tell something about mr joad think killed edermont why not certainly did not know name in connection with mr edermont past for that might have killed patron for what reason mr pallant be just where require to be enlightened by be afraid can not enlighten replied must not if must there be sense in believing joad killed guardian in first place far from being desirable mr edermont death be bad thing to happen for joad comfort in second mr joad be in cottage at one o'clock in morning a be proved by mr pride to own knowledge murder be committed about time so mr joad must not have be assassin seems clear enough said pallant preparing to climb into trap be waiting for same mistrust joad say murder be committed at one o'clock joad say be in cottage at one o'clock call upon mr pride to substantiate statement very good will believe added pallant gathering up rein clock in hall might have be wrong after remark raised hat drove off smiling dora did not think that remark about clock be worthy of consideration for have set watch by before retiring to bed on night of second of august be right then one must possibly have put wrong in meantime joad have proved alibi clearly enough there be possible suspicion that be guilty of crime especially a committal have not be to advantage curiously enough joad knew nothing of pallant visit did dora intend to inform of have be in library morning reading ancient book sipping brandy out of flask carried constantly in tail pocket of dingy coat not wishing to disturb in midst of pleasure dora returned to own sitting room sat down to think while thus employed mr tice entered room with letter in hand looked distressed dear young lady said hastily be afraid must return to mr allen be ill ill cried dora jumping up what be matter with fancy have fretted into kind of fever said mr tice glancing at letter have just be sent over emma wrote emma be servant in scott house mr allen did not want to be told emma thought best must know must really return nurse dear mr allen concluded mr tice smoothing down apron with trembling hand will go afternoon cried dora will send meg to hotel for trap will go over together mr tice smiled looked grateful hope wo think unkind miss carew oh dear meg will protect against joad said dora after pause added abruptly ask what be doing in london yesterday did not think wished to let know miss refused to tell last night know did will tell now because may be able to help mr tice said dora solemnly have seen lady burville yes miss what of asked mr tice cheerfully do know who lady burville be know nothing about miss save be patient of mr allen then will tell mr tice be mother housekeeper ruddy face paled sat down on nearest chair mother miss carew be sure be certain lady burville informed of relationship told story in case said mr tice with emphasis know now why marriage between mr allen be impossible be just what know be dora reply mother did not tell story now want to relate what kept hidden tell what have heard miss will see said mr tice after pause very good said dora taking seat near old dame will tell story will tell yours between may save allen life chapter xx sin of father when dora made that last remark face of mr tice grew red indignant looked at girl with fiery eye demanded crossly what meant by saying thing knowing attachment of housekeeper to allen be natural enough fact be explained dora mr joad accuses allen of murdering mr edermont what next wonder cried mr tice in high dudgeon be more likely mr joad killed man can substantiate accusation can state that allen be in house on night of murder doe not say mr allen committed crime retorted mr tice face shade paler mr allen told in confidence that have seen dead body have kept silent for own sake quite agreed with that be best thing to do told also miss carew yes told also did not inform joad then how doe joad know that mr allen be here on night saw from door of cottage said dora quietly need not be afraid for allen mr tice can save close joad mouth how dear asked housekeeper greatly perplexed by becoming wife of mr joad mercy on miss carew must not do exclaimed mr tice lifting up hand in horror wo do unless be forced to said dora gloomily supposing joad denounces allen how can defend know that be innocent presence here on night look guilty appearance be against certainly if mr allen be arrested will have to save life by denouncing father a murderer father be not murderer say that be cried mr tice emphatically for twenty year george carew have be hunting down mr dargill suppose lady burville told real name caught at last killed be wrong said dora shaking head thought a did before mr pallant arrived undeceived what doe mr pallant know about know everything met father in san francisco two year ago father told whole story before died died do mean to say that george carew be dead be dead buried captain carew dead muttered mr tice in bewildered tone dead without avenging on man who stole wife then who killed mr dargill rather mr edermont know be just what wish to find out one else have reason to kill said housekeeper in dismay yet be dead dead murdered be right dear added in firm tone be serious matter for mr allen joad hate so that must willingly perjure to see dear boy hanged must save must save miss carew to do so must understand one said dora must tell will do so cried mr tice energetically yes hitherto have said nothing out of consideration for feeling now will tell why captain carew father dear hated mr edermont so deeply first let hear what mother revealed may be able to relate thing kept hidden from thus adjured to confess dora related story of past a told to by lady burville must not bear even to think of a mother mr tice listened in severe silence only nodding head now then at special point in story when dora concluded sat quiet for two minute then gravely delivered herself of opinion see that look upon woman a mother dear young lady said solemnly be right to do so may speak plainly a plainly a like mr tice have filial feeling for mother who deserted left helpless child to be brought up by stranger mr dargill be scarcely stranger corrected mr tice be mother second husband a told oh heaven be quite right mr carew a knew be always light headed selfish woman given over to vanity pleasure cared only for money idleness will be bound be only too glad to get rid of so a to give chance of third marriage a unencumbered widow yet what came through must have sobered many woman there mr carew be always feeble frail coquette loved only one thing in world then love only one thing now be what told true oh tale told be true enough be trimmed cut to suit own end be ashamed to tell everything suppose wicked woman be miss carew for be mother owing to coquetry love of money poor mr dargill came to end a surely a if have killed know yet said dora thoughtfully remember be not first husband who killed be true assented mr tice nevertheless can think of other person who have interest in guardian death have best tell story miss carew can judge for will story enable to discover real murderer say that replied mr tice reluctantly a said before must judge for took spectacle off laid on table then folding mittened hand on lap began amended version of story lady burville have told to dora missing portion supplied by memory of housekeeper be by far most exciting episode of tale whole affair took place at christchurch in hampshire said slowly be right in guess a to locality miss carew be born brought up married there twenty five year ago husband died to support have to go out again to service dr mr scott took in a nurse to newly born child mr allen be mother died shortly after giving birth bringing up be left to dr scott took little heed of child be handsome man clever in

not married then miss treherne be pretty fair haired girl willow frivolous have three suitor dr scott be one mr julian dargill be second captain carew third be mr edermont rich then mr julian dargill be rich corrected mr tice prefer to talk of mr edermont by real name dear be weak effeminate little man with noble head even then hair be of silvery whiteness be description that made recognise on day showed picture wore beard then said dora remembering portrait no be clean shaven doubt afterwards adopted beard a disguise to escape captain carew well miss treherne hesitated between three suitor for many month at last parent decided for for reason forced to marry carew why know for captain be not rich be of violent temper usually be absent at sea however married became mr carew shortly after honeymoon husband went to sea while be absent mr carew carried on with mr dargill dr scott must say behaved very badly public opinion be quite against so much indeed that six month afterwards left christchurch have received news of father supposed death then said dora flushing little at disapproving way in mr tice spoke of mother yes mate of captain carew ship be saved came home to tell story then mr carew went away with what small property have be supposed went to london be noticed that mr dargill left christchurch after did when reappeared at christchurch brought miss carew new husband mr dargill be year afterwards yes be quite year if not more said mr tice married mr dargill a soon a must after report of first husband death be mother in love with mr dargill in love echoed housekeeper contemptuously be never in love with anyone be not rather hard on mr tice said dora reflecting that after despised woman be mother entitled to consideration far from dear young lady be emphatic rejoinder of mr tice indeed out of pity for position feeling be speaking a well a can of what can think of woman who marries three husband leaf child to be brought up far away from in twenty year miss carew added old dame nodding dare swear mother have not given single thought be willing enough to recognise said girl attempting defence of indefensible made best of bad job mean retorted mr tice if have not produced that brooch showed lady burville plainly that be in power must never have acknowledged relationship knew must not denounce own mother be why spoke up might wish to make amends for conduct mr tice shook head laura carew laura dargill laura burville like to call said be not kind of woman to regret conduct in way deceive lady burville be in trap used knowledge of birth to get out of be beside question said dora wearied of constant blame asked if mother be in love with mr dargill be not what woman must love miserable little creature saw enough of miss carew be sure neither loved respected certainly did not said dora gravely yet seeing that brought up out of charity must certainly have paid more attention acted well by deny answered mr tice reluctantly be good of to help lady burville by taking charge of what can not understand be why did not stay with how must mr tice for in first place marriage be void a father be alive in second may be sure that captain carew kept watch on mother to see if mr dargill must come near doubt thought to trap in way perhaps replied mr tice ambiguously if father kept watch upon wife why did permit to marry sir john burville can not say said dora colouring knew mother opinion on point mother thought that captain carew be dead else may be sure that must not have married again be not so sure of grumbled mr tice mother must do anything for money remember that took spare further detail said dora blushing finish story have not heard yet why allen can not marry will say no more then said mr tice hastily to make long story short captain carew be not dead returned to claim wife a have said be madly jealous of wife have fearful temper when heard that wife have married again swore must kill second husband dargill be away at time captain carew kept watch on wife that must send warning wished to kill dargill who be expected back by late train came out at inquest dear be dargill habit to cross lawn enter drawing room by

be saved from fury of captain carew fell into trap laid for mr dargill be shot through heart then captain carew fled be never caught be supposed that have gone to continent now miss carew know why mr allen can not marry because because of murder gasped dora in broken tone yes mr allen can not marry daughter of man who killed father in cold blood chapter xxi so near yet so far mr tice be right marriage with allen be out of question must not make daughter of murderer wife power human divine must sanction union dora no longer wondered at allen strange silence be natural that must shrink from telling so terrible story from branding father with terrible name of assassin remembered how have be glad to know that father have died without killing edermont that have gone to account without blood on hand wonder pallant have chuckled at ignorance have forborne to enlighten george carew have taken life in cold blood with deliberation malice aforethought dora carew be daughter of criminal dora said little to mr tice after story have be told indeed there be nothing to say for knew fate only too well must never marry allen if did not become joad wife to save lover from arrest possibly condemnation must be forced to remain single for rest of life lonely sorrowful sin of father have be visited on child dora be reaping harvest of blood george carew have sown morally speaking end of thing have come to dora will go over to canterbury with said to mr tice say good bye to allen can never marry can at least see for last time tell that be safe from joad dear young lady will not marry that wicked man if can save allen in other way must said dora firmly consider position mr tice must joad accuse of crime quarrelled with edermont came here at very hour of murder when left house edermont be dead to circumstantial evidence can oppose only bare word tell be in danger of being hanged mr tice nothing be left for to do save to marry joad dare not speak then real assassin may be found yet suggested mr tice hopefully there be little chance of be afraid when hundred of men stimulated by gigantic reward have failed to track murderer how can hope to succeed mr tice name of criminal will never be known so only remains for to see allen for last time return here to be joad wife housekeeper sighed indeed appeared sole way out of difficulty must offer advice on subject went to heart that dora must marry so disreputable creature a reason for such marriage be safety of allen scott be content that must take place in love for old nurse must have sacrificed hundred woman dora fate be hard admitted that be necessary allen proved le ill than expected to find be annoyed that mr tice have be sent for although be glad to see dora nevertheless protested against being considered sick man that must take to bed be not well enough to go about work said candidly at same time be not sufficiently ill to retire to sick room will be right in day two did not look a though must recover in so short time in default of bed be lying on sofa in dining room covered with rug appeared to be thoroughly ill eye be bright hand be burning now again shivered with cold a though suffering from attack of ague mr tice made beef tea insisted upon taking did after much persuasion see dora said with smile doctor have to be prescribed for by old nurse science knowledge go for nothing in comparison with mr tice remedy know what be common sense said mr tice smiling also lie still mr allen keep warm miss carew will sit with here while look after house dare say have be dreadfully neglected in absence be hardly compliment to management said allen trying to smile oh a to that gentleman can look after house mr allen be woman work to see to such thing let manage at present when be gone wife can take place wife echoed dr scott with sigh will never marry dora said nothing bent head to hide despair written on face feeling that have said too much mr tice hastened to excuse in doing so only succeeded in making matter worse name of joad occurred in midst of excuse allen made feeble gesture of displeasure wish must not mention that creature said clasping dora hand hate a much a dora doe be enemy mine for must marry allen must not sacrifice mr allen be sensible cried mr tice stand in dreadful position be at mercy of joad must speak be lost can tell story dora shook head will not be believed in face of joad evidence said dolefully then quarrel have with mr edermont give colour to accusation dr scott made gesture of dissent mr tice supported dora be right mr allen if joad speaks be lost talk over with miss carew sir will hear what think when come back just now must look after house when left room allen waited until door be closed then turned to look at dora be sitting by side of sofa with drooping head sad expression on face moved by silent sorrow ascribing rightly to unhappy position in stood to one took hand within own look so sad dora said softly will be better shortly be knowledge of what be told to by mr edermont have made ill will recover dear bear trouble like man dora burst into tear can only bear trouble like woman sobbed oh allen allen have done that must be made so unhappy be in very dangerous position can save only by marrying man detest dora must not marry joad can not accept safety at price of lifelong misery what doe matter about marrying that creature said drying tear can never become wife allen groaned true true ah how true be that sin of father be visited on child be shameful that must suffer a do for evil of others can not help position allen there be hope be right said allen in despairing tone there be hope ah dora if only knew truth do know truth who told asked sitting up with look of astonishment lady burville told that lady burville interrupted sharply what doe know everything be wonder seeing that be root of evil how do mean that be root of evil lady burville be mother allen great heaven mother mr carew yes mr carew mr dargill lady burville like to call know story allen what failed to relate mr tice told know that father killed yours that can never marry lady burville mother told stammered be so careful to hide truth from know spared in goodness of heart allen be better must know truth yes went up to town restored pearl brooch to lady burville can not call mother heard story dora allen seized hand again did mother kill mr edermont thank god be innocent of crime then how be found brooch by dead body dropped in room when went to see mr edermont on night why did see edermont sent for to deliver up packet of letter have written to be long story allen sad one listen will tell allen signified desire to hear story listened eagerly while told what mother have related to make information complete dora passed on to history of murder a told by mr tice when finished allen be in possession of fact waited for to comment thereon be not long in doing see that know dora said with melancholy smile yes be what mr edermont told on day lost head when ended believe advanced towards in threatening manner to thrash for share have taken in matter be then that threw up window cried out that wished to kill probably be wrong to act a did a miserable little creature be not responsible for death of father did not consider at moment when cried out to joad left room house remember must not speak to when went must not dear revelation have proved too much for self control felt half mad for saw have lost for ever why did go up to london asked dora anxiously edermont referred to file of morning planet containing account of tragedy ended in death of father went up to see account of father murder yes must not bring to believe that matter be so bad a made out in london went to office of paper turned up report be true enough father shot mine a be stated by edermont afterwards went down to christchurch found out rest of story from old housekeeper did learn that lady burville be mother did edermont tell so why know only stated bare fact of case how father have be killed now know why told nothing dora why kept silent be afraid lest father must be arrested for double murder bring shame pain on poor dear double murder yes george carew killed father in accordance with oath believe murdered mr edermont found out after many year killed be wrong allen told how pallant blackmailed mother learnt whole story from wretched father well captain carew died two year ago in san francisco be sure be certain died in mr pallant arm pallant have reason to lie over story then if carew did not kill edermont who did ah said dora with weary sigh be just what must find out if only to save life prevent marrying joad dora said allen after pause do know why pallant wanted that packet of letter yes desired to confirm possession of mother by threatening to show letter to sir john burville hoped to get money wished scoundrel what particular information did letter contain to render so valuable know mr pallant hinted that be about about allen reflected for few moment dora said at length dare say letter passed between mother guardian after tragedy at christchurch probably contained full account of crime detail a to how mother parted with in fact believe contained summary of lady burville life if pallant have obtained letter wonder must have extorted money if have be shown to sir john burville wife mother must have denied nothing own handwriting must prove falsity of denial quite understand said dora mr edermont be wise enough to give to mother be just cried allen supposing lady burville have unconsciously let pallant know that be going to red house to receive letter supposing followed be too late to intercept packet do think might have killed edermont in fit of rage at losing letter allen think so for moment mr pallant be too cautious to act so foolishly besides if be a say must easily have followed lady burville along lonely road have forced to give letter whoever killed guardian be not mr pallant then who be guilty asked allen in despair ah said dora with melancholy sigh that secret be worth fifty thousand pound life dear allen chapter xxii what dora discovered when dora took leave of allen returned to red house with firm conviction that to save doctor must be obliged to marry joad in face of old man evidence did not see how allen must defend be true that must produce letter of mr edermont giving midnight invitation to study such production must not mend matter must only show that have be present at very hour of murder must confirm evidence of joad once be proved what plea must put forward to prove innocence none quarrel might have taken place on subject of previous conversation allen might have killed edermont in fit of rage be view dora truly believed judge jury must take of matter on face of what view must be more reasonable be use bringing lady burville into question for evidence must throw light on subject when left house edermont be alive when scott arrived old man be dead there be nothing to show that anyone have be in study between lady burville departure dr scott arrival medical evidence must prove that lady burville be too feeble woman to strike so terrible blow of too nervous character to carry out so brutal crime if lady burville came into court must be to save to condemn allen under circumstance only remained to hush matter up by granting joad wish dora hated man for sake of allen decided to marry yet a still have few day grace before giving answer resolved to say nothing of resolution at present might be that in interval real criminal might be discovered night dora tossed tossed on bed courting sleep in vain be like rat in trap running round round in endeavour to escape must have done anything rather than consent to marriage with joad unless miracle intervened saw chance of escaping ceremony to be saddled with husband to live in constant companionship with satyr poor girl wept bitterly at very thought what must feel when joad demanded payment of price of silence towards morning fell into uneasy slumber awoke more despondent than ever be with listless air that descended to breakfast only with strong effort must force to eat meg gance who brought in meal informed mr joad be already in library engrossed in daily occupation come here afore nine said meg who be large stupid countrywoman with more muscle

rather startled by abruptness of question why clock in hall for sure be ever wrong meg whole hour miss though how must have lost hour in night dunno be ten when looked at in morning while kitchen clock be nine too fast by hour miss dora on what night be wrong asked dora eagerly feeling that be on verge of discovery why miss went wrong on night master have head bashed not a wonder miss for aunt have husband a died clock clock miss struck thirteen seems a clock know of death funeral concluded meg reflectively be clock in hall wrong by hour when saw in morning after crime have be committed for sure miss dora lor ' bless miss matter jes ' put right by kitchen clock a have never lost minute since came here be six year miss why did not mention that clock be wrong when gave evidence meg stared at mistress never thought said gravely be asked about clock did matter hope replied dora carelessly did matter need say nothing about to mr joad indeed to anyone be much of chat at time miss cried meg tossing head a for mr joad a lief speak to blackbeetle wo say naught bless miss very well meg can clear away meg did with considerable clatter clamour while dora left room without putting on hat walked slowly across lawn in dewy freshness of morning on reaching beehive chair under cedar be joad favourite outdoor study girl sat down looked contemplatively at scene before space of sunlit lawn with girdle of flaming rhododendron fringing on right tall poplar musical with bird bordering ivy draped wall beyond wall red tiled roof of joad cottage showing in picturesque contrast against delicate azure of august sky after regarding scene to right left a lay steeped in yellow sunlight dora gaze finally rested on glimpse of joad house there stayed thought reverted to remark about clock made by pallant to later explanation given by meg gance what connection thing have with joad may be gathered from girl thought ran something after fashion must be possible that joad have killed edermont there seemed to be motive for committing crime be not kind of man to run needlessly into danger yet discovery about clock be certainly very strange knew be correct on night of murder meditated dora set watch by before went upstairs be at half past nine watch have be right ever since when meg looked at in morning be hour wrong therefore somebody must have put wrong with intent be impossible that so excellent clock must suddenly slip for hour then go on again must joad have be in house on night have put on hour at time of murder clock struck one at hour joad according to own showing mr pride corroboration be in cottage if clock have be put wrong murder must have taken place at twelve since be hour fast in morning there be ample time for joad to commit crime at twelve be back in cottage by one dora got up walked restlessly to fro must not quite understand why clock must have be put on hour so a to give false time when there be one to hear in night that have woke up heard strike be quite accident although there have be night when have heard hour chime strike till dawn suddenly remembered that once have said something to joad about sleepless night on impulse of moment walked into library mr joad said to old man who be reading near window that hall clock seemed to dora that pallor crept over red face of man addressed however looked up quietly enough spoke to with greatest calmness what about hall clock miss dora asked in puzzled tone be disturbing again really must have removed in dead hour hear strike in most ghostly graveyard fashion a did on night concluded under breath do have many sleepless night now how do know have sleepless night at asked quickly joad looked at in surprise told so shortly before lost julian said quietly be toothache be not yes something of sort answered carelessly be not toothache now still lie awake thinking of said joad with leer week be not yet over mr joad said coldly till end of have right to ask question good bye for present be going out on bicycle be excuse confident that joad have altered clock on chance that must hear during sleepless night be confident also that for such reason for more terrible one have be in house on night of murder put on clock so a to prove alibi thought wheeling bicycle down path to gate if killed edermont at twelve o'clock right time when struck one must have ample opportunity of getting back to cottage through postern quite believe that be with pride at one o'clock also believe be in study at twelve have proved to own satisfaction that joad must have be in house wished to discover if have killed edermont assassin have committed crime to obtain manuscript containing story of guardian life if joad be guilty that manuscript must be in possession be why dora excused on plea of riding bicycle be determined to search joad cottage find out if manuscript be hidden there with intent hid bicycle behind hedge on other side of road went to cottage there be plenty of time for to search a joad took mid day meal in red house never returned to house until nine at night have whole day at disposal determined to search in corner for manuscript believed have hidden if found must then be able to prove allen guiltless joad guilty must be magnificent revenge on part man must be caught in own trap can be easily guessed by what step dora have arrived at conclusion chance remark of pallant anent possibility of clock being wrong chance explanation of meg proved that clock be hour fast on morning after murder have taken place memory of own remark to joad about sleepless night conclusion that old man have put clock wrong for purpose of own inference to be drawn from fact be that joad have be in house on night of second of august if have be in house be probable that have killed edermont since allen lady burville only other people who have be present at same hour be innocent have be proved by sundry scrap of evidence that murder have be committed to obtain possession of manuscript therefore if joad be guilty must have hidden fruit of crime where in cottage without doubt front door of cottage be locked so dora went round to back knew that joad be in habit of hiding key of back door under water butt sure enough found there to open door pas into study be work of moment so here be in stronghold of enemy where be manuscript room be not very large lined on four side with book writing desk littered with paper stood before single window few chair be scattered round there be also horsehair sofa small sideboard of varnished deal three four china ornament little clock on mantelpiece floor be covered with straw matting what pattern of paper be like one must tell for be hidden completely by book whole apartment looked penurious in extreme very untidy book lay on chair sofa fireplace be filled with torn up letter newspaper hastily scribbled manuscript book first decided dora after look at chaos there be need to go through one by one for dust lay thickly upon binding shelf have only to glance to see have be disturbed within last few week have be taken down examined carefully must find trace of manuscript looked on top of bookcase went down on knee to search lower shelf still found nothing at end of hour dora have gone through whole library of joad have come across trace of wished for paper have hidden always presuming that be in possession more cunningly than have thought now for desk hour search in drawer pigeonhole blotting pad likewise revealed nothing dora emptied out wastepaper basket sorted scrap still be unsuccessful then lifted portion of matting removed cushion of chair searched sideboard dived into recess of sofa to purpose perhaps have not got after thought dora disappointed have burnt burning suggested fireplace saw that there have not be fire for month in grate then struck that mr joad might have taken idea from poe purloined letter have hidden manuscript in conspicuous place fireplace alone be unsearched so went down on knee turned out disorderly mass of paper patience be rewarded at last from under heap drew forth crumpled mass of paper foolscap size spread out carefully then uttered cry confession of julian dargill better known a julian edermont read ah be right here be stolen story of past joad be man who killed guardian chapter xxiii madness of lambert joad with recovered manuscript in hand with knowledge where have be found with memory of clock being wrong dora felt convinced that joad be guilty of crime without doubt have designed to kill edermont on night have prepared alibi so a to prove innocence must such proof be needed what be motive for perpetration of so detestable crime why have stolen manuscript why have not destroyed so dangerous piece of evidence dora believed that answer to question be to be found in manuscript reading of must probably solve whole mystery having accomplished task slipped paper into pocket of dress ran out of house having locked door repaired to place where have hidden bicycle to give colour to excuse to joad mounted rode down road for considerable distance indeed felt inclined there then to go to canterbury assure allen that be safe that have won fortune by discovering actual criminal desire to do away with possible suspicion on part of joad induced to abandon such intention when found manuscript gone might suspect if went directly into canterbury whereas if behaved a usual must have doubt on subject besides said dora to herself a turned face towards chillum joad never go to cottage during day therefore will not find out loss until to night must suspect have discovered secret may do injury take to flight must allay suspicion see allen about manuscript will read together then take such step a may be necessary to save arrest joad on approaching gate of red house dora received shock for on glancing at joad cottage saw owner coming out of door perhaps question about clock have induced to depart from usual routine by rousing suspicion have created desire to assure that manuscript be safe might be reason dora have never known joad to revisit domicile in daytime qualm seized lest must guess what have done memory of what be at stake nerved to resistance confronted approaching old man with mien cool composed certainly needed courage at moment for joad be conducting like lunatic face be redder than usual with suppressed rage swung round arm in threatening manner hardly seeing in blind fury babbled about loss dora did not need to hear word to be assured that have discovered loss of manuscript strained ear to listen in hope that joad might say something likely to incriminate lost lost muttered joad a shuffled near after care what be to do now what what what be anything wrong mr joad man paused before dora with dazed look suddenly cooled down in most surprising manner knowing dangerous position in be placed by loss of manuscript saw necessity for dissimulation rage gave place to smile furious gesture to fawning miss dora there be nothing wrong have lost precious book be know who took broke out with renewed fury dora felt nervous for moment thought that suspected next moment still talking of manuscript under flimsy disguise of book word reassured oh yes repeated know who stole will be revenged then shook fist in air a though invoking curse on someone returned to red house when dora reached own room took out manuscript be lengthy effusion evidently carefully prepared certainly clearly written with thrill of excitement girl sat down to read story learn from if possible motive of joad in becoming midnight assassin before have read two line meg knocked at door dora hid away precious paper hastily in wardrobe called on meg to enter dinner be up miss said stout countrywoman mr joad wait look well miss dora sheet ai nothing to face of be in bad temper meg lordy miss ghastly pale quiet like meg report proved to be true joad rage have died out into subdued nervousness red face have paled to yellowish hue said little ate little dora noticed that drank more than ordinary allowance of whisky water now then cast furtive glance round room a though waiting anxiously for unexpected to happen conduct reminded dora of late mr edermont behaviour in church during litany there be doubt in mind a to joad feeling have received shock in consequence thereof be thoroughly frightened towards end of meal grew more composed under influence of spirit water be then that abruptly informed dora that be going into canterbury be going into canterbury echoed fairly astonished afternoon yes have not be in town for month wish to consult lawyer about loss of book suppose joad raised heavy eye sent piercing glance in direction yes said in quiet tone wish to consult about loss will see mr carver on whole said joad with great deliberation think will see mr carver know much may a well know more what do mean asked dora startled by significance of speech will know to morrow miss carew left room shortly afterwards house anxious to learn if intended to fly so escape consequence of crime dora followed down to gate have not be kept locked of late joad swung easily open stepping out cast glance to right left in uneasy fashion suddenly staggered against wall with hand to heart in instant dora be beside what be matter mr joad only old trouble heart heart muttered will kill day sooner better now dora took speech a acknowledgment of guilt withdrew little from neighbourhood joad took notice of shrinking explained plan go to cottage to change clothes said calmly then will get trap from hotel drive to canterbury to see mr carver need not expect at red house to night miss dora will stay in own cottage will not do for to be out after dark why not mr joad be in danger be in danger of losing life retorted old man flinging detaining hand rudely aside ran across road with activity surprising in one of year sedentary life when disappeared dora returned to house be at loss what to do with regard to joad action speech be so strange that be afraid lest must fly if did complicity in crime might never be proved so allen safety might be compromised dora be determined that must not be decided to get into canterbury before joad to see mr carver ask advice afterwards to call on allen show manuscript in way other must contrive to circumvent discovered villain having come to decision dora put manuscript in pocket assumed hat glove took out bicycle joad be not yet out of cottage so hurried in hot haste spun up road at full speed by time have got to hotel ordered trap hoped to be in canterbury preparing ground for arrival so that effort to fly if indeed intended to do so might be baffled in direction dora felt that crucial moment be at hand that behoved to have wit about if hoped to save allen win fifty thousand pound on arrival at canterbury dora lost time in seeking lawyer be busy in dingy back office a usual betrayed surprise at seeing visitor with dry smile shook hand placed chair for then gave explanation of appearance have come to ask further about five hundred pound said if so be afraid be wasting time intend to waste time on matter mr carver replied dora quietly object of visit be far more important have discovered who killed mr edermont if hoped to astonish mr carver by speech be never more mistaken in life did not display surprise merely laughed rubbed dry hand together have then to congratulate on gaining fifty thousand pound asked satirically can judge for mr carver said dora quietly then there without further preamble related finding of manuscript behaviour of joad evidence of clock carver betrayed interest by frequent raising of eyebrow otherwise remained motionless until conclusion of story might a well have be speaking to stone manuscript asked have with yes dora laid on table here be story of mr edermont early life have read not yet have not have time to do so have brought in to read with allen be unless require thought for moment shook head said in amiable tone require at present moment will see mr joad first then call on dr scott to hear report on paper do think mr joad be guilty asked dora replacing manuscript in pocket circumstantial evidence be strongly against replied mr carver cautiously will reserve opinion until hear story do think will call on told that intended to do so miss carew very true mr carver same may have done so to save time for know may design to go straight to railway station catch london express oh can frustrate scheme said carver rising mr joad conduct be sufficiently suspicious to justify detention on ground of complicity if not of actual guilt word to inspector jedd mr joad will not get away by express go see dr scott dear young lady leave to deal with friend wo let escape said carver dryly on whole have rather got fifty thousand pound than anyone else then conducted dora to door with courtesy have never extended before to female client

that have something of importance to communicate to what be dora asked anxiously good bad news good be safe then intend to marry joad said allen in tone of despair indeed intend such thing mr joad have other thing to think about besides marriage what other thing how to save neck yes may well look astonished allen joad none other killed guardian here be proof dora flung manuscript on table

have saved from arrest perhaps condemnation from marriage revolted what be left after dear nothing nothing can never be anything friend to one for life have be ruined by sin of other people be cruelly hard speak only too truly dora said allen taking hand can give comfort can give consolation father crime have parted must suffer vicariously for guilt for moment so remained silent thinking over hopelessness of position matter be too important pressing to admit of much time being wasted in useless lamentation dora be first to recover speech forthwith related event of day from conversation of meg gance down to visit to carver allen interrupted frequently with exclamation of surprise be right dora cried when have ended how wonderfully have worked out matter without doubt joad be hidden in house while lady burville saw edermont after left must have killed friend secured manuscript doubt hid again when heard coming saw not in road a alleges in study oh villain must have saved neck at expense of mine have not even that excuse allen for owing to manipulation of hall clock there be absolutely suspicion that be guilty accused to gain now have caught in own trap doubt mr carver will

of crossing lawn entering drawing room when saw scott approaching in same direction thought be being provided with pistol always carried shot man through heart when found out whom have killed fled to escape being arrested last word to laura be that must hunt down kill 'all came out at inquest be reported in morning planet under heading of romantic tragedy on hearing how life be sought by carew still at large left lodging went into hiding what else must do be weak puny man morally speaking be coward be not fault be born so dared not face brute in ungoverned rage so hid then john mallison came to rescue be rather like proposed to adopt name go to america letting carew know in way how have fled mallison be brave man knew that must hold own better than against carew assumed name supplied with fund carew saw by chance in regent street in distance took for mallison to encourage false recognition fled to america carew followed then prepared for own safety took name of julian edermont

to since then dora have lived with a ward for be afraid to say that be daughter lest carew must find out ' adopted daughter of course interrupted allen be afraid father might kill take away 'later on found old college companion joad starving in london took to live with ' dora went on beallison came back from america provided for likewise so far felt safe year have have belief that carew must find out in spite of precaution kill if be found murdered george carew will be culprit a one else have reason to wish for death be at peace with men to punish leave by will bulk of fortune to who find out punishes george carew for villainy hope daughter dora may be so fortunate need have compunction in doing so for carew be not father be child born of marriage with laura only called carew ward to do away with possible discovery by carew certificate of birth be with family lawyer in lincoln inn field dora cried allen starting up be not carew daughter not daughter of man who killed father edermont dargill father stammered dora what doe mean mean cried allen taking in arm that father did not kill mine can marry chapter xxv confession there be also short note to manuscript stating that edermont have found out helped son of old enemy dr scott on ground that felt to be cause indirectly of man death allen took occasion to explain particular matter now come to look back on said reflectively believe that edermont must have supplied most of fund for education understood came from money left by dead father from story touching manuscript must appear that died poor certainly mr edermont behaved generously in inviting to settle in canterbury when qualified for doctor in helping with loan be afraid acted badly to on day added allen in penitent tone be not news of father terrible death maddened be father after sighed dora poor soul never cared over much for a did not like personality a thought be living on own money did not realize generosity be glad to know be not daughter of carew be strange that mr tice did not know edermont be father said allen after pause for must have be born shortly before dargills returned to christchurch ah here be mr tice added a housekeeper entered come here nurse have good news for what may be asked old dame smiling dora intend to fulfil engagement marry face of mr tice grew stern with dismay disapproval impossible mr allen how can marry daughter of father murderer be just nurse dora be not daughter of carew of julian dargill oh be adopted by mr dargill know said mr tice still unconvinced be called by name in christchurch why changed name to carew know though to be sure be ward not daughter carew be real name so thought said dora impetuously have just discovered that be really truly daughter of mr dargill wife laura listen mr tice will tell story narrative greatly surprised mr tice who be forced to sit down lift up hand in surprise be forced to believe that dora be dargill daughter by laura carew second marriage a mr tice mentally noted illegitimate owing to carew still being alive after birth housekeeper be too wise kind hearted to touch upon so delicate point deary deary ejaculated one knew in christchurch never saw miss dora must have known so young child must not have be daughter of man dead over year be surprised one else guessed how blind be oh may be sure lady burville told story to account for appearance size of child said allen cynically be adept at trickery can not understand dora why did not tell name of real father did not wish to inculpate more than be necessary said dora in bitter tone told be mother only because believed must denounce a guilty of crime know letter pallant wanted allen well have doubt that be letter wrote to edermont can hardly bring to call father giving permission to take to live with probably paid for doing so after be mother miss dora said mr tice reprovingly have not acted mother part retorted dora deserted deceived lied to never wish to set eye on again think will be rather relief to than otherwise said allen be determined to keep position a sir john wife will refuse to make explanation likely to endanger however doe not matter to dear bar to marriage be removed indeed wonder father did not tell truth poor soul be coward allen admits a much in confession few men must have behaved a did especially in face of fact that captain carew be in danger of arrest for murder of father mr edermont elaborate precaution be dictated solely by lifelong dread can see other reason why must have passed off a ward however now that know truth can marry will marry a soon a like dearest be glad for sake dora that will inherit fifty thousand pound left by father how be that mr allen cried mr tice in amazement that money be only left to person who discovered murderer well nurse dora have done so joad be culprit say so well always did think be bad man have boldness to say be guilty of own wickedness cried mr tice indignantly be glad have fallen into own trap why did kill mr dargill ah said allen be just what must like to know motive be assigned in manuscript be mystery at present mr carver may force to confess reason suggested dora perhaps may guess what mr carver yes mr tice believe mr carver know great deal more about unhappy father than chooses to confess from reference in manuscript to father family lawyer be inclined to think that mr carver know who be if doe know also mr edermont real name be julian dargill wonder if know anything about john mallison said allen abruptly see what there be to know about replied dora carelessly man did work well inveigled carew to america when returned father recompensed a say in confession dare say john mallison be settled somewhere in england happy content why do ask allen be thinking that failing joad confession mallison might know motive depend upon dora reason be mixed up somehow with dark story of past well well said dora with sigh will know when mr carver come in meantime let enjoy present happiness mr tice approved of sentiment brought in tea two lover with confidence restored between lingered over simple meal made plan for future be after six before awoke to fact that twilight be waning a dora have to return to red house on bicycle allen suggested that must start at once demurred to a be anxious to hear lawyer report of interview with joad while be arguing matter mr carver arrived for so unemotional man seemed greatly excited shook hand heartily with dora although have seen few hour before mr carver explained meaning of second salute congratulate young lady said heartily through cleverness tact have found out truth be heroine miss carew not miss carew interposed allen brightly miss dargill beg pardon said mr carver in stiff manner be aware that mr edermont real name be dargill a have doubt learnt from manuscript young lady be daughter of late client interrupted dora captain carew be not father mr carver be child of julian edermont rather dargill in case congratulate again miss dora said carver compromising matter by calling by christian name can now marry dr scott since father did not kill father do know that story asked allen with start oh dear yes be told by late client did not inform that young lady be daughter be always under impression that be child of captain carew ward of late mr dargill strange must have kept that from mused lawyer never yet knew client to tell whole truth be very well broke in dora what have joad done fled to london have be with for last two hour by time mr carver glanced at watch be doubt back in cottage back in cottage echoed doctor did not make confession certainly be written out signed in presence with two witness one of clerk to testify to signature then confesses murder oh dear said carver dryly doe nothing of sort confesses a to who committed murder did do miss dora did not friend joad be innocent although added lawyer with afterthought may be described a accessory after fact then who killed father cried dora in blank amazement aha be long long story replied carver with nod in good time dear young lady tell briefly what be contained in manuscript will supply sequel thus added mr carver rubbing dry hand will arrive at clear logical understanding of whole complicated matter lover protested against proposal carver firmly refused to speak word until gist of manuscript be communicated to in end be reluctantly compelled to give way to lawyer obstinacy postpone satisfaction of own curiosity assisted by allen young girl communicated detail succeeded little in moving emotion of mr carver perhaps sequel referred to be more exciting than what told on point pair have speedy opportunity of judging be queer story said carver reflectively have heard queerer be sequel be odd thing about here be man who for twenty year go in dread of life take manner of precaution to look after yet few day after have learnt that enemy be dead life be safe be foully murdered be not superstitious man miss dora see finger of fate in father be doomed to die violent death lifelong fear be justified by result be not killed by man whom expected to be murderer quite true dr scott be killed by man whom did not expect to be murderer what do mean cried dora rising did father know man intimately be man who at one time saved mr edermont from being caught by captain carew mean john mallison shouted allen in wide eyed surprise mr carver nodded be man killed edermont must admit that there be something ironical in fact understand at said dora helplessly will be so kind a to tell how why crime be committed willingly replied carver commenced forthwith late client a know went for year in fear of life said in dry way shortly before murder fear be ended by communication from mr pallant gentleman told that captain carew have died in san francisco a reward for intelligence asked mr edermont for packet of letter written by lady burville to second husband mr edermont be unwilling to give up a saw that pallant wanted to blackmail unfortunate woman mother miss dora refused to comply with mr pallant request wrote to lady burville at hernwood hall asking to come to study in red house on night of second of august between eleven twelve o'clock when undertook to give up letter why did choose so late hour because did not wish to compromise lady burville position did wish pallant to know letter posted

that edermont expected visit from lady burville on night also expected visit from scott yes said allen eagerly wrote to appointed almost same hour why will tell doctor wished to give lady burville

that a knew be bar to marriage to do away with asked to meet lady burville did not meet because be late must not wait let continue edermont also wrote letter to mallison telling now carew be dead fear at end must no longer pay pension have hitherto allowed that letter be cause of death how asked dora allen together will hear joad learning a have said about appointment with lady burville made up mind to overhear conversation knew by letter have opened that postern gate glass door be to be left ajar so about eleven o'clock got into house way without being seen by mr edermont yes mr edermont at moment be in bedroom so joad slipped through study hid in darkness of hall here altered clock by putting on hour why did do in case edermont must suspect next day explained carver then must prove alibi by saying be in cottage did with success to clear of murder primarily be to make safe in eye of edermont well know that altered clock what happened then lady burville arrived edermont returning to study gave letter joad hidden behind door saw heard edermont showed manuscript took out of bureau told be going to burn alter will afterwards when dr scott did not come refused to wait went off edermont saw to glass door at end of deserted drawing room left manuscript on desk seeing way to get hold over edermont joad stepped into room during absence secured scoundrel cried dora excitedly go
