being with powerful passion held in check by sheer force of will be broad strongly built smooth black hair parted in middle be brushed carefully from bold rather protuberant forehead young barrister be somewhat of dandy one who once looked at face thought of dress affectation dapper appearance saw intellect pride resolute will stamped upon pale countenance men with such face end usually in greatness seemed unlikely that david sarby barrister ambitious youth must prove exception to rule lastly etwald be difficult to describe indescribable be austere in face like dante with hollow cheek pallid hue told of midnight study if have passion must not be discerned in feature eye mouth general expression be like mask what actually lay behind mask one ever knew for be never off slightly hollow chest lean nervous hand shock of rather long curling hair tossed from high forehead gave air of student there be something sinister menacing in regard looked dangerous more than trifle uncanny

calamity can do so yes in easy manner never get married maurice flushed crimson resenting mocking tone of etwald half rose from seat without moving finger etwald continued in cold tone be in love with young lady wish to marry quite right quite right broke in major jen heartily want maurice to marry then want to meet fate of life in death said etwald curtly others stared at with skepticism of thoroughly healthy mind refused to attach much importance to etwald mysticism jen be first to speak did so in rather stiff way quite different from usual jovial style of conversation dear etwald if did not know so well must take for charlatan be charlatan major rejoined etwald coolly ask money for performance so be performance after said david carelessly if choose to call so only repeat warning

thing unheard of so young so beautiful so full of divine youth diviner womanhood so sombre pale worn with intellectual vigil with mysterious past doubtful present problematic future maurice david divided one against other by passion for same woman united in feeling of rage contempt against interloper who dared to make third in worship of isabella looked at etwald looked at one finally began to laugh jen frowned at sound of mirth etwald in nowise discomposed sat unsmiling in seat waiting for further development oh be too absurd said maurice resuming seat why etwald put question with greatest calmness stared steadily at young man waited for reply knew must be difficult to make oh because because never mind explaining mr alymer can guess objection be too old too plain too poor for charming young lady on contrary be young passing well off handsome gift of fortune be on side decidedly added doctor hold best hand well will see who will win game a may call what about said david forget that

needle might die finished major with naive simplicity of child may break may shatter vase a will scent of rose will cling round still quoted maurice with laugh doubt devil stick can still do harm ugh what gruesome idea 'd remove from so conspicuous position if be uncle jen someone might come to grief over rubbish boy have be hanging on wall for year have never hurt anyone yet etwald said nothing with eye fixed upon devil stick meditated deeply barrister whose belief be that etwald knew more about wand than chose to say watched closely noticed that doctor eyed stick then after pause let gaze wander to face of maurice pause be looking at david who received fire of strange man eye without blanching there be something so mesmeric in gaze david felt uncomfortable a though be enveloped in evil atmosphere to surprise found that eye also be attracted to devil stick longing to handle began to posse clearly etwald be trying to hypnotize for evil purpose by effort of will david broke through nightmare chain rose to foot next moment be in open air in cold moonlight breathing hard fast within maurice major be talking gaily sound of voice laughter came clearly to ear of david silent in deep

nothing of esoteric meaning to negress mention of emblem conveyed distinct understanding let arm fall listlessly by side with unseeing gaze stared at green tree bathed in hot sunshine after moment so muttered to herself in negro jargon clenched hand baal wand of sleep bringer of death what be saying dido asked battersea feeble intellect scared by fierce gesture unknown tongue say deep thing

grandmother have be carried off a slave from west coast of africa knew about ashantee sorcery fetish rite have repeated to granddaughter dido with result that dido cherishing recollection knew exactly how to use wand of sleep have spoken about to dr etwald quite ignorant that jen kept one a curiosity now etwald have intimated through battersea that wished to do something in connection with stick what that something might be dido at present moment must not guess have exerted magnetic hypnotic influence over battersea not that wished for detailed description of wand for already knew appearance because might happen that must be necessary to use tramp for certain purpose connected with discovery of secret dido exercised strong influence over weak old creature partially on account of half negro blood partially because have terrified feeble brain by dark hint of obi worship battersea be supposed to be christian barbaric fluid in vein inclined to terrible grotesqueness of african witchcraft dido word stirred dim instinct in mind negress saw that accident have placed in way helpless creature who might be of use in necromantic business therefore by hypnotizing once twice contrived to keep within power of fantasy must have be denied by average british newspaper reader who can not imagine such thing taking place in what call euphoniously christian land happened for denial having dismissed battersea negress turned to seek isabella be so devoted to nursling that must hardly bear to be away from since infancy isabella have scarcely be absent hour from strange

jealousy of woman advocacy of dr etwald suit made unpleasant third at meeting moreover maurice instinctively disliked sullen creature be never quite easy in presence finally isabella decided to slip round by back of house meet maurice at gate dido be occupied in questioning battersea about devil stick on verandah so after glance to assure that pair be in earnest conversation isabella put on straw hat ran lightly away to see lover passed out by side door danced like fairy across intervening space of lawn slipped laughingly into narrow path wound through wood to avenue near gate just a emerged into open heard sharp click saw maurice approaching be dressed in flannel looked particularly handsome thought more so when beheld face lighting up at unexpected appearance magnetism of love drew irresistibly together in le time than take to write isabella be lying on broad breast of lover be fondly kissing lip own dear love murmured softly how good of to meet came down here to escape dido explained isabella slipping hand within like to be with like in case darling be like black shadow of evil always at heel must get mother to forbid trespassing upon meeting dear maurice how can possibly do that when refuse to tell mother of engagement oh have reason for keeping engagement secret be no longer necessary to day at moment be going straight to ask mother to give dear hand in marriage if consent will soon get rid of dido mother may not consent said isabella trifle nervously why not have profession small property love one dearly so see what ground have for refusal dido well dido can hing said maurice in jesting tone unless want to forbid banns may even be able to do replied isabella seriously mother be afraid of be often influenced in decision by dido what black witch bah be only servant be something more than in barbadoes oh mean that obi rubbish dearest said maurice slipping arm round slender waist of girl be on very account wish to tell mother of engagement for must rescue from influence of dark jezebel be dangerous know be hate care for hate replied maurice carelessly be poor thing can not possibly harm mean to extricate from toil care how attempt to prevent marriage surely mr dallas will not let be guided in so important business by will feeling of black wench mother be weak where dido be concerned said isabella shaking head so be dear responded maurice kissing of be weak have yielded up will to woman announcement of engagement will give influence in house do away with that will be fight between white black magic a civilized wizard intend to win why do particularly wish to announce engagement to day maurice grew serious paused at top of drive just out of sight of house to reply to question dear child said slowly kept engagement secret on account of david have seen for long time that love knowing fiery temper did not wish to provoke quarrel by telling that have promised to be wife last night truth be forced from at dinner david declared that intended to ask to marry love love knew did know now that love one be ignorant that be engaged when fact be publicly announced may give up idea of marrying so quarrel may be averted be

etwald enter two young people looked steadfastly at brilliantly colored figure of negress standing in statuesque attitude near great iron gate on side of waved summer foliage of tree overhead sun like burning eye looked down from cloudless sky beyond dusty white road showed distinctly through slender bar of gate be bright cheerful english in sinister red figure with black face hand there be suggestion of evil seemed to dominate poison whole beautiful scene maurice felt isabella shudder with nervous dread a pressed closely to side dearest must not be afraid said glancing down anxiously at face must throw off terror have of woman if law at moment broke off speech with ejaculation of surprise for true to prognostication of isabella in answer to expectant attitude of negress dr etwald turned in at gate ho ho murmured maurice rather taken back so art of devil raising be not lost one after dido can still call spirit from vasty deep have called flesh blood said isabella with shiver there be nothing strange about dr etwald appearance just now dido did not call simply felt that be at hand went to meet at gate continued to watch pair saw dido throw at foot of etwald who raised hand over in threatening manner pointed into wood with imperious gesture in slinking attitude usually stately dido passed out of sight into little path down isabella have come to meet maurice when gleam of

something important have brought doctor to see be not man to waste time on visit of ceremony now mr dallas be secretly afraid of etwald a have received hint from dido in whose truth implicitly believed that doctor knew more about secret thing than most people dreaded lest visit must portend harm so in trepidation waited for to speak etwald guessing frame of mind took time be only when isabella approached with tea for mother that broke silence go away miss dallas said entreatingly have something to say to mother concern isabella turned pale for guessed what be coming a etwald have raised voice purposely maurice who be standing by tea table also pricked up ear mr dallas with curiosity raised to look closer at etwald seeing that auditory be attentive prepared to launch

departure outside etwald found dido waiting for looked at significantly have failed said there be nothing left devil stick chapter vi strange occurrence maurice returned home after somewhat stormy interview with mr dallas for once mother of isabella be roused out of habitual indifference refused absolutely to accept alymer a son in law in vain lover implored to give reason for strange refusal beyond expressing personal dislike for maurice declined to explain conduct young man saw in uncalled for behavior hostile influence of dido be because black woman distrust that object said when mr dallas have talked hoarse wonder that english lady christian educated person must be dominated by uncivilized creature dido have nothing to do with refusal said widow coldly although take advice in thing in wish isabella to marry request to leave house mother cried isabella with pale face never come back to again finished dallas sharply maurice went to window of room opened on to veranda put on hat a gentleman must accept dismissal said quietly decline to give up isabella cried girl swear to remain true to maurice will hing of sort said mother violently forbid even to think of young man will marry whom choose dr etwald suppose mr sarby david ejaculated maurice in astonished tone wish isabella to marry yes love isabella much more than do asked permission did to pay address to consented so mr dallas raised voice will marry refuse to marry mr sarby said isabella vehemently hate be matter replied mother coldly must marry must repeated maurice with great indignation yes mr alymer must must

said isabella major be kind man want to see happy be be enough interrupted mr dallas rising in cold fury want further speech from go to room isabella mr alymer way lie yonder with swift gesture pointed to window resigning to inevitable maurice gave one glance at isabella went outside with heavy heart dido be standing upon veranda with eye glowing like two coal yet there be ill concealed expression of triumph in gaze maurice in then disturbed angered state of mind must ill brook paused abruptly a passed by asked direct question why do hate dido negress glared savagely at voodoo said in harsh voice what do mean by jargon demanded in angry tone voodoo said dido again showed teeth in anything pleasant fashion bah black parrot muttered maurice scornfully turned upon heel a vanished down walk dido clapped hand together with great satisfaction began to sing in low tone song be barbaric in word strange beyond telling in music rose fell moaned drawled in curiously painful manner in drawing room mr dallas have risen to foot at first deep contralto note now stood rocking to fro with expression of alarm on face isabella be terrified in turn by dido song mother strange conduct though by time must have be used to eccentricity mother what be doe dido sing mr dallas closing eye continued rocking to fro saying one word in answer voodoo said be be enough for isabella shrieked ran out of room then dido still singing appeared at window looked at mr dallas with expression of triumph why do sing death song asked mr dallas opening eye because de master hab doomed dat yaller have ' r said dido continued song in meantime maurice walked slowly homeward puzzling out in own mind a to what must be meaning of strange thing must not understand why mr dallas objected to a son in law must surmise meaning of mysterious word voodoo pronounced so significantly by dido however saw plainly that negress be disturbing element in dallas household by half hypnotic control over weak will of mistress must act a pleased widow have be born brought up in barbadoes be half educated woman of feeble intellect having be left during time mind character be being formed solely to society of black servant have imbibed not unnaturally many of debased superstition of africa dido knew by mean of claim to knowledge of obi be enabled to rule mr dallas also a have be stated to exercise powerful influence over plastic mind of isabella will spoil design in quarter muttered maurice a thought led to conclusion isabella will not be dragged down to level of mother will marry so destroy influence of vile negress be easier said than done a maurice simple upright in conduct character be match for unscrupulous machination of dido hated young man be determined that must not marry nursling whether have like mr dallas preference for david over etwald maurice must not determine more thought over affair more incoherent complicated did become so alymer gave up task in despair then occurred to that mr dallas have referred to major jen so to guardian maurice went moment arrived at big house to surprise major be not to be found major gone out sir explained jaggard to whom maurice applied for information got message from dr etwald went to see be back to dinner sir b'lieve where be mr sarby gone over to brance hall sir ho ho thought maurice a turned away so david have gone to see lady meg countess now if be in love with isabella mr dallas favor suit wonder why act in way question must not answer so dismissing from memory retired to smoking room with pipe novel when jen david returned intended to question if possible get to bottom of thickening mystery hang soliloquized maurice over book since yesterday everything seems to have gone wrong that negress dr etwald be at bottom of affair ca see reason for mixing thing up so then laid aside book to think through smoke curling from pipe stared idly at opposite wall chanced to be that upon barbaric weapon before alluded to be arranged conspicuous among glittered golden handle of devil stick recalling mention of voodoo etwald reference to african witchcraft maurice connected in own mind devil stick with barbarism on impulse of moment rose to examine magic wand handling carefully for dreaded poison although be said to be dried up wondered if dido must make use of be in possession heard mr dallas say that dido people came from ashantee soliloquized maurice so have doubt can work infernal thing perhaps know enough to fill bag with fresh poison if did so must trust near must be sure to experiment on at moment major jen looking slightly worried entered room seeing devil stick in hand of maurice stopped short with ejaculation of surprise be looking at thing maurice said wonderingly now be strange why must be strange because have just be talking about with dr etwald oh said maurice thought flying back to mysterious influence have seen etwald exercise over dido be doctor saying major jen threw into chair frowned great deal saw devil stick other night last night yes last night to day sent note asking if must ride over see afternoon did so then explained that wished to buy that thing devil stick why ca say explained that have be in barbadoes that took great interest in subject of african fetish worship have heard of 'wands of sleep a be called greatly wished to obtain one be unable to do so since seeing mine have be seized with desire to posse why said maurice again a curiosity suppose have told told refused to sell to seemed greatly vexed display of irritation in turn vexed be quite annoyed when left why wish to sell uncle jen because be dangerous thing to handle although poison be dried up yet there may be enough in to kill man if parted with anyone be injured by must never forgive pray put up maurice dislike to see touch to night after dinner will lock up in safe place david be right must not be on wall there david have gone over to see lady meg yes think will be back until after dinner

what said interrupted jen hastily more of till after dinner dear lad then will explain explain what why mr dallas want isabella to marry david not word must major say on subject at moment so maurice be forced to seek room in very unsatisfied frame of mind however a thought here be one mystery about to be explained be comfort a jen prophesied david did not return to dinner maurice have tte tte with guardian talked of indifferent thing be not until be once more in smoking room with cigar coffee that major consented to speak on subject of mr dallas strange conduct now boy be ready to tell here jen stopped looked blankly at wall what be matter asked maurice in surprise devil stick gasped jen pointing shaking finger at wall devil stick maurice looked devil stick be gone chapter vii rival for moment two men looked at one then major jen seeing necessity for prompt action rang bell jaggard entered with military swiftness stared blankly at master who be pointing at wall action inexplicable to servant at moment where be devil stick demanded jen wrathfully what sir asked jaggard doubtfully green stick with gold handle be placed among weapon here be gone have become of jaggard advanced to trophy of weapon examined with deliberation after turned to face irate major be gone sure enough sir know where find out if of servant have taken jaggard saluted vanished while master walked up down room fuming at loss of curiosity have talk to for maurice whose mind be busy with conjecture a to dido dr etwald being thief did not think necessary to speak in few minute jaggard

again at half past eight devil stick be gone in two hour dido have have time to cross lawn yonder steal why do suspect dido because room be in darkness a heard jaggard say to steal that thief must have known position on wall well dido did know that be never in room dr etwald be dr etwald do think have anything to do with queried jen perplexed trifled startled be certain of replied maurice employed dido to steal from a refused to sell listen uncle will give reason for belief then maurice told succinctly have taken place at wigwam during afternoon major jen listened quietly waited until maurice ended story before spoke information about mr dallas reference to did not surprise so much a alymer expected must do in fact only made one brief remark upon point be sorry mr dallas said that remarked when maurice paused in narrative what doe mean by uncle jen did wish to marry isabella be for against replied jen enigmatically a said before let girl marry who love best love best in case be sorry for david retorted major so be rejoined maurice promptly same can hardly expect to give up to david girl love who love why doe mr dallas support david suit ask to explain that dear lad did so referred to major jen wriggled uneasily in seat carefully knocked ash off cigar disliked telling what appeared to to be silly story a such story bore strongly upon present position of thing a maurice be impatiently waiting to be enlightened jen be forced to put scruple on one side speak out if what relate appears impossible blame said abruptly feel certain that will laugh when tell about voodoo that word again cried maurice in puzzled voice dido used when met etwald repeated to before left voodoo voodoo what doe mean uncle jen african witchcraft obi fetish worship adoration of bad spirit who catch mortal by hair one of thing explains meaning of term h be said maurice be devil worship pure simple yes mr dallas know more about than be good for mean to say that belief in boy jen laid hand upon arm of young man when reach age will find that there be limit to credulity folly of human being when be stationed in barbadoes many year ago met mr dallas oh so be old friend of yours yes knew in west indie shortly before isabella be born be through knowing explained major that came to neighborhood rented wigwam see maurice be one of few people knew in england remained near for company sake here major hesitated because be afraid of herself finished significantly quite understand will explain be lucky for that mr dallas gave permission to ask for explanation otherwise must have be forced from sense of honor to hold tongue a be can tell mr dallas fear that if isabella marries anyone david death will take place whose death isabella mr dallas latter must know maurice continued major that mr dallas though well born well married be extremely ignorant woman be brought up mostly by dido grandmother who be most accursed old witch in barbadoes out of for matter of old hag instilled into mind of mr dallas kind of superstition in really belief when grandmother died dido became nurse to isabella private witch of dallas household be clever wonderfully clever have continued grandmother system of terrorizing mr dallas isabella yes can see uncle jen be for reason want to marry isabella take away before mind be degraded further by old fury well old fury see what want dear lad so be determined that isabella will marry david not to accomplish aim went through hocus pocus of devilry fortune telling incantation discovered that if isabella marries mr dallas will die doe mr dallas believe that rubbish asked maurice incredulously implicitly tell be ignorant superstitious come what may be convinced that marriage with isabella mean own death so may rest assured maurice that will never never accept a son in law understand said maurice with shrug seems hopeless to contest decision of diseased feeble mind can understand dido stopping marriage a want to retain sinful influence over isabella can understand mr dallas weak silly being dominated by negro jezebel ca understand why david be chosen a future son in law if marries isabella will no more put up with dido than must have done of course not ca explain reason repeated jen shaking head know know maurice can see that be hopeless for to attempt to marry girl be not so sure of retorted maurice love isabella come what may intend to make wife what about said voice outside open window what about moment later david in dusty riding dress stepped into room looked disturbed angry strongly marked face bore trace of agitation haunting thought disturbed by unexpected appearance of david seeing from expression that be bent upon making disagreeable jen hastily interposed to prevent quarrel between two young men what david back again said ignoring question asked by sarby so did not stay to dinner replied david shortly did flung into chair resumed in significant tone lady seamere did ask if have must have accepted in dress besides be not man whom delight to honor now if maurice have be there lady meg for heaven sake couple name with lady meg interrupted maurice sharply know quite well yes do rejoined david interrupting in turn so doe what do mean what say be use assuming that innocent air maurice have not treated lady meg well have how dare say thing lady meg knew be in love with isabella oh said david with sneer overheard arrange to marry will never do while be alive mr dallas know that mr dallas be on side know reason then know more than do retorted sarby told mr dallas loved isabella said that nothing must give greater pleasure than to see married sha marry cried maurice angrily rising will said david rose also boy boy said jen annoyed at quarrel be so positive if be in love with same woman let woman decide have decided said alymer sharply love care two straw about said david coldly have not spoken to yet same intend to become wife give fair warning maurice that be not to poach upon preserve preserve confound insolence upon word david said jen seeing that maurice must hardly speak for rage go too far girl love maurice not must be much more honorable for not to press suit care two pin for honor major love isabella intend to marry become wife of maurice never will 'd rather see married to etwald third richmond who be in field scoffed maurice well have a good chance a dido support pretension mr dallas be champion a for have love of isabella so be afraid of nothing be not said sarby with peculiar smile remember what etwald said about life in death believe in rubbish david must be very sorry to think did a to care about discussing point be reply own belief be own business must say that etwald be dangerous man to to daresay replied maurice coolly more so a believe have stolen devil stick what david made step forward stared at wall face be quite pale hand trembled in spite of effort to control devil stick gone said turning on heel must be careful maurice chapter viii cry in night so far reader may wonder at constituent element of story african witchcraft mysterious stranger barbaric woman seem to be out of place when set in sober framework of english provincial town romance be not dependent upon landscape on surroundings for occurrence be to be found everywhere very often in most unlikely place here for instance by trick of fate certain people have come together certain passion have be aroused now that drama have be set in motion seemed likely that must play out to tragical conclusion tragical certainly for herein element of comedy seem to be wanting then fate be so pessimistic for whole week after event already related nothing new took place likely to alter situation maurice david remained coldly polite very watchful of one neither mentioned name of isabella did one other see girl mr dallas took care of acting doubt under advice of dido for have will of own kept isabella within door refused to allow to communicate with maurice on other hand did not force to see david isabella be thankful for consideration there be one visitor to wigwam whom isabella must gladly have avoided no le individual than dr etwald after violent scene with maurice widow so overtaxed strength that became ill doctor be sent for mere presence appeared to soothe mr dallas came frequently when must isabella absented be not able to do on occasion so have to endure complimentary speech mesmeric quality of gaze last especially be trial to one of sensitive organization one day felt so uncomfortable that remonstrated with etwald make afraid doctor said impetuously gaze be disagreeable to dear young lady replied man blandly must look at when address then address isabella be rude cried mr dallas who have overheard passage at arm whereupon girl with defiant glance at tormentor left room be sure know what will do with isabella sighed mr dallas be getting so disobedient perhaps can assist mr dallas looked uneasily at medical attendant said quietly may persuade into doing what want be to marry mr david sarby said etwald coolly in case can only hope that young lady will continue obstinate a wish to marry know know want to marry doctor mr sarby be man for daughter be good looking clever poor finished etwald well yes assented mr dallas there be that objection be not much of obstacle a isabella have money young couple can live on three thousand year dr etwald went home with sum running in head more than ever resolved to marry isabella be in love with must have taken without penny same if be heiress in small way be better doctor be clever poor with income like must move to london do great thing there be many scheme in etwald head certain of determined to put into execution at once in order to secure isabella to wife time previously major jen have asked etwald about devil stick only to be informed that doctor knew nothing of missing article have not set eye on since night showed to declared etwald coolly refused to sell to so of course gave up idea of possessing same finished politely be sorry that be lost lost stolen mean growled jen tartly that negress dido well admit that barbaric treasure must tempt more particularly a know about such wizard instrument ask if took have done so have asked mr dallas also replied jen seems that dido be out of house on night be ill oddly enough hear etwald that be who made ill really said etwald quite possessed suppose mr alymer told so thought a much continued a jen nodded saw calming dido agitation when arrived to ask mr dallas for daughter hand negress be hysterical on day happened to be so quieted yet mr alymer accuses of having caused illness know anything about etwald truth to tell maurice doe not like because prophesied ill concerning oh be rubbish said jen contemptuously did mean did wait see after etwald bowed visitor politely to door of gloomy old house occupied in deanminster jen returned home quite baffled a to what must have become of devil stick inquiry proved futile be unable even to conjecture how have disappeared yet knowing fatal quality be in constant dread lest must reappear in connection with tragedy maurice still held to idea that dido have taken wand jen inquiry proved that negress have not be out of house night in question then must have be battersea said maurice decidedly be friend of dido pensioner of isabella will find out if stole stick for negress for dr etwald be easier said than done a mr dallas must not allow maurice to set foot in house still maurice hoped to learn truth from tramp hope that proved futile also battersea have gone on one of begging excursion for quite week be not seen in neighborhood of ashantee then suddenly made appearance at house asked to see maurice on being led into hall alymer came out to speak with after few word took old man into library jen who be rather curious to know what maurice might learn from disreputable old scamp waited patiently for termination of interview a alymer did not reappear sought library found young man alone where be battersea asked jen glancing round oh have gone away what did wish to see about have heard that accused of taking devil stick explained maurice came here to exculpate well did do so yes be quite innocent did not take devil stick then who did maurice paused reflected looked anxiously at jen will tell that to morrow said after pause why not to night asked jen sharply because have suspicion can not prove at present battersea gave hint upon be determined to work to night may learn truth from whom ask uncle jen ca answer yet jen frowned then laughed well just a please said raising eyebrow be a mysterious a david why what about david only that have gone up to town without bidding good by save in short note ca understand such conduct said maurice stretching out hand please let read note uncle jen wish to see precisely how be worded note major handed over be curt to verge of rudeness merely stated that writer have gone to london for couple of day on business must be back a soon a possible explanation of what business might be be given maurice did not wonder than jen be annoyed at receiving missive from one whom regarded in light of son in handing back to major excused writer fact be david have not be quite since trouble about isabella said gravely think best to go away for time know how torture over trifle egad love business of two young men be getting to be anything trifle said jen testily what between lot of etwald there seems to be nothing trouble wish 'd marry girl maurice have done with perhaps may settle affair sooner than think said alymer rising uncle jen wo be back to dinner to night a have to go into deanminster what about business connected with devil stick isabella h be be pleased to be mysterious why not tell business because may fail said maurice here uncle jen be cross will tell about to morrow then will see approve of silence to night well said jen with shrug be old enough to guide own action must say that like to be shut out of confidence of two boy in way will know everything to morrow ' about david also perhaps can even promise said maurice with smile what cried jen do know why david have gone to town not for certain can guess now uncle jen sha answer question just now a must go into deanminster will take dogcart will walk walk in evening dress be not going to put on evening dress said maurice impatiently will get dinner in deanminster then go about business be useless to ask further question a jen saw that young man be getting irritated so in very pleasant temper major went up to dressing room be of peace loving easy going nature fond of quietness so annoyed not little that disturbance must take place on account of woman sex be at bottom of everything said major uttering old truth with conviction david maurice being absent one in london other at deanminster major jen be compelled to dine alone disliked doing so hurrying over dinner with speed betook to smoking room with book here lighted cigar chose comfortable chair near open window attempted to read somnolent influence of evening be upon before cigar be half done good major be sound asleep outside warm wind be blowing air be filled with perfume of flower in dark blue sky hardly cloud must be seen moon just showing orb above tree top flooded still loveliness of night with wave after wave of cold light be full of charm spellbound a be by magic of moonlight when suddenly long wild cry struck shuddering through silence accustomed a old campaigner to sleep lightly major jen be on foot in instant again heard that terrible shriek seemed to come from direction of high road thinking that evil be being done jen without loss of time raced across lawn into avenue in few minute arrived at gate stepped out into white dusty road black mass be lying distance down toward ran jen with indefinable sense of evil clutching at heartstrings black mass proved to be body of man cold still jen turned corpse over recoiled dead man be maurice alymer chapter ix after deed while major hardly able to credit own eye be staring at dead body of dear lad jaggard attracted also by strange cry came running up what be sir asked saluting jen even in moment of anxiety heard awful cry sir came arter jen pointed to corpse said nothing jaggard ignorant of truth bent down to place hand upon dead man heart then saw recognized face mr maurice god sir what doe mean cried aghast with sudden horror mean murder jaggard replied jen in hollow voice hardly recognized a own mr maurice went to deanminster before dinner now major pointed again to remains murder echoed jaggard ruddy face growing pale who sir know ca say interrupted master impatiently go get men to bring down stretcher for body send groom for dr etwald ai too late sir do a tell said jen so fiercely that jaggard did not dare to disobey ran off leaving major alone with dead road ran past ashantee toward wigwam be lonely even in daytime at hour of night for be close upon nine o'clock be quite deserted not person be in sight although major must see up down road for considerable distance owing to bright moonlight raised maurice rather remained of maurice in arm placed body on soft grass by wayside then sat down began to think out reason for committal of cowardly crime that be crime be certain for there be reasonable idea to suppose that maurice have committed suicide have left for deanminster hardly three hour before full of health spirit now be dead dead body lonely road evidence of atrocious assassination having be committed not one trace of assassin undoubtedly twice uttered cry have come from maurice a jen have raced out of house after first time heard must have reached boy almost immediately after died before so to speak body have time to grow cold yet strange part of affair be that body be cold that there did not seem to be wound whereby murder must have be achieved be taking too much for granted muttered major jen passing hand across brow maurice may not have be killed after be etwald horrible prophecy have put idea into head let have look at poor lad body in bright moonlight carefully examined body must find trace of wound until came to right hand here in palm saw ragged rent clotted with blood be mere scratch not likely to have caused death unless poison be here major jen uttered oath rose to foot with new terrible idea in brain devil stick by heaven said aloud again bent down examined face hand be swollen discolored tore open shirt at neck saw that young man breast be distended bloated undoubtedly cause of death be blood poisoning devil stick have be instrument used to effect deed here problem proposed who have killed maurice person who have stolen devil stick who have stolen devil stick person who major jen came to abrupt pause must think for moment of answer to question be only fair to say that dazed by terrible occurrence of dear lad death jen have not wit about while be still considering affair in confused manner jaggard reappeared with men from ashantee carrying stretcher while placed body of maurice thereon groom bound for deanminster passed driving dogcart major jen stopped man to tell at risk be to bring back dr etwald with jaggard wondered at for maurice poor lad be beyond earthly aid jen be thinking of certain person who might have committed crime wished for aid of dr etwald to capture person in meantime necessity of case called for immediate removal of body to ashantee be melancholy procession bore body up to house four men carried bier for be nothing else since bore dead body of young man behind came major jen bowed to ground with sorrow must hardly believe that maurice be dead that have perished upon lonely country road by unknown hand be question jen began to think assassin be not unknown that have clew to find guilty one waited coming of dr etwald with great impatience to see what opinion be regarding course to be pursued in due time etwald arrived for groom have be fortunate enough to find at home on hearing of affair expressed deepest concern putting other business on one side came back to ashantee in dogcart before seeing jen went up to alymer room examined body of unfortunate young man having satisfied so far a be able without making post mortem examination came down to library where jen awaited well etwald cried major when saw tall form of doctor at door have seen have seen corrected etwald with professional calmness poor fellow be dead major dead from blood poisoning knew guessed devil stick may be rejoined etwald taking seat can not be sure see neither know anything of poison be in handle of african instrument what be talking of broke in jen impetuously say that poor boy died from blood poisoning how else must have come by save through being touched struck with devil stick one in neighborhood be likely to posse likely to corrupt blood if maurice have be stabbed shot if head have be smashed in must understand crime rather motive for crime better a be person who stole devil stick must have killed who stole devil stick asked etwald coolly if forget not major asked other day if did yes be wrong made mistake mistake under present dispensation of thing might prove awkward for said etwald be friend to dead man did not like loved same woman be rival what then so easy a for to say for jury to believe have stolen devil stick killed mr alymer so a to get out of way never thought of such thing protested jen suspect then whom do suspect asked etwald fixing dark eye on major dido negress of mr dallas etwald shook head smiled be ridiculous said commission of crime presupposes motive now what motive have dido to kill friend hated maurice did not want to marry miss dallas

sympathy be manifested for untimely death also mysterious way in have come to end absence of known motive knowledge that deceased have enemy thing combined to raise public curiosity to highest pitch inquest on dead body be awaited with much anxiety crowd of people came from part of country to view scene of crime if possible to gain glimpse of jen david who a relative a might be said of deceased

casually that have be giving dido instruction a to what be to be done with isabella girl be nervously excited explained now that have sustained shock of mr alymer death there be knowing what complication may ensue think life be in danger asked david in faltering tone fancy reason be here jen looked suddenly at etwald recalled dinner at doctor have read dead man hand then have prophesied ill of maurice ill must seem have be fulfilled now with equal curtness be prognosticating evil for isabella vexed at such croaking jen spoke abruptly be prophet of evil etwald said first poor maurice now miss dallas a to replied etwald with deliberation foretell that miss dallas may get ill from perfectly natural sign be in love with alymer be of highly excitable nervous character so be easy to know that unless great care be exercised brain may be affected with regard to maurice quite different thing read in hand that must be subject to state of life in death a guessed meant paralysis catalepsy said david a see poor maurice be dead prophecy be false etwald shrugged shoulder must seem so assented mr aylmer be dead a say so term life in death can not be applied to present state of non existence will admit that foretold that evil must happen to if decided to marry miss dallas have turned out a thought true doctor remarked jen keeping eye fixed upon swart face of other be that have to say what else do expect to say demanded etwald coldly say who think killed maurice be beyond power then who stole devil stick ca answer question said doctor taking up hat detective may be able to assist on point engage one said jen linking david by arm need aid from law to learn who killed maurice avenge death david will find guilty person really hope will succeed case like requires trained intelligence such a will find in detective of course may command service major be afraid will not succeed will see replied jen who be a obstinate a mule on point be fool certainly not rejoined etwald with something like sneer be also no detective that will see retorted major vexed by sarcasm thereupon gave etwald to understand by look manner that wished to be alone with david when doctor have taken off be walking past library window toward curve of avenue where ran into wood jen looked after with lowering face laid inquiring finger on david arm do trust that man boy asked gravely returned sarby after pause think be bad lot be sure of what be more added jen nodding be opinion that know who killed maurice if indeed did not do david shook head think so said with conviction why must kill maurice lad be rival mine also major yet suspect of deed god forbid that heart must harbor so ill thought cried jen with natural horror tell what david must sift affair to bottom maurice be dead assassin be at large so must catch uncle jen added major for know that black witch may have something to do with crime likely enough if know how to manipulate devil stick denied knowledge of devil stick lie lie lie said jen scornfully if must only enough of for time being added abruptly will talk of thing on more fitting occasion hour dragged heavily along in house of mourning body of dead man lay in little chamber looked out upon laurel encircled lawn be covered with white sheet hand be folded upon breast flower have be laid thereon by major over face handkerchief have be thrown a once handsome feature be so discolored a to be absolutely repulsive to sight there be something terrible in rigidity of long form stretched out so stiffly under sheet in chamber candle be burning jaggard be watching near corpse be to watch throughout night on morrow post mortem examination be to take place inspector of police at deanminster have left man in house to look after interest of justice a yet inspector very gifted man at most be doubtful of proper course to pursue crime have be committed victim be well known gentleman so here if anywhere be chance of covering with glory by discovering assassin arkel inspector in question have only experience in bucolic crime of rick burning order at worst poker murder of laborer subtlety with deed have be accomplished baffled must not grasp idea of devil stick even take in mode of death if arkel be to be avenger of alymer death assassin ran excellent chance of getting off scot free david retired early to bed a be quite worn out with anxiety of day jen be too grieved to sleep remained in library thinking over great loss wondering what wretch must have taken that young life toward twelve o'clock went to kitchen have short conversation with policeman who be stupid bucolic youth with more brain than pumpkin afterward sought chamber of death to see jaggard be not sleeping at post finally like good old soldier be jen went round house to satisfy that window door be bolted barred thing done returned to library at first read smoked then paced up down thinking of dead lad finally a hand of clock drew to midnight threw into chair worn out in body in mind old man slept profoundly hour after hour passed in silence moon set night grew darker a wind rose moaned through wood round house save muttering of breeze ticking of clock not sound be to be heard in silent room wherein jen slept heavily suddenly woke with start somebody be rapping gently on shutter of middle window glancing at clock jen saw that be three in morning wondering who must be outside at so untimely hour rose to open window with care begotten by old experience picked up revolver held ready while unbolting window shutter when be thrown open saw white figure with outstretched hand standing before window good lord miss dallas here at hour yes yes whispered girl stepping into room got out of bedroom window escaped from mother dido want to see maurice if maurice maurice interrupted girl wildly take to dead chamber seeing from look that be too distraught to be argued with jen led out of library into dead man room then uttered cry be echoed by wild shriek from girl bed be empty corpse be gone chapter xi major jen detective astounded horrified major with isabella dallas clinging to arm stood staring at empty bed candle be still burning jaggard have fallen from chair be lying huddled heap upon floor one window of room be wide open wind now blowing freely be shaking loose shutter to fro shock of discovery be so terrific that jen for once in life lost presence of mind be recalled to sens by wild voice of isabella maurice maurice where be cried leaving major rushing toward empty bed said be here poor dead love ca see where be where be god know stammered jen turning horrified gaze on poor girl did not know what to do isabella be in dangerous state of hysteria have on loose white dressing gown presence in house at three o'clock in morning be enough to overpower jen sense of reasonable independent of crowning horror of missing corpse at juncture much needed aid came from without david sarby rushed into room be half clothed pale a white dress of isabella dallas evidently from wild look in eye quivering of nether lip badly scared stopping short few pace from door held up lamp carried to survey astonishing scene before sight of jen tongue tied immovable of isabella weeping on knee by bedside of bed vacant of dead occupant thing be calculated to shock even stronger nerve than of david sarby nevertheless after pause of sheer astonishment managed to stammer out question did did cry out asked nodding toward girl heard shriek presence question unlocked major tongue yes replied in hesitating manner a of one unused to speech came to library window ten minute ago having escaped from custody of mother dido quite hysterical a see bent upon seeing poor dead lad to pacify brought a see body be gone cried david hurrying toward bed gone gone moaned isabella rising dear dead lover jaggard there said jen pointing to inanimate form of old servant be asleep dead dead wailed isabella catching at word maurice dead must alarm house cried sarby in horrified tone thereupon walked swiftly toward door before must reach major having recovered presence of mind seized by arm said jen hastily bring one here a yet david must think of poor girl take home at once when be out of house will give alarm understand one must know that miss dallas have be in house at hour quite agree with said david simply turning to isabella took gently by hand come miss dallas be place for maurice muttered isabella looking piteously at maurice be not here come miss dallas let take back to mother mother be so cruel said isabella in low tone feel so ill continued raising hand to loose hair yes yes must go home maurice dear maurice will tell about to morrow answered jen soothingly led out of room at present moment must go home with mr sarby david there be loose cloak of mine in hall wrap round come into library be best that must leave in way came david did a be told snatched up own ulster after wrapping up isabella in library found major reopening shutter of window have closed on girl entry when flung aside gust of wind blew inward sprinkling with moisture rain said jen drawing back better there will be spy about can take miss dallas home without being observed taking girl by hand david led toward window be in half dazed condition result of strong excitement have impelled to make midnight visit nerve being thus dulled surrendered passively to guidance of david only at window did pause look steadfastly at major must find out what have become of dear maurice body said quietly promise replied jen with look of stern determination in face will let know promise said jen again please go miss dallas there be time to be lost must not be found here thus entreated isabella stepped out into night in moment so be swallowed up in darkness with companion left alone major closed window bolted barred shutter then hastened back to death chamber where rang bell in few minute footman half dressed half asleep made appearance then came policeman hastily from kitchen finally a bell still continued ringing other servant male female poured into room single glance showed what have occurred insensible jaggard empty bed open window babel of voice ensued silence of cried jen authoritatively must act not talk two of take jaggard to room tell groom to ride at once to deanminster for dr etwald inspector arkel sampson added turning to policeman who be stolidly staring at empty bed rouse take lantern search for footmark there must have be more than one person to carry off dead body direction be obeyed at once house ground whole wild night with driving tempest became radiant with light alive with terrified men that human being must be murdered be sufficiently ghastly without crowning horror of missing body coming after man looked on fellow with suspicion in yellow light of lantern dimly through steady downpour of rain must be seen pallid face scared expression while men folk scoured house park adjacent lane environing ashantee female servant unnerved hysterical crowded together in kitchen whispering over hastily prepared tea be wild night full of vague horror of death mystery etwald came immediately from deanminster in company with arkel whom last extraordinary event took entirely by surprise questioned young policeman left in charge searched chamber of death stepped out of window across lawn toward belt of laurel divided lawn from winding tortuous lane tenebrous pathway even in noonday slipped eel like through darkling tree to emerge into high road quarter of mile away arkel be so long absent that jen must only surmise that have gone into outward darkness on inspector return appeared that major be right in conjecture furthermore arkel brought back certain news without doubt body be taken out through window said to jen flower bed beneath lattice be trampled down be carried across lawn for must see by light of lantern footmark of four foot through bush into lane way can be traced easily enough to point be too dark to note further sign nothing more can be done to night said jen gloomily men have returned dead tired have seen nothing one where be when body be stolen sleeping in library saw that be safe about midnight then sat down over book fell asleep woke somewhere about three be sure be that hour certain heard hall clock strike on waking went into room where dead body be laid out to assure that be well found bed empty window open jaggard insensible did hear noise none at wind rain be wild outside so that may have drowned noise made by who broke in must question servant said arkel having noted major answer in pocket book be stunned believe ca say have examined stunned drugged suppose where be mr sarby asked inspector a turned to leave room major be prepared for question a did not intend that visit of isabella to house must become known to police answered in guarded fashion mr sarby went out a soon a discovered loss have not yet returned be with when made discovery no have retired to bed rejoined jen a soon a saw what have taken place called up jumped through window to see if must espy trace of robber then servant came sent for inspector arkel who must not see one inch beyond nose be quite satisfied with explanation nodded in reply left room with major to seek out jaggard if possible to learn from have occurred be unable to do man have be stunned by blow on head be quite insensible yet be strong man said etwald when conveyed intelligence must have be taken by surprise undoubtedly asserted jen readily must also have be asleep else must have called out a men burst through window how do know there be more than one asked etwald in jesting tone because maurice be unusually heavy man replied major must not have be carried off be body must not have be carried off corrected with sigh unless by two men there may have be three for know what be meaning of cried jen in bewildered dismay why be poor lad body stolen resurrectionists suggested arkel whereupon major jen shuddered for god sake even hint at thing cried vehemently must be too terrible a happens quite unbelievable be incredible that thing must occur nowadays be incredible that thing a theft of body must occur said etwald dryly yet have taken place where be mr sarby must think that must be present to aid jen be just about to repeat feigned explanation regarding david absence when door opened young man wet exhausted entered room to give cue major spoke to at once be just in time david a be telling gentleman about hunt after wretch did see anyone saw nothing said david wearily god know what have become of body have theory mr sarby doctor be too weary to frame theory at hour of night doubt mr inspector yonder can certainly not interrupted arkel sharply can prove nothing be quite puzzled wonder said etwald counting off event on finger devil stick murder theft of body be catalogue of horror man might do worse than write story on thing agree with remarked major sharply man might make jest of horror a be doing assure never felt le like jesting in life replied etwald coldly be use discussing such thing at five in morning if can do without major will return to deanminster be tired jaggard asked david rising stiffly from chair be all right for time being have detailed housemaid a nurse know what to do will come back again in morning see if have recovered sens when etwald took departure major jen sent david to bed in spite of young man remonstrance remained up to talk to arkel for long time jen discussed matter with inspector conversation proved extremely unsatisfactory arkel be not clever detective even keen witted man in case like present difficult involved be quite at loss how to proceed finally major jen dismissed in despair while arkel went to see men who be posted round house clear case of shutting stable door after steed be stolen jen remained alone to think of what must do must be own detective thought pacing library man be fool will find out nothing wo have even satisfaction of burying body of poor lad must do work with assistance of david to find out who stole devil stick be first step to discover who killed maurice be second step to learn who carried away body be third step three very difficult thing to find out see where to begin must learn can about maurice past life for may have enemy of whom know nothing once learn who enemy be if have may discover truth will go sleep when awaken will set to work to solve mystery a spoke major unbarred shutter of window rain have ceased dawn be breaking terrible night be at end be omen said major omen of good chapter xii strange perfume sensation caused by news that dead body of maurice alymer have be stolen be even greater than occasioned by discovery of murder even london paper took up matter sent down reporter to make investigation build up theory a to reason of strange disappearance everywhere people be talking of matter giving opinion a to proper course to be pursued in recovering corpse must be detective haunted road lane around ashantee must have penetrated into park for vigilance of major jen attitude at moment be rather displeasing to friend refused to permit anyone to see chamber whence body have be stolen even declined to discus matter accept advice a to best thing to be done to who spoke to be many have one reply know what be doing must say trifle tartly prefer to keep own counsel if murderer of dear boy can be found will be found by if wretch who stole body can be discovered be man to make discovery how intend to set about be own affair of course busybody who saw well meant meddlesome advice thus rejected be by mean pleased even went so far a to say that shock of death disappearance have unsettled jen reason spoke to david counseled to look well after guardian said also that major if have sens about be doubtful must engage smart london detective to investigate case a have be before stated jen have concluded to be own detective must be conceded that for amateur major set about unaccustomed task in very methodical manner offered reward of five hundred pound for detection of murderer further sum of like amount to anyone who must discover thief who have desecrated chamber of death munificent reward set everybody on alert jen without putting down actual money thus became possessed of hundred of spy who must bring information likely to assist in investigation also major examined servant in house questioned young policeman who have be in kitchen on night when body have be stolen finally paid visit to police office at deanminster where saw mr inspector arkel well arkel said jen after first greeting be over have clew major replied arkel rather gruffly for disappointment be beginning to tell on temper be likely to find until servant of yours regains sens how be now in state of high fever poor soul said jen with depressed look doe nothing rave yet in wild talk never let slip single word likely to help be pity major by way questioned dr etwald about matter be of opinion that man be stunned by blow on head know can only suppose jaggard fell asleep at post woke up in time to see men getting in by window struggle must then ensue must be struck on head a etwald supposes agree with theory there be flaw in yes queried jen eagerly be open to correction please go on will proceed on question answer system said arkel precisely thrash out matter in way be in library on night yes saw be right in house at twelve o clock slept on in chair from hour until three good then between twelve three body must have be stolen be light sleeper heard say major well yes returned jen with thought upon rapping of isabella upon window doe not take much to waken must have heard jaggard call out suppose certainly bedroom be great distance from library door of latter be open then jaggard did cry out precisely said arkel laying forefinger on jen chest with air of triumph did not cry out have be asleep woke up in time to see robber get in by window must have called out at once for assistance true enough rejoined major struck by sensible deduction still might not have heard forcing window doubt that doubt that jaggard like be old campaigner doubt alert sleeper be explained arkel must wake up at least sound yes think must what doe tend to simply to theory have in head jaggard be drugged sir wound at back of head stunned there have cried arkel with nod wound at back of head be caused by falling like log when be drugged h be be building on sand said jen doubtfully even to drug men must have entered by window do not remember when examined window that be opened from inside egad be right then think that someone must have be concealed in room sprung out from hiding to drug jaggard said arkel again one be concealed in room confound man mean to say that jaggard opened window cried jen starting from seat with show of temper ay do major jaggard helped to steal body of mr alymer opened window to admit accomplice when fulfilled task got body out of room turned on jaggard betrayed be drugged knocked down agree with at arkel jaggard be perfectly honest be a devoted to maurice a be to besides even granting possibility of such thing in least why must jaggard accomplice betray ca say returned arkel shrugging shoulder may have be bribed to steal body on accomplishing task did not want to share bribe with jaggard rubbish said jen tartly must have known that must betray when recovered sens doubt in meantime must make scarce jaggard have be insensible raving for over week major scoundrel counted on say again that believe in jaggard honesty agree with said jen putting on hat after see how deduce drugging theory oh a to be once bit of chemist explained arkel when took to see jaggard smelt curious perfume seemed to be hanging about a servant be not likely to use perfume thought curious what kind of perfume ca exactly describe rich heavy deadly sort of thing likely must think to dull sharpest sens did etwald notice asked jen thoughtfully yes professes inability to explain think man be stunned not drugged think on ground have explained that be first drugged then stunned be be queer will have to think over when body be taken out of window arkel thief carried across lawn then down through bush to winding lane suppose said jen know afterward put into cart took away how do know asked major on alert why said arkel fingering fat chin be raining a may remember on night not until after body have be stolen returned jen mindful that isabella have come into library dry shod how do know asked inspector sharply jen be rather taken aback by quickness of query saw that if wished to preserve secret of isabella upon depended reputation behooved to be careful well said cautiously looked out at night when hour be twelve might have rained between time three said arkel with swift interruption believe did rain for see major found mark of wheel in lane must not have be left have not considerable amount of rain fallen did follow trail asked major waiving question of rain rain arkel made gesture of disappointment to high road only said there wheel mark became mixed up with of other vehicle lord know where took body to for once on high road have wide wide world to choose from be devil own mystery said biting finger never met like of before be fairly puzzled why must wretch steal mortal remains of murdered man true said jen why must wretch have murdered that man arkel looked up sharply a to that said be by mean certain that be same follow yet be easy enough if who slew mr alymer wanted body must have stolen on high road where struck down be mere foolishness to venture liberty life in raid upon house may have be afterthought people have afterthought in grim matter of kind said arkel rising well major good by good by must learn anything else will let know depend upon truth of matter be to come from jaggard be honest honest cried jen will stake existence upon when riding homeward after interesting conversation major must not admit to that arkel have brightened up wonderfully in intellect since first taking charge of case man be not brilliant not even clever yet in present instance displayed more readiness of resource than jen must have given credit for theory of drugging be worthy of investigation major determined to see if anything must be discovered likely to support view of matter still held to belief in jaggard honesty for be incredible that old servant of thirty year standing must turn traitor at once thought probable that someone might have taken by surprise drugged a window be closed person in question must have be concealed in room here jen train of thought became confused see how anybody can have be in room reflected a entered house saw that be safe at midnight servant be abed sampson keeping vigil in kitchen jaggard sentry in death room moreover left library door open sound of footstep stealing to door of poor lad must have wakened out of deepest sleep isabella rap be light enough yet be up on instant ca see that devil who drugged man must have be in house yet window opened from inside h be be strange very strange wish jaggard be able to talk sensibly jaggard be far from condition of connected thought coherent word turned tossed upon poor bed with bright eye burning skin babbling tongue head be swathed in bandage housemaid who watched beside have frequently to replace clothes tossed off in violent movement nurse be sickly dark eyed creature who be strongly attached to jaggard be love for made proffer service to look after chained to bedside reported to master that dr etwald have be in morning be coming again in afternoon that there be nothing to be done until delirium have expended ay thought jen a stood by bed until man dy if dy without regaining sens will never know truth bent down to replace bedclothes sick man have thrown off a did so faint perfume sickly rich struck nostril seemed to come from bandage at back of head on bending down for closer inspection jen saw that one of be merest corner peeped out be of finer linen than rest fabric be cambric with start made blood turn to ice in vein jen realized that be woman handkerchief delicacy border embroidery assured of how came here asked housemaid pointing to scrap of linen oh be on first night sir hastened to explain be put on head when in room where fell sir doctor sir say a ai safe to take away yet curtain interposed between head of patient light of window jen drew aside lightly removed outside wrapping of wound housemaid looked on in horror for did not dare to prevent master from meddling yet felt sure that be doing wrong jen be bent on making discovery a to whom handkerchief belonged in few minute have outside bandage removed saw handkerchief discolored with dry blood lying over wound with deft finger lightly touched four corner in one of be initial m d m d said major to margaret dallas mother of isabella how did handkerchief come into room on night perfume struck sense of smell with belief that have smelt before nothing be so strong to awaken memory a odor in le than minute mind of major leaped back to where have smelt before be perfume of dried poison of devil stick chapter xiii isabella discovery at once irritated amazed perplexed major that handkerchief of mr dallas must be bound around head of jaggard be strange that must be perfumed with deadly scent impregnated devil stick be stranger still have mr dallas found wand of sleep have mr dallas perfumed handkerchief with cruel poison have mr dallas drugged stupefied jaggard on fatal night by mean of saturated handkerchief be vital question presented to puzzled major found unable to answer here at point personality of dr etwald intruded into affair be etwald who have bound up wound with handkerchief in question who according to housemaid have forbidden removal question be have received from mr dallas have found on night by side of insensible man if first mr dallas must have perfumed designedly with poison etwald knowing that be so impregnated must have used advisedly a bandage if second mr dallas must have be in room on night in question have used handkerchief to render jaggard insensible in case a major very sensibly concluded mr dallas must be in possession of devil stick otherwise how must have obtained deadly scent plain conclusion of whole affair soliloquized jen be that mr dallas must have stolen devil stick must have murdered maurice must have drugged jaggard for purpose of completing devilish work by stealing poor boy body reason that did not desire maurice for son in law be insufficient motive for commission of triple crime have declined to sanction engagement have forbidden maurice house assisted upon point by social rule have ample power to prevent match a averred be distasteful to why then with power must jeopardize liberty life by thieving devil stick killing man in perplexity jen sought out david asked opinion young lawyer gave very decided verdict in favor of mr dallas believe mr dallas have anything to do with matter said in decisive voice have motive to commit three crime one of be more terrible than other major do think that have nerve brain enough to design accomplish assassination theft assure david handkerchief be hers granted forget that isabella be in room on night might have dropped handkerchief well said jen after pause be not improbable perfume oh replied david with shrug know that scent be ashantee preparation dido grandmother came from ashantee so be just probable that dido knowing secret might have prepared dose of poison even so why must have perfumed handkerchief ca say major have better ask egad will cried jen starting from chair also will find out why needed to prepare poison at in opinion david black jezebel be at bottom of whole affair thieved devil stick prepared poison murdered maurice stole body accused mr dallas of thing five minute ago said david ironically now think know what to think cried jen in desperation dido mr dallas know one of must be guilty will go over to wigwam at once to accuse upon insufficient evidence will see isabella hear what have to say loved maurice will aid to avenge death be improbable if to do so have to betray mother nurse think will learn much in quarter major will learn what can at event retorted jen in unsatisfactory manner conversation concluded david retired to room jen went off to interview isabella at wigwam walked meditatively down to gate here on high road thought led to sudden conclusion respecting coming conversation with miss dallas without much consideration retraced step rapidly sought out david in room then there asked question be of vital importance david said abruptly owing to coming of etwald arkel on night night upon body be stolen mean forgot to ask what reception miss dallas met with on return home who received mr dallas have missed daughter have be seeking for in state of terror surely natural under circumstance found pacing veranda wondering what have become of isabella pacing veranda echoed jen thoughtfully be fully dressed well yes so far a memory serf think be dido saw nothing heard nothing of dido when found mr dallas simply performed mission delivered isabella into hand poor girl be quite distraught with horror of night be led unresistingly to bed by mother mr dallas dressed dido missing said major thank david have told want to know with nod major jen set off for second time to wigwam major be rather inclined to agree with david that must be difficult to learn anything of material value from isabella on night have visited house at three o'clock in morning brain have be unsettled for time being by terrible death have overtaken lover have be thrown into frenzy by mysterious theft of body question major wished answered be whether have be sufficiently to remember event of night especially have taken place prior to escape from wigwam only way to decide doubt be to see girl personally major jen feared lest must find mr dallas dido obstacle to accomplishment of object however fortune favored to state truth fortune rather astonished for upon arriving within ground of mr dallas major met with isabella in light colored dress with sunshade straw hat be strolling down walk led to gate on coming up with jen be surprised to see that manner be calm collected in respect different from displayed during frenzy of midnight visit must hardly believe that be same girl be glad to see major said holding out hand have

abruptly left major side to exchange few word with dido jen a be natural looked after with glance full of doubt suspicion notwithstanding love for maurice expressed desire to avenge death by hunting down assassin appeared to be anything frank in matter in plain word conduct suggested to jen mind idea that knew more than cared to talk about that such half hinted knowledge implicated mother in case

again looked straightly in eye replied with point dryness give clew in direction for must not have looked for thank miss dallas dido will now say good day when will return when have followed to end clew of have be speaking replied jen taking off hat walked swiftly away from house swiftly a be afraid lest isabella must ask indoors for certain reason not unconnected with late conversation did not wish to face mr dallas at present moment there be large issue at stake when vanished round curve of drive isabella with very pale face turned toward dido have told lie wished to tell said hurriedly have hidden from sharp eye of major jen thing wished hidden at cost of honor honesty der noting wrong missy said dido eagerly swear cried isabella with shudder have done enough evil add perjury to other sin ran hastily into house a though to escape further conversation on distasteful subject while dido with eye on ground remained in deep thought old negress knew that be placed in perilous position might be rendered even more so must isabella speak freely of have little fear a by conversation with major jen girl have gone forward on path of concealment whence there be now retreat yet dido be not satisfied did not trust around be uneasy a to what might be result of jen pertinacity in investigating death of maurice disappearance of body thus perplexed occurred to to seek out consult with dr etwald will tell master muttered in own barbaric dialect will tell what to do spirit in voodoo stone will tell having come to resolution went into house to ask rather to demand permission to visit deanminster that be about to call upon etwald negress did not think necessary to tell mr dallas there be matter between doctor of mr dallas knew nothing must not have understood if have known when inquired dido merely hinted that such secret have to do with obi when superstitious nature of mr dallas immediately shrank from pursuing inquiry into what be even to civilized so called christian woman secret mystery while dido go on dark path take way toward etwald in gloomy house at deanminster be necessary to return to doings of major jen on leaving wigwam returned forthwith to own house with intention of repeating to david conversation have taken place between dido isabella on arrival however learned that david have gone out for walk that lady meg brance be waiting for in library at once ever courteous major hastened to apologize to visitor dear lady meg be so sorry to have be absent when called hope have not be waiting long only hour replied lady meg in low grave voice must have waited in case until return a have something important to say to major looked inquiringly at visitor be tall stately woman with fair complexion steady blue eye hair of deep red shade although close on twenty five year of age be still spinster a much to annoyance of mother match making matron have hitherto declined most eligible offer for hand reason for such refusal must not state jen from certain observation have long since guessed truth lady meg be deeply in love with maurice alymer be for sake that remained single whether knew that young man loved isabella dallas be impossible to say at event showed very plainly drift of desire very indifference of alymer have rendered passion more violent persistent what must have be conclusion of one sided love be difficult to conjecture death of maurice have brought other thing to abrupt conclusion lady meg be dressed in black out of regard for dead man looked worn red eyed very dejected in coming forward to greet major fine blue eye lighted up with fire of hope be with something of old impetuosity quenched since death of maurice that gave hand repeated last remark have something to say to said quickly something likely to help in investigation concerning theft of body asked jen eagerly with regard to murder what be will inform in few minute replied lady meg first tell if have found out anything likely to reveal truth jen shook head mournfully be completely in dark so be inspector arkel whole case be profound mystery well mystery even most profound have be cleared up before now major come tell precisely how matter stand may be able to help know something yes do be to tell that something have driven over to day well now major let know about matter from beginning have heard nothing most garbled account be necessary for sake of information be about to impart must know exact truth will tell to replied jen with hesitation be afraid will give pain guess what mean miss dallas jen bent head gravely maurice wanted to marry know know replied lady meg while wave of color passed over fair face do cried jen in surprise who told mr sarby oh major considered moment thought be anything benevolent toward david can guess why told what do mean major never mind at present said jen evasively will tell later on in meantime let state case maurice be killed on high road by mean a verily believe of devil stick know about of course yes read report of inquest have heard rumor agree with major that mr alymer be killed by poison of devil stick go on on night that body be stolen continued jen deliberately jaggard be drugged by whom ca say if knew 'd know who stole body be drugged by mean of perfume be same a impregnating devil stick how do know jen be about to explain when remembered necessity of keeping silent concerning visit of isabella to house ca tell just now said in hesitating manner know for certain well said lady meg must seem that devil stick be center of mystery fancy be if found devil stick must know truth go so far a protested jen if found person who stole devil stick from smoking room might guess truth in case major look at said lady meg produced article from pocket article held up triumphantly before astonished eye of old man devil stick cried by be wonderful devil stick devil stick got from assassin of mr alymer assassin know assassin who be be not woman man battersea chapter xv cross examination major jen sprang to foot with loud cry information that battersea be criminal took so utterly by surprise for moment be tongue tied then when recalled feeble emaciated form of old tramp when recollected weak intelligence altogether declined to believe that creature one so wanting in activity must have conceived executed triple crime theft of devil stick murder of maurice stealing of body battersea have not sufficient craft strength to do such thing with shrug of shoulder major resumed seat must be mistaken lady meg said in quiet voice whosoever may be guilty battersea for physical mental reason must be innocent that must prove replied lady meg dryly in accusing battersea go only on own premise said that man who stole devil stick who have in possession must be guilty person see devil stick there pointed to table well obtained that from battersea how did obtain knowing that collected curiosity came to sell to proof of innocence cried jen promptly if man have be guilty certainly must not offer evidence of guilt for sale where did obtain devil stick out of smoking room presume said lady meg have not questioned a thought best that must examine certainly when can find where be now round at stable with groom brought over with thank lady meg said jen cordially congratulate on presence of mind on courage there be necessity to congratulate at replied other coloring knew that must not be wise to let out of sight after saw devil stick in possession a to courage added carelessly poor old creature be so feeble that even woman must overpower ring bell major have in may be wrong may be innocent if force to confess how obtained possession of devil stick may get at truth perhaps at name of murderer wo be name of battersea said jen touching button of bell have motive to steal devil stick to kill maurice must have reason to take possession of dead body besides added jen returning to seat if tramp be guilty must scarcely put neck in danger by offering devil stick for sale at moment footman appeared in answer to bell in obedience to master peremptory order left room again for purpose of bringing in old battersea for examination while waiting lady meg major spoke a considered truly that nothing further must be said until truth be forced from tramp then present aspect of case might change important step might be taken toward solution of mystery a dirty disreputable a ever battersea rolling cap in dirty hand made appearance on threshold of library conducted by disgusted footman when door be closed behind stood alone before who be about to examine shifted uneasily from one foot to other blinked bleared eye blushed a with shame of guilt through sallow darkness of skin jen with military instinct of command fully awakened within looked sternly at feeble old creature questioned sharply a though be talking to soldier who have done wrong on part lady meg left most part of examination to major listened with anxious look parted lip to word fell from tramp lip death of man whom have loved so deeply have inflicted terrible anguish upon loving heart a tribute to memory be anxious to punish assassin at present influenced by view of major began to waver in opinion regarding guilt of weak brained creature who stood trembling nervously at doorway what be name man demanded jen commencing in orthodox manner battersea sir what else nothin ' else retorted tramp sullenly father be black mother be white be married be brought up in battersea parish so took that name did not havin ' right to name how do get living begs said battersea candidly when ca get nuffin steal be sure of remarked jen taking devil stick off table stole will be bound did found said major in satirical tone found where at missus dallas ' place jen started looked sharply at old man who to appearance be answering question with possible candor be more explicit man said sternly what do mean by mr dallas place house ground groun near gate when did find day arter th ' young genbean be killed why did give up to police battersea scowled wanted money for did said huskily ' must give tin to fur findin pointing to lady meg be fond of pretty thing so guv for five shillin did pay for said lady meg speaking for first time because did not know if have come by honestly tell 'ee found did growled battersea becoming restive under constant questioning found near gate of missus dallas place inside gate asked jen outside on road inside jus ' among grass be comin ' up to get food from missy sowr that 'andle shinin ' in sun go ' look ' fin knowed a perlice wanted 'cause 'eard talk of doin ' murder a perlice must give must guv to added battersea cunningly so keep for 'er ai paid yit concluded with whine of mendicant for moment major jen did not ask more question for very simple reason that did not exactly know what course to take undoubtedly tramp be telling truth have reason to conceal for in own mind jen quite acquitted of complicity in crime so feeble elderly creature debauched by intemperance weak from insufficient food must attack vigorous young athlete like maurice be out of question even though have advantage of possessing devil stick here question of dried up poison occurred to jen if poison have evaporated by lapse of time devil stick must have be innocuous incapable of inflicting death therefore upon evidence of saturated handkerchief bag concealed in turquoise studded handle must have be refilled by dido dido for significant reason that inheriting tradition of ashantee grandmother alone must have be capable of manufacturing deadly drug to prove assumption feasible one devil stick be close at hand jen picked up slightly pressed handle at once turquoise gem indented concealed bag at once iron fang protruded from end of stick on looking closely major at end of spike observed oblong drop of greenish hue evidence of own eye be enough jen replaced devil stick upon table with full conviction that bag have be filled with fresh preparation of original venom discovery to major mind confirmed guilt of negress what be matter asked lady meg a saw major face grow dark with thought be anything wrong yes dido be wrong said always thought that black witch be at bottom of everything be sure of now dido repeated lady meg thoughtfully have heard mr alymer mr sarby talking about negress be not yes murderess major do think certainly do believe killed maurice evidence be a yet too slight upon to accuse if thought that here major checked resumed in altered tone must think of thing later on in meantime must conclude examination of man do think know anything believe found devil stick a say within ground of mr dallas mind well what doe prove prove retorted jen sharply simply that be dropped there by black fiend after have killed maurice do really think killed asked lady meg face growing pale with intensity of excitement do replied jen decisively evidence ah evidence well added after pause have something to go on in refilled devil stick saturated handkerchief understand never mind dear lady will later on retorted jen with nod then turning to battersea resumed examination know negress dido who be in employment of mr dallas asked mildly yes sir ' hawful female be how so well sir battersea scratched shock head know thing a ai good for 'bout devil stick e talk of oh cried jen recalling dido denial know of doe yes sir do arsked 'bout knowed nuffin did what did say to concerning well sir when brought message from dr etwald 'bout devil stick what cried jen interrupting sharply did dr etwald know about also did sir leastways arsked to arsk dido 'bout thought a much said jen in excited tone then after pause added battersea must like free quarter plenty of food drink for week ai fool sir said tramp with sheepish grin must bet in case go down to kitchen tell servant from that be to stay there later on will see thankee sir will get free quarter grub for week cried battersea rubbing grimy hand eye 'ere be oppolance can go now sir at once replied jen pointed to door battersea bowed awkwardly to lady meg benefactor then went out of room left major alone with visitor what doe mean asked meg quite surprised at jen excitement mean cried jen in tone of conviction why etwald be mixed up in business also chapter xvi evidence of jaggard etwald repeated lady meg thoughtfully be not doctor of whom have made so great friend yes took viper to bosom stung replied jen who in excitement be pacing backward forward with hasty step will be even with in way believe be possible to bring home to triple crime do think be guilty be certain of etwald prophesied to poor lad in charlatan way that if wed miss dallas even announced engagement with fate must be of life in death what did mean mean death without addition of life that word be brought in solely to render prophecy if may be called so confusing etwald be in love with miss dallas found in maurice formidable rival warned by pretended prophecy that must slay if persisted standing in path maurice announced engagement upon very day when etwald designing scoundrel went to pay address to girl from moment doomed maurice to death yes truly believe that such be design that offered to buy devil stick in order to carry out criminal intention did ask to buy devil stick demanded lady meg in surprise twice time refused to part with failing to get honestly stole have proof of know so much about retorted jen sharply heard what battersea confessed that have taken message from etwald to dido about devil stick well doctor have mysterious influence over negress what sort of influence know appears to be afraid of believe incited to steal devil stick that by direction filled with fresh poison must prepare special kind of poison required assuredly confessed a much grandmother came from ashantee where devil stick be used for purpose of destroying people dido inherits knowledge of family secret know how to make poison cure nervous headache be perfume of doe dido made with saturated handkerchief to bind round head of young mistress how do know that poison be same from peculiar sickly heavy odor explained jen promptly continued well can see rest for dido filled that devil stick with poison pointed to article on table of remains in wand yet etwald used devil stick to kill maurice on going back to tell dido of success have doubt dropped inside gate of mr dallas ground where a have heard be found by battersea oh be a plain a day to cried jen vehemently etwald killed maurice stole devil stick to accomplish murder have certainly made out strong case against man said meg after pause be theory proof will find will be difficult doubtless hardly anticipated easy task when undertook to learn who killed dear lad besides david will help lady meg sighed rising to foot drew cloak round tall form will help also said sadly be if will accept of help assuredly loved maurice to cost major did not love girl miss dallas added in faltering voice must be very lovely for mr sarby love also woman who have three men at foot must be wonderful jen shrugged shoulder be certainly beautiful said indifferently be not clever weak nature be enslaved by gross superstition of dido must not think from description that be likely to attract maurice said lady meg in low voice undoubtedly loved dearly made gesture of despair moved toward door on threshold paused held out hand good by major must hear anything further will let know tramp will keep here be careful lest go away oh there be fear of said jen in confident tone free quarter plenty of food will keep battersea in kitchen if be guilty of crime must not stay a be will remain under eye intend to question further about connection between dido etwald wonder power doctor hold over negress can learn that only from woman from etwald rejoined jen if can only succeed in having arrested may confess let hope will replied lady meg after shaking hand again with jen took departure when major have seen carriage drive away returned to look after devil stick examined long carefully undoubtedly have be filled with fresh poison undoubtedly poison from evidence heretofore set forth have be prepared by dido jen be more certain than ever etwald negress have stolen devil stick have slain maurice with theft of body be that puzzled must understand why etwald wanted maurice removed from path must explain on ground why devil stick have be stolen what reason must pair have for removal of body poor boy have died corpse must be of use to who have murdered yet have disappeared only person who must give evidence a to who have entered room on fatal night be jaggard up to present moment jaggard have remained incapable of giving clear evidence absolutely certain that etwald be guilty that dido be accomplice jen must not see way to proving case without assistance of jaggard at first thought of going into deanminster for purpose of speaking with inspector arkel about discovery of devil stick upon reflection deemed wiser not to do so at event for present arkel must come only to same conclusion a namely that battersea innocent of crime have picked up devil stick on ground of mr dallas regarding suspicion of etwald major determined to keep to until be in position to prove for if etwald be guilty slightest hint that police be on track must be sufficient to put on guard against so clever man a doctor arkel with clumsy method must hing for present therefore jen decided to hold tongue while major be thus considering what step must take david returning from long solitary walk entered room of late young man have indulged in lonely excursion whence always returned more melancholy than ever fine face be lean worn there be dark circle under eye manner formerly noted for composure be now nervous hesitating on approaching guardian saw devil stick on table at once pale face grew yet paler where did find asked pointing trembling finger at terrible piece of evidence did not find at rejoined major gloomily lady meg brought to have nothing to do with matter replied jen surprised at agitation of young man be battersea who found offered for sale to lady meg brought tramp to battersea said david repeating name in puzzled tone how did become possessed of have anything to do with crime no found devil stick within ground of mr dallas near gate who lost there asked sarby abruptly ah replied jen in meaning tone tell that will have assassin of dear maurice within wall of deanminster jail before year be twenty four hour older david looked at jen in astonishment have idea a to guilty person asked in hurried tone think so be belief david dr etwald killed maurice impossible for what reason because want to marry isabella dallas in case must rather have killed than poor maurice for a suit to isabella be supported by mr dallas be more formidable rival of two think so boy isabella loved maurice to marry must have rebelled against mother daresay if become engaged to etwald will remove also from path there will be need for to do replied david coldly will never marry isabella what do say thought loved girl do love cried david vehemently have always loved will continue to do so until day of death same will never become husband why for certain reason said sarby evasively what be reason ca tell have anything to do with death of maurice ask major must tell if must be impossible jen rose to leave room more wounded than chose to confess of course boy said rather bitterly if choose to withhold confidence from have right to force to speak same a have be second father to think must be more open with must tell if must said david again in rather sullen manner have reason strong reason for not doing so later on paused nervously well demanded jen coldly seeing hesitation of man later on may tell know know repeated jen in startled tone about crime yes know something what be dare not tell now uncle jen added gravely looking at elder if be wise will not pursue inquiry why not may ask david ah said sarby walking toward door will know reason when learn truth after enigmatical remark hurriedly left room for purpose without doubt of escaping further questioning demeanor completely puzzled jen who must not make out meaning of conversation evidently david knew something be unwilling to reveal something might lead to solution of profound mystery enwrapped death of maurice extraordinary disappearance of body more jen thought about matter more perplexed did become recovered devil stick found in ground of mr dallas saturated handkerchief found in bedroom of dead man now unaccountable hint of david that knew something likely to throw light upon mystery joined with equally unaccountable refusal to afford such revelation thing puzzled a be impossible in absence of actual knowledge to come to reasonable decision jen determined to see jaggard see how be if jaggard must only recover sens argued major must be able to say who have stolen body moreover in jen opinion person who committed second crime must most probably by force of analogous reasoning have committed first to major surprise found that jaggard have recovered sens although still weak from accident long insensibility be able to talk fairly well jen be puzzled by sudden be comparatively sudden recovery expressed somewhat forcibly to housemaid anne who have be watching for so long by bedside of sick man woman with shrewdness of class gave opinion a to reason ever since handkerchief have be removed sir said earnestly jaggard have got well do believe sir that scent on kept poor dear stupid light be let in on jen mind here be handkerchief again perfumed with devil stick decoction of poison by dido applied by hand of etwald design be evidently to keep jaggard in state of stupor prevent from making dangerous disclosure dido etwald once more in partnership jen be more convinced than ever that pair be at bottom of whole terrible affair be glad to see that be better jaggard said while standing by bed yes sir thank sir replied man in weak voice be sorry sir must help myself be drugged sir guessed a much said jen grimly who drugged that black devil dido sir replied jaggard faintly guessed a much said major once more chapter xvii story of night exhausted by few word have spoken jaggard fell back on pillow in dead faint seeing that further conversation be impossible at present moment jen left patient to tender attention of anne withdrew to seek david found in melancholy mood pacing up down lawn before window of smoking room on perceiving guardian sarby turned pale for thought that jen have come to continue previous conversation so force confidence first word of major at once undeceived well david said newcomer with significance have made one discovery without help discovery what be know who drugged jaggard have learned who stole body of maurice then know more than do replied david with appearance of truth knowledge extends only to death not to seizure of body refuse to aid said major reproachfully well keep secret may be able to do without help added jen fixing piercing glance on young man notice that ask name of person who drugged jaggard because guess name ah mr dallas said david faintly be mr dallas jen drew back step looked at ward with marked surprise said at length mr dallas have have nothing to do with thought from what said of handkerchief dropped in room that being property of mr dallas have lost there interrupted jen smartly told also that isabella have confessed to having dropped at time of midnight visit now know that told lie isabella lie impossible not at rejoined jen coldly can understand reason for telling lie wanted to shield mother cried david quickly interrupting in turn mind seems to run on mother david said jen looking again at sarby with keen inquisitiveness can prove by chance that committed crime sarby flushed drew back with cold reserve uncle jen ca have suspicion against mr dallas well yes can prove nothing against plea to be mysterious david shortly will insist upon explanation insist repeated young man annoyed by peremptory tone of guardian yes owe to second father to tell truth owe to dead brother memory for assuredly maurice be brother david stared sullenly at ground in moment two lifted head in defiant manner owe much more than can ever repay said in harsh tone same uncle jen can not reveal even to what know if did so must be first to blame understand understand said young man despondently save be most miserable man alive must be if know who killed maurice yet refuse to confess retorted jen with heat will tell truth ask for last time answer for last time that truth be not mine to tell replied david coldly if doubt question etwald what that criminal david looked up quickly how do know be criminal ca give reason must take too long to explain believe out of jealousy killed maurice oh said sarby ironically out of jealousy stole body dido did that dido expression of surprise appeared on pale face of younger man yes dido repeated jen firmly jaggard have just informed that be dido who drugged why did drug to steal body of poor lad why did steal body to conceal crime committed by etwald quite understand listen then will explain resumed major with growing excitement firmly believe that etwald stole devil stick with killed maurice from motive of jealousy precisely a know body be stolen before post mortem examination must be made why be doe not own reason find answer to question replied david still obstinately unconvinced why said jen with nod if post mortem examination have be made trace of poison must have be discovered poison must have be proved a identical with of devil stick thus beyond doubt must have learned that maurice have be killed by devil stick well well repeated jen in irritated tone can not rouse that dull brain of yours to understanding to avert discovery to prevent analysis of poison in body dido under direction of dr etwald committed third crime why must dido act so under etwald because man have power over what power may be know more than do although added jen with afterthought may be able to explain have idea why dido must serve etwald evidently be impossible to extract information from so impenetrable man jen be thoroughly enraged by display of obstinacy in quarter where least expected to find usually sweet tempered especially toward boy major quite lost control of passion at moment take care david said in angry manner be forcing to believe that be acting in way from unworthy motive be duty to aid in discovering punishing murderer of maurice yet leave to do work refuse assistance in way unless alter manner take into confidence regarding reason of strange behavior breach not easily mended may occur between paused waiting for ward to make reply in defense of conduct young man moved spoke paler than usual stood before major with eye on ground more in sorrow than in anger jen looked at then turned on heel with shrug walked into house david looked after with quivering lip if only knew truth said wiping perspiration from face what must say what must do blame now must blame then in meantime while sarby be indulging in enigmatical soliloquy major jen be pursuing way toward room of jaggard despairing of obtaining information from david thought possible to learn truth at event of fatal night from jaggard honestly speaking major be puzzled by conduct of ward hitherto have always considered david to be honest man at present time conduct savored of duplicity did know of anything relative to triple crime have be committed if so why did not speak finally be david also under fatal influence of dr etwald man who jen verily believed be source of woe to none of question must major find feasible answer therefore for time being ie pending narration of jaggard dismissed from mind be possible that story of invalid might throw light on darkness overshadowed case a jen anticipated found that jaggard have recovered from faint having have sleep during long absence of master be much better a usual anne ill favored housemaid be watching by bedside on sign from jen left room finding alone with servant jen addressed immediately to business in hand do feel stronger jaggard asked much stronger sir be able to talk think so major for hour at least hour will be sufficient said major in serious voice wish to tell took place on night be drugged about dido sir yes jaggard about dido invalid remained silent for time then began to speak slowly with little difficulty after left sir said in weak voice remained seated in chair beside bedside of poor young master if remember there be only one candle in room be placed on table little distance away examined window found closed be sure of demanded jen anxiously quite sure sir be bolted barred door be simply closed for never thought of locking a fancied sir that might return after midnight to see if be right did not however jaggard fell asleep in library after mr sarby have gone to bed of course have confidence in please say that major said jaggard imploringly a did best be not fault that dido drugged be sure know why did so continued jaggard half to never did harm major looked fixedly at man do not know what occurred during time be insensible asked gravely sir have only got wit about now have not anne told have told anything sir well said jen seeing that man spoke in good faith body of mr maurice be stolen on night body stolen repeated jaggard in amazement for why sir ca tell can anybody else know be that at three o'clock in morning entered mr maurice room found window open body gone insensible window open said jaggard thoughtfully then must have be opened from inside sir by dido doubt be certain of major be that black witch who stole body how did get into room be hidden under bed sir under bed be sure said jen greatly startled by information yes major be way be seated by bed at foot of with face to door window a said be locked must not have got in at window have entered by door must have seen besides added jaggard in faint voice grabbed from behind from behind yes sir be not quite asleep kind of dozing in chair know what be made sleepy a be wideawake when left sir there be kind of heavy sleepy smell about know know devil stick perfume well sir smell made sleepy though heard noise behind must not turn head be just a if in nightmare sir then black arm of witch came from behind grabbed at throat held handkerchief with stuff on to nose ah said jen to knew that isabella be speaking falsely go on jaggard added aloud why did not call out must sir felt a in dream turned tried to fight pushed over fell like log think must have hit head on corner of bed for felt cruel pain at back of did wound head jaggard after fall remembered more sir not till to day know what mean sir be sure know how dido got into room ah be what wish to learn well if remember sir dido called to see day yes to ask if must see mistress most unnecessary question be blind sir when left room believe left house what make think so sir took dido out to door while be telling to go away dr etwald came out told must see after left alone now sir said jaggard with emphasis do believe a dr etwald took black jade to room of mr maurice hid under bed chapter xviii devil stick thief long conversation have somewhat exhausted jaggard who be yet weak so telling to cease from talking jen recalled housemaid left room to think over that have learned story of jaggard convinced more than ever that dr etwald be cause of terrible event have occurred within last few week without doubt be who have treacherously hidden dido in chamber of death after drugging jaggard negress doubt have opened window to admit etwald between precious pair have carried off dead body for what reason jen must not determine to learn truth thought advisable to call at wigwam interrogate dido with evidence of jaggard to go on major felt satisfied that must by threatening with arrest force into confessing whole nefarious plot who have thieved devil stick who have slain maurice who have

one moment miss dallas what influence have etwald over negress isabella shuddered be possessor of voodoo stone said in low voice voodoo stone echoed jen much puzzled what may be be small black pebble of peculiar shape explained girl be brought from africa to barbadoes over hundred year ago negro believe that spirit dwells in stone that when be worshiped indwelling devil can work woe to against whom possessor of stone bear malice can have idea how talisman be venerated by black will go mile to look on to adore must burn down city to posse to gain must murder hundred human being well dr etwald be in barbadoes year ago gained possession of voodoo stone have used while here to intimidate dido while hold will not dare to disobey plotting assassination designed to bring about marriage with dr etwald have be designed by carried out by dido solely on account of ownership of voodoo stone know that call 'great master ' well now can guess reason for service worship of man yes assented jen turning sharp eye on isabella do believe in voodoo stone also when be child did fancy that mother also have belief in brought up among negro of barbadoes imbibed superstition of black race now

a old servant will not let go see about theft of devil stick oh on night be stolen be seated on veranda after dinner saw mother come out with dido did not know be there a sat in shade saw dido speak

witch have hypnotized mr dallas yes did not know that until later on when mother disappeared dido re entered house at once terrified by mother action ran down little path lead to gate followed out onto road went into ground by postern in wall saw cross lawn enter smoking room wherein lamp be burning when came out be with devil stick in hand recognized by golden handle reached home before did again hid on veranda dido reappeared a mother came up walk took devil stick from then led indoors what did do asked jen much interested in strange history went in later on found that mother have gone to bed said nothing at time a be afraid of dido afterward when maurice be killed said that devil stick have killed went to dido accused her of crime be fearfully angry warned that if said word about theft of devil stick must be in danger of hanging own mother what cried jen jumping up did dido accuse mother of crime to yes to mother afraid lest accusation must kill mother who be not strong a know said nothing to indeed to anyone told lie to to save mother what else must do now tell truth wish to protect against evil of dido dr etwald believe that dr etwald killed maurice be sure of when became ill through terror of secret possessed dido prepared that poison under pretense of curing now know that did so to refill devil stick then sent to etwald killed maurice also stole body with assistance of dido why must pair of wretch steal body know more than do said isabella with great despondency now major jen can understand not speaking truth at last interview yes honor for said jen kissing hand tell one thing why did make midnight visit well be not quite major in first place in second missed dido on night asked jen eagerly yes be ill a have said mother be watching by bedside usually be dido who doe so asked mother about dido said that dido have asked permission to go out for evening to see dr etwald suppose thought so at first one of servant who brought cup of tea late at night told that dido have gone to house to offer service in laying out body of dear maurice oh said major suddenly recollecting what have taken place remember visit gave a excuse that wanted to see one of lie said isabella vehemently did not know have gone to house until servant told then when remembered how devil stick have be stolen be afraid lest dido must be contriving further mischief although be late must not rest in bed tossed turned with brain burning with fever felt that must learn what be taking place at house mother left about two o'clock in morning quite worn out with watching then rose put on dressing gown escaped by window reached library at three o'clock know rest yes assented major with nod know that a imagined dido be up to mischief stole body with etwald why why muttered jen in perplexed tone can not guess said isabella for second time now have told major what do intend to do return to house see etwald be there expect at noon along with inspector arkel then may force truth out of certainly will have arrested on suspicion of murder dido will take step concerning at present said jen glancing at watch especially a there be fear of leaving neighborhood replied isabella interpreting major thought while voodoo stone be with dr etwald will not leave place where be staying in case will have to live in deanminster jail for there a sure a be living man etwald will find before twelve hour be over head now dear young lady added jen rising must leave to keep appointment with scoundrel speak of conversation to anyone can depend upon silence said isabella who held out hand major jen shook in usual kindly manner moved step toward door of summer house at once paused looked back one moment miss dallas said quickly doe david know about theft of devil stick be added more precisely doe know that mother stole isabella considered can not be quite certain if doe said after pause fancy have idea of when have seen of late have always be so nervous silent at last meeting also told that be to fear nothing h be said jen reflectively undoubtedly be right miss dallas david must have learned truth in way can not imagine how well good by good by will see later on when have scoundrel under lock key major hurried off leaving isabella alone in summer house walked on slowly notwithstanding that be past hour have appointed to meet arkel etwald thought be busy with what isabella have said concerning david knowledge of trick undoubtedly belief that mr dallas killed maurice thought jen be why refuse to confess to said must be first to blame for telling knew a be under delusion that mr dallas be guilty understand now reason of silence also said that must never marry isabella show that be afraid of becoming husband of woman whose mother have committed crime poor boy how must suffer after must say that approve of honorable silence added major to when know that mr dallas be innocent etwald be guilty will then be able to marry isabella on consideration jen thought must be best to say nothing definite to david about discovery if young man from feeling of honor toward unhappy woman kept silent major be last person in world to tempt to break jen decided to merely hint to david that knew truth let arrest of etwald tell own tale unseal lad lip by showing that mr dallas be innocent a jen came to conclusion entered own gate rather to surprise saw david considerably agitated advancing to meet inspector arkel dr etwald be waiting for in library said sarby rapidly know sent for sent for well why not wish first to arrest second arrest dr etwald on what ground on ground of having murdered maurice said jen coldly yes may look astonished david be truth without assistance have discovered that etwald be guilty also added major in kindly tone know reason of silence of ray silence echoed david know reason yes honor for who who told stammered young man a pale a death miss dallas isabella god david looked terrified chapter xx strange request before jen have time to inquire meaning of david strange exclamation young man have turned on heel be walking rapidly back to house surprised by behavior suspicious of reason major called out to to stop without taking notice young man increased pace be soon lost to sight still marveling jen went after on entering library found that only arkel be present where be dr etwald demanded major anxiously went few minute ago to see servant replied inspector rising alone mr arkel why major mr sarby be with jen started evidently david have returned before in order to see etwald to gain private speech with doctor have conducted to jaggard sick room for moment jen still suspicious of sarby behavior have in mind to follow few minute of reflection convinced that be unnecessary david did not know conversation have taken place between isabella therefore must inform etwald of nothing new indeed major wondered why david wished to speak privately with doctor looked to mind a though two men be in league will find out what mean after have have speech with arkel said jen to doctor can not escape if david have understanding with will force to confess there can be harm in leaving together for few minute in jen be wrong a be only amateur detective can not be blamed very severely for negligence at particular moment acted a thought for best therefore hastened to explain to arkel position of affair before return of dr etwald afterward when matter of accusation arrest be settled intended to have speech with david insist upon explanation of young man mysterious behavior thus did situation present to inexperienced eye well never mind dr etwald just now said aloud pointing to chair have duty to perform have mine sit down mr arkel suppose wonder why have sent for well major presume be in connection with case be right wish to know if have discovered anything new yes messenger battersea be wandering about ground on night battersea cried jen thunderstruck did see body carried off did not see taken out of house explained arkel referring to note held in hand saw put into carriage carriage yes be waiting in winding lane at foot of ground two people carried body between man woman battersea can not give name can however said jen grimly oh be just a thought be name major asked arkel anxiously will give name later on mr inspector in meantime be good enough to conclude report of battersea confession interest deeply thought must replied arkel with look of satisfaction well battersea wondered at body being put into carriage did know that be alymer corpse interrupted jen sharply guessed a much from circumstance that body be carried through ground to lane where carriage be waiting know major that tramp be rather stupid be not easy thing for to put two two together on occasion however discovered that made four replied major dryly well man woman put body into carriage closed carriage suppose yes assented arkel with nod brougham doctor brougham what cried inspector with look of surprise have scamp told have told nothing please go on well said arkel making invariable beginning when body be placed in carriage door closed woman went away in what direction returned through ground where went battersea doe not know do however muttered jen divining that dido have taken usual route back to wigwam man mounted carriage box drove off appears that there be coachman wonder at rejoined major precious pair be afraid to trust infernal secret to third party doubt horse being quiet be left to stand in deep shadow of lane while robber stole corpse however understand woman went away man mounted box suppose drove off with corpse also with battersea added arkel with significant smile seems that tramp wished to see end of singular adventure doubt wished to make money out of by blackmailing see suppose hung on behind yes like street arab be one once know major have not forgotten early habit well be driven with carriage to deanminster quite so into gloomy courtyard surround house of dr etwald added major jen with satisfied smile battersea saw doctor take body out of carriage carry into house then on return etwald mean unharnessed horse put into stable also carriage into coach house be that not so mr arkel battersea told stammered arkel amazed at insight assure told nothing be a clever a battersea can put two two together next day battersea went to etwald did not tried to blackmail clever doctor compelled to keep silent be quite true assented inspector thunderstruck though how guessed can not say a know so much perhaps can tell one thing more bother not little how did dr etwald compel battersea to keep silence very easily said jen with shrug battersea be half negro black race adore voodoo stone of dr etwald be possessor etwald simply threatened battersea with vengeance of voodoo stone if spoke therefore held tongue be forced to confess only by threatening to have arrested a murderer of mr alymer did threaten how know know great many thing mr inspector for instance know that woman who assisted dr etwald to steal body be dido negress of mr dallas also that dr etwald be murderer a well a thief heaven if have only known must have have warrant altered what cried jen with expression of ferocious joy lighting up face have warrant for arrest of etwald yes on charge of stealing body only took out after hearing evidence of tramp battersea very good then can take out warrant for arrest a murderer after hearing evidence can prove guilty jen rose to foot stretched out one hand toward arkel swear on sacred honor maurice alymer be killed by max etwald at moment door of library opened slowly dr etwald calm composed appeared on threshold behind over shoulder peered pale countenance of david from ironical look on doctor face must appear that have overheard accusation of major be prepared to treat with contempt that such be case appeared by first word issued from mouth a faced accuser hear name of max etwald coupled with crime of murder be way treat guest major be not guest retorted jen furiously rather victim seeing that have lured into trap be not to see jaggard that asked here rather to force if can into confessing that be guilty of triple crime make one slight mistake sir said jen coldly accuse of two crime not of three ah be lenient replied etwald shade of surprise passing over feature surprise be reflected in agitated face of david sarby well sir let hear of what be accused with utmost coolness entered room sat down in chair near arkel inspector with hand in breast pocket fingered warrant did not deem wise to execute until have heard what proof major possessed against etwald for murder of maurice alymer david sat down near door followed movement of scene ensued with keen eye thus three of occupant of room be seated sarby arkel etwald only one man stood up major jen stood a accuser dr etwald said major with great calmness deliberation be clever ambitious man who wish to make way in world have hitherto failed to do so for lack of money to procure money for experiment in chemistry must do anything even marry rich woman murder man formerly engaged to retorted etwald with pale smile go on major jen see mark be aiming at found rich match here resumed jen without noticing interruption in person of miss dallas already engaged to late mr alymer also loved by mr sarby said doctor coolly will come to later on if please said major making gesture to david to be silent loved wanted rival mr alymer out of way to do so have devil stick stolen ho ho by whom by mr dallas mr dallas cried david starting from seat did steal devil stick must seem so from veracious history major be telling said etwald with irony mr dallas stole devil stick resumed jen imperturbably gave to dido who by direction filled with fresh poison dido gave newly prepared weapon of death to with killed poor boy at very gate of girl loved really said etwald with pointed satire be a cruel a afterward stole body of man murdered dido helped to do so drugged servant jaggard with perfume of devil stick poison in order that theft might be carried out with safety must seem dido have great deal to do with matter said etwald looking up to roof have everything to do with will be brought up against a witness indeed then appears that be to be arrested can answer broke in arkel amazed at self possession of man have here warrant to arrest for stealing body of maurice alymer etwald glanced over warrant smiled how can prove did so demanded by evidence of tramp battersea battersea repeated doctor for first time frowned yes saw place body in brougham with assistance of dido followed to deanminster saw take body into house really evidence be circumstantial have searched house intend doing so be afraid will have trouble for nothing rejoined etwald coolly moreover ca arrest without actual proof can arrest on suspicion said arkel rising with warrant arrest now in queen name on what charge on charge of stealing body of maurice alymer oh then said etwald turning toward jen be not to be accused of murder later on friend cain said major grimly will have quite enough to do to save neck from halter be afraid so indeed major therefore must have assistance there be nothing like being provided in time with counsel for defense therefore must ask mr david sarby to defend from absurd charge cried david starting up with pale cheek defend assuredly replied etwald fixing piercing glance on young man do refuse of course doe cried jen wrathfully david raised head looked at major at doctor at inspector no said in firm voice to three accept will defend max etwald chapter xxi nine day wonder great be astonishment throughout neighborhood when became known that dr etwald clever physician of deanminster have be arrested on double charge of murder theft of dead body who did not like be majority rejoiced openly that assassin of maurice alymer have be found in etwald person there be regretted so brilliant man must be consigned to felon cell possibly in hereafter to felon doom opinion for against prisoner be held by good people of deanminster surrounding neighborhood there be doubt of one thing trial of max etwald at assize must be great sensation of year major jen worked hard to procure evidence against prisoner david sarby worked just a hard to obtain material for defense attitude taken up by young barrister astonished everybody be universally condemned that who might almost be called brother of dead man must defend assassin of such brother be almost incredible of belief people be astonished angered by very idea when idea became known to be actual fact conduct of david be disapproved of on side only one man said nothing that man be very person who have best right to speak while talked major jen remained silent reticence on subject caused almost a much scandal a david inexplicable conduct yet jen knew what be about be acting merely in accordance with agreement have made with sarby after memorable interview in library when etwald be accused arrested arkel took away prisoner in custody by virtue of warrant left major jen alone with counsel for defense assassin so called inspector arkel left room left house when sound of etwald carriage for went to deanminster jail in own brougham have died away in distance jen who have hitherto kept silence raised head looked at david well sir said in icy tone to adopted son be waiting for to explain very extraordinary conduct david replied in equally a cold manner major jen have explanation to give what cried guardian rising do dare to sit there tell that be traitor coward ungrateful man traitor echoed david with flush rising in pale cheek yes sir traitor to foster brother who be rival be because maurice loved woman who hate that act unworthy part of defending murderer very good major understand why be traitor coward be coward in submitting to influence of base assassin cried jen enraged by calmness of young man a ungrateful man do want explanation of term whom have loved brought up a own son can understand anger from point of view point of view point of view raged jen stamping from point of view of world sir what will everyone say when learn that intend to defend etwald will say almost a cruel thing a have said returned david still composed care for opinion of public act according to dictate of own conscience jen drew back stared at young man in angry surprise own conscience repeated in disdain how can talk in manner what excuse can have excellent excuse interrupted david rising what be if may be so bold a to ask refuse to tell at present indeed be ever to learn reason of extraordinary behavior david considered yes major said at length will learn reason at trial at trial will explain when make speech for defense what do mean cried jen curiosity getting better of anger be possible that believe in innocence of man a counsel for defense can hardly expect to answer that a adopted father demand answer will have sir at trial obstinacy marvelous composure of young man be not without due effect on major jen drew back after few moment consideration spoke in seriousness david said quietly there be something very extraordinary in behavior refuse to give reason therefor if wait until trial will explain yes have already told so in speech for defense will be fully satisfied that have good cause to act a be doing very good said jen calmly then will say nothing to one about very curious behavior will work hard to secure condemnation of scoundrel can do best to save against for will not open mouth at trial will expect explanation will have added jen raising head a until explanation be enemy although not openly so will require to leave house expected that must do so rejoined david bowing head indeed can act in other way to day will take lodging in deanminster wait for trial will defend etwald to best of ability then can decide whether be fit to re enter house ca understand sir said jen with sigh reason may be feel sure that will not approve of approved of reason before major will approve of again in meantime until trial let remain stranger bowed without offering hand be very probable major jen must have refused to take left room when door closed older man sank into chair passed hand across brow moist with perspiration there can be only one explanation muttered david be mad result of conversation be that david took up residence in deanminster near jail saw etwald frequently about defense doctor assured that possessed sufficient power over dido by reason of owning voodoo stone to prevent from becoming witness against sarby be satisfied that if dido did not appear to give evidence case for prosecution must fall through be only witness of whom barrister prisoner have fear on part major jen together with arkel built up strong case against man whom fully believed to be culprit search have be made in etwald house trace of dead body must be found disappearance be almost a profound mystery a reason have induced etwald to steal reason for theft of devil stick for murder of maurice be plain enough what have induced doctor to make away with corpse one must discover etwald even to counsel be silent on subject arkel have sought out a witness against etwald seven person first mr dallas who be to prove that be hypnotized frequently by dido second isabella who be to depose that before murder mother have be sent by dido to ashantee to steal devil stick while under influence of hypnotism third battersea who be to give evidence that have found devil stick within ground of mr dallas fourth lady meg who be to prove offer of battersea to sell stick fifth major jen who must explain engagement of dead man to miss dallas rivalry of assassin sixth jaggard whose evidence must tend to show that dido have drugged for purpose of stealing body seventh most important witness of dido who be to depose to manufacture of poison refilling of devil stick giving of to dr etwald so that might perpetrate crime with seven witness jen did not see how etwald must escape gallows be certain that people will speak out asked major of arkel when list be submitted to be certain of save one replied arkel in dissatisfied tone worst of be that dido be one doe refuse to give evidence against etwald must think so simply because be holder of voodoo stone can force by threat to give evidence said jen angrily think so must be legal answered arkel only chance of getting negress to confess to whole truth be for to gain possession of stone where be etwald carry on watch chain saw other day in prison showed to common little black stone be dido must kill with pleasure to get kill etwald ejaculated jen then after pause added believe be right arkel for be not man care about stone however will see isabella make persuade dido to speak against etwald major went at once to wigwam notwithstanding eloquence in spite of tear implorings of isabella negress positively declined to say word against great master while dat big man hab de voodoo stone in ' notin ' said from obstinate position failed to move when major jen departed isabella mother be in despair failing proving of crime against etwald accusation might be made against mr dallas result must be brought about by dido did choose spell of voodoo stone be on refused to say anything likely to inculpate master why get voodoo stone if adore so much cried mr dallas exasperated by obstinacy dido opened shut hand convulsively ah if hab dat voodoo stone be great great de queen ob de debbles let go go see dr etwald tell will give evidence against unless give stone suggestion came from isabella of dido took notice without word to mother daughter who be in tear left room in afternoon be nowhere to be found mr dallas isabella came to conclusion that have fled to avoid being forced into giving incriminating evidence fell into one arm be beside with terror evil done by dido etwald seemed likely to fall upon innocent head still there be hope said isabella recognizing occasion for prompt action will speak to major jen ask to send police after wretched woman opinion be at once acted upon messenger be sent to ashantee major jen be from home be not until six o'clock that presented at wigwam heard story of dido flight ca be very far away said jen hopefully saw in deanminster thought have gone there with message from cried mr dallas wringing hand will catch train there go to london oh why did stop wish have known said jen rather dismayed to find fine case against etwald breaking down even if have forced into court must not have given evidence against holder of voodoo stone dat so said hoarse voice at door three people turned saw dido with expression of triumph on dark face enter room dido cried isabella did not run away missy tell de truth against dat man voodoo stone said jen wondering what meant dido opened clenched fist voodoo stone lay in palm of hand chapter xxii for defense how became possessed of voodoo stone dido refused to say jen have learned from inspector arkel etwald wore talisman on watch chain wondered in what fashion dido have contrived to penetrate into prison to obtain from doctor whole result of trial depended upon transfer of stone if etwald kept dido must not dare to give evidence against so in absence of incriminating detail must go free a be stone be now in possession of dido for reason jen be unable to fathom be quite content to betray share in plot by changing hand voodoo stone have transformed dido into traitress however a advantage derived from transfer be on side of prosecution jen did not think wise to inquire too closely into mean dido have employed to regain talisman saw nothing of david who pointedly kept out of way made inquiry of dido simply informed inspector that negress be ready to explain etwald secret without telling why be willing to do so majesty judge on circuit came to deanminster court be formally opened after trivial case have be disposed of trial of

creole stared at in surprise a for moment must grasp idea that have be bold enough to present before whom have so deeply wronged ah said etwald a complacently a ever thought must find here major hardly expected to see mr dallas villain cried that lady starting from seat do think want to see after misery have caused why refuse even to remain in same room with with furious gesture creole swept past etwald out of door banged loudly etwald looked at door shrugged shoulder turned politely to major be just a well be gone said quietly be better that conversation must be private wish to hold conversation with scoundrel sir cried jen purple with rage follow example of mr dallas if please etwald looked round for chair selected most comfortable sat down with great deliberation never follow one example major said dryly be always custom to act independently will have turned out of house in case will never hear what have come to tell what be sir demanded jen in calmer tone truth bah heard that in court indeed did such thing retorted etwald coolly story be quite different to of dido david be different also know story true story mind differs even from david will hear major will leave house before suffer disgrace of being kicked out major considered for few moment before replying there be hinted mystery in manner of etwald puzzled not little what demeanor might mean be anxious to learn moreover wished to know actual fact of case now that dido have fled etwald be only one who must tell acting upon consideration jen sat down again in chair sulkily gave etwald permission to remain explain doctor proceeded to do at once a be aware said calmly escaped charge of murder very right too seeing be innocent of crime a to stealing of body be guilty where be body wretch pardon said etwald raising hand in protest if interrupt call name will tell nothing to proceed added seeing major held peace be out on bail must come up for trial soon on charge spoke of however be not afraid a can defend in manner little dream of being out on bail came to see to tell more lie to tell truth dear major assure that truth will surprise not little what be demanded jen in fever of excitement patience patience will tell when time come by way major dido have fled know be afraid of hardly replied jen trifle spitefully have lost voodoo stone remember yes be taken advantage of for once in life cunning woman dido got permission to see in prison to talk to alone under pretense of telling about evidence knowing must compel to do what wished by mean of voodoo stone saw with pleasure a be intention to put word likely to get off to prove innocence into mouth however while be talking to suddenly produced phial of devil stick poison threw in face of course instantly became unconscious be then that wrenched talisman off watch chain be poison so quick in effect then must think so said etwald coldly saw how david fell in court after wounding hand fell in prison quite a quickly a skin be not scratched drug took effect only through nostril recovered when recovered jailer told that dido have called in saying that have fainted while be getting round took hour dido went off with voodoo stone about prison have reason to detain so left when found voodoo stone gone added etwald impressively knew that black wretch must give evidence against that game be at end expected to be hanged suggested jen well replied doctor with wonderful coolness did not expect that if worst came to worst knew must protect must admit that confession of counsel mr sarby took somewhat by surprise poor david sighed jen thinking of young man cut off in bloom of youth poor david echoed etwald with sneer foolish david might say to die for sake of woman yet risked death for same woman risked danger for woman fortune retorted etwald with revolting candor be money wanted death did not risk that be not so sure of etwald how did know that david must confess in so dramatic fashion did not know major a said before confession took by surprise still a be innocent knew must not be hanged well said jen growing weary of long continued conversation seemed to lead to nothing at event will not escape long term of imprisonment why said etwald with agreeable smile there be two opinion about mine be that will go free then added coolly intend to seek barbadoes search for black witch in order to recover voodoo stone hope will get chance of going doubt however if do get a far a west indie will find friend there really particular friend know if will consider so mr dallas daughter go back to estate in barbadoes within month really said etwald again then may marry after wo have oh think so have mean of compelling to marry jen jumped up with scowl be tired of enigma cried angrily what be wish to tell name of person who committed murder know david sarby not at all accused to shield real person to shield assassin gasped jen thunderstruck who be assassin ca guess from self accusation why woman loved isabella exactly isabella dallas none other killed boy maurice chapter xxiv final surprise isabella killed maurice said jen pushing back chair impossible doctor must be mistaken think so replied etwald dryly saw do so did david must be mistaken insisted major once more david be in london on night when crime be committed by own confession in court david be in ground of mr dallas on night yes yes be right said jen in bewildered tone still can not believe that isabella killed maurice loved dearly have reason to murder none in world yet certainly took life why not said etwald coolly mr dallas have reason to steal devil stick yet without reason believe ah be hypnotized did not act of own free will precisely case with isabella said doctor nodding come major wo worry longer with inquiry dido hypnotized daughter to commit crime a have willed mother to steal devil stick isabella be absolutely ignorant of what did firmly believed be guilty person now of course think david by own confession be assassin david confessed guilty to save of course isabella doe not know that think on face of with reason david killed maurice out of jealousy how be david saw crime committed will explain said etwald david found out that maurice be going to meet isabella night secretly in ground of mr dallas near gate determined to see meeting to learn if there be hope for feigned journey to london in order to lull suspicion maurice might have that be being watched instead of going however concealed at spot where must see gate opened onto highway now added etwald with side glance at major so happened that also wished to see that meeting how did know be about to take place learned fact from dido who advised of went on in dallas household a may guess well saw david in place of concealment guessed reason for coming maurice appeared at rendezvous shortly afterward isabella under hypnotic influence came down avenue in hand held devil stick came swiftly toward maurice not understanding deadly weapon with be armed came to meet with outstretched arm thrust devil stick before wounded in palm of hand with cry fell dead within gate asked major much agitated yes within gate responded etwald when isabella have struck blow dropped devil stick in grass where if remember be afterward found by battersea then returned to house by little path lead thereto through surrounding tree body lay in bright moonlight full in center of path not stonethrow from high road david rushed simultaneously from hiding place explained hurriedly that body must not be found in ground understood carried body onto road before have time to deliberate what be to be done heard noise of approaching footstep afraid of of being accused of crime fled then came down road discovered corpse yes heard poor lad cry said jen simply ran down at once must have be very quick in movement there be ample necessity for prompt action replied etwald with dryness a david wished to be arrested now can understand how be that david refused to reply to question agreed to defend understand said poor lad must approve of reason when knew now that have explained motif quite agree with saying to protect poor girl to save from suffering for crime did not commit must have acted in other fashion still wish of have be more open with be afraid must have be impossible major said etwald rising be so distracted over death of maurice so unjust in hatred of that must have be dangerous to trust be unjust in hatred of demanded jen getting on foot think not dr etwald desire to marry isabella rather fortune have be cause of ill dido be only instrument whom compelled to work by mean of voodoo stone betrayed in end be punishment blame so much a do alone be responsible for death of two poor lad of mine well have own way said etwald carelessly be scoundrel in eye dare say if will permit to see to morrow at eleven o'clock will be able to prove that particular devil meaning major be not quite so black a have painted never want to set eye on again said jen bluntly will after midday to morrow will regret if grant interview what do wish to say will tell to morrow ca say now major jen ca sha retorted etwald tartly if be wise will arrange to let come here to morrow at eleven meet mr dallas daughter of will refuse to meet saw dallas to day how behaved like fool be said doctor putting on hat well be going will see to morrow morning yes know what possible thing can find to say to after interview a make such point of will see ask mr dallas daughter to be present yes will try get to come very good etwald walked toward door there struck by sudden thought looked back of course will not tell isabella that killed mr alymer said hurriedly not at present said jen after moment thought later

good by for present good by said jen a door closed behind doctor muttered may devil go with for greater scoundrel doe not exist later on in day jen sent letter to wigwam asking mr dallas to come with daughter next morning at eleven o'clock did not explain that dr etwald must be present a knew temper of mr dallas might be at stake even if be to own interest must refuse to meet man toward whom bore so strong hatred therefore jen decided to be diplomatic keep silent a to visit of etwald during afternoon note be brought to jen in mr dallas promised to come to bring isabella very good said jen to that matter be settled etwald confound will obtain desire wonder what want to see about in spite of conjecturing major found unable to answer question therefore like wise man possessed in patience until next morning most of night passed in room where poor david be laid out for be determined that time body must not be stolen a pondered during long silent hour reflected that have lost opportunity of forcing dr etwald to say what have done with body of maurice have not be found in house notwithstanding questioning etwald with changeless smile have refused to state where be must have wrung truth from villain to day thought jen a paced room to morrow to morrow sha leave house until confesses what have done with remains of poor boy ghoul that be wretch scoundrel toward morning jen slept for hour so when rose have taken bath felt much refreshed ready to face etwald at final interview at eleven o'clock mr dallas arrived with isabella latter looking wan ill even have major not promised to be silent must not have brought to tell poor girl truth at moment after be perfectly innocent have committed crime unwittingly dido be culprit not isabella major felt profound pity for miserable girl

absolutely ignorant of part have played in affair still to make certain jen asked why have not kept appointment have nervous headache said quickly dido hypnotized when woke up be too late to see maurice remark put matter beyond doubt girl by own admission have be hypnotized by negress while in trance state with will at mercy of other woman have killed lover morally speaking be dido in person of isabella who be assassin however major have learned that wished to know not wishing to pursue subject turned conversation by explaining that etwald be coming in few minute mr dallas rose up in cold fury did ask here to insult major asked here at particular request of dr etwald why what can have to say to mother cried isabella in surprise miss dallas know more than do evidently desire to make clean breast of whole miserable business have heard quite enough about said mr dallas marching toward door refuse to meet that monster of iniquity be too late for before must escape from room dr etwald a smiling composed a ever entered door placed quietly before enraged mr dallas go madam said quietly have something to show what be asked mr dallas curiosity like of major getting better of

london thence be intention to go abroad a told at last meeting will never see again when finish letter will doubt be glad of be just a well that must remain beyond reach be virtuous man be not nature must prevent ever assimilating one with other a to promised explanation here be much good may do be a know physician be also what may not know man of genius have brain money for experiment in chemistry money regret to say be extremely necessary being case have needed money that in large quantity life a must not make for not having mercantile instinct resolved to gain by making rich marriage for many year have traveled world like ulysses have known men city year ago chance deity at whose shrine always pay devotion led to barbadoes while there be attracted a always be by weird mysterious by superstition of african race studied cult of obi belief of voodoo stone by strange train of circumstance need not relate gained possession of powerful talisman be known to negroid america with stone in possession be king so to speak of black race power determined to use to own advantage through to make rich marriage discovered that mr dallas be richest woman in west indie that have one fair marriageable daughter that mother daughter be under influence of negress called dido who be profound believer in cult of obi determined therefore to bend negress to will by mean of

barbadoes found that be living near deanminster so to town repaired established a physician made acquaintance of yourself of mr alymer mr sarby also of mr dallas daughter young charming girl whom intended to make wife here a may guess found unexpected obstacle young lady be in love with mr alymer must have nothing to do with elderly bachelor like determined to remove obstacle not by death by

voodoo stone possessed complete power be ready to do wanted employed in forwarding scheme grandmother have come from 'ashantee ' native country of wand of sleep knew about also knew how to prepare poison secret transmitted to dido resolved to obtain devil stick to make dido prepare fresh poison to use devil stick against rival mr alymer now word about poison doe not kill merely place victim in trance state so closely resembles death that not even most expert doctor can tell difference if trance continues victim dy there be antidote by way obtained from dido antidote if used in time can restore victim from state of catalepsy to pristine vigor have made up mind to use devil stick so a be anxious to give mr alymer chance to escape prophesied to state of life in death phrase describes exactly trance state of wounded by devil stick impregnated with poison however mr alymer did not take warning leave off courting miss dallas on contrary announced engagement carried off young lady in triumph a may guess from what have said before doomed from that hour made dido hypnotize mr dallas in order to have devil stick stolen if remember major offered to buy a refused have to have stolen in order to compromise mother arranged that must steal did without having slightest notion that be committing crime when dido obtained devil stick filled with poison then by direction hypnotized miss dallas put devil stick into hand sent forth to kill mr alymer must not say kill a know devil stick can not kill let say to cast mr alymer into trance by ingenious plot must admit major that be ingenious got rid of lover obtained hold over mother daughter to make long story short have body of mr alymer stolen with aid of dido in order to revive rival did not wish to die so took away body kept in trance for week feeding in meantime so a to preserve life while be in prison dido attended by order mr alymer be not concealed in house so be why police have useless search for body where be concealed ah be secret after trial seeing that mr sarby have behaved so foolishly decided to abandon game evidently there be chance of winning hand of miss dallas also did not wish sarby to die if revived must have to revive maurice also more so a did not want to stand trial for stealing body rest of story know revived maurice brought to so suppose will now marry miss dallas also revived david to have satisfaction of seeing woman loved in arm of in case antidote be efficacious so now dear major a said before have two dear boy once more in flesh hope be satisfied did not tell that devil be

also from mr sarby that have prevailed upon miss dallas deserted ariadne of mr alymer to reward long devotion by giving hand hear that be to be married within month that match be one meet with full approbation of mr dallas under circumstance be afraid that there be chance of marrying miss dallas so must content with searching for wife found in brief interview with miss dallas that have learned how have tried to kill mr alymer while under hypnotic influence of dido perhaps knowledge broke off match young couple took dislike to one from peculiar circumstance of night certainly hypnotism not one must not care to marry woman who have attempted one life so that conjecture be reason of mr alymer withdrawal also miss dallas must have have horror of seeing constantly before man whom innocently enough tried to kill hence refusal to marry dear maurice be wrong in idea think not still must like explanation from a will be here for month searching for voodoo stone dido please send letter to barbadoes directed to anxious inquirer max etwald third letter of dr etwald barbadoes dear major jen be now month since wrote making certain inquiry yet have not be courteous enough to gratify
