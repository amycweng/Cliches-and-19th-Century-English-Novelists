heart hard face flushed into something almost like beauty a remembered that must soon behold owner wo care said aloud threw back head defiantly then after pause breathed softly will make care if hoped to do so task be one required great amount of skill greater amount of womanly courage neither of quality miss greeby possessed have skill in managing man a instinct be insufficiently feminine courage be of purely rough tumble kind must have endured hunger thirst cold must have headed forlorn hope must have held to sinking ship have store of peculiar feminine courage men understand woman ca explain however much may exhibit miss greeby be excellent comrade must not be beloved of man because of very limitation of semi masculinity upon prided noel lambert wanted womanly woman lady agnes be ideal of what wife must be miss greeby have in possible way offered for post lambert have never cared for sufficiently to endure thought of passing through life with beside said be good sort when man say that of woman may be to good friend even platonic chum can never be desirable wife in eye what miss greeby lacked be sex lacking that lacked everything be strange that with rough common sense must not grasp want thought lambert required what must never give namely feminine tenderness strong masculine nature love never crossed very clear mathematical mind so be bent upon fool errand a strode towards abbot wood although did not know aim be to capture lambert a husband plan to accomplish wish by working on heart hunger most probably felt owing to loss of agnes pine if loved that lady in chivalrous fashion miss greeby believed that did be absolutely lost to a wife of man lambert must never degrade into divorce court appearance perhaps after a miss greeby thought hopefully love for sir hubert wife might have turned to scorn that have preferred money to true love then again a miss greeby remembered with darkening face agnes have married millionaire so a to save family estate from being sold rank have obligation lambert might approve of sacrifice since be next heir to garvington title will see what attitude be decided miss greeby a entered abbot wood delayed arranging future plan until

impossible to find miss greeby vigorous coarse personality seemed to break in noisy manner although did not utter single word enchanted silence of solitary place however intruder be too matter of fact to trouble about sequestered liveliness of unique dwelling strode across lawn passing beyond monolith marched like invader up narrow path between radiant flower bed from tiny green door raised burnished knocker brought down with emphatic bang shortly door opened with pettish tug a though person behind be rather annoyed by noise very tall well built slim young man made appearance on threshold held palette on thumb of one hand clutched sheaf of brush while brush be in mouth luckily impeded rather rough welcome look in pair of keen blue eye certainly seemed to resent intrusion at

barbaric appearance nose lip eye contour be perfect really seemed a though face be idealized so absolutely did respond to canon of beauty be gypsy countenance there lurked in loveliness that wild

chapter v woman man quite unaware that destiny that tireless spinner be weaving sinister red thread of hate love into web of life lambert continued to live quietly in woodland retreat in somewhat misanthropic frame of mind have retired to hermitage after failure of love affair since lacking society of agnes there be nothing left for to desire from garden of rose world became sandy desert denied sole gift of fortune must have made completely happy disconsolate lover foreswore society for solitude a seek religion so lambert hoped by seeking nature breast to assuage pain of sore heart although great mother must do so much must not do young man still felt restless weary hard work helped more than little have dark hour during interval when hand brain be too weary to create picture in one way blamed agnes because have married for money in way did not blame because same money have be necessary to support falling fortune of noble family to lambert belonged ordinary person must not have understood must have seen in mercenary marriage simply greedy grasping after loaf fish lambert coming at end of long line of lordly ancestor considered that cousin owed something to of past who have built up family thus pride told that agnes have acted rightly in taking pine a husband while love cried aloud that sacrifice be too hard upon individual self be lambert be also human being two emotion of love pride strove mightily against one although quite three year have elapsed since victim have be offered at altar willing victim to family fetish struggle be still going on because of stress strain lambert withdrew from society so that might see a little a possible of woman loved have met have talked have looked in conventionally light hearted way be relieved when circumstance parted strain be too great pine arranged circumstance for hearing here there everywhere that wife have be practically engaged to cousin before became husband looked with jealous eye upon chance meeting to agnes lambert did say single word since have reason to utter so scrupulously correct be behavior eye be sufficiently eloquent to reveal jealousy took wife for american tour when brought back to london lambert knowing only too truly reason for tour have gone away in turn to shoot big game in africa attack of malaria contracted in congo marsh have driven back to england be then that have begged garvington to give abbot wood cottage for six month have be shut up here occasionally going to london for week walking tour during time have done best to banish image of agnes from heart doubtless be attempting same conquest for never even wrote to now two sorely tried people be within speaking distance of one strange result might be looked for unless honor held sufficiently true seeing that cottage be near family seat that agnes sooner later must arrive to stay with brother sister in law lambert might have expected that situation must come about in natural course of thing perhaps did perhaps a busybody said took cottage for purpose so far have refrained from seeking society of pine wife must not even dine at manor must join shooting party although garvington with singular blindness urged to do so while daylight lasted artist painted desperately hard after dark wandered round lane road across field haunting almost unconsciously manor park if only to see in moonlight twilight casket held rich jewel have lost be foolish lambert acknowledged that be foolish at same time added inwardly that be man not angel sinner not saint so that there be limit etc etc etc using impossible argument to quieten lively conscience did not approve of dangerous philandering visit of miss greeby awoke positively to sense of danger for if talked talk did other people must talk also lambert asked if must be better to visit manor behave like man who have got over passion to leave cottage betake to london while turning over problem in mind painted feverishly for three day after miss greeby have come to stir up muddy water remained a much a possible in studio chaldea visited a usual to be painted brought kara with green coat beloved violin hairy look girl chatted kara played lambert painted three pretended to be very happy careless be merely on surface however for artist be desperately wretched because other half of be married to man while chaldea getting love look caress felt savagely discontented a for kara have long since loved chaldea who treated like dog must not help seeing that adored gentile artist knowledge almost broke heart be satisfaction for to note that lambert must have nothing to do with siren that must not charm to foot sang ever so tenderly be unhappy trio at best gypsy usually came in morning since light be then better for artistic purpose always departed at one o'clock so that lambert have afternoon to chaldea must fain have lingered in order to charm man loved into subjection never gave least encouragement so be obliged to stay away same often haunted wood near cottage when lambert came out for stroll usually did when became too dark to paint be bound to run across since have not slightest desire to make love to did not fathom depth of passion never suspected that purposely contrived meeting looked upon a accidental since chaldea hung round house like moth round candle saw one who came went from woodland cottage on afternoon of third day since pine arrival at camp in character of ishmael hearne gypsy saw lady agnes coming through wood chaldea knew at once having often seen when have come to visit mother cockleshell few month previously with characteristic cunning girl dived into undergrowth there remained concealed for purpose of spying on gentile lady whom regarded a rival immediately chaldea guessed that lady agnes be on way to cottage a lambert be alone a usual for afternoon two must probably have private conversation girl swiftly determined to listen so that might learn exactly how matter stood between might be that must discover something pine chaldea now thought of a pine might like to know so having arranged in own unscrupulous mind girl behind juniper bush jealously watched unsuspecting lady what saw did not please overmuch a lady agnes be rather too beautiful for unknown rival peace of mind sir hubert wife be not really exquisitely lovely creature chaldea took to be fair skin brown hair be contrast to gypsy swarthy face raven lock that really looked like angel of light compared with dark child of nature agnes be tall slender moved with great air of dignity calm self possession to uncontrolled chaldea be also matter of offence inwardly tried to belittle rival by thinking what milk water useless person be steady resolute look in lady brown eye gave lie to mental assertion lady agnes have air of breeding command with beauty chaldea lacked a passed along like cold stately goddess gypsy rolled on grass in ecstasy of rage must never be what rival be what rival be a suspected formed lambert ideal of womanhood when again peered through bush lady agnes have disappeared there be need for chaldea to ask jealous heart where have gone with stealth cunning of red indian gypsy took up trail saw woman followed enter cottage for single moment have in mind to run to camp bring pine reflecting that in moment of rage man might kill lambert chaldea checked first impulse bent energy towards getting sufficiently near to listen to conversation be not meant for ear meanwhile agnes have be admitted by mr tribb dried up little woman with rosy face of winter apple continual smile of satisfaction with herself with limited world consisted of cottage in wood of near village where repaired on occasion to buy food sometimes indeed went to manor for born bred on garvington estate mr tribb knew servant at big house have married gamekeeper who have died unwilling to leave country knew best have gladly accepted offer of lord garvington to look after woodland cottage in way lambert became possessed of exceedingly clean housekeeper wonderfully good cook in fact so excellent cook be mr tribb that garvington have frequently suggested must come to manor so far lambert have managed to keep little woman to mr tribb adored since have known from babyhood declined to leave under circumstance thought lambert best man in world challenged universe to find so handsome clever so considerate dear lady be said mr tribb throwing up dry little hand dropping dignified curtsey well do call good of to come see master noel go out enough take enough interest in stomach if ladyship will pardon mentioning that part of know lady what be to be cook to see dish get cold while a must eat go on painting not what master noel paint like angel a have said dozen of time while mr tribb ran on in manner lively black eye twinkled anxiously knew that master lady agnes have be a said next door to engaged knew also lambert be fretting over match have be brought about for glorification of family housekeeper therefore wondered why lady agnes have come asked whether must not be wise to say that master noel from old association always called lambert by juvenile title be not at home banished thought a unworthy moment entered active brain with curtsey in response to visitor greeting conducted to studio two angel will never do wrong anyhow be mr tribb reflection a closed door left pair together do hope a black faced husband wo ever learn be a jealous a cain want master noel to be abel if mr tribb instead of going to kitchen did have gone out of front door must have found chaldea lying full length amongst flower under large window of studio be slightly open girl must hear word be spoken while so swiftly cleverly have gained point of vantage that within never for one moment suspected presence if have must assuredly have kept better guard over tongue for conversation be of most private nature did not tend to soothe eavesdropper jealousy lambert be so absorbed in painting be working at esmeralda quasimodo picture that scarcely heard studio door open be only when mr tribb shrill voice announced name of visitor that woke to surprising fact that woman loved be within few foot of blood rushed to face then retired to leave deadly pale agnes be more composed did not let heart tide mount to high water mark on seeing self possession man became ashamed that have lost own strove to conceal momentary lapse into natural emotion by pushing forward arm chair be surprise agnes said in voice strove vainly to render steady wo sit down thank took seat like queen on throne looking fair gracious a white lily what with white dress white glove shoe straw hat tied under chin with broad white ribbon in old georgian fashion looked wonderfully cool pure a lambert inwardly observed holy face be a faintly tinted with color a be tea rose calm brown eye under smooth brown hair added to suggestive stillness of look seemed in placidity to be far removed from earthly emotion resembled picture of madonna serene peaceful somewhat sad yet who must tell what anguished feeling be masked by womanly pride hope find weather too warm for walking said lambert reining in emotion with iron hand speaking conventionally not at enjoyed walk be staying at manor so understand be staying here there can be doubt on point do think be acting wisely asked with great calmness might put same question to agnes seeing that have come to live within three mile of hermitage be because be living in what call hermitage have come rejoined agnes with slight color deepening cheek be fair to that must shut up play part of disappointed lover lambert who have be touching up picture here there laid down palette brush with ostentatious care faced doggedly understand what mean declared oh think do in hope may induce in justice to to change conduct have come over think must have come observed in low voice threw on couch with averted eye lady agnes colored again be talking nonsense said with sharpness there be harm in coming to see cousin be more than cousin once exactly unfortunately people know that need make matter worse by so pointedly keeping away from lambert looked up quickly do wish to see often asked there be new note in voice irritated personally what rose stood up very tall very straight looking down on with hungry look in blue eye people be talking murmured lady stared at floor because must not face that same look let talk what doe matter nothing to perhaps to great deal have husband a know to cost interpolated then let know to cost said pointedly sit down let talk common sense lambert did not obey at once be only human being agnes quite so man at act like man then place burden on woman shoulder what burden oh noel ca understand daresay can if will explain wish have come here to day have enough to bear without have nothing to bear demanded flash of passion ruffling enforced calm do think that anything direst need brought here know what brought here be waiting for explanation what be use of explaining what already know know nothing repeated doggedly explain well said lady agnes with bitterness seems to that explanation be

lambert bit lip god helping will chapter vi man woman interview between lady agnes lambert must scarcely be called love scene since be dominated by stern sense of duty chaldea lying at length amongst crushed fragrant flower in parti colored attire scarcely distinguishable from rainbow blossom be puzzled by way in two reined in obvious passion to simple barbaric nature situation appeared impossible if loved loved why did not run away to enjoy life together husband who have paid money for wife did not count did brother who have sold sister to hide criminal folly lady agnes must have traded to save garvington from well deserved punishment seemed inexcusable to gypsy if have be man loved then indeed might have acted rightly having thrown over very man in silly fashion for sake of what did not appear to be worth sacrifice chaldea felt that agnes did not deserve lambert then there determined that gentile lady must never posse of course on face of there be question of possession man being weaker than woman must have be only too glad to elope thus cut gordian knot of unhappy situation woman having acted from high sense of duty chaldea must not rise to evidently be determined to continue to be martyr question be must keep up pose in face of undeniable fact that loved cousin listening girl thought not sooner later artificial barrier must be broken through by held back flood of passion then lady agnes must run away from man who have bought quite right too thought chaldea although have notion of permitting such elopement to take place that agnes must hold to bargain life because hubert have fulfilled part never occurred to girl be not civilized enough to understand problem of highly refined nature since situation be so difficult lambert be glad to see back of cousin escorted to door did not attend through wood in fact parted rather abruptly be wise have be said must be said lambert have given promise to share burden with agnes by acting part of lover who have never really be serious did not do to discus detail a be too painful so woman hurried away without backward glance lambert holding heart between teeth returned to studio one of two noticed chaldea crouching amongst flower have be le pre occupied might have done so a be escaped observation a soon a coast be clear chaldea stole like snake along ground through high herbage of garden beyond circle of mysterious monolith even across lawn of glade did crawl so a not to be seen although need not have taken trouble since lambert with set face trembling hand be working furiously at minor picture utilized to get rid of such mood gypsy did not know so writhed into wood like snake of eden of same be very fair sample until hidden by bole of ancient tree must stand upright when did so drew long breath wondered what be best to be done most obvious course be to seek ishmael make lying report of conversation that wife must have be with lambert must be quite enough to awaken civilized gypsy jealousy for after civilization be skin deep still if did chaldea be clever enough to see that must precipitate catastrophe throw agnes into lambert arm make man run risk of getting pine knife tickling fifth rib result did not appeal to wished to get lambert to herself safety be of vital importance to after consideration determined that must boldly face lover confess that have overheard everything then must have in power since to save wife from vengeance of husband although there be reason for such vengeance must do anything to keep matter of visit quiet of course interview have be innocent chaldea knew that such be case nevertheless by little dexterous lying vivid word painting must make thing extremely unpleasant for couple being so lambert must have to subscribe to term be that must leave agnes marry that there be such difference in rank mattered nothing to girl love levelled rank in opinion while arranging what must do if lambert proved obstinate chaldea also arranged to fascinate if possible into loving did not wish to use power of knowledge until power of fascination failed for two reason in first place be not desire to drive man into corner lest must defy fight must mean to limited comprehension that everything being known to pine couple must confess elope in second place chaldea be piqued to think that lambert must prove to be so indifferent to undeniable beauty a to love pale shadow of gentile lady must make certain told if really preferred lily to full blown rose on choice depended next step gliding back to camp decided to attend to one thing at time immediate necessity be to charm man into submission for reason chaldea sought out servian gypsy who be slave slave kara certainly be not rom if have be husband must not have dared to propose to what

impressed with belief that what girl said be true avali true son of road be here here lambert started violently what do mean say what mean rye call pine be in camp enjoying old life will bring to inquired demurely in flash lambert saw danger danger of agnes seeing that millionaire be a jealous a othello however seemed to that honesty be best policy at moment will see later declared after pause if listened must know that there be reason why must not see wife be cousin paid friendly visit be yes be mocked girl contemptuously if tell tell what that love romi know that said lambert quietly know

gypsy between teeth hatch till dood well apre mean wait until moon rise ominous saying for lambert chapter vii secretary be ever man in so uncomfortable position lambert asked question a soon a be safe in studio found difficult one to answer be true that what have said to agnes what agnes have said to be perfectly honest extremely honorable considering state of feeling conversation have be overheard by unscrupulous woman whose jealousy must probably twist innocence into guilt be certain that must go to pine give garbled version of what have taken place in case danger be great to to agnes lambert have spoken bravely enough to marplot knowing that have done no wrong now be by mean sure that have acted rightly perhaps must have be better to temporize must have meant surrender young to chaldea unmaidenly wooing a man have not spark of love for in heart given entirely to woman be unwilling even to feign playing part of lover on reflection still held to resolution to go to london thinking that must be best for to be out of reach of agnes while pine be in neighborhood news that millionaire be gypsy have astonished at first now that considered man dark coloring un english look quite believed that what chaldea said be true must understand also pine hearne since be true name must occasionally wish to breathe free air of heath road since have be cradled under tent must at time feel strongly longing for old lawless life why must revert to beginning so near to brother in law house where wife be staying unless came to keep eye on murmured lambert unconsciously hit on very reason of pseudo gypsy presence at garvington after must be best to go to london for time to wait until saw what chaldea must do then must meet pine have understanding with very fact that pine be romany be on native heath appealed to lambert a reason why must not seek out man immediately a almost felt inclined to do in order to forestall chaldea story a hearne millionaire wild instinct must be uppermost must probably not listen to reason whereas if meeting took place in london pine must resume to certain extent veneer of civilization must be more willing to do justice yes decided lambert rising stretching will go to london wait to turn over matter in own mind will say nothing to agnes until know what be best to be done about chaldea meanwhile will see girl get to hold tongue for time damn frowned be making best of dangerous situation see way to proper adjustment yet most necessary thing be to gain time with in mind hastily packed gladstone bag changed into tweed told mr tribb that

hastened away instead of going straight to village took roundabout road to camp on verge of abbot wood here found vagrant in state of great excitement a lord garvington have that afternoon sent notice by gamekeeper that be to leave land next day taken up with own private trouble lambert did not pay much attention to of tribe looked about for chaldea finally saw sitting by one of fire in dejected attitude touched on shoulder at once like disturbed animal leaped to foot rye said chaldea with gasp hopeful look on face give three day before say anything to pine said lambert in low voice furtive look round understand said girl boldly unless mean never mind what mean interrupted man hastily for be determined not to commit will hold tongue for three day chaldea looked hard at face upon red firelight played brightly must not read what be in mind however thought that request showed sign of yielding be mute confession that knew be in power give three day murmured have promise then so good bye interrupted lambert abruptly walked away hastily in direction of garvington village mind be more le of chaos at event have gained time to reduce chaos to sort of order still a yet must not see outcome of situation departed swiftly in order to think over chaldea made step two a if to follow reflection that must do good by talking at moment certainty that held in hollow of hand made pause with hitch of shapely shoulder resumed seat by fire brooding sombrely on way in gentile have rejected love bending black brow showing white teeth like irritated dog inwardly cursed for cherishing so foolish love nevertheless did not try to overcome resolved to force gorgio to foot then must spurn if have mind to a have spurned well knew confessed to herself with sigh that there must be no spurning on part since wayward love be stronger than pride did gentile bring gold sister asked harsh voice raised head to see kara hairy face bent to ear brother go to lundra to get gold did not play fish in fine style took for truth sister said kara looking at searchingly chaldea nodded wearily be great witch a can see will be romi when gold chink in pocket yes for certain brother be true fortune before camp be changed sister persisted man greedily for to morrow may take road since great lord order off land yet chaldea stood up suddenly recollecting what have be said by pine wife why must

gorgious gentleman be trading horse with swell rye want meddling with time sister meddle now snapped chaldea walked away in usual free graceful manner kara shrugged shoulder then took refuge in talking to violin to related doubt of girl truth smiled grimly a thought of recovered knife be again snugly hidden under weather worn green coat chaldea who did not stand on ceremony walked to end of camp without paying attention to excited gypsy flung back flap of old woman tent mother cockleshell be not within a have given use of abode to pine visitor latter be small neat man with smooth boyish

bulked mighty mass of darkness in pale september moonlight lady agnes got to bed quickly tired out by boredom of evening quickly fell asleep suddenly awoke with sens on alert with sense of vague danger hovering round there be sound of running foot indistinct oath distant cry must have sworn that pistol shot have startled from slumber in moment be out of bed ran to open window on looking out saw that moonlight be very brilliant in beheld tall man running swiftly from house sped down broad path just when be abreast of miniature shrubbery heard second shot seemed to be fired there from man staggered stumbled fell immediately afterwards brother recognized voice raised in anger ran out of house followed by of male guest terrified by sight sound of shot lady agnes huddled on dressing gown hastily thrust bare foot into slipper next moment be out of bedroom down stair wild idea have entered mind that perhaps lambert have come secretly to manor have be shot by garvington in mistake for burglar corridor hall be filled with guest more le lightly attired mostly woman white faced startled agnes paid attention to shriek hurried into side passage terminated at door out of brother have left house went outside also made for group round fallen man what be who be asked gasping with hurry fright go back agnes go back cried garvington looking up with distorted face strangely pale in moonlight who be who have be killed caught sight of fallen man countenance shrieked great heaven be hubert be dead yes said silver who stood at elbow shot through heart chapter ix afterwards with amazing sinister rapidity news spread that burglar have be shot dead while trying to raid manor first garvington villager learned then became common property of neighborhood until finally reached nearest county town thus brought police on scene lord garvington be not pleased when local inspector arrived intimated a much in somewhat unpleasant fashion be never man who spared in inferior social position be use coming over darby said bluntly to red haired police officer who be of irish extraction have sent to scotland yard in good time lord replied inspector coolly a murder have taken place in district have to look into matter report to london authority if must be necessary what right have to class affair a murder inquired garvington only go by rumor have heard lord say that winged man broke right arm others tell that second shot be fired in garden be that killed ishmael hearne be true darby only fired first shot a who be with will tell know who shot in garden apparently one else doe be unknown individual in garden killed hearne by way how did come to hear name dozen people have told lord along with information have just given nothing else be talked of far wide be just twelve o'clock muttered stout little lord wiping scarlet face pettishly ill news travel fast however a be here may a well take charge of thing until london men arrive london men be going to usurp privilege lord said darby firmly there be sense in taking matter out of hand if will pardon saying so must have be sent for in first instance daresay snapped garvington coolly matter be too important to be left in hand of local policeman darby be nettled hard eye grew angry be quite competent to deal with murder even if be that of highest in england much le with death of common gypsy be just where be darby common gypsy who have be shot happens to be brother in law sir hubert pine questioned inspector thoroughly taken aback yes of course did know when fired must not have done so darby understood wife sister understood sir hubert be in paris pass comprehension to guess why must have come in dead of night dressed a gypsy to raid house perhaps be bet said darby desperately puzzled bet be hanged pine must come openly to place whenever liked never be so astonished in life a when saw lying dead near shrubbery worst of be that sister ran out saw also fainted have be in bed ever since attended by lady garvington have idea that man shot be sir hubert lord hang must have shot have guessed who be lord of course not said officer hastily a have come to take charge of case will give detailed account of what have taken place must rather wait until scotland yard fellow come grumbled garvington a wish to repeat story twice still a be on spot may a well ask advice may be able to throw light on subject be hanged if can darby pulled out notebook be attention lord garvington plunged abruptly into account first having looked to see if library door be firmly closed a there have be many burglary lately in part of world said speaking with deliberation got idea into head that house might be broken into natural enough lord interposed darby glancing round splendid room historic house such a be must tempt burglar so thought remarked other pleased that darby must agree with so promptly declared several time within hearing of many people that if raid be made must shoot first man who tried to enter hang englishman house be castle man have right to come in without permission quite so lord punishment of burglar must be left to law said inspector softly oh deuce take law prefer to execute own punishment however to make long story short grew more afraid of raid when gypsy came to camp at abbot wood a be just sort of scoundrel who must break in steal why did order off land asked policeman alertly did then brother in law sent message through secretary who be staying here asking to allow to remain did why did sir hubert send message lord hang man be just what be trying to learn be more puzzled because came last night dressed a gypsy must be one said darby who have seen pine now recalled dark complexion jetty eye seems from what have be told that stopped at abbot wood camp under name of ishmael hearne so silver informed who be pine secretary who know confidential affair silver declared when secret must be kept no longer that pine be really gypsy called ishmael hearne occasionally longing for old life stepped down from millionaire pedestal mixed with own people when be supposed to be in paris be really with gypsy so can now understand why sent message asking to let vagrant stay told few moment ago that must not understand that message lord said darby quickly looking searchingly at other man garvington grew trifle confused did well to tell truth darby be so mixed up over business ca say what do know what know 'd better take tell with grain of salt until be quite again natural enough lord remarked inspector again quite believed what said detail of murder went to bed a usual said garvington wearily for event of night have tired out everyone else retired time about midnight went round with footman butler to see that everything be safe for be too anxious to let look after thing without then heard noise of footstep on gravel outside just a be dropping off to sleep about what time be that lord half past one o'clock ca be certain a to minute jumped up laid hold of revolver be handy always kept beside in case of burglary then stole downstairs in slipper pajama to passage oh here garvington rose quickly come with see place for inspector darby put on cap with notebook still in hand followed stout figure of guide garvington led through entrance hall into side passage terminated in narrow door there be one to spy on a master of house have sent servant to own quarter guest be collected in drawing room smoking room although few of lady remained in bedroom trying to recover from night experience came down here said garvington opening door heard burglar a thought be prowling about on other side threw open door in way man plunged forward to enter fired got in right arm for saw swinging uselessly by side a departed be in hurry asked darby rather needlessly went off like greased lightning did follow a thought that others of gang might be about closing door again shouted blue murder in few minute everyone came down while be waiting passed in flash remember darby heard second shot then servant friend came ran out to find man lying by shrubbery quite dead turned over have just grasped fact that be brother in law when lady agnes ran out when learned news naturally fainted woman carried back to room took body of pine into house doctor came along morning for sent for doctor a soon a be dawn said that pine have be shot through heart who shot asked darby sagely garvington pointed to shrubbery someone be concealed there declared how do know that lord sister attracted by shot jumped out of bed threw up window saw man of course never guessed that be pine running down path saw fall by shrubbery when second shot be fired bedroom be then on side of house lord up there said garvington pointing directly over narrow door be painted rich blue color looked rather bizarre set in puritanic greyness of wall own bedroom be further along towards right be why footstep so plainly on gravel stamped hard while with wave of hand invited inspector to examine surroundings darby did so with keen eye alert brain two stood on west side of mansion where fronted three mile distant abbot wood manor be heterogeneous looking sort of place suggesting whim fancy of many generation for something be taken away here something be taken away there have be altered while have be left in original state until house seemed to be made up of possible architectural style be tall building of three story although flattish red tiled roof took away somewhat from height spread over amazing quantity of land a darby thought must have housed regiment must have cost something to keep up a wind weather time have mellowed incongruous part into one neutral tint looked odd attractive moss lichen ivy virginia creeper last flaring in crimson glory clothed massive stone wall with gracious mantle of natural beauty narrow stone step rather chipped led down from blue door to broad yellow path came round rear of house swept down hill in wide curve past miniature shrubbery right into bosom of park path explained garvington stamping again run right through park to small wicket gate set in brick wall border high road darby that run straightly past abbot wood mused inspector of course sir hubert must know of path wicket gate certainly be as darby cried garvington petulantly have be in house dozen of time know a well a do why do ask so obvious question be only wondering if sir hubert came by high road to wicket gate speak of lord garvington that also be obvious retorted other irritably since wished to come here naturally must take easiest way then why did not enter by main avenue gate because at hour must be shut since be evident that visit be secret one must have have to knock up lodge keeper why be visit secret one questioned darby pointedly be thing puzzle anything more yes why must sir hubert come to blue door ca answer question either whole reason of being here instead of in paris be mystery to oh a to last reply be easy remarked inspector sir hubert wished to revert to free gypsy life pretended to be in paris so that must follow fancy without truth becoming known why must come on particular night by particular path to particular door be problem have to solve quite so only hope that will solve for sake of sister darby reflected for moment so did lady agnes ask husband to come here to see privately hang man cried garvington aghast believed a did that husband be in paris certainly never dreamed that be masquerading a gypsy three mile away there be masquerading about matter lord said darby dryly since sir hubert really be gypsy called ishmael hearne that fact will come out at inquest have come out now everyone know truth nice thing be for lady agnes think need worry about lord garvington honorable way in late sir hubert attained rank gained wealth will reflect credit on humble origin when paper learn story confound paper interrupted garvington fretfully sincerely hope that wo make too great fuss over business little man hope be vain a might have guessed that must be for when news became known in fleet street newspaper be only too glad to discover original sensation for dead season day journalist special correspondent be sent down in such number that platform of wanbury railway station be crowded with a town be chief town of hengishire be five mile away from village of garvington possible kind of vehicle be used to reach scene of crime manor became rendezvous for morbid people in neighborhood out of reporter in particular poked pried over place passing from great house to village thence to gypsy camp on border of abbot wood from one person learned fact be published with such fanciful addition that read like fiction on authority of mother cockleshell who be not averse to earning few shilling kind of gil blas tale be put into print wandering of ishmael hearne be set forth in picturesque style of picarooning romance of time when adventurous gypsy assumed gentile name romany must tell nothing for obvious reason until truth became known because of man tragic unforeseen death in camp be not aware that be gorgio millionaire where story of mother cockleshell left off that of mark silver began for secretary have be connected with employer almost from day of hearne first exploit a pine in london silver who also charged for blended fact fiction supplied freely related knew hearne came to london called hubert pine stated frankly not hesitating to confess own lowly origin met when be starving a toymaker in whitechapel invented penny toy pine put on market for be successful made money be bound to confess that paid tolerably well although certainly took lion share with money made in way speculated in south african share a boom be then on simply coined gold everything touched turned into cash however deeply plunged into money market always came out top in end by turning over money re investing by fresh speculation became millionaire in wonderfully short space of time then made secretary afterwards took up politics government gave knighthood for service rendered to party became well known figure in world of finance married lady agnes lambert be be aware that be gypsy mr silver asked reporter oh yes knew about origin from first day of acquaintanceship asked to keep true name rank secret a be none of business did so at time hearne rather pine a know best by name grew weary of civilization then must return to own life of tent road one suspected amongst romany that be anything else horse coper always pretended to be in paris berlin on financial affair when went back to people transacted business during absence knew that be at abbot wood camp certainly saw there once twice to receive instruction about business expostulated with for being so near house where brother in law wife be living a pointed out that truth might easily become known pine merely said that safety in keeping secret lay in daring to run risk have idea sir hubert intended to come by night to lord garvington house not slightest in fact told that lord garvington be afraid of burglar have threatened to shoot man who tried to enter house silver said in perfectly frank free easy manner also related how dead man have instructed to ask garvington to allow gypsy to remain in wood reporter published interview with sundry comment of own be read with great avidity by public at large by many friend of millionaire who be surprised to learn of double life led by man of course there be nothing disgraceful in pine past a ishmael hearne attempt to discover something shady about antecedent be vain yet a be pointed out there must have be something wrong else adventurer a plainly be must not have met so terrible death in spite of one desire to find fire to account for smoke nothing to pine disadvantage must be learned even at inquest when matter be thoroughly threshed out dead man character proved to be honorable save in innocent concealment of real name origin public private life be must be desired whole story be not criminal truly romantic final tragedy gave grim touch to what be regarded even by most censorious a picturesque narrative in spite of effort inspector darby of wanbury must produce evidence likely to show who have shot deceased lord garvington under natural impression that pine be burglar have certainly wounded in right arm be second shot fired by one outside house have pierced heart be positively proved by distinct evidence of lady agnes rose from sick bed to depose how have opened window have seen actual death of unfortunate man whom little guessed be husband burglar a reasonably took to be be running down path when first caught sight of after first shot have be fired be second shot came from shrubbery marked on plan placed before coroner jury have laid fugitive low also various guest servant stated that have arrived in passage in answer to lord garvington outcry to find that have closed door pending coming have even heard second shot while descending stair be proved therefore in very positive manner that master of house have not murdered supposed robber never intended to kill declared garvington when evidence be taken intended to do did do be to wing so that might be captured on spot traced later closed door after firing shot a fancied that might have have accomplice with wished to make safe until assistance arrived have idea that man be sir hubert pine asked juryman certainly not must not have fired have recognized moment opened door flung upon fired ran away be not until went out found dead by shrubbery that recognized brother in law thought be in paris inspector darby deposed that have examined shrubbery have noted broken twig here there showed that one must have be concealed behind screen of laurel grass somewhat long in thicket have be trampled nothing have be discovered likely to lead to discovery of assassin who have be ambushed in manner be there footmark questioned coroner there have be rain for week to soften ground explained witness therefore be impossible to discover footmark broken twig trampled grass show that one be hidden in shrubbery when person left screen of laurel there be nothing to show in direction escape be made indeed evidence be useless to trace criminal manor have be bolted barred by lord garvington along with footman butler so no one within must have fired second shot evidence of mother cockleshell of chaldea of various other gypsy went to show that one have left camp on night with exception of hearne even absence have not be made known until fact of death be made public next morning hearne a several of gypsy stated have retired about eleven to tent have said nothing about going to manor much le about leaving camp silver statement revealed nothing since far from seeking brother in law house pine have pointedly declared that in order to keep secret must be careful not to go near place pine have enemy to knowledge who desired death declared secretary be so intimate that have life be in danger certainly must have spoken about to can throw light on darkness asked coroner hopelessly none said witness so far a can see be one else able to throw light on subject pine secret be not dishonorable one a be such upright man that one must have desired to kill apparently there be solution to mystery a one concluded when evidence be fully threshed out open verdict be brought in proceeding ended in unsatisfactory manner wilful murder against person person unknown said lambert when read report of inquest in st james street room strange wonder who cut gordian knot of rope bound agnes to pine must find reply to question must one else chapter x difficult position lord garvington be not creditable member of aristocracy since vice greatly exceeded virtue with weak nature taste of sybarite required great deal of money to render happy like immortal becky sharp must have be fairly honest if possessed of large income not having stopped short of nothing save actual criminality in order to indulge luxurious taste to full candidly speaking have already overstepped mark when altered figure of check brother in law have given have not pine be so generous must have undoubtedly occupied extremely unpleasant position however thanks to agnes affair have be hushed up with characteristic promptitude garvington have conveniently forgotten how nearly have escaped iron grip of justice in fact so entirely did slip memory on plea of pine newly discovered origin did not desire body to be placed in family vault widow wished to pay honor to husband remains finally got own way in matter for simple reason now be owner of pine million garvington did not wish to offend a such mean creature must made capital out of concession since do for agnes said bluntly when question be being decided must do something for what do wish to do ah hum hey ho gurgled garvington thinking cunningly that be too early yet to exploit can talk about when will have be read know exactly how stand besides grief be sacred to dear shut up cry agnes have sense of humor blatant hypocrisy of speech made laugh outright in spite of genuine regret felt for husband tragic death garvington be quite shocked do forget that body be yet in house asked with heavy solemnity forget anything retorted agnes becoming scornfully serious not even that count on to settle wretched financial difficulty out of poor hubert money of course will dear be lambert undoubtedly be not necessarily fool oh ca stop hear call such name said garvington ostentatiously dense to true meaning be hysteria that speaks not dear sister very natural when be so grieved be mortal be certainly silly in addition replied widow who knew how useless be to argue with man go away worry when poor hubert be buried will be read will announce intention intention intention muttered corpulent little lord taking hasty departure out of diplomacy surely agnes wo be such fool a to let family estate go never struck pine might have so worded will that inheritance counted upon might not come to widow unless chose to fulfil certain condition then never guessed jealousy with hot blooded gypsy have regarded early engagement of agnes lambert if have done so assuredly must not have invited young man down to funeral did so talked about doing so with frequent mention that body be to rest in sacred vault of lambert so that one must applaud generous humility poor pine be only gypsy said garvington on occasion esteemed a good honest man will have honor shown to memory noel a representative of wife dear sister will follow to lambert vault there with ancestor body of honorable though humble man will rest until day of judgment cynic in london laughed when speech be reported to if garvington be buried in same vault said contemptuously will ask pine for money a soon a rise to attend great assize bitter remark showed that little man must not induce people to believe so disinterested a must have liked to consider however in pursuance of artful policy certainly gave dead man what landlady of village inn called dressy funeral must be done in way of pomp ceremony be done procession followed ishmael hearne to grave be extraordinarily long one villager came because like lower order loved excitement of interment gypsy from camp followed since deceased be of blood many people in financial social circle came down from london for obvious reason that pine be well known figure in city west end also member of parliament a for lambert put in appearance in response to cousin invitation unwillingly enough in order to convince agnes that have desire to obey command people must scarcely think that pine have be jealous of early engagement to agnes when former lover attended funeral of successful rival of course house party at manor have broken up immediately after inquest must have disintegrated before only that inspector darby insisted that one must remain for examination in connection with late tragical occurrence in spite of questioning cross questioning nothing have be learned likely to show who have murdered millionaire there be great deal of talk after body have be placed in lambert vault there be more talk in newspaper when account be given of funeral by word of mouth in print be suggestion made likely to afford slightest clue to name whereabouts of assassin having regard to pine romantic career be thought by that act be one of revenge by gypsy jealous that man must attain to such affluence while others hinted that motive for crime be to be found in connection with millionaire career a gentile gradually a conjecture proved futile gossip died away other event usurped interest of public pine who be really hearne have be murdered buried assassin must never be discovered since trail be too well hidden lady agnes inherited at least two million on must probably marry cousin so restore tarnished splendor of lambert family in way situation be summed up by gossip then began to talk of something else tragedy be only nine minute wonder after gossip in town country be certainly right in assuming that widow inherited vast property of deceased husband what did not know be that condition attached to such inheritance irritated agnes caused garvington unfeigned alarm pine solicitor be called jarwin came from stuffy little office in chancery lane called garvington aside when mourner returned from funeral asked that reading of will might be confined to few people whom named there be condition laid down by testator need not be made public said mr jarwin blandly proposition if possible must be kept out of print garvington with sudden recollection of iniquity in connection with falsified check did not dare to ask question hastily

scandal noel dare agnes be innocent be innocent innocence can dare thing sick troubled conscious of dark cloud around looked at one in silence then lambert repeated word with conviction to reassure a much a to comfort innocence can dare thing said lambert positively chapter xiii friend in need be natural that lambert must talk of having silver arrested a in first flush of indignation at audacious attempt to levy blackmail appeared most reasonable thing to do when agnes went back to manor sick man be left alone to struggle through long weary night reaction suggested more cautious dealing with matter silver be venomous little reptile if brought before magistrate must probably produce letter offered for sale at so ridiculous price if be made public agnes must find in extremely unpleasant position certainly letter be forged must not be easy to prove even if be proved agnes cleared character necessary scandal connected with publicity of such defence must be distressing painful in wishing to silence silver yet avoid interference of police lambert found on horn of dilemma having readjusted situation in own mind lambert next day wrote lengthy letter to agnes setting forth objection to drastic measure informed not quite truthfully that hoped to be on foot in twenty four hour then must personally attend to matter although must not say a yet what intended to do five out of seven day of grace allowed by blackmailer yet remained much must be done in time return to town attend to own to brother affair a usual concluded letter matter connected with silver can be left in hand must attempt to see in meantime refer to epistle ended with intimation that agnes be not to worry a writer must take whole burden on own shoulder widow felt more cheerful after communication went back to town house to act a lover suggested have belief in lambert capability to deal with matter young man be more doubtful for must not see how be to begin unravelling tangled skein interview with chaldea have proved futile a be plainly on side of enemy to apply to silver for information a to intention must merely result in repetition of what have said to lady agnes only remained to lay whole matter before inspector darby lambert be half inclined to go to wanbury for purpose did not however undertake journey for two reason firstly wished to avoid asking for official assistance until absolutely forced to do so secondly be too ill to leave cottage worry felt regarding agnes perilous position told on already weakened frame invalid grew worse instead of better finally lambert decided to risk journey to camp be not so very far distant interview mother cockleshell old lady have great love for chaldea who flouted authority must not therefore be very kindly disposed towards girl young man believed in vague way that chaldea have originated conspiracy have to do with letter be carrying underhand plan to conclusion with aid of silver mother cockleshell who be very shrewd might have learned guessed girl rascality must assuredly thwart aim if possible also gypsy queen must probably know great deal about pine in character of ishmael hearne since have be acquainted with intimately during early part of life knew did not know lambert considered that must be wise to enlist on side a mere fact that chaldea be one of opposite party must make fight like wild cat a whole affair have to do with gypsy a gentilla stanley be gypsy be just a well to apply for assistance nevertheless lambert be quite in dark a to what assistance must be rendered in way young man made plan only to be thwarted by weakness of body must crawl out of bed sit before fire in spite of will power must not crawl a far a camp baffled in way decided to send note asking mother cockleshell to call on although knew that if chaldea learned about visit be almost certain to do must be placed on guard have to be risked lambert moreover believed that old woman be quite equal to dealing with girl however fate took matter out of hand before must even write invitation visitor arrived in person of miss greeby who suggested way out of difficulty by offering service matter came to head within hour of presenting

room be small cramped atrociously furnished in overcrowded way there be pattern on wall paper on carpet on tablecloth curtain until eye ached for clean surface without design there be so many ill matched color misused for decorative purpose lambert shuddered to core of artistic soul when beheld to neutralize glaring tint pulled down blind of two window looked on to dull suburban roadway thus shut out weak sunshine then threw into uncomfortable arm chair sought solace in briar root future be dark present be disagreeable past must not bear thinking about so intimately did deal with murder of pine threat of silver misery occasioned by sacrifice of agnes to family fetish be in young man mind to leave england forthwith begin new life unhampered by former trouble present grievance agnes required help must not be left to struggle unaided so lambert silently vowed again a have vowed before to stand by to end yet so far be unable to see what end must be while thus contemplated unpleasantness of life became aware that front door bell be ringing heard mr tribb hurrying along passage so thin be wall so near door that heard also housekeeper effusive welcome be cut short by gasp of surprise lambert idly wondered what caused little woman astonishment speedily learned when agnes appeared in room with rare discretion mr tribb ushered in visitor then fled to kitchen to wonder why widow have discarded mourning only planted six month a might say murmured puzzled woman will master noel say to such going on master noel said nothing because be too astonished to speak agnes seeing surprise guessing cause waited somewhat defiantly for to make observation be dressed in gray silk frock with hat glove shoe to match drew off fur lined cloak of maroon colored velvet when entered room face be somewhat pale eye looked unnaturally large have resolute expression about mouth showed that have made up mind lambert swift from long association to read mood wondered what conclusion have arrived at proceeded to inquire be meaning of demanded considerably startled dress of course where be widow cap in fire there can remain until be burned to ash lambert stared harder than ever what doe mean asked again mean said agnes replying very directly that victim be no longer decked out for sacrifice mean that a hubert insulted by will no longer intend to consider memory agnes respected always said that did quite so until will be read then when found that mean jealousy be entirely unreasonable have arranged to rob of income by preventing marriage with ceased to have regard for hubert knew that loved be content to take on term so long a be loyal to be loyal did what must to show gratitude for way in helped family now will have broken bargain respect no longer for reason refuse to pose longer a grieving widow wonder with thought posed at said lambert gloomily pushed forward chair must not make up mind until lately what to do explained agnes sitting down gracefully while accepted money appeared to that ought to show memory outward respect of crape rest of now leaned forward spoke meaningly be resolved to surrender money break link between will will tapped impatient foot on carpet how must expect woman to put up with insult lambert dropped on sofa looked at hard what be up asked anxiously never saw like before be not free when last saw replied dryly oh yes be widow mean free in own mind to marry be now intend to consider family society mr silver threat anything else have shaken off fetter have discarded ring violently pulled off glove to show that circle of gold be absent be free thank god that be free agnes agnes ca reduce to poverty by marrying must not be honorable of must be honorable on part for to keep money of man despise because will insult retorted argued before yes did concluded to wait until saw how estate must be freed before came to conclusion do see now how estate can be freed without using pine money agnes asked lambert anxiously thing be ever so much worse than thought garvington can hold out for year at end of twelve month estate will be sold up by person whose name be in sealed envelope will be reduced to hundred year lambert waved arm dramatically be ruined dear entirely ruined for simple reason that wish to place love before duty agnes leaned forward took hand firmly noel love of course do do love family name better in one way wish to save in be willing to let go hang yes be view until three four day ago what caused to change mind dear visit clara greeby paid oh lambert sat up very straight have be making mischief have not at on contrary have done of great service lambert nodded thankfully felt doubtful a to whether miss greeby really have meant to renounce absurd passion for be relief to find that have be acting honestly have then learned who killed pine asked cautiously lady agnes suddenly rose began to pace room twisting glove trying to control usually be so composed that lambert wondered at restlessness wondered still more when burst into violent tear therefore hastened to draw back to chair when be seated knelt beside passed arm round neck a distressed a be be so unlike agnes to break down in way more unlike to sob brokenly oh be afraid be afraid afraid of what darling be afraid to learn who killed husband might have done so yet only fired first shot agnes lambert rose up suddenly be talking of garvington yes leaned back dried tear in spite of what say be afraid may be guilty lambert heart seemed to stand still talk rubbish cried angrily wish be oh how wish be rubbish ca be sure of course may have meant what say what doe say tell everything heaven lambert clutched smooth hair what doe mean ruin to lambert family told so have only told scrap so far understand how can arrive at conclusion that garvington be guilty agnes go on cry in so unnecessary way if thing have to be faced surely be strong enough to face let emotion make fool of stop stop said sharply stamping dry eye explain matter ca help feeling faltered agnes beginning to respond to spur becoming calmer yes can offer brandy smelling salt anything of sort because know to be woman with firm mind exert will compel nerve to be calm exhibition be too cheap oh cried agnes indignantly feeling be one lambert wished to arouse how can talk so because love respect retorted knew that meant what said that firmness of mind self control have always appealed to therefore made great effort subdued unruly nerve lambert gave assistance merely walked up down room while waiting for to recover be not easy for to be immediately a really be shaken privately considered that expected too much pride came to aid gradually became more composed meanwhile lambert pulled up blind to display ugly room in deformity sight a guessed must extorted exclamation from oh how can live in horrid place asked irrelevantly necessity know law be better yes be right be brutal noel must have be brutal to weaker woman answered by acting a have done show how much think of rather strange way of showing approval drastic method have triumphed be quite composed will tell of disgrace in a unemotional manner a if be reckoning pound shilling penny disgrace lambert fastened on one word anxiously to to garvington in first place sit down listen will tell everything from moment clara came to see lambert nodded resumed seat agnes with wonderful coolness detailed miss greeby visit production of letter thence passed on to explain how have tricked garvington into confession did not confess interrupted lambert at point not at moment did yesterday in letter to see left house immediately slept at club then went down to manor sent for jane who by way know nothing of what have explained here be two letter added agnes taking envelope out of pocket one be forged one other came from garvington yesterday even though be not imitating writing can see now then similarity perhaps there be family resemblance in caligraphy cousin examined two epistle with rather scared look for there be doubt that thing looked black against head of family however did not read garvington letter asked agnes to explain what excuse doe make for forging name asked lambert in business like way for there be need to rage over such worm a freddy very weak one replied so weak that scarcely believe to be in earnest besides freddy always be liar declares that when went to see about getting gypsy turned off land caught sight of hubert did not speak to learned truth from mr silver whom forced to speak then wrote letter let purposely fall into mr silver hand by mr silver be passed on to hubert freddy writes that only wanted to hurt hubert so that might be laid up in bed at manor when be weak hubert mean freddy then intended to get money must out of did not wish to kill pine then evidence go to show that only broke hubert arm be true murmured lambert thoughtfully for evidence of other guest of servant showed plainly at inquest that second shot be fired outside while garvington be indoors agnes nodded yes really seems a though freddy for once in life be telling exact truth cousin glanced at garvington lengthy letter of explanation do really believe that hoped to manage pine during illness well said agnes reluctantly freddy have tremendous faith in power of persuasion hubert must hing more for since be such cormorant for money if hubert have be laid up with broken arm be just possible that might have be worried into doing what freddy wanted if only to get rid of importunity hum sound weak garvington certainly winged pine so seems to corroborate statement in letter be such good shot that must easily have killed pine if wanted to then think that freddy be responsible for death inquired agnes with look of relief lambert appeared worried think not dear lured hubert into own private trap so a to get laid up extort money unfortunately person aware of trap waited outside killed poor husband according to what freddy say mr silver knew of trap since delivered letter to hubert mr silver knew that freddy have threatened to shoot possible burglar seems to ended agnes deliberately that mr silver be guilty why must shoot pine to whom owed so much ca say remember silver be inside house yes assented lady agnes in dismay be true be great puzzle noel however be not trying to solve clara say that mr silver will hold tongue certainly a letter be now in possession can not bring forward evidence to show that be inculpated in matter think best thing to do be to let freddy mr silver fight out matter between while be on honeymoon lambert started agnes what do mean grew impatient oh what be use of asking what mean when know quite well noel hubert insulted in will cast slur on character by forbidding to marry freddy although did not fire second shot certainly lured hubert to death by forging that letter intend to consider husband memory more brother position will never speak to again if can help a be wicked

distressed have only five hundred year have be accustomed to such luxury have five hundred year of own said agnes obstinately hubert settled on for pin money refused to make other settlement have right to money since sacrificed so much will keep surely can live on one thousand year in england inquired lambert doubtfully after have led luxurious life said quickly mean in colony let go to

intercepted letter pine be furious a knew must be said that must come to blue door at appointed time to prevent supposed elopement told lord garvington who be ready went down pretending that pine be

did did have revolver have gave away lent panted silver cry with terror lent gave liar who to silver looked round again for way of escape must see none to miss greeby shot pine swear did chapter xix mother cockleshell be late in afternoon when lambert got back to village inn felt tired bewildered examination of silver have be so long what revealed so amazing that young man wished to be alone to rest to think over situation be very perplexing one a plainly saw since in light of new revelation seemed almost impossible to preserve name of family from disgrace seated in sitting room with leg stretched out hand in pocket lambert moodily glared at carpet recalling have be confessed by foxy secretary of miss greeby that must accuse of committing crime seemed unreasonable according to silver woman have overheard by chance scheme to lure pine to manor knowing that millionaire be coming to abbot wood secretary have propounded plan to garvington long before man arrival hence constant talk of host about burglar somewhat unnecessary threat to shoot one who tried to break into house persistence of remark have roused miss greeby curiosity noting that silver host be frequently in one company have seized opportunity to listen for time so cautious be plotter have heard nothing particular after recognition of hearne a pine when visited gypsy camp became aware that secret talk be connected with presence then chance remark of garvington be always loose tongued gave clue by threat of exposure managed to make silver confess whole plot far from thwarting agreed to let carry out promised secrecy only extracting promise that must be advised of time place for trapping of millionaire be acquiescence of miss greeby puzzled lambert on face of since be in love with be better for own private plan pine must remain alive because marriage placed agnes beyond reach why then must miss greeby have removed barrier at cost of being hanged for murder lambert have asked silver question have obtained no definite answer since secretary protested that have not explained reason jokingly referring to possible burglar have borrowed revolver from silver have obtained from garvington be action first led little secretary to suspect afterward knowing that have met pine in abbot wood kept close watch on action to see if intended to take hand in game silver protested that must see reason for doing so even up to moment when confessed to lambert must not conjecture why have acted in such manner however appeared that be duly informed of hour when pine must probably arrive to prevent pretended elopement also learned that must be hanging about blue door when silver retired for night watched door of bedroom be in same wing of mansion of own also occasionally looked out to see if pine have arrived a window of room afforded fair view of blue door shrubbery for over hour a told lambert divided attention between passage window be while looking out of last after midnight that saw miss greeby climb out of room descend to ground by mean of ivy formed natural ladder window be great height from ground be athletic woman much given to exercise wondering what intended to do yet afraid because of pine expected arrival to leave house silver watched cautiously be arrayed in long black cloak with hood said in brilliant moonlight must easily distinguish gigantic form a slipped into shrubbery when pine arrived silver saw dash at blue door when be opened by garvington saw fall back after first shot then heard shutting of door immediately afterward opening of lady agnes window noted that pine ran quickly unsteadily down path a passed shrubbery second shot came at point silver simply gave same description a lady agnes did at inquest then pine fell afterward garvington guest came out gathered round body miss greeby slipping along rear of shrubbery doubled back to shadow at corner of house silver having to play part did not wait to see re enter mansion presumed did so by clambering up ivy ran down mingled with guest servant who be clustered round dead man finally found miss greeby at elbow artlessly inquiring what have happened for time being accepted innocent attitude later on when dismissed by jarwin in want of fund sought out miss greeby accused at first denied story finally a judged that must bring home crime to compromised with by giving post of secretary at good salary when obtained forged letter from chaldea learned from lambert when be ill miss greeby made give to alleging that by showing to agnes must more positively part widow from lover miss greeby knowing who have written letter counted upon agnes guessing truth have not seen that have entered mind when letter be brought to must have given hint a to forger name agnes hesitation sudden paleness assured miss greeby that guessed truth so letter be left to work poison silver of course clamored for blackmail miss greeby promised to recompense also threatened if did not hold tongue that must accuse garvington of murder since latter have forged letter former have borrowed revolver have killed pine must have be tolerably easy for miss greeby to substantiate accusation a to share in crime have to do be to deny that silver have passed borrowed revolver on to there be way in must prove that have done so on whole silver have judged best to fall in with miss greeby plan preserve silence especially a be rich must supply with money chose to ask for be in power be in power so be necessary to act on golden rule of give take final statement silver made to lambert intimated that garvington be ignorant of truth until bullet be produced in library to fit revolver have never struck garvington that other weapon have be used to kill pine have honestly believed that silver a be actually case have remained in bedroom time until came downstairs to play part a to miss greeby being concerned in matter such idea have never entered garvington head little man hesitation in producing revolver when got inkling of truth be due to dread that if silver be accused of murder at time seemed a though secretary be guilty might turn king evidence to save neck explain very shady plot in garvington have be engaged lambert have forced cousin hand silver have be brought to book with result that young man now sat in room at inn quite convinced that miss greeby be guilty yet wondering what motive have led to act in such murderous way also lambert wondered what be best to be done in order to save family name if went to police have miss greeby arrested truth of garvington shady dealing must certainly come to light especially a silver be accessory after fact on other hand if left thing a be there be always chance hint might be thrown out by chaldea who have everything to gain nothing to lose that agnes be responsible for death of pine of course lambert not knowing that chaldea have be listening to conversation in cottage believed that girl be ignorant of true state of affair wondered how must inform that actual criminal be known without risking malignity wanted to clear character that of wife likewise wished to save family name seemed to that issue of thing lay in hand of chaldea be bent upon injuring if must be very perplexing be at point of meditation that mother cockleshell arrived at inn heard jovial voice outside judged from tone that old dame be in

spectral wood with awful light stop stop cried lambert racing to cut off woman retreat closely followed by constable miss greeby laughed scornfully instead of avoiding a crossed path darted straight towards pair in moment by dexterous touch of shoulder right left knocked over by taking unawares then sprang down path curved towards gypsy encampment at end motor be waiting so vivid be light that saw silver black figure bending down a frantically strove to start machine travelled at top speed fearful lest man must escape without then came onrush of romany attracted to glade by fire guessed from miss greeby haste that something be seriously wrong tried to stop delivering blow straight from shoulder here there everywhere woman managed to break through finally reached end of pathway here

steering gear bent only upon saving own miserable self have put car in motion must only drive in slip slop amateur way aimlessly zigzagged down sloping bank fell away to high road a motor began to gather speed miss greeby ran for life liberty ranging at length breathlessly alongside gypsy tailed behind shouting stop beast screamed miss greeby feeling fear for first time tried to grab car for purpose of swinging on board silver urged to greater speed save shrieked shrilly unhinged by deadly terror get away get away in panic twisted wheel in wrong direction big machine swerved obediently next moment miss greeby be knocked down writhed under wheel uttered tragic cry little silver cared for rendered merciless with fear sent car right over body then drove desperately down hill to gain hard road miss greeby with broken back lay on ground saw a in ghastly dream machine flash roaring along highway driven by man who must not manage even in pain smile crept over pale face be done for

lambert started to foot with oath leaving wretched woman to care of gypsy ran back to glade cottage be mass of streaming crackling flame there be water to extinguish a realized with sudden fear be terrible to think that old woman garvington be burning in furnace desperately anxious to save at least one of two lambert tried to enter door heat of fire drove back flame seemed to roar at discomfiture must hing stand helplessly gaze upon what be plainly garvington funeral pyre by time villager be making for wood whole place rang with cry of excitement dismay wintry scene be revealed only too clearly by ruddy glare by same sinister light lambert suddenly beheld chaldea at elbow gripping arm spoke hoarsely tiny rye be dead drove engine over bank smashed to pulp oh ah miss greeby be dying lambert clenched hand groaned garvington mother cockleshell be dead be dead by now said chaldea looking with callous smile at burning cottage be dead lord garvington lord garvington lambert groaned again have forgotten that now possessed title what remained of family estate avali cried chaldea clapping hand nodding toward cottage with meaning smile there be bonfire to celebrate luck chapter xxi final surprise week later lambert be seated in library of manor looking worn anxious wan appearance be not due so much to what have passed through trying a late event have be a to dread of what inspector darby be about to say that officer be beside getting ready for immediate conversation by turning over various paper produced from large well filled pocket book darby looked complacent important a examination into late tragedy have added greatly to reputation a zealous officer thing be now more ship shape a miss greeby have died after making confession of crime have be duly buried by shocked relative ash of lord garvington mother cockleshell recovered from debris of cottage have also be disposed of with religious ceremony silver broken body have be placed in unwept grave frightful catastrophe have resulted in death of four people have be talk of united kingdom for entire seven day what lambert be dreading to hear be report of miss greeby confession inspector darby have come to talk about have tried to see at village inn whither have be transferred to die have refused to let come to dying bed therefore did not know in what state of mind have passed away judging from vindictive spirit have displayed lambert fancied that have told darby whole wretched story of forged letter murder last be bound to be confessed young man have hoped against hope that miss greeby must be silent regarding garvington share in shameful plot wickedly a cousin have behaved lambert did not wish memory to be smirched family honor to be tarnished by revelation of little man true character heartily wished that evil garvington have done might be buried with whole sordid affair forgotten first lord said darby leisurely when paper be in order have to congratulate lordship on accession to title hitherto so busy have be that there have be time to do thank mr inspector regret must have succeeded through so tragic death yes yes lord feeling doe honor darby nodded sympathetically must be comfort for to know that poor cousin perished when on errand of mercy although aim be not perhaps quite in accordance with strict justice lambert stared know what mean remarked being puzzled by coupling of garvington name with good deed of course lord for to understand have better begin with miss greeby confession must touch on rather intimate thing however said inspector rather shyly meaning miss greeby be in love with exactly lord love for if will excuse mentioning so private subject caused whole catastrophe indeed young man felt sense of relief a if darby put matter in way truth about forged letter must scarcely have come to light will explain certainly lord miss greeby always wished to marry lordship knew that loved wife present lady garvington who be then lady agnes pine believed that lady agnes must sooner later run away together there be reason must think so said noel becoming scarlet of course not lord pardon again for speaking of such very private matter can scarcely make lordship understand how late sir hubert pine came by death unless be painfully frank go on mr inspector noel leaned back folded arm be frank to verge of rudeness if like oh lord certainly not darby said in shocked manner will be a delicate a possibly can well then lord miss greeby thinking that might elope with then lady agnes pine resolved to place even greater barrier between than marriage what must be possibly greater barrier honor lord strict sense of honor miss greeby thought that if got rid of sir hubert lady agnes be in possession of million that must never risk losing same for sake be right in supposing that mr inspector how did miss greeby know that lady agnes must lose money if married sir hubert told so lord when discovered that be at abbot wood camp under name of ishmael hearne real name of course lord of course having made discovery knowing how jealous sir hubert be of wife if will pardon mentioning fact miss greeby laid trap to lure to manor that might be shot listener moved uneasily now quite expected to hear revelation of garvington forgery go on mr inspector miss greeby pursued officer glancing at note knew that late mark silver who be sir hubert secretary be not well disposed toward employer a fancied that have be cheated out of proceeds of certain invention miss greeby worked on point induced silver to forge letter purporting to come from lady agnes to saying that elopement have be arranged oh lambert drew breath of relief so silver laid trap did yes lord very clever one letter be arranged by silver to fall into sir hubert hand that unfortunate gentleman came to blue door at appointed time then miss greeby who have climbed out of window of bedroom to hide in shrubbery shot unsuspecting man then got back into room very clever climber must have be lord afterward mingled with guest why did think of luring sir hubert to be shot asked noel with feigned ignorance when ran risk of being discovered ah lord therein lie cleverness of idea poor lord garvington have threatened to shoot burglar gave miss greeby idea be hope that late cousin might kill sir hubert by mistaking for robber only posted in shrubbery to shoot if sir hubert be not killed be not a know that shot fired by lord garvington only broke arm miss greeby made sure by killing very cleverly did so what about late cousin philanthropic visit to silver ah lord be mistake lordship be informed of forged letter by chaldea gypsy girl who found in sir hubert tent for sake of family wished to get silver out of country must have be dreadful a lord garvington rightly considered that name of sister name must be mentioned in connection with elopement even though be untrue therefore went to induce silver to leave country man instead of being grateful stunned lordship with blow from poker have picked up how be that known mr inspector miss greeby have truth from own lip silver threatened to denounce knowing chaldea went to london to warn oh muttered lambert thinking of what gentilla stanley have said how did find out overheard conversation between silver lord garvington in cottage lambert be relieved again since miss greeby have not evidently mentioned a being mixed up with matter yes mr inspector can guess rest unfortunate woman came down to get silver who must have hanged out of country set fire to cottage set fire to corrected darby quickly by chance a told overturned lamp of course lord garvington being senseless be burned to death gentilla stanley be also burned how did come to be there oh seems that gentilla followed hearne be grandson hear from gypsy to manor on night saw shooting said nothing not feeling sure if unsupported testimony must be sufficient to convict miss greeby however watched that lady followed to cottage to denounce prevent escape of silver who knew truth also a ascertained silver knocked old woman down stunned so also be burned to death then silver ran for motor car crushed miss greeby since must not manage machine did crush on purpose do think said darby after pause think so miss greeby be rich if pair of have escaped silver must have be able to extort money no more killed than killed by dashing into chalk pit near road be mismanagement of motor in case lambert be quiet for time be that asked looking up lord answered inspector gathering paper together be anything else likely to appear in paper lord noted said lambert slowly that there be mention of forged letter made at inquest darby nodded arranged that lord since forged letter made so free with lordship name that of present lady garvington a probably saw be only stated that late sir hubert have gone to meet secretary at manor that miss greeby knowing of coming have shot motive be ascribed a anger at late sir hubert for having lost great sum of money miss greeby entrusted to for purpose of speculation be true that such money be entrusted lost perfectly true lord saw in fact chance of hiding real truth must do good to make forged letter public must cast discredit on dead living therefore have be said doe not even hint at trap laid by silver now that party concerned be dead buried more will be heard of matter lordship can sleep in peace young man walked up down room for few minute while inspector made ready to depart noel be deeply touched by man consideration made up mind that must not lose by delicacy have shown in preserving name that of agnes from tongue of gossip saw plainly that darby be man must thoroughly trust forthwith did so mr inspector said coming forward to shake hand have acted in most kind generous manner can not show appreciation of behavior more than by telling exact truth of sad affair know truth said darby staring not exact truth closely concern honor of family a have saved that by suppressing certain evidence be only right that must know more than do know will keep quiet anything that tell lord said darby greatly pleased be anything be consistent with official duty of course also wish to know exactly how matter stand since there may be trouble with chaldea oh think so lord chaldea have married that dwarf kara servian gypsy yes be given bad time put up with because have authority over now that be romi a people call wife will make dance to playing left england yesterday for foreign part hungary fancy lord girl wo come back in hurry for kara will keep eye on lambert drew long breath of relief be glad said simply a never must have felt safe while remained in england felt safe echoed officer suspiciously host nodded told man to take seat again then without wasting further time related real truth about forged letter darby listened to recital in amazement shook head sadly over delinquency of late lord garvington well well said inspector staring to think a nobleman born bred must act in way why must nobleman be wicked a well a grocer said lambert impatiently according to socialistic press evil of humanity be to be found in aristocratic circle however know exact truth mr inspector have confided to secret concern honor of family wo abuse confidence darby rose extended hand may be sure of lord what have told will never be repeated everything in connection with matter be finished will hear no more about be glad thankful said other again drawing breath of relief to show appreciation of service darby will send substantial check oh lord must take only did duty think did great deal more than answered new lord garvington dryly have acted entirely on evidence gathered together especially on confession of miserable woman might have made public much must prefer to keep private take money from friend darby a mark of esteem for man thank lord replied inspector straightly deny what conscience duty to government will allow to take since put in way a be not rich man money will be welcome thank with warm hand shake inspector took departure noel offered up silent prayer of thankfulness to god that thing have turned out so admirably shifty cousin be now dead there be longer danger that honor of family for so much have be sacrificed by agnes must be smirched young man regretted death of mother cockleshell who have be so well disposed toward wife rejoiced that chaldea have left england under guardianship of kara a henceforth if knew anything of dwarf jealous disposition girl must trouble more silver be dead buried did away with possible trouble coming from quarter finally poor miss greeby who have sinned for love be out of way there be need to be anxious on account fate have made clean sweep of actor in tragedy lambert hoped that particular play be ended when inspector went away lord garvington sought out wife late cousin widow to reported have passed gave joyful assurance that nothing more must be heard in connection with late tragic event lady be delighted poor freddy sighed agnes who have quite forgiven brother now that have paid for sin behaved very badly same have good point noel ah have have said lady garvington widow shaking untidy head be selfish greedy perhaps not so thoughtful a might have be there be worse people than poor freddy noel must not help smiling at somewhat guarded eulogy of
