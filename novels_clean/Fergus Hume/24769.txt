workman a have bag of tool on shoulder be looking into shop window also a paul suddenly thought seemed to be observing hay however incident be not worth noticing so continued speech to grexon tried to pawn with aaron norman said well what did get on asked hay with yawn nothing old man fainted when showed brooch be why asked if know anything strange about article hay shook head looked curiously at beecot do know anything asked seem to have something on mind about brooch there be something queer about said paul why must aaron norman faint when saw hay yawned again have better ask one eyed friend think said be one eyed be frightened sort of man there be nothing about opal serpent to make faint perhaps did so because be in shape of serpent suggested constitutional failing perhaps people hate cat other fluttering bird one eyed friend may have loathing of snake ca bear to see representation of one might be said beecot after pause aaron be strange sort of chap man with past must say make curious said grexon laughing in bored manner think will go to shop have look at come with when next go said paul have intended to call afternoon wo until hear from mother what about want to learn how came into possession of brooch pooh nonsense said hay contemptuously think too much about thing who care if pawnbroker faint why wish to go to shop be because be anxious to see lady love well when do want to go send for have address old man gorgeous being sauntered away with apparently not care in world to render anxious paul be anxious however more thought of episode of brooch stranger seemed sylvia talk of father queer habit did not make paul wonder le however resolved to write to mother be just mounting stair to do so when heard beg pardon sir beheld working man bag of tool pipe beg pardon sir said man civilly that gentleman be talking to know name sir what devil to asked paul angrily nothing sir only owes little bill go ask for then know address sir oh be hanged paul went on when man spoke again be what call man on market sir have care departed quickly paul stared what did working man mean be working man chapter iv unforeseen paul did not go near gwynne street shop for next few day much a wanted to do so being deeply in love must hardly bear to be away from sylvia even for few hour in spite of remained away for two reason first of be that awaited reply to letter written to mr beecot a wished to be able to tell aaron norman where brooch have be obtained thought by doing to ingratiate with old man perhaps if thus confidential might learn for satisfaction of curiosity why sight of brooch have produced effect on pawnbroker other reason be that not having be able to sell brooch rather pawn since did not wish to lose altogether fund be running low now have few shilling left call at office of penny weekly have resulted in return of three story a being too long not sort required editor in hasty interview admitted that liked paul work must give three pound for tale written on certain line likely to be popular with public paul did not care to set forth person idea especially a be old very sensational a required money set to work labored to produce what must bring in cash made several attempt before reached editor level be low rather than high succeeded in getting tale accepted with three golden pound in pocket exultation in heart for success seemed to bring nearer to sylvia paul returned to aerial castle found waiting for expected letter be written in low spirited sort of way characteristic of mr beecot with true motherly heart after two page of lamentation over absence description of how head of household managed to bear up against affliction of son absence mr beecot proceeded to explain about brooch why do ask about opal brooch dear boy wrote mr beecot in scratchy handwriting know be that father bought out of pawnbroker shop in stowley be town in midland father be travelling there saw brooch by chance a always thought opal unlucky be anxious to make see folly of such superstition so bought brooch took away with afterwards believe received letter from pawnbroker saying that assistant have sold brooch by mistake that time for redeeming have not run out when father bought pawnbroker asked that brooch might be returned wanted to pay back money know what father be refused at once to give back brooch insisted on wearing have bad fall while wearing then be thrown out of high dog cart father must insist on driving be sure brooch stone be unlucky a after time father forgot about let lie in jewel case for year have not worn a think be unlucky a need money darling boy hope will sell there be need to pawn a say never want to see brooch again regarding health etc etc so mr beecot wrote in verbose style with error of grammar paul saw in simple tale fresh evidence of father tyranny since made wife wear gem detested be superstitiously set against possessing dog cart episode paul remembered very well mr beecot in amiable way have patience with wife nerve never lost opportunity of placing in unpleasant position whereby might be what called hardened paul sighed to think of mother position a folded up letter have bad time with truculent husband have married ca believe became wife of own free will thought paul probably governor bullied into in own sweet way however there be nothing in letter to explain norman faint be certainly strange that pawnbroker from whom brooch have be originally purchased must have demanded back excuse given seems rather weak one however paul did not waste time in thinking over resolved to tell aaron what mother have said have received two letter from sylvia mentioning amongst other thing that father now quite well be asking after paul urging to come see father appears to have fancy for wrote sylvia so if be very nice a nice a can be perhaps wo be very angry if tell be engaged there be much more to same effect paul thought good advice intended to adopt same be necessary that must tell aaron of love if thing be to be conducted in straightforward honorable manner paul have desire to conduct otherwise having made up mind to see aaron again paul bethought of grexon hay that gentleman have never appeared again at bloomsbury garret have never even written paul be anxious that hay whom regarded a clever man of world must see old man a trans atlantic cousin say size up norman manner queer life puzzled paul not little not being very worldly be anxious to have advice of old school friend who seemed desirous of doing good turn witness desire to buy brooch so paul might be supplied with money so beecot wrote to grexon hay at camden hill chamber told intended to go to gwynne street on certain day at certain time to grexon responded by saying that be at paul service must come especially a wanted to see dulcinea of gwynne street paul laughed at phrase suppose grexon think be very quixotic thought coming to london to tilt with windmill of press don quixote be wise in spite of apparent madness grexon will recognize wisdom when see dulcinea bless humph wonder if hay must pacify father make look more kindly on ambition grexon be clever fellow thoroughly good chap so here paul paused to think incident of working man warning have given about hay recurred to mind also phrase man on market stuck in memory why must grexon hay be called so what did phrase mean paul have never heard before moreover from certain indication beecot did not think that individual with bag of tool be working man rather appeared to be person got up to play part fellow watching accosting paul alone certainly seemed doubtful character beecot regretted that have be so short with man else might have learned why have acted in way story of little bill be absurd for if grexon owed man money man must certainly have known name address of creditor altogether incident puzzled paul almost a much a of aaron fainting resolved to question grexon never crossed mind that hay be anything else what appeared to be man about town with sufficient income to live upon comfortably have paul doubted must never have asked grexon to go with to gwynne street however have done so appointment be made so there be more to be said man about town duly made appearance to very minute always keep appointment explained when paul congratulated on punctuality there be nothing annoys so much a to be kept waiting so invariably practise what preach well paul how be dulcinea of gwynne street be very well replied paul who be still young enough lover to blush have not seen since last met waited for letter from mother about brooch so might explain to aaron how got old man have be asking after oh confound brooch said grexon in cool manner want to hear about let talk of dulcinea rather let talk of

asked who be where lived seems owe money be very probable said hay equably owe most people money if man have debt against must certainly know about a to address name so thought replied paul queer thing be that told to take care called man on market what doe mean never heard phrase before have said hay proceeding calmly down somewhat steep stair man on market mean one who want to marry be eligible for heiress who come along with sufficient rent roll why must fellow like talk shibboleth of society paul shrugged shoulder ca say perhaps man guessed intended to take to see sylvia warned against a seems from phrase that wish to marry ah then dulcinea be heiress said hay fixing eye glass carefully if so need fear be almost engaged wo be on market longer what confounded cheek fellow addressing in way talking of a did suppose added with cold laugh be not necessary for to defend what rubbish replied beecot good naturedly same be strange man must have spoken to a did told to go to devil go to devil assuredly will if meet be dry reply will break head for not minding own business think can explain will do so a soon a take telegram lad be holding out for grexon be quicker sighted than paul for moment arrived at bottom of stair be about to emerge into street saw messenger do know if gent of name life here guvnor asked boy holding out buff colored envelope beecot to surprise saw own name who can be wiring to said taking telegram wait boy there may be answer skimmed through line sell brooch send back read paul puzzled father angry mother paused looked at boy got form asked lad

terrible night from time sylvia have started up in bed at sound of far distant cry of soul in agony that from what miss sylvia say ended deborah be just before church clock struck hour of twelve came down quarter of hour later did when miss sylvia woke said deborah be frightened out of seven sens must get up at once yes be about twenty minute after hour come down to see woman strong nerved a be shuddered humph said inspector assassin have time to escape begging pardon sir a murdered master be below in cellar when saw corp not that be what 'd call corp then will say precisely what mean deborah did so with such wealth of detail even hardened inspector felt creep down official back there be something terribly merciless about crime man have be bound like sheep for slaughter mouth have be sealed with brooch so that must not cry out then in sight of child servant have be slowly strangled by mean of copper wire communicated with cellar one of policeman brought up auger evidently have be used to bore hole for wire to pas through for fresh sawdust be still in whorl who doe belong to prince asked deborah be bart said deborah staring be using along with other tool to make deal box for

engaged to pretty need think done so there be accusing one said inspector grimly must get to bottom of horrible crime ah well may call wailed deborah with serping on poor mouth wriggling like eel to get free 'ark there pretty calling miss junk dashed headlong from shop shouting comfort to sylvia a went prince looked at dead man at opal serpent held in hand at one end of matter at other what be connecting link between brooch that corpse chapter viii verdict of jury a may be guessed murder of aaron norman caused tremendous sensation one day name be unknown next be in mouth of million strange circumstance of crime mystery shrouded abominable cruelty of serpent brooch having be used to seal man lip while be being slowly strangled deepened interest immensely here at last be murder worthy of wilkie collins gaboriau handling such crime a one expected to read of in novel never must hope to hear of in real life fact have for once poached on domain of fiction notwithstanding inquiry be made vigilance of police newspaper article theory sent by people who knew nothing whatever of matter nothing tangible be discovered likely to lead to discovery of assassin assassin be conjectured that two people at least have be concerned in committal of crime a weak physically though be deceased must surely not have allowed to be bound by one person however strong that person might be in such case there must certainly have be scuffle a daughter of murdered man heard cry for help be what sylvia did hear must certainly have heard noise of rough tumble struggle such a norman must have made when fighting for life that single muffled cry be have be heard then probably brooch have be pinned on mouth to seal for ever later man have be slowly strangled in sight of horrified daughter poor sylvia received severe shock after witnessing awful sight be ill for day faithful deborah attended to like slave must allow one save doctor to enter sick room bart tawsey who have be summoned to gwynne street from bed remained in empty shop attended to domestic duty miss junk required to be performed made cook viand for sylvia for herself a have be trained by before to act a emergency cook did credit to tuition also bart ran message saw that house be well locked bolted at night slept on hastily improvised bed under counter even deborah strong nerve be shaken by horror have witnessed insisted that bart must remain to protect sylvia bart be not over strong be wiry have courage of cock sparrow so while be guarding house deborah have fear must attend altogether to sick mistress one of first people to call on miss norman be dry wizen monkey of man who announced a jabez pash solicitor of deceased have so said executed aaron legal business for year knew secret yet when questioned by police must throw light on murder knew of something strange connected with matter related to detective who be now in charge of case officer be chatty agreeable pleasant faced man with brown eye brown hair brown skin also to match face doubt wore brown clothes brown boot brown hat brown tie in fact in body face hand dress be brown prevalent color produced rather strange effect must have bin dyed said miss junk when set eye on brown be better black miss sylvia though black will have to wear for poor par a be gone to better land let hope though there be knowing brown man who answered to name of hurd a genially described billy hurd saw mr pash lawyer after have examined everyone must lay hold of in hope of learning something likely to elucidate mystery what do know of matter sir asked brown man pleasantly pash screwed up face in manner worthy of monkey look must have be absolute image of one with few nut in cheek a talked in chattering sort of way very fast trifle incoherent resemblance be complete know nothing why esteemed client must meet with death said may mention that on evening of death called round to see deposited in charge four bag of jewel at least said be jewel for bag be sealed of course never opened can see bag asked hurd amiably legal monkey hopped into next room beckoned hurd to follow shortly two be looking into interior of safe wherein reposed four bag of coarse white canvas sealed tied with stout cord odd thing be said mr pash chewing word looking so absurdly like monkey that detective felt inclined to call jacko on morning of murder before heard anything about stranger came with note from esteemed client asking that bag must be handed over what sort of man well said pash fiddling with sharp chin what might call seafaring man sailor maybe must be best term be stout red faced with drink rather than with weather must think rolled on bow leg in somewhat nautical way what name did give asked hurd writing description rapidly in note book none asked who be told with many oath regret to say to mind own business insisted on having bag to take back to mr norman doubted oh yes added lawyer shrewdly doubted mr norman always did own business never in experience of employed deputy replied to unknown nautical man sailor a might say certainly smelt of rum a know be nautical drink well mr hurd replied must take bag round to mr norman at once office be in chancery lane a see not far from gwynne street so started with bag with nautical gentleman said must remain behind until returned so a to receive apology when have seen esteemed client become convinced of nautical gentleman rectitude when reached gwynne street found that mr norman be dead at once took bag back to replace in safe where now behold sailor asked hurd eyeing mr pash keenly lawyer sucked in cheek put foot on rung of chair oh clerk tell left within five minute of departure saying must not wait have seen since have not seen since be glad that saved property of client be norman rich very well off indeed did not make money out of book selling business in fact said pash putting tip of finger delicately together be rather good judge of jewel pawnbroker interrupted hurd dryly have heard about from bart tawsey shopman skip go on can only go on so far a to say that miss norman will probably inherit fortune of five thousand year beside jewel contained in bag be said mr pash wisely if jewel be not redeemed by who pawned be there will asked hurd rising to take leave pash screwed up eye inflated cheek wriggled so much that detective expected acrobatic performance be disappointed when did not come off really ca be sure on point said softly have not yet examined paper contained in safe of deceased esteemed client must never allow to make will lease yes have house property mortgage yes investment yes entrusted with business save important one of making will great many other people act in same strange way though might not think so mr hurd must never make lease let house buy property without consulting legal adviser yet in case of will most important document many prefer to draw up consequently there be much litigation over wrongly drawn document of nature better for lawyer well be off to look for nautical gentleman do think be guilty ca say said hurd smiling never speak unless be quite sure of truth will be hard to come at in case said lawyer billy detective smiled pleasantly shrugged brown shoulder so hard that may never be discovered said know many mystery be never solved suspect gwynne street crime will be one of hurd have learned great deal about opal brooch from sylvia deborah what told resulted in visiting charing cross hospital to see paul beecot young man be much worried arm be getting better doctor assured must be able to leave hospital in few day have received letter from mother whom have informed of accident bewailed danger wrote with many tear a paul saw from blotted state of letter that domestic tyrant must not allow to come to london to see wounded darling in be annoying enough paul be still more irritated excited by report of aaron terrible death saw in newspaper so much have moved that be thrown into high state of fever doctor refused to allow to read paper luckily paul for own sake have somewhat calmed down when hurd arrived so detective be permitted to see sat by bedside told patient who be beecot looked at sharply then recognized be workman said astonished yes mr beecot be hear that have not taken warning regarding friend mr grexon hay ah then knew name time of course did merely spoke to to set on guard against will do no good be at school with said beecot angrily that doe make better companion replied hurd see here mr beecot can talk of matter time at present a be allowed to converse with only for short time wish to ask about opal serpent paul sat up although hurd tried to keep down what do know of why do come to know very little want to know more a told name be billy hurd a did not tell be detective whom treasury have placed in charge of case norman murder yes have read paper few not enough doctor took from gently mr beecot let talk a little a possible where did get brooch why do want to know suspect hope hurd laughed no have be in ward time a brooch be used cruelly to seal dead man mouth seems to to inspector prince that whole secret of murder lie in tracing to original possessor now tell about said billy spread out note book will if will tell about miss norman be engaged to marry hear be ill oh be much better said hurd pausing pencil in hand distress that young lady be right when marry will marry heiress a learn from lawyer who doe business of deceased care about being heiress will take message to from certainly what be hurd spoke quite sympathetically for even though be detective be human being with kindly heart tell how sorry be will come see a soon a can leave confounded hospital thanks for kindness mr hurd now what do wish to know oh yes about opal serpent a say a think seems to be at bottom of trouble listen paul detailed knew taking story up to time of accident hurd listened attentively oh said with world of meaning so mr grexon hay be with hum do suppose pushed into road on purpose said paul staring be sure did what have to gain by acting in such way money may be sure said hurd that gentleman never doe anything without hope of substantial reward hush will talk of when be better mr beecot say brooch be lost yes must have slipped out of pocket when fell under wheel of machine believe there be number of loafer ragged creature about so be just possible may hear have be picked up have sent advertisement to paper hurd shook head wo hear said how can expect to when know brooch be used to seal dead man lip forgot that said paul faintly memory be not so good a be hurd rose will go a see be exhausted good bye wait will keep advised of how case go certainly if doctor will allow to good bye hurd went away very well satisfied with information have obtained clue a thought be led to wargrove where obtained useful information from mr beecot who gave with very bad grace offered remark about son being mixed up in case made hurd who have taken fancy to young fellow protest from wargrove hurd went to stowley in buckinghamshire interviewed pawnbroker whose assistant have wrongfully sold brooch to beecot many year before there learned fact sent back to mr jabez pash in london say sir said hurd when again in lawyer private room nautical gentleman of yours pawned that opal serpent twenty year ago more le never said monkey screwing up face chewing yes indeed pawnbroker be old man remembers customer quite well description allowing for time have elapsed answer to man who tried to get jewel from mr pash chewed meditatively then inflated cheek pooh said twenty year be long time man then man now must be quite different people never change said hurd quietly have not changed much suspect cackled lawyer rather amused grew old young have never altered look well nautical gentleman may be same pawned article under name of david green feigned one suspect then think be guilty have to prove that brooch came into possession again before can do said hurd grimly a brooch be lost in street by mr beecot see what can do however be strange that man connected with pawning of brooch so many year ago must suddenly start up again when brooch be used in connection with terrible crime be strange congratulate on having case mr hurd be interesting one to look into mighty difficult one said hurd rather depressed really see way have got together evidence can fear verdict at inquest will be wilful murder against person person unknown hurd who be not blind to own limitation like detective proved to be true prophet inquest be attended by crowd of people who might a well have stayed away for learned concerning identity of assassin be proved by evidence of sylvia deborah how murder have taken place be impossible to show who have strangled man be presumed that assassin assassin have escaped when deborah went upstairs to shout murder out of first floor window by time policeman on gwynne street beat be not in sight must have be easy for concerned in crime if more than one to escape by cellar door through passage up street to mingle with people in strand even at late hour must not be deserted else assassin assassin might have got into drury lane have proceeded towards oxford street in direction went none of numerous policeman around neighborhood on fatal night have spotted suspicious person be generally assumed from peculiar circumstance of crime that more than one person be inculpated have come out of night have committed cruel deed then have vanished into night leaving trace behind appearance of fellow whom mr pash called nautical gentleman certainly be strange led many people to believe robbery be motive for commission of crime man who be powerful must easily have overpowered little creature like norman came to rob said wiseacre finding that jewel be gone probably from memorandum finding that be in possession of lawyer attempted next morning to get so on against be placed by other people cruel circumstance of crime mere robbery must justify brooch being used to pin dead man lip together then again man being strangled before daughter eye be refinement of cruelty removed case from mere desire on part of murdered to get money finally one man a police thought must not have carried out abominable detail alone so after question have be asked evidence obtained detail shifted theory raised pro con discussed jury be obliged to bring in verdict predicted by mr hurd wilful murder against person person unknown said jury everyone agreed that be only conclusion must be arrived at of course paper took up matter asked what police be doing to permit so brutal murder to take place in crowded neighborhood in metropolis of world what be civilisation coming to etc etc same public be satisfied that police jury have done duty so inquest be held verdict be given then remains of aaron norman be committed to grave from journal everyone knew that daughter left behind be great heiress million of money said press lied a usual chapter ix castle in air so aaron norman second hand bookseller of gwynne street be dead buried may be said forgotten sylvia connected with remembered old man unhappy end public managed to forget about matter in wonderfully short space of time other event took place interested reader of newspaper more few recalled strange gwynne street crime many people when did think said that assassin must never be discovered in be wrong if money must hunt down person person who have so cruelly murdered aaron norman daughter heiress be determined that money must not be better spent billy hurd knowing about case taking profound interest in by reason of mystery environed be selected to follow up what clue there be while london be still seething with tragedy strangeness of crime mr jabez pash came to heterogeneously furnished sitting room in gwynne street to read will for there be will after deborah bart who have witnessed at request of master told mr pash of existence found in one of three safe in cellar proved to be short curt document such a man in sens must think of making when disposing of five thousand year aaron be clever business

deborah in burst of gratitude there sits upstairs with arm to put about lily queen for drying of dear eye mr pash be not at pleased at news rubbed nose hard if proper will have only be made said

positively reason why must steal so comparatively trifling article sharper a be hay flew at higher game certainly must not waste time risk liberty in stealing what must bring in only few shilling why ask detective to search for brooch said hay smiling be in detective possession said paul sullenly want to know how came to pin norman lip together ca imagine unless picked up if lost at must have be

mister ho beecot turned back on boy after be not worth arguing with liar by instinct still in case might have spoken truth norman might have appeared on scene of accident have picked up brooch paul thought must tell hurd meantime held out hand to hay in spite of bad character have heard of young man saw reason why must not be civil to until found out meantime be on guard one moment said grexon grasping outstretched hand have something to say to walked little way with paul be going in to see pash on business mean little money to be unfortunate cause of accident beecot so think might accept twenty pound so from thank same said paul gratefully yet with certain amount of caution can struggle along after be accident very unfortunate one said hay more heartily than usual will never forgive be arm right oh much better will be quite cured in week so meantime how do live manage to get along replied paul reservedly did not wish to reveal nakedness of land to such doubtful acquaintance be hard hearted sort of chap said hay coldly rather annoyed at friendly advance being flouted well then if wo accept loan let help in way come dine at room have young publisher coming also if meet will be able to do something for be under obligation to may be certain will use influence in favor come now next tuesday be week off ca have engagement at long notice paul smiled never do have engagement

year may not even inherit that what do mean be not at liberty to say with regard to dinner added paul hastily changing conversation will come if can get dress suit out of pawn then count on said hay blandly though will not let help to obtain suit however publisher will do lot for by jove what good looking girl said under breath miss maud krill appeared on doorstep where two young men stood stumbled against grexon in passing hat be off at once apologized profusely miss krill who seemed young woman of few word a paul thought from silence in office smiled bowed passed on without saying thank mr krill followed escorted by treacherous pash who be smile hand washing bow apparently be quite convinced that widow story be true paul felt sick at news must have to tell sylvia pash saw young man meeting indignant eye darted back into office like rabbit into burrow widow sailed out in calm serene way without look at paul companion yet young man have instinct that saw be mother expect said hay putting glass firmly into eye handsome pair gad paul that young woman eh perhaps 'd like to marry said paul bitterly hay drew up stiffly marry stray young woman see on street however attractive said in cold voice know of lady pash will introduce if make worth while why deuce must retorted hay staring well said beecot impulsively telling whole of misfortune have befallen be wife be daughter of aaron norman alias krill daughter inherits five thousand year so marry be happy dulcinea asked grexon dropping eye glass in amazement have poverty said paul turning away must quiet call of hay make stop at end of street looked back saw grexon entering office of lawyer if hay be man hurd said be paul guessed that must inquire about heiress marry too if banking account be large safe chapter xii new life for obvious reason beecot did not return to gwynne street be difficult to swallow bitter pill providence have administered in place of assured future with sylvia found confronted with former poverty with chance of marrying girl with obligation of telling that have right to name paul be by mean coward first impulse be to go at once inform sylvia of reverse of fortune be already late thought must be only kind to withhold bad news till morrow thus avoid giving disinherited girl tearful wakeful night therefore after walking embankment till late paul went to garret to young man credit must be said that cared very little for loss of money although grieved on sylvia account have be able to earn small income must have married girl given protection of name without smallest hesitation be yet unknown to fame be at variance with father must scarcely bring sylvia to share bitter poverty might grow still more bitter in cold cheerless garret then there be thing to consider paul have written to father explaining circumstance of engagement to sylvia asking for paternal blessing to gain mentioned that promised wife have five thousand year bully tyrant a beecot senior be loved money although well off be always on alert to have more brought into family with bribe of wealthy wife paul have little doubt what breach must be healed sylvia welcomed a sweetest most desirable daughter in law in world then paul fancied girl must be able to subdue with gentle way stubborn heart of father must also be able to make mr beecot happy indeed have received letter from mother congratulating on wealthy match for good lady wished to see paul independent of domestic tyrant also mr beecot have made many inquiry about sylvia goodness beauty hoped that have chosen wisely hinted that girl living be worthy of son after fashion of mother paul have replied to letter setting forth own unworthiness sylvia perfection mr beecot have accepted good news with joy letter written to beecot senior be yet unanswered paul began to think that not even chance of having rich daughter in law must prevail against obstinacy of old gentleman when reached garret after lonely tormenting walk on embankment found letter from father opened with trepidation proved to contain joyful news mr beecot thanked heaven that paul be not such fool a have be of yore hinted that sudden access of sense have led to engage to wealthy girl have come from father not from mother beecot senior be aware that paul have acted badly have not remembered what be due to best of father since be prepared to settle down with rich wife beecot senior nobly forgave past paul many delinquences mentioned in detail must be glad to welcome daughter in law then beecot becoming tyrant again insisted that marriage must

probably might be ignorant of person person who have slain poor wretch in so cruel manner motive of crime be to be found in norman past mr krill knew about therefore paul be very pleased when found that mr krill daughter be guest at little dinner hay room be large luxuriously furnished in effect occupied small flat in house of ex butler have furnished place in sybarite fashion ex butler wife servant looked after hay in addition that languid gentleman possessed slim valet with sly face who looked a though knew more than be good for indeed whole atmosphere of room be shady fast paul simple young fellow a be felt bad influence moment stepped into tiny drawing room be furnished daintily with great taste in color furnishing be more like woman room mr hay have spared cost in making pleasing to eye comfortable to body prevailing tone be pale yellow electric light suffused through lemon shaded louis quinze furniture be upholstered in primrose there be many persian praying mat eastern drapery about place water color picture decked wall numerous mirror reflected dainty pretty apartment brisk fire be burning although evening be not cold everything looked delightfully pleasant paul must not help contrasting luxury taste with bare garret with sylvia love to warm heart must not have changed place with grexon hay for splendor two lady be seated by fire mr krill in black majestic calm a usual wore diamond on breast jewelled star in gray hair although not young be wonderfully well preserved woman arm neck be white gleaming beautifully shaped from top of head to sole of rather large well shod foot be dressed to perfection waved languid fan a welcomed paul who be presented to by host be glad to see mr beecot said in deep voice have rather unhappy interview when last met how be miss norman be quite well replied paul in a cordial tone a must command for sake of learning what must wished to be amiable be difficult when reflected that large suave smiling woman have robbed sylvia of fortune have spoken of in contemptuous way beecot swallowing down pride held little candle to devil without revealing repugnance too openly apparently mr krill believed that composure be genuine enough for be quite at ease in presence daughter be dressed like mother save that wore pearl in place of diamond talked little a usual sat smiling young image of older woman hay also introduced paul to handsome young fellow of twenty one with rather feeble face be lord george sandal pigeon hay be plucking although have charming manner assumption of worldly wisdom be evidently one of who have come into world saddled bridled for other folk riding third lady be also present who called aurora qian hay informed friend in whisper that be actress paul then remembered that have seen name in paper a famous in light comedy be pretty kittenish with fluffy hair eternal smile be impossible to imagine greater contrast to massive firmness of mr krill than lively girlish demeanor of little woman yet paul have instinct miss qian in spite of profession odd name childish giggle be more shrewd person than looked everyone be bright merry chatty save maud krill who smiled fanned in statuesque way hay paid great attention paul knew very well that intended to marry silent woman for money must be hardly earned thought with such firm looking mother in law a mr krill must certainly prove to be dinner be delightful well cooked daintily served leisurely eaten red shaded lamp threw rosy light on white cloth glittering crystal bright silver number of diner be le than mus more than grace everyone laid out to make thing bright again maud krill may be mentioned a exception ate well held tongue merely smiling heavily when addressed paul glancing at serene face across rosy hued table wondered if really be a calm a looked if really lacked brain power mother seemed to posse be glad to see here beecot said hay smiling be very glad to be here said paul adapting to circumstance especially in such pleasant company go out much said lord george be poor author who have yet to win spur thought of being author myself said young man be such fag to think about thing want material supplied to perhaps put in mr krill in calm contemptuous way oh if wrote story like author johnny 'd rake up family history there be lot of fun there family might like giggled miss qian know lot of thing about own people must read delightfully if mr beecot set down then shrugged dainty shoulder oh dear what row there must be suppose there be skeleton in cupboard said hay suavely quite ignoring shady tenant in own there be whole dozen cupboard with skeleton to match in family said young lord why have aunt lady rachel sandal who be murdered over twenty year ago now said looking triumphantly round table of can say there be murder in family eh lady gentleman paul glanced sideways at mr krill wondering what must say wondering also how be that lord george did not know be widow of murdered lemuel krill whose name have be so widely advertised hay spoke before anyone must make remark what unpleasant subject said with pretended shudder let talk of le melodramatic thing oh why said mr krill using fan rather like to hear about murder lord george looked oddly at seemed about to speak paul thought for moment that did know about gwynne street crime intended to remark thereon if so good taste told that must be ill advised to speak turned to ask for glass of wine miss aurora qian looked in pretty shrewd way from one to other just love newgate calendar said clasping hand there be lovely plot for drama to be found there think so mr beecot read that sort of literature miss qian ah then know what people be capable of in way of cruelty mr beecot want to know retorted paul finding subject distasteful wondering why actress pressed a undoubtedly did prefer to write story to elevate mind miss qian made grimace shot meaning look at doe pay said tittering money be what want fear care for money overmuch said mr krill to in undertone know that from way spoke in mr pash office be standing up for right of will be rewarded replied meaningly what did mean paul must not understand rest of dinner passed off well enough a subject be changed lord george began to talk of racing hay responded mr krill alone seemed shocked believe in gambling said icily hope be not very down on said hay lord george propose to play bridge with lady in next room maud can play miss qian said widow will talk to mr beecot unless prefers fascination of green cloth must rather talk to replied paul bowing mr krill nodded then went out of room with younger lady three gentleman filled glass with port hay passed round box of cigar soon be smoking chatting in most amicable fashion lord george talked great deal about racing card bad luck with hay said very little now then cast glance at paul to see how be taking conversation at length when sandal became trifle vehement on subject of loss hay abruptly changed subject by refilling glass of companion want to drink to health of future bride said what cried paul staring miss krill same responded hay coldly see have taken advice intend to settle pash presented to lady when next came to office since then have be almost constantly with miss krill affection be disengaged therefore with mother consent became promised wife wish joy said lord george

from brown study who be mr krill have heard name be not uncommon name said hay untruthfully quickly be rich widow who have lately come to london where did come from ca tell that from wild of yorkshire believe have better ask oh by jove must be so rude seem to know name paul privately thought that if read paper ought certainly to know name be on point of making perhaps injudicious remark hay pointedly looked at in meaning way that held tongue more when left wine for society of lady hay squeezed friend arm in passage mention death said using politer word by preference sandal doe connect mr

sylvia pouncing on be so glad spoke paul wanted to say something to confession of thug read out looked at paul have read beecot nodded by colonel meadow taylor very interesting book rather bloodthirsty one for dearest debby got confessed miss norman along with other book from literary customer who must not pay bill be very strange paul that confession of thug must be amongst book really

exclaimed excitedly hokar said be hokar be thug remember handful of coarse brown sugar left on counter did bart tell of paul started yes by jove did be reply well then said sylvia triumphantly that sugar be goor thug eat before strangling anyone father be strangled beecot must not be impressed be certainly very strange said looking at book be queer father must have be strangled on very night when indian hokar left sugar on counter coincidence sylvia darling why must hokar leave sugar at well did eat therefore if be thug must have done so have intended to strangle father know said sylvia with look of obstinacy on pretty face remember cruel way in father be killed paul be just what indian must do then sugar oh be quite sure hawker committed crime beecot shook head strove to dissuade from entertaining idea sylvia usually so amenable to reason refused to discard theory indeed paul thought that incident of sugar be queer determined to tell hurd about matter then hawker might be found made to explain why have left goor on counter sect of thug be extinct argued paul quickly ca be sylvia be insisted be sure from firm opinion must not move finally when departed took book with promised to read novel again perhaps something might come of sylvia fancy lover spent rest of time in talking over future beecot looked hopefully towards making sufficient money to offer sylvia home also described to how have met mr krill related what be prepared to do do think must accept five hundred year paul said sylvia doubtfully must put everything right so long a be with care where live if leave decision to darling said paul think will be best to refuse offer something be wrong mr krill must not be so anxious to get out of country oh paul do think know anything about murder dear think that mr krill be far too clever woman to put neck in danger there may be chance of daughter losing money sylvia asked saw maud krill how old must take to be oh quite old paul said sylvia decisively dress well paint face be forty oh sylvia not so much a well then thirty over insisted sylvia debby think same a do think debby zeal may lead to exaggerate doe lead to exaggerate said sylvia slightly offended have eye in head a well a debby that girl that woman must say be over thirty paul in case said beecot color rising fancy see reason of mr krill desire to get out of country maud added deliberately may not be father daughter after what make think well according to marriage certificate to mr krill admission be married to father thirty year ago if maud be over thirty ca see sylvia yes sylvia colored mean may be same a be not exactly dear replied paul soothing mean that mr krill may have be widow have have little girl with when married father in case maud certainly must not get money so mr krill want to leave england in case must get said sylvia excited paul looked puzzled rather sad ca say dear replied doubtfully certainly money be left to bey daughter ' a marriage with mother unfortunately be void fear must not inherit however said grimly there must be certain pleasure in taking money from woman maud be mere puppet in hand laughed then hay must marry poor bride ended maliciously sylvia must not quite understand gave up trying to solve problem with pretty gesture of indifference what will do paul asked will see hurd tell what deborah say about age of maud krill why not see mr pash because be traitor replied beecot darkly knowing have lost confidence will certainly try give maud krill possession of money will speak to hurd who be friend yours be clever will be able to unravel tangle tell about goor also paul yes will explain everything can then will get to go down to christchurch see what happened there when father lived with maud mother what did happen paul asked sylvia anxiously nothing replied with assumption of carelessness for did not want to tell girl about fate of lady rachel sandal may find in father past life what led to murder do think mr krill have anything to do with own asked that question before still one never know must think mr krill be dangerous woman although fancy too clever to risk being hanged however hurd can find out if be in town on night father be killed be on sixth of july said sylvia yes be murdered at twelve after twelve said sylvia heard policeman on beat at quarter past then came down poor father be strangled before very eye said shuddering hush dear speak of said paul rising let talk of more interesting subject paul can think of nothing till learn who killed poor father why be killed so cruelly then must wait patiently sylvia hurd be looking after matter have confidence in hurd by jove added beecot with after thought mr krill doubled reward be concerned in matter must not risk sharpening wit of so clever man a hurd sylvia whosoever strangled father be not mr krill be indian insisted sylvia be thug paul laughed although be far from thinking might be wrong of course seemed ridiculous that thug must strangle old man in first place thug have be blotted out in second if survived certainly must not exercise devilish religion in england in third hokar putting aside offering strangled victim to bhowanee goddess of sect have reason for slaying unoffending man finally there be sailor to be accounted for sailor who have tried to get jewel from pash paul wondered if hurd have found out anything about individual be very difficult sighed beecot more go into matter more difficult doe get will see light day hurd if anyone will unravel mystery sylvia agreed with chapter xvii hurd

presented looking cool composed be more excited than one must imagine a paul saw from expression of eye detective accepted cup of coffee lighted pipe then sat down in arm chair on opposite side of

died in gwynne street explained that name of krill appeared only few time in paper be principally set forth with portrait in hand bill must think lord george be kind of young man to bother about hand bill same might have heard talk at club everyone be so stupid at event did not seem to connect mr krill with dead man even with regard to death of aunt fancied might not be same woman what as must be said hurd contemptuously think have much brain confessed paul shrugging shoulder asked if thought mr krill be same a landlady of 'the red pig denied that be like telling lie in case hope departure from truth will be pardoned did very right said detective fewer people know about matter better especially chatterbox like young fool do know yes under name of count de la tour know of in way will reveal later hay be still fleecing be lord george seems to be growing suspicious of hay paul related conversation have with young man hurd grunted be sorry said want to catch hay red handed if lord

krill death in spite of apparent frankness detective have idea that something be being kept back what that something might be determined to find out however thought be turned in direction by note from beecot addressed to at red pig asking to come at once to jubileetown laundry believe have discovered person who stole opal brooch from wrote paul deborah have made discovery connected with norman may prove to be of service wondering what discovery might be wondering also who have taken brooch hurd arranged that jessop hokar must remain at christchurch under eye of two plain clothes official managed duty so dexterously that matilda junk be far from guessing what be going on moreover informed detective who thought be commercial gent that intended to pay visit to sister mr tawsey demanded address hurd gave readily enough thought that if matilda knew anything such a absence of mr krill from hotel during early part of july deborah might induce to talk freely hokar have proved difficult subject whether be too grateful to mr krill to speak out whether really did not understand what be asked of certainly showed talent for holding tongue however hurd saw well enough that man be afraid of sahib law when matter came to crisis must try prove innocence even at cost of implicating others therefore with easy mind detective left two witness being watched at christchurch repaired to town where aurora informed of interview with hay billy approved of way in sister have managed matter guessed that hay be man who put mr krill on track of husband said with satisfaction be quite sure how spotted man oh one eye identified said aurora who be eating chocolate a usual norman fainting at sight of brooch confirmed hay belief a to who be wonder did make bargain with norman on own hurd shook head must have paid so well said wisely norman must have parted only with small sum whereas murder will bring in hay clear five thousand year when marries girl hay acted cleverly enough tell have nothing to do with murder may be so though trust mr krill might have strangled husband so a to get money what make think did asked aurora doubtfully well see from what jessop say mr krill be devotedly attached to maud may have be anxious to revenge daughter on krill acted like brute fastened child lip together so mr krill treated in same way hum said miss qian reflectively can prove that mr krill be in town on night of murder be what be going to find out said have to do be to keep eye on hay oh wo cut if be what mean think everything be square now that have got boy to stop chattering will marry maud annex money may marry maud said hurd emphatically certainly wo get five thousand year miss norman will hold on cried aurora shrewdly maud may not be lemuel krill child may have be born before krill married mother in case sylvia norman be child of legal marriage krill certainly committed bigamy so daughter sylvia ca inherit well said hurd ca say will see pash about matter after will

later first must clear ground by telling miss norman what have discovered at christchurch so mr purr rather unwillingly for felt importance of position be bundled out of room hurd sat down to relate late adventure did clearly slowly be interrupted frequently by exclamation of astonishment from two hearer so there said detective when finishing have beginning of end then think that mr krill killed husband asked paul dubiously ca say for certain be cautious reply think so on face of evidence have heard what do say say anything said sylvia before paul must reply mr hurd have better read paper be found by deborah in old box belonging to father be brought from gwynne street gave detective several sheet of blue foolscap pinned together closely written in shaky handwriting of aaron norman hurd looked at rather dubiously what be asked paper referred to in unfinished scrap of writing be discovered behind safe explained paul norman evidently wrote out placed in pocket where forgot deborah

what be writing about asked hurd turning over closely written sheet to save time have better give precis of matter be important very must say responded paul emphatically contains account of norman life from time left christchurch hum hurd eye brightened will read at leisure at present moment might say what can well know good deal of said paul who did talking at sign from sylvia seems that norman 'd better stick to old name left christchurch because be afraid of being accused of murdering lady rachel be really murdered norman doe say swears know nothing about matter first intimation have be when jessop came down with news after blundering into wrong bedroom hint that mr krill killed can prove that ca give proof at event doe declares that when wife daughter oh doe call maud

seen body wanted to run out call neighbor how old doe norman say be about fifteen quite old enough to make thing unpleasant then ca inherit money said hurd decisively cried beecot quickly sylvia think so to go on with norman confession must not let maud go began to scream feared lest must alarm neighbor tied handkerchief across lip got free again began to scream then cruelly fastened lip together with opal brooch where did get that if innocent declared that spied on floor of sitting room near wife foot then hint that strangled lady rachel to get turn into money a be desperately in need of cash for maud mr krill idolized child know that snapped hurd go on when norman fastened child lip together mr krill threw on in rage knocked insensible then ran away walked through night until at dawn came to distant railway station there took ticket went to london concealed until there be chance of being discovered besides saw verdict of jury in newspaper be determined must not go back to wife because threatened in what way ah said paul while sylvia shuddered in strange way when fastened child lip together mr krill said that must do same to one day with same brooch hurd uttered exclamation so be why wanted brooch so much exclaimed eagerly yes told hay wanted though did not reveal reason said if got brooch must be allowed to marry maud with whom hay be deeply in love hay stumbled across by accident happened to have brooch rest know said hurd know how brooch came into possession of mr krill again to use in cruel way threatened well said sylvia quickly be sure if mr krill did get brooch
