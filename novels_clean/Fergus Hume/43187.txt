at nothing to accomplish desire be true that be principally on account of opal that desired to marry dona dolores be also in love with beauty adored in sensual brutish fashion made jack grind teeth clench hand at very thought yet be undeniably clever man skilled in diplomatic intrigue therefore might be that revolt against established government of cholacaca must end in assuming dictatorship in such event must certainly force dolores to become wife against power englishman must be able to hing still a have now aid of three friend duval hoped if came to worst to escape with dolores opal in philip yacht once on open sea must laugh at xuarez threat engine of bohemian be not meant for show what jack feared be that don hypolito might have resorted to strong measure carried off dolores with to acauhtzin hitherto there have be suspicion that intended to revolt so lulled by sense of false security dolores might have permitted to be kidnapped in case jack hardly knew what to do still might be that nothing have happened save withdrawal of xuarez to acauhtzin duval fervently hoped that friend might arrive at tlatonac before out break of hostility provided started fair with xuarez in game jack hoped to come off winner dolores opal republic being stake if start to morrow will not be long before reach chalacaca thought jack a leaned over taffrail looking absently at dull hued water once

preserving much to disgust of philip who hated yacht to be overloaded with such debris with painful candour prevailed between told peter that must only take half meek doctor waxed indignant refused to go without what called necessary so in end philip have to give in then bohemian turned prow westward dipping nose in salt brine followed in track of columbus chapter iv in track of columbus spread

glow within sunset heart anguish for magic strand so depart notwithstanding notoriety of atlantic ocean for storm bohemian met with little bad weather during voyage to cholacaca blue sky blue sea fair wind be ideal cruise have not be necessary to reach tlatonac with a little delay a possible philip must willingly have prolonged ocean tramping for indefinite period jack however be anxious to see dolores special correspondent looked forward eagerly to fierce delight of possible battle peter hankered after insect tribe of central america so in deference to wish philip made yacht act well up to reputation a fast boat bohemian did not belie fame made bee line straight for destination ignoring lisbon where boat generally touch on way to south america yacht held on straight for azores passed in night continued course to cuba from whence must drop down to tlatonac in few day touched at havana be trifle out of course at express request of jack who have few commission to fulfil for dolores

warm tropic night else stayed in saloon listening to philip piano playing jack singing tim also sang in pleasant tenor voice often favoured company with varied selection of ditty ranging from pathetic irish melody to latest music hall song of day peter be most unmusical member of party save talking did little else to amuse friend be true that offered to give lecture on lepidopterous moth offer be promptly refused on score that must be dull peter must not understand such adjective being applied to so interesting subject be at one of symposium jack gave description of political situation in cholacaca information peculiarly acceptable to tim who be anxious to be thoroughly acquainted with local affair of country on reaching tlatonac wrote capital article embodying jack information sent off at once to morning planet in whose column duly appeared gave british public excellent idea of don hypolito reason for rebelling against established government of republic tim article be brutally

purple sky mirrored flashing point in deep so that yacht cut way through glittering sea of planetary splendour sail be furled light breeze made humming noise in taut hemp of rigging from wide mouth of funnel floated faint trail of smoke steady screw with monotonous repetition throbbed like beating heart water hissing like serpent streamed past black side of boat at prow white foam boiled like witch cauldron a rose fell on heaving plain be wonderfully charming voyager seated on deck felt to be so after time conversation ceased remained silent drinking in beauty of night infinite magic of sea peter unromantic peter be first to break charm with commonplace remark hope will get fresh milk in cuba be tired of swiss stuff heathen cried tim in disgusted tone think of nothing fat little paunch

in chair will then know side to take don miguel don hypolito go on jack peter hold tongue interrupt will give order for removal overboard doctor grinned expressed desire to know jack have to say on subject whereat duval without wasting time plunged at once into middle of subject be difficult task said rubbing chin in perplexity first must know geography of cholacaca have more depth than breadth being strip of country lying south of yucatan about four hundred mile long two hundred broad tlatonac chief town be in south acauhtzin second city in north about three hundred mile intervening there be other town of more le importance in interior most of cholacaca consists of dense forest inhabited by indian dotted with buried city one of contains temple of harlequin opal suppose said philip

construct railway to acauhtzin how far have constructed fifty mile thereabouts now that war be on tapis expect work will have to be abandoned failing railway only way to get to second capital be by water so see communication between two town be not so perfect a might be thus offer good opportunity to don hypolito to make thing nasty for government there be doubt of provided don hypolito can secure allegiance of navy navy said peter in surprise mean to say jack that cholacaca have navy very good one a south american navy go have three war ship named respectively columbus cortes pizarro first class vessel government have also sent to england for two torpedo boat be expected out shortly then if don hypolito command navy can do what like not exactly tlatonac be well fortified war ship

trust indian that hold good of government also take judging from opal story said philip reflectively seems to that indian business depends on stone doubt if don hypolito secures dolores opal indian out of sheer superstition will side with against government in case be too near tlatonac to be pleasant be plan of don if please asked tim who be scribbling shorthand note in pocket book hum will have to ask xuarez about then wo tell so far a can judge will win over navy to side establish head quarter at acauhtzin make thing unpleasant round with navy of three can blockade tlatonac what about torpedo boat doubt be on way out from england if war ship can stop certainly will torpedo boat be unpleasant thing to handle yes suppose war ship will try force in charge of two torpedo boat wo know of disaffection of navy so possibly commander will be decoyed on board ship rebel can place own men in charge of torpederas in case said philip after pause must be a well to use yacht to warn before enter harbour dear philip if tried on game rebel must send war ship after bohemian must be knocked to bit not if get start will back speed against whole cholacacan navy when bohemian have furnace going be like streak of greased lightning after said peter yawning see why need anticipate evil don hypolito may not have rebelled navy may still be loyal to government what cried tim sticking chin in air d think have come mile to see flash in pan if don hypolito doe revolt will consider deceived want war blood red war plenty of barbaric wretch said philip indolently war be invented to fill empty column of paper during silly season not must mind war will see more remarked jack confidently xuarez be bent on becoming dictator of republic a president gomez wo care about being kicked out will be case of war to knife what kind of man be xuarez be like napoleon wonderful man can tell can see from face that be born to command if gain day wo be content with playing at dictator not will make
