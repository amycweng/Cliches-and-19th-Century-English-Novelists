that heart margery pointed fat finger to card in question miss bull muttered something about eyesight getting worse madame knew that be just done to annoy a miss bull sight be excellent to revenge took margery away go tell servant to send up negus sandwich said sharply margery rose heavily be huge girl of twenty year of age apparently very stupid why sharp little miss bull who loved one have taken to one knew two be inseparable seeing madame usually kept margery hard at work in other quarter so a to part from old maid with cunning of animal margery be very much of type girl managed to see great deal of one friend madame have idea of reason for at present moment did not think be necessary to interfere be quite capable of crushing miss bull when need arose meantime vented temper by sending margery away girl departed with scowl angry look at aunt miss bull never raised eye though be well aware of what be going on madame be not to be beaten tell what dear miss bull said smiling graciously since have broken through rule have produced card will tell fortune yours asked miss bull looking up for first time madame shook head know mine tell mr rasper if invention will succeed

jersey kept own counsel still continued to smile have quite made up mind how to act lady gentleman said standing in middle of drawing room must disperse to night at ten have business to attend to so request will all retire at hour in mean time miss bull have kindly consented to tell fortune be extraordinary to see how withered old people crowded round table several fate have long since be settled so what must expect card to tell save that must one die soon be difficult to say yet so ineradicable be wish to know future in human breast that be a eager a youth to hear what must befall miss bull wholly unmoved by senile excitement dealt card with air of sphinx madame meantime retired to throne saw that servant arranged tray properly have gigantic chair be jokingly called throne here received

a rule have great self command sometimes gave way to paroxysm of passion be really terrifying margery alone have be witness of mr jersey passed for dear gentle old lady mr harmer be to be married announced mr taine leaving circle round card table how extraordinary so extraordinary that ca possibly be true said mr harmer dryly unless madame will accept added bowing must recommend miss bull

general company train have long ago gone to hear miss bull tell fortune from laughter be evident that future be being prophesied cried train will never marry literary man must keep away from fascination of female society do agree with mr brendan asked mr jersey curiously shook head laughed be not hermit mr jersey then miss bull must prophesy about marriage come at first brendon be unwilling to go after persuasion submitted to be led to table miss bull be quite willing to do what be asked of spread out card brendon waited beside mr jersey with most indifferent air be far more

come true never sighed in effective manner miss bull continued mystic counting told madame lot of thing about house be known to most present mr jersey laughed sneered suddenly miss bull turned up black card will meet with violent death said one shuddered chapter ii brendon story if miss bull wished to make madame uncomfortable certainly succeeded from being voluble mr jersey became silent fresh color died out of face lip moved nervously twice did make effort to overcome emotion time failed afterward took seat by fire stared into flame with anxious look a though saw therein fulfillment of dismal prophecy depression communicated to rest of company shortly before ten friend took departure idea of being alone seemed to cheer mr jersey accompanied departing guest to front door be comparatively thick fog yet not so bad that visitor might hope to reach home for time mr jersey stood in doorway at top of step shook hand with who be going boarder who be old chilly be too wise to

particular a to bolt bar be secretive woman never said anything to about fear if have be great friend replied old maid bluntly be not madame behaved in extremely rude manner have lived must have given notice never liked added miss bull with feminine spite will be more likely to speak truth then said quex cynically turned to examine body madame be still in black silk dress wore on previous night seated at round center table have evidently be struck from behind killed before have time to cry out arm be on table head have fallen forward furniture of room be not in disorder red table cloth be not even ruffled murder have be committed without haste noise a quex pointed out to miss bull whosoever murdered must have be friend said doe seem friendly act to kill defenseless woman said miss bull looking coldly on limp figure quite understand what mean be that mr jersey knew person who killed miss bull shook head agree with observed quex be astonished that must dare to contradict be struck from behind before have time to turn head quite so assassin must have entered room unless deceased be deaf madame have particularly sharp ear then that make more certain have one unexpected entered must have be on alert there must have be struggle now see that furniture be not disturbed therefore can argue from mr jersey be in friendly conversation with assassin be seated at table assassin be at back show certain amount of trust in fact miss bull person who committed murder be last person mr jersey expected to hurt in way have enemy that knew of talk rather of friend said quex coolly have not be listening to argument oh quite understand fancy madame have friend be woman who kept very much to herself do know anything of past absolutely nothing took house fourteen fifteen year ago believe

to miss bull family history searched for weapon with crime have be committed must find none there be blood on furniture although have trickled down from wound onto table cloth blow must have be struck strongly surely with power of deadly hatred be at moment that doctor arrived turning body over to quex conducted miss bull back to drawing room where examined who be in house have one left morning asked jarvey have seen mr granger go out said so even while be speaking mr granger returned filled with suspicion quex examined first granger when saw what inspector be bent upon expressed greatest indignation how dare accuse gentleman of such thing cried went out to compose nerve into fog asked quex doubtfully yes sir must have gone out into snow hail if have desired there be intimation that none be to leave house have notice be given to effect must have remained beg pardon said quex seeing that old gentleman be fuming seeing also that senile creature with so sheeplike face be innocent enough be duty to be suspicious not to accuse innocent people of crime sir for sake of example will tell what did with since leaving drawing room last night at ten certainly have reason to conceal doings officer said mr granger angrily retired to bedroom at ten to bed last saw of madame be standing on door step bidding farewell to guest in morning be awakened by news of murder went out to walk off horror produced by sight of poor woman did see body saw body till miss bull turned out locked door put in miss bull sharply be a well that nothing must be disturbed in room till police arrived be argument very good one said quex approvingly have head on shoulder miss father be general replied old maid nodding inherit talent for organization next witness examined be margery refused to open mouth unless sat by miss bull old maid held margery hand coaxed into answering when proved recalcitrant quex must not admire way in miss bull managed lumpish creature left drawing room with lady asked indicating miss bull speaking in persuasive tone yes played 'patience ' in miss bull bedroom did twice at what time did leave about eleven just before did clock strike hour when be in own bedroom said margery trying to collect wit when be in passage what be doing in passage must only take few minute to get to room must not yes put in miss bull bedroom be on second floor margery be on fourth right above head must easily have got to room before clock struck margery did try to admitted girl aunt kept talking quex sat up did speak to aunt at hour yes met walking up to room scolded for being out of bed at hour said have be with miss bull madame made polite remark about said old maid grimly oh can well understand what said must seem mr inspector that margery be last person to see madame alive will see said quex who be not going to be taught business even by so clever person a miss bull be there one else about asked margery aunt said that one be in bed that must not have clock struck eleven called name then took by arm pushed into room locked door yes did nodded margery vindictively locked door why did do asked quex staring know be doing anything grumbled margery said must have wandering about house at hour of night locked in must get out morning till miss bull let out margery usually brings cup of tea explained miss bull a did not come morning a usual be anxious when alarm came went to look for margery in room key be in door door be locked released margery oh key be in door mused quex must seem then that deceased simply turned key left humph wonder why locked girl in miss bull shrugged thin shoulder be spite on part said madame never cared to see margery with because love so said girl with adoring look miss bull patted hand fondly be strange thought inspector so clever refined woman must love so stupid coarse looking girl like doe not always draw to like while quex be thus examining witness train brendon be seated in sitting room of former discussing crime brendon be gloomy for in unexpected death of mr jersey saw downfall of hope of proving legitimacy there be chance of marrying dorothy now said with sigh will remain plain george brendon to end of day bachelor at that be awful gasped leonard who be white haggard never expected that search for type must lead into neighborhood of tragedy who must have killed ca say wonder if death have anything to do with affair brendon looked up suddenly with stern flushed face train said sharply do say nothing about what told last night yes what told might lead to discovery of assassin care if doe said brendon angrily rising to foot to emphasize determination be to keep confidence oh sha say anything do think think nothing be sure that affair have nothing to do with death came to see mr jersey morning must have have truth out of be dead so project go to four wind want spoken of can depend upon said leonard dominated by strong will of friend who must have tell know cried george restlessly how do harp on subject be subject of hour retorted train most unpleasant one here will have to remain until police officer question what story will tell story one told to retorted brendon well said leonard after pause can rely upon will not say anything to get into trouble brendon laughed not pleasantly good fellow have done nothing wrong even if tale be told must not be accused of having to do anything with murder oh did mean that for one moment protested train uneasily know did nevertheless if police inspector knew that told might get into stupid head well brendon broke off abruptly know what might think however will answer question a to visit here then go away will go also said train with shudder ca stop here after what have occurred be terrible to think of poor woman murdered how lucky locked door last night brendon stopped in walk looked sharply at young man why did lock door asked surprised well see after mr jersey came into sitting room did like to think of prowling about one be so helpless when one be asleep train shuddered did expect to murder asked brendon derisively did expect anything retorted leonard rather nettled did want to come into room so got out of bed locked sitting room door not bedroom door sitting room door so be quite safe from prying brendon looked steadily at train gave short laugh yes a locked sitting room door must a little enter a must go out leonard paused pinched lip think will be wise for to tell inspector why not be innocent that go without saying answered george sharply le have to do with unpleasant matter better suppose in common with one else here will be called to give evidence at inquest once be done mr jersey be safely buried wash hand of whole affair train shuddered so do said be last man in world to wish to pursue subject who can be guilty must be one in house suppose so replied brendon unless mr jersey have visitor last night till have have said leonard when locked sitting room door be about half past eleven think closing of front door deuce did yes put head out listened to see if be quiet distinctly heard front door close must have have visitor said brendon thoughtfully yet a alone must have let that visitor out a must have be alive to do so visitor can not be assassin visitor might have killed then have closed door how do know visitor be man might have be woman besides miss bull told that door be locked a usual that took key morning to open from mr jersey pocket no train person who killed mr jersey be in house be must say a little a possible to inspector about leonard took advice when questioned simply stated that have retired to bed at eleven have heard nothing brendon made similar statement quex saw reason to doubt evidence questioned boarder servant must learn nothing likely to throw light on darkness concealed crime one have heard noise in night one have heard scream be conclusively proved that one in house be in bed by eleven o'clock majority indeed before hour jarvey have be last to retire at past ten o'clock then have left madame in sitting room with book glass of negus sent off in hurry with a expressed flea in ear being somewhat out of temper be thus apparent that margery who saw madame at striking of hour be last person to see alive mr jersey went to own sitting room there have be struck down be about twelve o'clock that be stabbed said doctor after have made examination can go only by condition of body must say little before after twelve be stabbed in neck with sharp instrument with knife said inspector rejoined doctor decisively be with dagger by kind of stiletto be not by ordinary knife that wound be inflicted then doctor who loved to hear talk went into technical detail about death proved beyond doubt that mr jersey must have died almost immediately with hardly groan for reason quex took one into chamber of death showed corpse perhaps expected that sight must shake nerve of murderer supposing murderer be among who saw body one flinched in way expected mr jersey be a dead a door nail one knew one must prove who have struck blow chapter iv nine day wonder on account of mystery murder of mr jersey made great sensation season be dull there be nothing of interest in newspaper therefore mysterious crime be godsend to reporter flocked in shoal to amelia square haunted jersey mansion like unquiet ghost whenever boarder went out for walk must be questioned by eager gentleman of press idle sightseer of morbid turn of mind came to look at place where crime have be committed picture of house appeared in several paper from being peaceful neighborhood amelia square became quite lively boarder found most unpleasant rude awakening from sleepy life be too much for majority made preparation to leave a soon a inquest be over until then be under police surveillance must not leave neighborhood restriction in be sufficiently unpleasant brendon found particularly so a be anxious to get back to own room at kensington to work even when told inspector quex that be merely visitor knew nothing about matter zealous officer objected to going perhaps have brendon insisted might have gained point did not think be worth while to make fact of stay in jersey mansion too public therefore held peace stopped with leonard a usual two men be not such friend a have be why train have changed toward brendon must not understand ever since leonard have be submitted to ordeal of seeing corpse have be altered man from being gay be now dull instead of talking volubly a usually did be silent for hour at stretch appeared to shun brendon company george knew that train be impressionable sensitive thought that sight of dead ordeal of examination have be too much for weak nerve might have be case leonard never gave satisfaction of knowing if diagnosis be correct after time george ceased to ply with question contented with usual courtesy of life in heart felt change deeply fool a train be brendon liked sufficiently to resent altered demeanor at inquest nothing be discovered likely to elucidate mystery boarder gave same evidence have already given to quex certainly came out that miss bull have prophesied that madame must die violent death when questioned on point merely said that have done so because death card have be turned up taken in conjunction with card according to reading employed by fortune teller violent death be assuredly prophesied a miss bull said one be more astonished than at speedy fulfillment of prediction told fortune on night for amusement only said a believe there be sense in such thing be mere chance nothing more be not believer in card a prophet coincidence be so extraordinary that several of newspaper hinted that old maid knew more than chose to tell miss bull be up in arm at once after consulting solicitor threatened action for libel until such statement be withdrawn certainly on face of accusation be absurd majority of people who did believe in fortune telling by card insisted that miss bull be quite adept several urged to set up in business promising patronage little old maid drew up mentioning that father have be general refused to entertain idea beyond episode there be little interest to be found in detail of inquest appeared that one be in bed by eleven one have slept soundly more le that be astonished shocked when tragedy came to light next morning train must have created sensation by stating that have heard front door open after eleven true to promise to george said nothing about miss bull on other hand declared that front door be locked a usual that have taken key from dead woman pocket to open when police entered must appear that mr jersey have be murdered by one in house yet not one scrap of evidence must be found to show that one in house must possibly be guilty boarder be old servant ordinary human being motive must be assigned to one person for committal of so cruel crime moreover fact that instrument used be stiletto doctor held to showed that crime must have be committed by foreigner only foreign person in house on night in question be fritz swiss waiter must not have killed fly moreover exculpated entirely with aid of jarvey in whose room slept jury brought in verdict of murder against person person unknown be must be done toward elucidation of amelia square crime there be only one thing be spoken of said quex when saw boarder in drawing room for last time seems that mr jersey always put out light above door at eleven when guest departed on occasion burned night a shine behind crimson glass red window might be guide to one who did not know house who have be given that sign whereby to distinguish can explain said granger who be present when madame be bidding farewell to guest thought that of might be lost in fog therefore called out after that must let light burn later so that might be able to retrace step well said quex scratching head that explanation be clear there be use for put in miss bull since front door be locked one entered house on night be just said inspector sagaciously a lady gentleman be clearly innocent crime must have be committed by one from outside now be there one to whom madame gave latch key none of have latch key said harmer madame must not allow such thing oh mean like mr harmer at age latch key be not necessary mr jersey may have given one to friend of hers who came to see on night have friend in whom must place such confidence said miss bull decisively trusted one far think have single friend outside house very few in muttered mr taine who on various occasion have suffered from madame tongue in case said quex rising to take leave there be nothing more to be discussed who killed mr jersey why be killed will probably never be known lady gentleman good day inspector bowed stiffly out of room with air of man who washed hand of whole concern after what must do there be proof likely to indicate one a assassin since leonard kept silent on point of front door having be opened after eleven be impossible to say that criminal have entered house have mr inspector known of might have made further inquiry knew nothing departed extremely perplexed amelia square crime be one of mysterious murder must have to be relegated to obscurity for sheer want of evidence when be going back to duke street asked brendon a took leave of train very day replied young man gloomily want to stop moment longer than can help in awful house expect many of others be of way of thinking train so far a can see there be hope of learning who killed woman if have only allowed to tell quex about door being opened might have traced assassin think so brendon shook head be foggy night whosoever entered must be able to slink away without being seen be not so sure of there be only one outlet to square there stand policeman on guard policeman must not be there time argued brendon to say nothing of fog must hide one desirous of evading recognition a assassin assuredly must have wished same wish have told quex well then tell if like said george vexed with pertinacity asked not to only because fear with weak nature one question will lead to until whole of private affair will come to light want to be known at scotland yard let alone chance might be accused of crime oh be ridiculous must not have left sitting room unless have let out there be door from bedroom be true enough answered brendon with ironical smile significance of be lost on train if whole of story came to light might be accused of helping to get rid of woman leonard hair almost rose on end how must be mixed up in well see here argued brendon who thought just a well to make train own safety depend upon discretion of too free tongue tell about house on recommendation come here come to stop with reveal reason for coming have to do with possession of secret by murdered woman to policeman must be suspicious what must be easier than for to go down stair when woman refused to confess a to legitimacy to stab then must return to bed must prove alibi on behalf by tale of having locked sitting room door train shuddered see how easily can get into trouble will say nothing wish have not come here will go abroad until blow over why said brendon in scorn what be there to blow over more will be heard of matter if hold tongue inquest be at end woman will be buried shortly will be back leading own life so far a be concerned know be not guilty must not have left room since locked that special door then a to hearing front door open may have be hallucination on part be sure be heard distinctly well brendon shrugged shoulder seemed uncomfortable dare say assassin came went in way if did door be found fast locked in morning unless miss bull be telling lie might be see what have to gain there be use talking further matter be ended so far a be concerned what will do now be going to see dorothy said brendon tell that there be chance of marriage be there for can not see way to prove legitimacy must part will probably go down country for six month so to finish novel to get rid of heartache train remained silent looking at ground then glanced at friend in doubtful way what have become of yellow holly brendon produced from pocket withered so took out of coat put into envelope do know if miss ward gave one else piece of yellow holly brendon stared at strange question not to knowledge why do ask train shuffled foot looked down again be exceptionally rare sort of thing said uneasily effect on mr jersey be so strange that wondered if connected with trouble disaster made same remark before said brendon dryly must arrive at conclusion in case see that miss ward giving holly have anything to do with mr jersey alarm if indeed be alarmed think be said train decisively if be must ask miss ward why gave yellow holly what must be sense in might learn why mr jersey be startled brendon laughed shrugged shoulder active brain be building up perfect romance declared there can be connection between dorothy mr jersey did know be coming to stop here on night yes told so when met in park in morning be then that asked to afternoon tea at afternoon tea gave holly yes seem to think did on purpose that mr jersey train interrupted quickly be who be building up romance now said never thought anything of sort do say that coincidence be strange what coincidence that must have in coat flower suppose one can call berried holly flower awakens unpleasant recollection in mr jersey breast in word train fancy that inquiry into circumstance of yellow holly may lead to detection of assassin go so far a must not be surprised if something of sort did eventuate then do go so far a said brendon with shrug however there be nothing more to be said advice to be to hold tongue lest must get into trouble be absolutely innocent so be if come to that same le said better train shook hand with more cordiality than have hitherto displayed will be silent for own sake a well a for yours said two parted leonard to pack up brendon to journey with bag for kensington men be conscious of relief when took leave of other wish have come here said train when brendon departed wish have held tongue muttered george when be in cab that fool seems to think know something about matter of course economy of mansion be disordered when crime be committed thanks to firm handling of miss bull who now took rein have fallen from hand of madame few day put different complexion on affair margery knew where aunt kept money miss bull made several of boarder behindhand pay up thus there be enough money to go on with miss bull decided to wait until after funeral before deciding what intended to do when mr jersey be buried lawyer made appearance with will be read to margery miss bull stopped beside poor girl a only friend have in world will be short concise a seemed that there be very little to leave lawyer read then looked at margery to hear what have to say girl simply stared at blankly a though not comprehending meaning miss bull touched elbow do hear what say asked rebukingly yes replied margery understand have money lawyer must have read will again miss bull held up hand be stunned with grief said miss bull be not capable of attending to business go lie down margery will speak to gentleman do exactly what like dear miss bull said margery rising then turned to lawyer let miss bull do exactly a like leave in hand most sensible thing can do said legal adviser under breath when margery have left room turned to old maid be idiot by mean be not very clever have taken great interest in a to tell truth mr james be badly treated by aunt if will explain will to will see what can be done to put thing straight be sorry for girl be devoted to be lucky have friend said mr james heartily did not care much for miss bull whose very presence seemed to inspire mistrust be acting very well on occasion moreover a margery be not likely to prove lucrative client mr james be anxious to shuffle business onto miss bull shoulder get out of a fast a must what be wish to know asked about will said miss bull laying one thin finger on document madame leaf to margery watson niece money in green box in sitting room also jewel presume mean diamond yes also if will recollect clothes of deceased lady be there nothing else asked miss bull raising black eye inquiringly what of lease of house be property of lord derrington only let house to mr jersey by year be not that rather strange very strange whole connection of lord derrington with late client be strange know that received from annuity of five hundred year lease of house by year remember from december to december now be dead annuity lapse lease naturally will not be renewed after next month be now end of november said miss bull quite composed understand to say that lease expires when december end on st of december explained james a mr jersey be dead will not be renewed lord derrington so far a know have interest in miss margery watson what interest have in mr jersey asked miss bull scenting scandal eye brightening ca tell that if must must not quite right beg pardon for asking see in interest of poor girl wish to know exactly how matter stand stand a tell said james rose to go have nothing more to do in matter connection with late mr jersey cease here one moment said miss bull quietly what of furniture be also property of lord derrington bought house a stood from executor of last owner mr anthony lockwood fifteen year ago mr jersey wished to set up boarding house so lord derrington placed in here stick in place belongs to must miss watson leave go with jewel money in green box with deceased aunt clothes very poor outfit to start life on at age said miss bull rising in prim manner by way mr james what be name of late mr lockwood executor roger ireland replied lawyer looking rather surprised why do ask for own satisfaction mr james if one else will assist poor girl will do so good day james departed with better opinion of miss bull although at time have reason to have bad one manner inspired mistrust kindly a appeared to be acting towards margery must not help thinking that there be more in action than mere philanthropy be deep one thought james must wonder if heard more of so far a james be personally concerned heard more of little woman miss bull collected boarder in drawing room after dinner made speech said that be margery watson intention to keep on house that term must be a before if chose to stop must be welcome who decided to go must have bill made out at once having thus acted a mouthpiece of margery miss bull took girl away to sitting room of late mr jersey very one in tragedy have taken place margery be unwilling to enter much le hold conversation there miss bull who have nerve to speak of very strong will laughed out of folly now dear margery said when girl be seated want to pay greatest attention to what be about to say to repeat nothing of conversation be best friend said margery looking at peaked white face with adoring eye will do say good child said miss bull patting hand be laid confidingly on lap listen child lord derrington be owner of house leased to aunt by year very strange arrangement for there ought to be explanation be going to seek from lord derrington wo tell anything miss bull old maid tightened thin lip think will said in rather ominous manner at event there be harm in trying with regard to annuity what annuity forgot know about well there be need that must seems that lord derrington allowed late aunt annuity of five hundred year know reason why did so a such reason be not pertinent to matter in hand wish to know annuity must lapse be not likely that lord derrington will continue to paused looked at girl parent be dead believe margery yes for many year have be with aunt be only relative dear miss bull better want other people interfering said miss bull in icy way well margery will see if can get lord derrington to renew lease to will be security with money in hand have counted with in bank amount to two hundred pound can continue boarding house few of boarder will go many will remain a will not get anywhere so cheap place will be nominal head of house in reality will manage do agree be slave cried margery with melodramatic intensity be friend said miss bull thin lip relaxing be lonely woman margery though still have surviving sister lip tightened again a said love dear for goodness well will keep on boarding house poor child will be preserved from terrible life must otherwise be portion how good be how good be little selfish also said miss bull kissing girl wish to leave place lose be growing old change must break heart said a though really believed that possessed organ mr jersey always said that heart be lacking in miss bull maiden breast certainly way in old woman be treating helpless girl showed that be better than looked perhaps a mr james considered miss bull have ax to grind on own account however might be from moment miss bull be in charge of amelia square establishment whatever mean used to induce lord derrington to consent certainly managed to get lease renewed in margery name of boarder went others came in place being younger added to gayety of house so be settled miss bull became person of importance be power behind throne ruled judiciously in way did do away with reputation of house a place where crime have be committed in year be forgotten chapter v lover meeting one who be one knew honorable mr ward be fluffy haired kitten of woman more like dresden china shepherdess than mere human being nothing must be prettier than face figure nothing more engaging than manner with yellow hair charming face melting blue eye managed to hold own against younger woman late mr ward lord ransome son have be fast young man devoted to turf to pretty wife be killed when riding in steeplechase two year after marriage left widow alone in world with one daughter for consolation in affliction mr ward being in want of money for deceased father have be general with nothing pay played card so well with regard to father in law that allowed good income thought be most perfect of woman lord ransome be only one of family who thought so for other relative fought rather shy of pretty pleading widow not that mr ward minded characterized woman a frump men a fool having enough to live on comfortably set up house in curzon street be thought that must marry again probably must have done so have sufficiently rich husband with title be forthcoming somehow one worth capturing ever came mr ward way a time went on chose to assume role of devoted mother a phrased to live again in daughter be quite wrong a dorothy ward be slim serious minded girl of nineteen not given to gayety be one who be anxious to marry husband with mind rather than with money how frivolous little mr ward came to have puritan daughter one ever must make out resembled mother in face in manner in taste mr ward openly lamented that dorothy be such difficult girl to manage meant that dorothy have refused several good match have declined to be guided entirely by mother opinion when earl of summerslea proposed be not accepted mr ward be furious dorothy said steadily that must never marry brute with title will marry one choose said mr ward when two be discussing matter certainly not lord summerslea rejoined dorothy steadily certainly not that penniless george brendon retorted mother will not throw away on be good man clever man man whom woman might be proud of winning mother man with money position who be what be family one ever heard of will one day when becomes famous oh a writing person a though one cared two pin about sort of thing want to see countess will never see countess of summerslea know about man be bad dissipated o lord a if mattered cried mr ward with supreme contempt father be same yet got on right be sure did said dorothy with bitter meaning upon mr ward showed claw friend called kitten be cat in reality must scratch on occasion scratching must not make dorothy lady summerslea hating brendon knowing that daughter liked be supposed by mr ward friend that young man must be sent to right about that dorothy must be kept out of way mr ward knew daughter too well to take disastrous course dear said to intimate friend if did that dorothy be just kind of annoying girl to run away with live in garret if let meet will not think of marriage dare say dorothy will get tired of brendon be so shabby in dress so poor that after time will cease to like will let follow wherever like meet on occasion will grow sick of one in ordinary case recipe might have answered dorothy respected a well a loved george brendon time met grew to admire love more mr ward became quite exasperated redoubled effort to sicken dorothy of creature a called brendon took to praising on occasion sometimes asked to dinner at same time constantly abused young walter vane who be lord derrington grandson heir be man wished dorothy to marry a one day must have title fifteen thousand year in spite of machiavellian policy dorothy still continued to love george expressed hearty dislike for walter vane whom characterized a weakling if have only grit of grandfather might respect mr ward turned pale under rouge when heard oh lord derrington be terrible old man be walter such a be must not ask to marry must marry to prince of darkness if suited purpose said daughter calmly from speech will be seen that miss ward have small respect for fascinating mother two did not assimilate a disposition be so different mr ward complained that dorothy be too religious dorothy found frivolous world in mother moved dull beyond word so happened that dorothy stayed mostly at home went out with one of aunt who be something of type while mr ward enjoyed at hurlingham monte carlo little woman always managed to keep on right side a have notion of losing position in society income lord ransome allowed within limit be extremely fast generally have number of young men at heel made use of in betting in getting box for theater for supper at cecil glove when nothing else be to be have managed thing so discreetly that one have word to say general impression be that be dear little woman with stiff daughter quite trial if old frump did praise up dorothy condemn mother be in minority thing be in position when murder of mr jersey took place dorothy read about in paper knowing that george have gone to stop in house with train be extremely anxious to hear particular wrote to kensington address asking to call received reply then saw that gave evidence at inquest two day later george made appearance at curzon street house mr ward who have be voluble in expression regarding brendon love for low company so put sailed toward with open hand always welcomed brendon in bright girlish kittenish way a be part of scheme thought so serious man must never relish frivolous mother in law hoped to get rid of in way brendon be too much in love with dorothy to mind vagary of fashionable parent dear mr brendon cried mr ward in usual gushing manner be so glad to see murder know saw name in paper how exciting how romantic tell about there be nothing to tell mr ward said george glancing round room seeing that dorothy be absent know be set forth in paper mr ward arranged on sofa laughed joyously quite exciting be said wonder who killed poor woman how did come to be there on very night died last question be asked sharply with keen glance george be rather taken aback not thinking have intention in what said answered soberly enough went to see friend mr ward be unfortunate that chose that night well of course did know said mr ward artlessly fancy knowing one living in out of way place like do know such queer people george thought knew none queerer than mr ward herself suppressed speech a impolite friend be mr leonard train really think have met father made fortune out of mustard coke something horrid what be doing there looking for character for book oh mr ward opened eye did find believe so have left house now must think one must leave after murder said mr ward dorothy will be down soon meantime tell whole thing from own clever point of view be so pertinacious that brendon have reluctantly to yield detailed event a have be reported by press concerning confidence of leonard kept silent mr ward expressed disappointment when finished tell nothing new warned must not replied brendon wondering at petulant speech surely can throw light on matter said mr ward brendon shook head fear not went to bed at eleven slept soundly until be awakened by clamor mr thought for moment doe mr train know anything nothing more than have told declared brendon uncomfortably disliked deviating from truth even in smallest particular dare not risk story of birth becoming public property be strange thought that mr ward must take profound interest in case have never before heard talk on subject to add to perplexity saw that in spite of rouge in spite of shaded window looked haggard yet be impossible that must be connected with matter in way ventured leading question why be so anxious to know about case mr ward reply rather astonished be not blind said quietly know well enough that admire daughter be poor be unknown must dorothy marry must make very bad match be aware of began george wait cried mr ward raising hand have not yet done notwithstanding disadvantage made up mind to place bar to union with daughter a seems to like love mr ward nonsense dorothy be too young to know meaning of word say like so can let stand at in spite of poverty obscurity brendon winced for mr ward tone be insolent in extreme be not willing that must marry dorothy unless hesitated unless queried george looking steadily at now come to point unless character be above suspicion what do mean know well enough here go to low house while be there mistress of be murdered george rose with indignation good heaven mr ward suspect cried oh dear must be unpleasant for daughter to have husband mixed up with shady affair be not mixed up with mr ward be unpleasant said mr ward willfully holding to opinion like find out who killed woman say nothing until do find out until assassin be brought to justice must ask to discontinue visit to dorothy brendon saw that be simply making excuse to rid of presence so a to leave way clear for walter vane be too strong man to be foiled in way speedily made up mind how to act will leave matter to miss ward mean wish to see

anxious to go there again be necessary that must do so if wanted to see guardian from force of habit still continued to call so although mr ireland have long since ceased to act in capacity george have sincere respect for frequently paid visit usually be one of ceremony of enjoyment on occasion young man went in search of knowledge ireland be eccentric character who collected of thing bill poster most collector turn attention to stamp to snuff box to autograph such like trifle mr ireland hunted for gigantic gaudy picture make gay thoroughfare of city when george entered dull old house in equally dull bloomsbury street found hall decorated with immense advertisement of bovril proceeding upstairs be met on landing by famous cat who serve to draw attention to nestle milk finally entered large room on first floor where mr ireland sat at desk surrounded by perfect art gallery here be fry chocolate there magic carpet of cook wall opposite to three window looking out onto street be plastered with theatrical advertisement more le crude in color out of drawing be not modern have be acquired by ireland in dark age when street art be in infancy effect of whole be bizarre striking george be too used to spectacle to pay much attention to gallery room be very bare so a to give space for collection mr ireland sat at mahogany desk in center be placed on square of carpet beside desk stood chair in one corner of room be safe painted green other furniture there be none what with huge picture bare floor want of curtain to window effect be comfortless dreary mr ireland did not seem to mind in least be tall old man with rather long white hair clean shaven benign face unusual height did away with impression of excessive stoutness for appeared to be a fat a daniel lambert george often wondered at size considering that man ate comparatively little mr ireland be dressed in glossy scrupulously brushed wore old fashioned gladstone collar have mild blue eye rather watery large mouth with full red lip hint of sensuality be contradicted by serenity pallor of face by life be a correct a dress a methodical a hour never be there so methodical man lived by clock with one day exactly resembled rose at certain hour retired precisely when hand on clock indicated meal be always regular have stated hour for walking when went out whether be wet fine sunny foggy man be like machine george when living with in early day have often found restriction irksome be one o'clock when brendon called mr ireland have just finished luncheon at two precisely must leave house for one hour constitutional brendon be aware of have timed visit accordingly nevertheless ireland looked at watch mentioned fact can only give hour george said know habit hour will be sufficient replied brendon taking one chair be not looking very well sir added noting fagged air of old man have not be sleeping so soundly a usual rejoined ireland producing box of cigar passing at age be now seventy five ca be expected to enjoy bed so much a young person take cigar old brand said brendon selecting one never vary replied guardian gravely pas that matchbox george have light good now can talk for next fifty five minute what be a time be short mr ireland must be sure to terminate interview exactly at stated hour george plunged immediately into business have brought hither wish to hear story of parent said deliberately cigar fell from fat finger of ireland stared in amazement at young man be rather late in day for be not asked picking up cigar recovering better late than never quoted george puffing cloud of smoke proverb be answer said ireland testily then if wish to know sir be in love be answer will lead to very explicit answer rejoined young man coolly love lead to marriage in case marriage can not take place unless know that be legitimate of course be have always maintained that be what proof have asked george eagerly ireland hesitated wiped mouth in quite unnecessary manner with red silk handkerchief father always declared that miss lockwood be lawful wife treated with respect did father ever tell where marriage be celebrated never asked did grandfather lockwood be not till after mother death that lord derrington denied marriage then mr vane be in italy never troubled about matter must have done so for sake said george indignantly certainly urged to do so said mr ireland heavily be in italy at time be only infant in arm who be nurse then jane fraser scotch nurse who afterward brought to grandfather lockwood when mr vane be murdered do remember other nurse first one have mr ireland grew indignant puffed angrily at cigar do indeed said wrathfully vulgar forward hussy be not bad looking set up for being lady here began to laugh must believe george boy be in love with father showed so plainly that be obliged to get rid of what be name eliza stokes be handsome in bouncing way what became of ca tell said ireland with sudden reserve did see after be dismissed ireland turned cigar slowly did not look at george when replied yes did when where doe not matter doe matter to cried brendon anxiously be to know about came here to see to day thought came about birth said ireland sharply that among other thing old man looked down again appeared to be in deep thought be turning over in own mind how much how little must tell george young man looked at anxiously much depended upon speech of mr ireland at last silence be broken by most unexpected remark loved mother said ireland never knew that said brendon softly for saw that man be moved at recollection of early romance never spoke of before be reply ireland laid down cigar to speak more freely yes loved rosina lockwood with heart soul be not bad looking in day george have good income preferred that scamp struck hand heavily on table with glowing eye be talking of father sir said brendon stiffly ask pardon if wish to tell story of most unfortunate affair can not hope that will keep temper be very badly treated by well with glance at george ireland nodded let dead rest in peace think will be a well said brendon coldly ireland again struck table pallid skin became deep crimson eye flashed george rose in alarm for old man struggled to speak with such obvious effort that thought apoplectic fit must end conversation hastily poured out glass of water begged ireland to loosen man shook head going to one of window opened for few moment inhaled air returned to seat more composed beg pardon george gasped when recovered voice if wish to tell anything must not speak to like have bad temper never knew that said brendon in soothing tone be always kind to have superlatively bad temper repeated ireland be child how must be angry with child wait wait will tell can give few moment be so moved with emotion with recollection of past that buried head in arm be resting on table brendon respecting feeling walked to end of room stared at picture represented star of ballet did not see saucy face twirling skirt be thinking how strange be that ireland must never have confessed love before certainly have never displayed such emotion change have come over man whereby more plainly revealed feeling than be wont to do george put down to old age to le self control consequent on same shortly heard ireland calling to returned to seat to find old man smoking quietly rather ashamed of outbreak will see more of that said be sorry to be obliged to ask for story of past said brendon apologetically mean so much to will tell can said ireland taking notice of apology looking at ash on cigar paused for moment to collect thought then began abruptly first met mother at father house in amelia square where went to take lesson in singing lockwood be famous for method in day fame be increased by appearance of mother rosina at many concert be most beautiful creature be a much admired for beauty a for voice ah what voice be like trill of lark flexible silvery with immense range be quite rage for season be called english jenny lind many offer be made to for operatic stage dare say must have accepted in end have not met with percy vane ireland hand clenched father said george willfully disregarding sign of temper how did meet saw at concert fell in love with then came to take singing lesson with voice of frog bah be mere blind be rosina lockwood be after saw oh eye of love be keen although rosina must not waste look on watched action many night have paced amelia square watching window when sang be entranced when smiled here old man shook head made effort to recover brendon saw that recital be painful to that be so anxious to get at proof of birth must have asked to desist there be too much at stake for such consideration to be shown go on said softly ireland resumed percy vane be handsome man rich warned lockwood that be in love with rosina old man must not heed be flattered by attention rosina received through season vane be in attendance on rosina at end of eloped with yes met outside st james hall eloped where did go to asked brendan eagerly can not say rosina wrote three week afterward from paris signing vane stating that be wife of percy be grandfather angry yes be angry that must have lost for be of use to a advertisement of method of singing also earned great deal of money house in amelia square be large required good deal to keep up besides anthony lockwood be extravagant that be why be left so badly off brendon shrugged shoulder be good of grandfather to leave anything said in what way be mr lockwood pleased hinted that be not quite angry well said ireland slowly twirling cigar in finger see be flattered that daughter must have married into aristocracy then there be question of marriage then lord derrington said nothing till mother be dead even then said very little be when vane be murdered at san remo that first decisively asserted that marriage have taken place did so because lockwood insisted that derrington must acknowledge a heir refused to do so said that second son be heir be walter vane father exactly now father be dead walter vane stand in shoe wish must prove marriage boy said ireland shaking head will be difficult task care how difficult be replied brendon resolutely be determined to learn truth who be lady asked ireland miss dorothy ward know anything of ireland shook head left adoration of aristocracy to lockwood said with something like sneer be here there boy to make long story short met mother in paris shortly afterward died giving birth to eliza stokes be with when died be given into charge of woman mother be buried in pre la chaise vane put up stone to oh behaved very well deny added ireland with dark face be really fond of suppose there be marriage did mother ever say anything about never asked that before be accepted fact after death of rosina husband went to italy be there too be at milan that episode occurred led to dismissal of eliza stokes what be why there be young english waiter quite boy be who fell in love with eliza when be taking charge of at htel de ville refused to marry hinted that loved father vane heard of taxed with impertinence end of be that eliza said too much be dismissed jane fraser be sent from england by vane mother to nurse look a though lady derrington believed in marriage doe admitted brendon hopefully must not have sent nurse have anything be wrong on other hand if have be quite certain about marriage might have offered to take charge of did believe father be so fond of for mother sake that must scarcely bear out of sight however eliza went jane came then father went to san remo be then two year of age did not father return to england during time when left england with mother never returned died in paris with in charge of nurse vane wandered about continent be twice in italy saw second time be at san remo if disliked father so much why did seek out to see george be child loved rosina so dearly ireland stopped gulped down emotion proceeded more calmly yes be at san remo when father be murdered never told that before said brendon never told anything before replied ireland dryly must not tell now that health be getting so bad may not live long have incurable disease will sooner later carry off want sympathy let finish story then need not refer to again have intended to leave written statement behind for george be better a can ask question about what understand understand so far said george thoughtfully about murder mr ireland who killed father be never discovered went to masked ball be seen leaving room in company of blue domino body be found on stone of beach early next morning have be stabbed to heart with stiletto asked brendon recollecting manner of mr jersey death yes hence be supposed that have be stabbed by jealous italian who have followed lady truth be never known think that vane be murdered on parade that body be thrown over onto beach man who killed must then have taken away lady who be lady blue domino one ever learned be cloaked masked father be gay man george be rumored that be in love with wife of certain officer might be that husband of course can not say blue domino may not have be woman in question whole thing be mystery father body be taken to england a lord derrington refused to acknowledge marriage lockwood took charge of remember jane fraser be nurse for many year be at san remo when murder took place yes so be eliza stokes what be doing there well waiter by way name be george also although be called after lockwood father well george rate seeing that eliza be dismissed got situation at hotel in san remo came there also during season believe two married eliza stokes never came near father what became of afterward ireland hesitated ca say said can observed george coolly be murdered other day at amelia square house a mr jersey heard of crime how do identify eliza stokes with mr jersey old nurse jane fraser told when began inquiry looked up jane who now life in little essex village told must be not much stated that when here one day on visit to have met eliza stokes in spite of age gray hair have recognized eliza told that be called mr jersey have taken boarding house in amelia square then determined to speak to mr jersey whom thought might have be present at marriage at event might know where have be celebrated be probable did said ireland a be with mother a maid when elopement took place did see mr jersey eliza stokes a still regard saw be murdered before must manage to speak to on subject did know know that eliza stokes have changed name to mr jersey be in amelia square said ireland only learned other day who told woman called miss bull said ireland miss bull repeated george remember be boarder who foretold violent death to mr jersey read about in paper ireland nodded did said also saw that be in house when mr jersey be murdered be witness can tell about there be need to tell have not time ireland looked at watch in ten minute leave for walk george remonstrated be so important not so important a health can give only ten minute george miss bull called to ask about lease of house to mr jersey knew nothing about when lockwood died sold house to lord derrington what to grandfather yes have known be purchaser must not have let have bought through agent since then heard nothing more about house did not even know be boarding establishment until appeared a such in paper other day wondered what be doing at inquest can explain ireland held up hand need explanation know that mr jersey be really eliza stokes gathered that from description given by miss bull in course of conversation suspicion be aroused by fact that lord derrington have leased amelia square house to mr jersey why did do george spoke more to than to ireland well said old man rising be belief that lord derrington know there be marriage assisted mr jersey so that must hold tongue now there be more time must go out ireland walked to door george followed knowing be vain to attempt to turn from purpose a old man be most obstinate one moment said on door step blue domino connected with father murder be never traced there be mean of tracing except wore piece of holly carried distinguishing mark holly cried george astounded yellow holly yes know how come to mention holly worn by blue domino with whom father went away have yellow berry chapter vii red man a brendon be in neighborhood of amelia square paid visit to boarding house having learned from ireland that miss bull have informed how lord derrington be connected with late mr jersey george thought just a well that must be questioned certainly miss bull who appeared to be dour secretive sort of person might not speak on other hand if must induce to be frank might learn from presuming knew reason why lord derrington have leased amelia square house to mr jersey be forlorn hope brendon be so eager to learn truth that clutched even at straw therefore on leaving ireland turned step in direction of boarding house much a disliked entering again be necessary that must do so on way brendon meditated on ireland remark about holly remembered agitation of mr jersey when saw sprig in coat have be at san remo when father be stabbed ireland have mentioned that woman with whom deceased man have left ballroom wore sprig of yellow holly have berry be red george might not have thought so much of matter yellow holly be comparatively rare evidently mr jersey alarm have be caused by recollection of murder sight of holly have revived memory wonder if have anything to do with murder mused george a turned into amelia square must have be woman in blue domino certainly be servant father must have have nothing to do with at ball must wear domino be closely masked even so by what mean must have induced father to leave room with suppose murdered for have reason to do so unless be jealousy for woman in position be absurd bah be making mountain out of mole hill eliza stokes probably never went to ball have nothing to do with blue domino with matter of crime from what ireland say however piece of yellow holly be mentioned in connection with murder mr jersey then eliza stokes probably heard of be why shivered turned pale when saw sprig in coat having thus decided question though not in very satisfactory way george rang bell be admitted into house by jarvey boy welcomed with grin a george have given crown when left mansion after inquest miss bull sir yes sir said jarvey step way introduced mr brendon into sitting room in murder have taken place be empty jarvey departed immediately to fetch miss bull george knew room well have be used by grandfather a breakfast room many meal have enjoyed at very table a furniture have be sold to lord derrington together with house table be very article of furniture at mr jersey have be stabbed when seated brendon looked from table to door wondered if assassin have entered stealthily with bared weapon have stabbed wretched woman before have time to turn head on second thought be inclined to think that assassin have be in friendly conversation with mr jersey before inflicting fatal stroke even in short distance between table door mr jersey must have have time to spring to foot give alarm thought george a seated what said to train be correct assassin engaged mr jersey in friendly conversation then watched for opportunity to strike from behind must have continued trying to puzzle out circumstance of crime that miss bull entered accompanied by margery little old maid looked whiter more haggard than ever eye gleamed brightly seemed to be in perfect health margery now being nominal head of house appeared more important kept eye on miss bull face in thing took order from superior being miss bull be despot although kindly enough margery be slave how be mr brendon said miss bull smiling in prim way without offering hand did not expect to see again why not asked george quickly miss bull shrugged thin shoulder fastened beady eye on face many of boarder left on account of madame murder so thought have done same be only visitor miss bull have be boarder must not have left murder did not scare replied miss bull indifferently suppose did only talked for sake of talking brendon knew be untrue a miss bull be not woman to waste word besides old maid eye be fixed with certain amount of curiosity on face must not conceive why be so be rather embarrassed how to begin conversation especially a margery be present something of showed in manner for miss bull drew margery hand within own nodded affably miss watson be head of house said do come to see mr brendon come to see said george hoping must send inconvenient third away did nothing of sort in case margery can stop a friend mr brendon anything say before will go further keep secret always always cried margery eye on old maid must rather die than reveal secret miss bull rather tragic dear rather tragic replied elder patting hand held have really secret worth revealing lonely old woman mr brendon solaced by friendship devotion of lonely girl margery who have flushed at rebuke stopped kissed old maid hand miss bull patted head turned cheerfully to visitor yes mr brendon said in interrogative manner again george felt awkward judged best to plunge into middle of matter get over a soon a possible called to see certain mr ireland said about lease of house have to come to ask why did so miss bull stopped patting margery hand lip tightened see what business be of yours said tartly on face of miss bull admit that question sound impertinent be anxious to learn something about mr jersey early life since know something know nothing interrupted miss bull quickly absolutely nothing came here a boarder many year ago a be custom kept to myself madame did not get on well together be not lady do know what be asked brendon shrewdly have already said that know nothing replied miss bull coldly evidently be impossible to learn anything from so secretive woman nevertheless george tried tack do know if mr jersey left writing behind asked because struck that mr jersey might have be tempted to write out relation with vane family be apparent that lord derrington have given lease of house to silence about possible marriage so for sake of niece mr jersey might have left confession must secure renewal that lease have be renewed be evident from fact that boarding house be still being carried on in old way by niece miss bull did not reply to question be not business said miss watson took possession of aunt paper be in green box said margery artlessly what did consist of asked brendon need not answer question margery said miss bull quickly from moment margery preserved lumpish silence george rose in despair will not help said taking up hat so far a can see there be reason why must help be miss bull reply rose in turn brendon saw nothing for to go yet hesitated to abandon chance of learning something from miss bull stared at pinched white face wondered if must be good appealing to love of romance be inherent in heart of woman old withered a miss bull be might soften under influence of love tale brendon disliked telling business to stranger especially anything regarding dorothy whom looked upon a sacred vestal not to be lightly mentioned however so much be at stake that determined to speak openly on bare chance of miss bull yielding must not speak in presence of girl margery be such sullen animal to mention love in presence must be like casting pearl before swine therefore turned to miss bull who stood with folded hand eyeing frigidly if must see alone said brendon miss bull cast shrewd glance at rapidly made up mind told margery to go girl looked at tigerishly a be evidently jealous sulkily withdrew when door be closed brendon resumed seat miss bull remained standing be not good sign george be now committed to certain course have to follow miss bull said deliberately what be about to tell being own private business must ask to keep to want to hear said miss bull never care for other people secret be not secret miss bull be merely that be engaged to be married indeed what interest can have for mr brendon much be woman must feel interested to certain extent in love romance be aware that be appealing to in way may regard a foolish be so anxious for certain information from what mr ireland said alone can give to put thing in nutshell be in love can forward marriage if will miss bull heard in silence a talked faint crimson flushed face softer light shone in hard eye put hand to heart a though felt cruel pain sank into chair alarmed by pallor have now returned george must have called for assistance stopped will be right shortly muttered in faint tone marriage love have to do with such thing paused then continued voice gathering strength a proceeded who be bride mr brendon be not bride yet never may be replied young man gloomily for if doe not become wife will accept one else can trust implicitly name be dorothy ward miss bull rose with ejaculation face grew red be mother honorable mr ward who married ransome son yes do know asked george surprised at emotion have heard of replied miss bull resuming seat with feigned indifference with barely concealed agitation dorothy ward handsome girl have seen in park be a good a be beautiful cried brendon enthusiastically will take word for said miss bull in softer tone mr brendon will help ask why perhaps be on account of romance perhaps because because hand clenched fought down outburst matter will do what can to forward marriage what do wish to know about mr jersey in relation to lord derrington yes be landlord of house believe be be be leased to mr jersey furniture by year by year said brendon surprised why not seven year lease in ordinary way can not say be only telling what mr jersey lawyer told lord derrington bought house from mr ireland with furniture a stood a stood gave to mr jersey turned into boarding house fifteen year ago think added took away furniture be in same condition a when left mr ireland hand believe sold on account of last owner did admitted george last owner be mr anthony lockwood be george have in mind to state that lockwood be father time be not yet ripe for such disclosure said nothing at moment be singing master finished rather lamely mr ireland told about be correct so far a know mr brendon dare say wish to know why saw mr ireland did so on behalf of margery watson a wanted girl to continue boarding house like poor creature when aunt died be left very badly off did mr jersey leave money lived principally on annuity from lord derrington ah said brendon suspicion becoming more more confirmed so allowed annuity why ca tell that with death of mr jersey annuity naturally ceased asked mr ireland about lease then sought out lord derrington represented to position of margery watson be good enough to renew lease in name on security still by year asked george still by year so now poor girl can live be good woman miss bull to help in way be not good cried miss bull vehemently god know have enough sin to repent of call good mr brendon be only desolate old woman who have have hard life must have be married settled shook head tear came into hard eye god help have have sorrow will have till die show have good heart said george alluding not to sorrow to action toward margery well miss bull rose have told what want to know hope to make use of in return for confidence must tell tell nothing cried old maid quickly wish to hear secret le said soonest mended when miss ward becomes mr brendon added with dry smile can send piece of wedding cake will not become mr brendon said george shaking head will be frank with miss bull name be not brendon rose from seat looked at steadily perusing line in face thought have seen one like before see now now tell name be be be impossible real name be george vane be lord derrington grandson little woman looked at wildly for moment then quietly slipped to ground have fainted in real earnest george rang bell for assistance margery who have evidently be lurking outside rushed in when saw friend extended pale lifeless on carpet turned on george with furious face what have be doing to poor darling demanded raised hand to strike brendon caught by wrist have be doing nothing declared quelling rage of bear by power of glance miss bull fainted unexpectedly thank goodness here be one be one of servant margery waved off one one cried took slender form of friend up in arm wait here added to george will be down soon when left room george looked at servant who be quiet respectable old woman be that girl mad asked be queer poor soul sir replied woman entirely devoted to miss bull well may be for be miss bull who manages house girl be natural sir look like replied george sitting down can go will wait here until miss bull recovers yes sir replied woman departed a closed door george heard muttering something to herself about danger of margery claw scratching brendon did not feel very comfortable on point saw that margery be kind of untamed animal who have be brought into subjection by miss bull other person must manage must return still in passion brendon feared lest must use physical violence still held ground a be anxious to learn how old maid be feeling still more anxious to find out if possible why have fainted on hearing name wonder if mr jersey told anything muttered george a looked out of window be impossible mr jersey must keep own secret so a to terrorize over derrington besides miss bull declared that recognized face wonder if knew father if can throw light on murder be strange that must be connected with matter live in same house a mr jersey upon word said george in disgust seems a though there be gang of shady people here connected with affair be moved by mention of dorothy name wonder what that meant did mean did not learn day margery returned stated that miss bull be better be too faint to resume conversation begged mr brendon to call day margery gave message in quite friendly way nodded smilingly to astonished george be better disposed toward said taking up hat miss bull told to be kind to declared still smiling then with burst of good nature will be kind do want to know about paper if choose to tell said george artfully rejoicing at opportunity offered of learning something yes do choose said margery asked to be kind to well then tell replied george humoring there be lease in green box many bill said margery few photograph be must see story what story miss watson margery nodded with cunning smile answered in whisper a though aunt be still alive within hearing told be story be writing oh long story sheet sheet of story foolscap sheet kept in long blue envelope must not let see george reflected that evidently mr jersey have be writing out account of early life margery next word put matter beyond doubt aunt said that must let have story to read after died must not find in green box perhaps did not look thoroughly suggested george yes did looked in other place must not find story be italian went on margery staring at for when aunt be looking peeped san remo be in italy be believe so replied george more more convinced that mr jersey have left confession behind did tell miss bull margery nodded said be to say word about will not be angry at telling like say be like one once knew loved brendon did not pursue conversation be afraid lest margery might say too much miss bull might be angry be necessary that must keep on good term with miss bull evidently have known father may even have loved george have heard so much that day that brain be quite bewildered wanted to be alone to think matter out only one last request made of margery will show photograph be in green box asked persuasively ca replied drawing down lip like child miss bull have will show to brightening for like like too be so handsome with laugh blush at nave compliment george left house promising to call again with head filled with many thought consequent on two interview emerged from amelia square walked down to oxford street shout aroused from day dream a reached corner saw tall red headed man crossing road cab be bearing down on man stood paralyzed in center be apparent that horse must soon be on george almost without thinking dashed into street

clever mr ward invitation invitation to dinner by jove never thought 'd get far honorable mr ward too hurrah leonard train made remark over letter have come by morning post be delicate perfumed friendly note begging dear mr train to come to dinner next evening without ceremony have just learned that dear mother be at school with wrote mr ward in most gushing style so will see why write informally do come do be underlined leonard must hardly contain for joy at proof that member of aristocracy be disposed to be friendly woman of highest fashion too chuckled leonard to account for train exuberant joy seemed out of proportion to reason must be explained that notwithstanding money what regarded a talent have never managed to enter fashionable world a be a vain a peacock anxious to shine be admired among people worth knowing be great grief to george took to several house leonard did not seem to be success for after one visit be never asked again although left card assiduously invitation of mr ward be purely voluntary a have met only once have snubbed when did meet at time have thought horrid woman now be prepared to bow down worship leonard father have be in trade nice little income inherited have be made out of patent medicine most drastic in effect claimed to cure disease train senior shrewd innkeeper have bought from one of customer drunken doctor meant for better thing who have fallen on evil day by judicious advertisement with aid of many bought testimonial from penniless member of aristocracy train managed to make drug success train trump pill be seen on boarding mr ireland possessed one of original poster soon train senior became rich very rich having improved manner suppressed parent be taken up by people of good position who needed ready money bought way into fringe of fashionable world finally married rather elderly lady who have blue blood extravagant taste money presented with leonard then thinking have done duty arranged to enjoy mr train spent proceeds of trump pill recklessly before husband died managed to get through greater part of wealth train settled income of five thousand year on son let mr train do what liked with rest then died mr train sent leonard to eton afterward to college when be thus off hand enjoyed amazingly finally died in paris after spending penny of principal interest of large fortune left by husband leonard mourned mother although have seen very little of then settled in london on five thousand year posed a literary man desire of life be to be fashionable hence delight at letter of course will go soliloquized leonard when calmer wonder if george will be there love that ward girl so might mr ward doe not approve of match so might not wonder if there be regular engagement if not might have shot honorable mr train must be mother will be seen leonard be not very faithful to absent friend fact be that train be le devoted to brendon than have be episode of amelia square made fight rather shy of george story of marriage be shady in way leonard must exactly explain how seemed to be connected with murder of mr jersey moreover leonard knew something have not mentioned to brendon must not have mentioned for fashionable world however have said nothing about george history so far have kept faith brendon saw that leonard be no longer so pleased to see a formerly therefore avoided fat young man leonard did not seem to mind avoidance indeed appeared to be rather relieved than otherwise brendon never asked reason of behavior a thought best to let sleeping dog lie that leonard must speak never entered head leonard never intended to speak being weak honorable in own foolish way when mr ward invitation came walked blindfolded into trap set by clever little woman asked train to dinner not because have known mother although be true enough for simple reason that wished to hear what knew about amelia square tragedy brendon have told much be probable that train being weak idiot in hand of pretty woman like must tell more mr ward be by mean reconciled to possibility of brendon marrying daughter wished to find scandal smirching george that might induce dorothy to break engagement must have utilized tale about lola brendon that be not sure of ground in particular direction moreover having seen spanish dancer feared lest so passionate woman must make open scandal be aim of mr ward life to do wrong thing to avoid trouble arising from therefore for time being put lola on shelf arranged in own scheming mind to make use of leonard can work like lump of putty said mr ward contemptuously vulgar illustration true one besides said in solitude of own room when be dressing for dinner so no one heard vulgarity truth when leonard entered drawing room be welcomed by dorothy who told that mr ward must be down shortly be only small dinner mr train said mr vane be coming one else expected to find friend brendon here said leonard thinking how beautiful looked mr brendon be very busy at present time with book must have come otherwise thing must give way where lady be concerned said train gallantly miss ward laughed have heard much of train from brendon thought kindly foolish young man be not woman of sort mr train have desire that man must neglect work for frivolity be great friend of mr brendon greatest have be stopping with in house where tragedy took place told about train secretly wished that george have held tongue on particular point a have own reason for not wishing to be questioned with very best intention a to holding tongue knew weakness for babbling well enough found easier to abstain from talking altogether than to be temperate in speech brendon certainly stopped with said reservedly be sound asleep when murder took place neither of heard anything after inquest returned to west end be most unpleasant experience said dorothy thoughtfully very assented train wiping face will never go in search of type again can find amusing type in west end remarked dorothy in low voice here be one young man who entered room be small attenuated precise atom of creature immaculately dressed with rather shrill voice answered to name of hon walter vane be cousin of brendon although did not know of relationship dorothy train knew compared vane physique disadvantageously with of one man be splendid specimen of humanity other peevish hypochondriac walter vane have be fast in time although be not yet thirty be now suffering from consequence of rapid way be in twenty yet be bald be a nervous a old woman finicky a elderly spinster lord derrington who be bluff old giant of country squire type sneered at degenerate descendant same must not replace by george who be man in look taste after old lord own heart beastly night lisped vane greeting dorothy taking notice of leonard think there will be snow hope wo get bad cold be so subject to cold mr train mr vane said dorothy introducing two vane stared muttered something about pleasure leonard caught other word then continued conversation with miss ward sneezed twice at merry music other night be where velez dance said leonard determined to speak vane stared again be dorothy who answered mother went to see say be most extraordinary dancer oh clever in sort of mad way regular bad one chuckled little man dorothy turned away did not like conversation a offended taste next word of vane made pause saw friend brendon at hall miss ward writing man know fine looking chap sulky best man in world said leonard whereupon dorothy gave approving look wondered what vane must say did know that man criticised so freely be cousin legitimate heir to derrington title if have right well have lark like one else say be sweet on dancer mr vane cried dorothy blood rushing to face little man became confused conscious that have transgressed bound of good breeding knew that brendon admired dorothy dorothy took pleasure in society be unaware that deeper feeling existed mr ward have kept that sort of thing from a did not want vane to leave coast clear for brendon vane be so egotistical that never for one moment dreamed that george be rival even if have must have laughed idea to scorn in eye brendon be merely writing fellow not to be named in same breath with noble attenuated rickety self well good people cried mr ward entering room at very opportune moment be here mr vane be pleased mr train how good of to come ah mr ward sighed have dear mother eye lovely eye be having slipped in compliment to put leonard at ease throw off guard mr ward delivered to dorothy took vane into shady corner dinner will be ready soon said fanning although be cold winter night hope be hungry mr vane be admitted guest have to nurse appetite carefully know mr ward be rather put out not by mr train hope be nice fellow really very nice with money made out of pig whisky something said mr ward vaguely for be not certain what did say said nothing miss ward did mr ward shrugged oh well know dear dorothy have such odd idea sort of thing suppose be something about book philosophy grammar something enough to spoil one appetite be sure mentioned that brendon know writing fellow yes know said mr ward viciously at once on alert well said that be rumored be sweet on lola velez miss ward fired up be so great friend of a that oh by mean responded mr ward vivaciously mere acquaintance know talk book believe how moth get wing like animal before flood think be goody goody be sure be dull enough lola velez oh perfect dear how can kick so mr brendon be in well never must have thought of quiet men be always worst so mr ward rattled on in incoherent manner perfectly clear in own mind a to good vane injudicious observation must do if dorothy once got into brain that george be admirer of lola then there must be chance of breaking engagement before vane must make more remark gong thundered mr ward rose at once rather glad of stoppage of conversation liked lively man vane be fool for that be quite prepared to give dorothy a must have given to prize idiot provided idiot be sufficiently rich take in dorothy said to vane thus getting off shoulder not hoping to find leonard pleasant change will take mr train under wing in order entered dining room mr ward trying to stifle yawn wondering how must get through dull evening luckily vane mentioned that grandfather have expressed intention of looking in during course of evening if will not mind mr ward said politely oh be rather glad replied little woman drawing off glove such delightful old gentleman anecdote be quite in best style told one to bishop other day said vane laughing really how amusing did bishop say said nothing looked sermon ah sighed mr ward bishop be so particular find delightful said dorothy filling in pause of course dear because talk of renan missionary sort of dry thing remember bishop of timbuctoo central africa of place one never heard of telling how old curate be eaten alive by black mosquito quite forget be eaten trust black mosquito did find curate tough be sure know be just thirty believe bald said be old curate oh dear dorothy how can expect to explain what mean at dinner too mean be young in year old in saintliness do try dish mr train be so good leonard did try did full justice to merit of mr ward cook kept particularly good chef a knew value of good cooking people like nice thing to eat explained to leonard while dorothy labored to entertain vane make one so popular if one chef can always be relied upon have known woman position ruined by inattention to kitchen one can break ten commandment if only one feed men then thinking have said too much added sweetly of course be only joking mr train a one must be good sort of thing be sure be be good kind mr ward now be really very nice of mr brendon must never say really nice thing like of course be great friend of yours be stopped with when poor woman leonard uttered ejaculation seemed to that be pursued by amelia square tragedy first dorothy now mother be there no other topic of conversation must have answered ordinary person rudely being wearied of being questioned mr ward having key of door led into fashionable world be to be conciliated replied to almost in same word a have used to dorothy mr brendon did stop with said be asleep when murder took place how extraordinary said mr ward languidly yet with keen eye on change in leonard face wonder who killed one know replied train shortly doe one suspect one believe not police be quite at fault oh police said mr ward in proper tone of contempt never do anything except make love to cook do suspect one leonard flushed mr ward why must suspect one oh know have clever face just kind of face one must think brilliant detective must have must have suspicion again eye searched face no protested be asleep know nothing about matter how stupid of said mr ward beginning to think that condescension in asking leonard to dinner be wasted men be always so blind poor dear what kind of woman be mr jersey nice motherly old creature know like monthly nurse be mr brendon introduced to yes took into drawing room really have drawing room in bloomsbury how nice civilized well did mr jersey mr brendon get on well together want to know because see mr train admires dorothy be such sign of man good nature if get on well with stranger suppose mr jersey liked think did replied leonard on whose weak head claret be beginning to take effect be rather startled when saw first mr ward eye flashed so brightly that leonard must have be warned of indiscretion have not be looking at plate oh how very interesting never saw before why must be startled be at exactly said leonard at piece of yellow holly wore in coat yellow holly repeated mr ward with feigned surprise why of course mr brendon wore sprig daughter gave to so told mr ward gave to dorothy continued mr ward who for reason wished to make explicit statement be very rare know man who life in devonshire sent bunch dorothy mentioned that mr brendon have begged for piece yes must naturally wear on night a have just left house why be unfortunate woman surprised ca say be answered train turned white thought be about to faint did give explanation no in few moment recovered nothing more be said oh mr ward seemed disappointed be that why leonard turned dull eye on flushed face what else did expect to hear mr ward nothing nothing said hurriedly for did not wish to make suspicious seems so odd dorothy giving holly know that mr jersey must be upset must continue conversation mr train be really most interesting literary men be quite fascinating after dinner in drawing room mr train dorothy signaled with fan daughter arose be too long over wine said mr ward a left room ca spare mr train leonard believed that attention be due to own fascination head be still heated with wine have drunk yet began to regret that have said anything about yellow holly certainly have not promised george to be silent on especial point nevertheless thought wiser to hold tongue about have taken place in amelia square on night of murder warned in way by mother sense train took more wine after rather dull conversation with vane went into drawing room dorothy be at piano thither repaired vane mr ward seated near fire called leonard to side must introduce lord derrington mr train grandfather of george be huge man burly red faced white haired with rather truculent expression be over seventy yet carried year like boy under bushy white eyebrow shot quick glance at leonard from pair of keen gray eye summed up at once a fool lord derrington have be diplomatist many year before knew that even fool be sometimes useful moreover have learned from mr ward aimless chatter train be great friend of brendon knew more about george than george thought however derrington after one glance of contempt be very civil to leonard be glad to meet said with nod go in for book understand from mr ward have deep raucous voice like of early starling spoke in abrupt staccato kind of way train who stood before like rabbit before snake compared in own mind with becky sharp friend marquis of steyne derrington be quite a wicked savage unscrupulous a celebrated nobleman do write little said leonard nervously believe in action rather than in writing said derrington there be far too many book written dreamer of dream may come true when do come true what be use of bah in young day lived now people dream be sure there be dreaming about society nowadays said mr ward laughing one be a sharp a needle to get better of neighbor mutual deception society said derrington give so much will let go so far be sort of thing there be great deal of philanthropy nowadays what good doe philanthropy do mr train said derrington only make people lazy people be too sentimental must give half pauper cat if have way train be quite sure that must for with red face heavy jowl savage air of command looked picture of roman emperor derrington have instinct of despot leonard must imagine slaying burning doing manner of evil thing wondered how brendon ever came to have villainous grandfather be on tip of tongue to say something about brendon just to observe effect on derrington courage failed held peace at moment fate intervened drawing room door opened servant announced mr brendon next moment george came face to face with grandfather chapter x diplomacy be most awkward meeting dorothy train brendon knew truth mr ward vane be ignorant a to lord derrington george be not sure after conversation with lola have vague idea since bawdsey be connected in way with grandfather lord derrington must have somehow learned that brendon be name grandson have taken there be other way of accounting for mention of derrington name by private inquiry agent however might be lord derrington be too clever man to betray george felt that old man knew who be must not be sure for derrington welcomed with well bred air a must have done stranger mr ward watched meeting curiously brendon noticed inquiring gaze put down to knowledge that derrington knew be suitor for dorothy hand wished girl to marry vane leonard be only person in room who displayed visible disturbance grew red restless brendon be perfectly calm how delightful of to come mr brendon said mr ward rising apparently forgetting that have forbidden house must introduce lord derrington mr brendon know mr train be old friend said george calmly miss ward bowed to dorothy who emulated serenity although felt anxious when saw lover composure knew that nothing disagreeable must occur apprehension be relieved there ensued general conversation relative to weather to doings of certain politician to sundry other subject more le vague george talked excellently be conscious that derrington be listening with approval again again wondered if old man really knew who be again again failed to arrive at conclusion after time leonard went with dorothy to piano where played for delectation mr ward seized opportunity to show vane new photograph of derrington brendon be practically alone old lord appeared anxious to make agreeable george be watchful for cloven hoof did not peep out truculent tyrant a derrington be yet must play part of highly bred polished gentleman of old school to perfection did so on occasion have heard of from mr ward said in harsh tone amount of politeness must render agreeable think have met before can not recall meeting replied george wondering if other be about to hint that have seen one resembling have seen in distance however distance lends enchantment to view in case be pleased to say so lord derrington generally do say what please responded old man shooting sharp glance at george be related to brendons of shropshire have not privilege derrington chuckled at reply thought george have good deal of man in when answered thus fearlessly have seen name somewhere lately observed ca recall where in what connection brendon laughed quite at ease although did not know if be attempt to make speak out however did speak out with idea of seeing what must happen can supply connection said lightly keenly observant of old man face name appeared a witness at inquest week so back ah now remember mr brendon quite so be that amelia square murder have good memory lord derrington in case flatter mr brendon there be difficulty in remembering especial case a mr jersey be tenant of mine george be not supposed to know displayed suitable surprise indeed said then have lost good tenant possibly replied derrington rather grimly always paid rent regularly saw yes friend mr train be stopping in house that young man derrington cast look in leonard direction did not know be there on night be witness also said brendon significantly ca remember name sir well stopped for night with mr train during night mr jersey be murdered heard nothing saw nothing be sound asleep whole time said brendon calmly humph derrington pulled at gray mustache in very same way a george did when be reflective what pity might have discovered assassin think assassin will ever be discovered be luck for assassin rejoined old lord cynically appear to be very certain mr brendon george shrugged shoulder more certain than police be replied examined one in house one must be accused there be absolutely evidence assassin must not have entered house a door be locked key be in pocket of murdered woman derrington for reason appeared to be rather relieved read that in paper said roughly be telling nothing new there did say

at leisure now walter remained a whipping boy be cunning enough to keep out of grandfather way contrived to be more independent than parent have be perhaps derrington be too old to carry on active war

decided to accord interview knew that by time mr bawdsey must have informed george that grandfather knew a brendon old autocrat wished to see if george must behave a pluckily at second interview a have done at first moreover must not forget good look clever conversation of young man must be absurd to say that derrington heart yearned over unacknowledged twig of family tree for according to

admirable actress thought old lord what dangerous woman ballet of bacchanal came at end of first part of programme when curtain rose dorothy be so anxious to behold lola that leaned forward so a to show face to whole house bawdsey saw put glass to eye smiled slightly derrington wondered why did so at moment while stage be filling with dancer arose to receive newcomer be none other than miss bull margery for whom bawdsey have procured box little old maid be whiter than ever wore usual gray dress margery be smartly gowned in green with light hair stupid red face looked anything beautiful placed in best position being evidently directed to do so by miss bull for lady preferred shade at event secluded behind curtain kept beady black eye persistently on stage on seeing that two be comfortable bawdsey disappeared did not return till end of ballet derrington saw one else in mr ward box took notice why must bawdsey party be quite unknown to ballet be modeled closely on line laid down by euripides in tragedy opening scene be market place of thebe stage be filled mostly with men pentheus king be informed that whole female population of city together with mother agave have gone to

movement in dance followed be interrupted by pentheus who strives to calm frenzy agav knowing god of wine be at hand becomes a one possessed bacchus appears be arrested by pentheus be chained hurried into palace agav warns king against impiety be committing pentheus defies god there be peal of thunder palace of pentheus sink into ruin at back appears ruin of city wall have also fallen on summit of heaped stone stand bacchus god confest at wave of wand vine begin to clamber over ruin cry of bacchanalians be heard pentheus try to seize god again darkness cover stage last thing seen be lola dancing in wild red light with extravagant gesture dorothy must not say that lola be handsome have about wild grace be very fascinating when dancing seemed to think of nothing revel in be engaged never cast look at house dorothy noticed be therefore somewhat surprised when during second scene saw lola deliberately look in direction of box stare at piercingly for quite moment two rather confused by sudden regard girl drew back lola noticed more continued to dance second scene be camp of bacchanal where pentheus a follower of god come to see orgy be mountainous scene with lurid red sky broken by mass of black cloud there be need to describe ballet in detail frenzied dancer of bacchanal seemed to send audience wild there be something fierce murderous about orgiastic movement through wild throng darted lola in leopard skin garland bearing cup of wine flinging about in wild madness appeared to be devil dorothy shrank back at sight of wild face music also be terrible excited dancer to further effort of madness be feast of witch walpurgis night revel of earth power there be nothing spiritual about riot of flesh audience shuddered at fierce rapture of dancer at alluring pain of music at reckless abandon of lola velez be too awful murmured dorothy moving to back of box beside derrington that woman be demon yet friend mr brendon helped to position said old man grimly be sure can not approve of dancing shuddered girl who be very pale there be nothing improper about said derrington everything be right in way be maddening unholy altogether terrible music be something like in tannhuser cruel evil voluptuous ah poor spiritual nature shrink from sort of thing mr ward seems to enjoy certainly did craning forward so a to get full view of stage mr ward eye be alight must have enjoyed being in throng herself must have danced a madly a worst of queerly enough miss bull appeared also spellbound face be flushed eye glittered breath came went in quick pant be

listening to sermon dorothy dorothy whispered mr ward come back to seat lola juggle head of pentheus be great dance answered dorothy clung to derrington arm will stop here be too terrible old man understood in darkness of box slipped arm round in kind embrace dorothy felt safe if looked upon madness again felt that must cry out derrington quite appreciated feeling be repulsion experienced by spiritual against material action of ballet proceeded rapidly pentheus climbed tree bacchanalians surrounded dragged down lola emerged from frantic crowd bearing head then began dance slowly at first with solemn pacing stately gesture limelight red blue green yellow be flashed on swaying form of lola a eyed head with terrible glance then music flashed out into wild galop scene became pandemonium lightning flashed thunder rolled violin shrieked in orchestra dancer spun whirled plunged sprang bounded frantically rushed about stage everywhere at unexpected moment lola appeared tossing smiting caressing head of pentheus whirling out in a rainbow light played upon restless figure finally when orgy be at height came flash of lightning crash of thunder riot died away bacchanalians sprang from stage darkness descended music sank to lulling tone quiet silvery moonlight flooded stage there alone in center sat agav restored to right mind weeping over head of son on scene of sorrow curtain fell slowly to strain of sweet music audience drew long breath felt a though nightmare be at end let go now said dorothy standing up still clinging to derrington arm wish have not come be interrupted by ejaculation from mother mr ward also be standing up eye be fixed on miss bull little old maid a though feeling influence of glance slowly looked in mr ward direction eye of two woman met from of miss

derrington sickened with walter milk water way saw in brendon worthy successor who must be able to hold own in will word must shed fresh luster on house have george be polite what old lord sneeringly called cringing must never have received invitation a be derrington took to hard old heart chuckled to think of walter dismay when heard that have elder cousin must not be likely to inherit title money however astonished brendon be too much man of world to reveal feeling on evening in question presented at mansion in st giles square scrupulously groomed brushed derrington looked approvingly on dress set off handsome figure to advantage also haughty bearing of brendon pleased unbent so far a to advance to george with outstretched hand have rather rough interview george said so have invited to smoke pipe of peace brendon shook old man hand quietly without much enthusiasm must not conjecture what derrington meant by behaving in way so different to that usually adopted host felt slack hand clasp winced on seeing want of response in brendon face queerly enough derrington contrary to accepted opinion have heart be so much taken with george that wished to draw to still must not admit that seeing how have treated young fellow in past be not to be expected that brendon must act part of affectionate relative immediately derrington rather admired george for uncompromising attitude dinner

be old george have not much time to spare yes wish to consult with after dinner about that can come in course of conversation meantime let talk of anything like weather sir confound snapped derrington

out of enormous mustache moved slowly toward door george felt sorry to see so lonely knew that derrington hated relative that relative cordially hated so there be none to comfort old man in declining year walter vane be le than nothing a mere presence served to irritate grandfather moved by sudden impulse george made remark moved to elder man side offered arm footman be holding door open derrington must not express even by look satisfaction felt with surly grunt took brendon arm george guessed by warm pressure that derrington be pleased that simple kindly movement served to draw two men closer together sat down to excellent dinner in good spirit be quite banquet for derrington lived in most expensive manner in spite of sadly diminished income must never abate splendor of style in have lived life table be round one laid with exquisite taste be placed under kind of velvet tent shut off rest of room made meal particularly cosy george who have taste for art admired finish of

prop for old age at last thought damme be fine fellow ah youth youth george be very comfortable also felt grateful for kindness grandfather be showing at same time felt a though be acting wrongly in hobnobbing with man who persistently blackened mother memory brendon thought saw sign of repentance in derrington wished to improve situation if must be difficult for to quite forgive old rascal be sorry for loneliness haggard look besides george be christian in more than merely going to church on sunday suppose wondered when received invitation said derrington in hardest tone did sir wondered

other better be anxious for peace for recognition of birth naturally one included other doe that mean will fight till get what want yes said george curtly then closed lip with firm determination to give battle if necessary at same time felt be rather awkward after eating derrington food sudden impulse made rise what be matter now asked derrington not moving well sir burst out brendon with candor

stepped out of front door came face to face with bawdsey who be mounting step man seemed excited carried carelessly folded newspaper have apparently be reading did not seemed pleased to meet brendon looked at in suspicious manner did expect to see here said with certain degree of roughness did not know that house be interdicted to replied brendon sharply liked tone peremptory manner of bawdsey moreover be not prepossessed in favor by report lord derrington have made of man duplicity be glad to meet however continued george a wish to have few word be too busy to give time retorted bawdsey tried to enter house nevertheless will give quarter of hour said george blocking doorway with stalwart form what have to say can not be left until more convenient period tell be busy mr brendon tell intend to have interview rejoined brewton imperiously talk great deal about gratitude bawdsey yet be unwilling to put out for in least degree bawdsey became penitent at once be true mr brendon be very worried cast glance at newspaper in hand however have first call upon time so will go to room be a must be more word passed bawdsey mounted stair led george into well remembered room brendon took chair bawdsey with anxious look threw into man face be flushed red hair be in disorder eye be bright a rule be calm controlled so george conjectured that something particularly important must have occurred to upset however bawdsey trouble be none of business began talking at once of reason for seeking interview have conversation with lord derrington other evening said deliberately talked of then heard good of replied bawdsey with sneer lord derrington doe not like that matter little liking can exist between man in lord derrington position paid servant oh call that do sir what else be lord derrington engaged a agent to watch that have done not lately have given free hand in case have free hand said george loftily be grateful enough for service in saving life to release from espionage have not done so must have taken mean to put stop to dogging footstep must not have known have not told mr brendon oh yes must in case must have seen grandfather must have told sir be enemy be where be wrong bawdsey be friend detective looked astonished do mean to say that lord derrington have climbed down demanded incredulously be strange be not said george in bantering tone a matter of fact after long conversation lord derrington came to understand one intends to recognize a heir have then learnt where marriage took place asked bawdsey starting from seat again glancing anxiously at newspaper lay on small table at elbow have yet to find out be quite satisfied from hint of late mr jersey that marriage did take place wish to make amends to for unjust conduct a regard mother memory whew what mean did take to force to recognize used force at responded brendon very dryly lord derrington must not climb down unless be made to a matter of fact did olive branch be held out by be none of business mr bawdsey only tell to to clear ground for what be about to say be something disagreeable bet said bawdsey scanning set face of visitor penetration doe credit sir be disagreeable bawdsey settled comfortably in chair then sooner grasp nettle sooner will pain be over said with eastern wealth of parable first mr brendon must like to know exact position oh be easily explained there be reason why must not know what london will know soon lord derrington will join with in searching for register of marriage meanwhile will recognize a grandson heir to estate not very large income for future peer murmured bawdsey george took notice of in fortnight leave kensington room take up residence with lord derrington in st giles square then will assume real name of george vane will marry miss ward suppose be entirely business said george placidly will gain nothing by insolence bawdsey man rose with wounded air upon word mr vane said giving george correct name to show that recognized new position have not slightest intention of being insolent be glad for sake that thing be a be pleased for own since lola may now give up thought of turn to that be very well bawdsey said brendon quietly profess great friendship for how can trust have never deceived yet have not given chance of doing so if opportunity offered be convenient to be quite sure must sell a saying go to highest bidder why must doubt asked bawdsey still wounded can only judge future by past since be quite ready to play lord derrington false who say that cried man sitting down looking defiant say so lord derrington have told what demanded bawdsey willfully ignorant took place on night when came to house to impersonate bawdsey laughed face cleared if be disagreeable business sir can easily put to right can explain why drugged why threatened did not threaten lord derrington informed that threatened to get into trouble be why consulted be why have come to tell that if fight lord derrington will fight also lord derrington be old be young be quite equal to dealing with never denied that said bawdsey calmly quite recognize that be strong man mr vane although be not to interest to admit a much that be business rejoined george coolly play with card on table what be have concealed know be quite prepared to play game at present moment need not call by father name have not yet assumed position when do george vane will have nothing to do with george brendon have said bawdsey with flash of eye press too hard mr brendon be willing to do service be misjudging be sorry must think so let cease bickering be willing to hear what have to say if be satisfied with explanation will endeavor to get lola to marry have nothing to do with have influence with will not be used to make miserable know nothing about save what grandfather told report doe not bias in favor for know might make poor lola worst husband in world bawdsey shrugged shoulder lola be well able to look after said think mentioned that before if be satisfied with what be about to tell will help will do best said george impatiently lola be sure to lose engagement sooner later through vile temper want to see on street again may a well be supported by in respectable manner a by one else besides a truly say can take care of own skin will not advise to marry unless prove to that did not intend to blackmail lord derrington nothing be further from thought said bawdsey earnestly be to interest that grandfather must hold tongue about having be to house must not have known have not told voluntarily oh must have discovered in way thought best to be on right side by confessing voluntarily what have done said must get into trouble admit did threaten so far simply to make hold tongue be afraid lest must be accused of crime bawdsey looked at george in surprise that possibility never crossed mind replied calmly certainly did not kill woman do think did mr brendon george shrugged shoulder going by circumstantial evidence oh bawdsey flipped away that objection with snap of finger be right will explain mr brendon why wished lord derrington to be silent be that might carry out plan so a to learn who killed mr jersey then be looking after case on behalf of lord derrington have idea that assassin became possessed of confession mr jersey left behind how do know left because knew mr jersey very well a told long since be once boarder here one day let slip that have one in power must leave evidence of power behind so that niece might benefit told to lord derrington insisted must try discover assassin so a to get confession compromise back again to spur on have promised reward of thousand pound must obtain confession conviction of assassin a want money to marry lola be doing best came to live here for purpose lord derrington talking of visit to house on night of crime must have jeopardized plan therefore be obliged a say to threaten so a to make keep silent so far do blame mr brendon replied george after thought end justifies mean might have adopted le rascally mean have not adopted have not asked lord derrington for money so be not blackmailer do intend to claim from anything what be justly mine what be justly yours if please reward of one thousand pound for discovery of assassin oh have learned who killed not yet may learn at present confess be in fault george pondered little so far bawdsey spoke frankly enough must not help mistrusting however since man be in telling vein thought best to betray doubt lest bawdsey must turn rusty well discovery be in own hand said sincerely trust will gain that thousand pound be a unwilling a grandfather that mr jersey connection with unfortunate business must become public be perfectly convinced that person who took confession stabbed unfortunate woman do think so asked bawdsey stealing glance at newspaper george nodded confession be written learned that much from margery mr jersey told be story well a confession be not found among mr jersey paper when died must have be taken by someone ca think what interest thing can have have for one unless unless what mr brendon unless contained name of person who assassinated father how must mr jersey know that be at san remo when father be killed loved used to follow how learned thing bawdsey doe not matter be just possible that mr jersey eliza stokes a be then might have knowledge of who committed crime if be set down in confession a be highly probable can quite understand that original assassin killed to gain dangerous document such a undoubtedly be then think that assassin of father be also assassin of mr jersey fancy so a can explain disappearance of confession in other way if remember rightly bawdsey be who said that san remo crime be connected with one committed in house did say so replied bawdsey thoughtfully pondered for few minute then looked up briskly well mr brendon that point can not be settled without proof there be use wasting time in indulging in vain speculation let tell about night went to see mr jersey go on said brendon crossing leg be attention knew before grandfather came to see that be about to pas night here lola told yes be foolish enough to tell though to be sure have great reason to conceal visit to train never knew that murder must take place so lola told bawdsey nodded did never intended to bother about matter a did not think there be anything in visit lord derrington came put different complexion on affair be belief that intended to force mr jersey into confessing about marriage came to appeal to said brendon dryly there be thought of forcing in mind lord derrington judged by thought there might be rather agreed with then knowing temper fancied if went to see mr jersey there must be row scandal did not want that to happen be making very good thing out of lord derrington admitted bawdsey frankly if scandal have taken place occupation must have be gone therefore determined to drug to go why in coat thought that mr jersey might not admit george pounced upon at once there be need that must do so took latch key grandfather carried oh know that do said bawdsey composedly then may a well be absolutely frank be best course oh be not on trial mr brendon be only friendship for be making speak out accept excuse go on bawdsey shrugged shoulder to show annoyance at uncompromising attitude of visitor feared lest mr jersey must order out of house unless must gain time by being mistaken for lord derrington drugged old gentleman then taking coat latch key went to see mr jersey at what time be there time before twelve can not say for certain well mr brendon let in with latch key found house by red light over door in former year have be custom to guide in way told lola so why did tell that oh knew that be going late to house made fuss about chance of being lost in fog said that probably train must tell of red light that must guide by humph lola be always unnecessarily kind said george well well closed door softly went into sitting room knew where be of course tell once lived in house entered sitting room lamp be burning mr jersey be seated at table bawdsey shuddered there be need to tell more left room at once for sight horrified why did pause in hall thought heard footstep on stair shock gave one of fit fear of open space know how did come to learn paused in hall because have come down stair to see who be with mr jersey ah then must have be footstep heard said detective well soon recovered left house what about stiletto be lying on floor near table saw glittering in lamplight a there be blood on saw wound knew that mr jersey have be killed by slipped into pocket with vague idea thereby might trace assassin did leave purposely in coat said bawdsey frankly did not be so moved a woman must say flustered by death forgot about lord derrington woke up went home said nothing about murder to at time have not nerve be only after departed that remembered stiletto thought might make row accuse of crime said nothing judged wise to let sleeping dog lie so that be can tell mr brendon will see be not such bad man a try to make out oh have spoken clearly enough said george then after pause yes think be honest so far a can judge trust bawdsey looked delighted will have glass of wine with to show that asked rising on arab principle of bread salt said brendon certainly bawdsey nodded in pleased manner went to sideboard at end of room george mechanically took up newspaper eye be caught by cross heading strange affair in essex church by word destruction of register just a be about to glance over article never thinking what meant to bawdsey returned with wine two glass uttered exclamation of dismay when saw paper in george hand hang never meant to see that said why not replied george be news about lady trying to tear register started looked at bawdsey who be uneasy pale be lola said george yet why must not know believe be lola though name be mentioned george picked up paper again read rapidly name be mentioned a be said that strange lady who have be arrested refused to give name seemed that went to wargrove church asked to see register for certain year register of marriage sexton took fee showed book then appeared that strange lady searched for hour sexton left vestry for few minute when returned saw that have torn page out of book being taken by surprise have tried to conceal theft sexton seized rescued torn page called for assistance end of be that strange lady who be described a having foreign air be arrested placed in prison be lola said george breathlessly yes assented bawdsey also pale evidently tried to destroy evidence of mother marriage george gave cry wargrove said wargrove in essex be in parish church that marriage took place lola knew paused eye of two men met chapter xx trouble of lola be four o'clock when george left bawdsey two have spoken little of newspaper paragraph informed of lola escapade although name be not mentioned there be doubt in mind of brendon that be culprit newspaper gave year of book when sheet be torn corresponded to year when percy vane married have be supposed to marry rosina lockwood be explanation of lola absence from town have not fled from rebuke of brendon have gone to do injury by destroying evidence of parent marriage finally be meaning of wild threat to dorothy by preventing george from proving legitimacy lola hoped to put final end to chance of making miss ward wife bawdsey be much upset over news must have flown immediately to wargrove special business kept in town however purposed to go next morning by first train bawdsey did not think that brendon have sufficient interest in lola to go down to wargrove at once george be going that very day same lola must not have known that parent have be married at wargrove without having seen mr jersey confession wherein fact be probably mentioned therefore must have obtained confession in way how achieved george must not conjecture then thought of lola hot spanish blood of stiletto peculiarly foreign weapon shuddered occurred to that lola must have stabbed woman however put thought aside for moment set about getting to wargrove on consulting b c found that train left liverpool street station for southend at ten minute past five wargrove be tiny rural town must be reached in hour ever quick expeditious in movement george have entered strand shop to buy railway guide having ascertained about train simply stepped into cab ordered man to drive to liverpool street at appointed time be on way down country precipitancy of action be due to dread lest bawdsey must change mind see lola first certainly detective have spoken frankly conduct appeared to be dictated by sentiment of honor nevertheless george felt that bawdsey be playing part that apparent honesty be not real character behooved to be on guard against to know a much about death of mr jersey a bawdsey did so a to able to counterplot if necessary from fact that be in wargrove lola evidently have possession of confession if bawdsey saw must doubtless try get from to learn name of percy vane assassin george wished therefore to forestall bawdsey to make lola surrender confession always presuming have to for reason departed quickly for wargrove at liverpool street station examined passenger a entered train bawdsey did not put in appearance a next train must not depart for two hour george felt that have stolen march on detective bawdsey must never think that have acted with such promptitude be dull journey a brendon be worried by commercial traveler who must talk politics george put off a civilly a possible finally turned prattle for be little else to own advantage by asking for whereabouts of wargrove seemed that new town of wargrove be place where train stopped old wargrove be three mile distant be there that parish church be situated commercial traveler followed up information with many detail concerning manner custom of native bored george to distraction however listened quietly paid a little attention a be consistent with politeness officious companion watched for station roared out name when train stopped george thanked alighted glad to be relieved of such weary talker till train be moving man leaned out of window shouting direction a to best way to reach old wargrove a proved there be necessity for george to go there lola be stopping in policeman house prior to removal to prison at chelmsford attempt at robbery have be committed on previous day brendon thought must have already be removed however be informed that there be delay owing to illness of chelmsford inspector therefore lola must have to remain in wargrove for twelve hour brendon be glad to hear a must save long journey thanked policeman who have explained be directed by man to house of superior officer be on outskirt of town george soon found semi detached house with notice on on knocking at door explained errand to brisk little woman pursed up lip looked inquisitively at with bright eye called husband policeman be burly slow witted fat man who seemed nervous on being asked for sight of prisoner for such lola be to intent purpose did not want to exceed duty george produced sovereign official although eye twinkled hesitated to take bribe be then that mr policeman came to brendon assistance nonsense jeremiah said briskly let young gentleman see young lady be dying to have sight of how do know that be young lady asked george mr policeman nodded with arm akimbo why be be cry out in foreign way of hers for george george be name certainly be gentleman

george ceased reading now knew worst father have died by accident ireland have be unwitting cause of death brendon wondered how old man must have carried knowledge year without speaking determined to have interview with at last knew truth about death in san remo inculpated one must not see how according to bawdsey must be connected with murder of mr jersey chapter xxii who bawdsey be george read remainder of mr jersey confession then put away even when got to end must not connect san remo crime with of amelia square be in mind to see grandfather tell story to backed by production of confession on second thought decided to see bawdsey first wired for appointment received reply stating that bawdsey be going out of town at three o'clock day must be in room till then george lost time called cab within hour of receiving answer to request be on way to bloomsbury on arriving found that detective expected went to room bawdsey be still in disturbed state a be most anxious to get down country to help lola out of difficulty received brendon irritably in silence george saw that man be nerve did not resent sharp greeting sat down opened conversation be going down to see lola asked of course be much worried over may get into serious trouble over freak well why not tell judge be insane at time then will get off lightly must that be true asked detective struck by idea a true a most thing really be not accountable for action when get into frenzy in such one must have be to attempt burglary poor soul wonder how be now oh be not troubled much spirit be a good a usual hardly seems to realize enormity of offense how do know asked bawdsey with stare because saw last night saw did after left took train to wargrove have interview with might have told mr brendon said bawdsey in wounded tone where must have be use of can manage own business hope considering how love be business also george shrugged shoulder well see bawdsey be intention to see lola first guessed a much so stole march on bawdsey fenced see how can say that can know lola be in house on night woman died presume so since got confession must have secured to know where parent be married well then knowing that wished to get confession yes did said detective why not desired to know if mr jersey said anything about san remo crime in can tell that did have confession bawdsey bounded from chair where be asked in room locked away do call that shame grumbled bawdsey might have trusted mr brendon might must have trusted do know do to such extent a suit must have shown that confession have come into possession be not showing to said bawdsey evasively be not answer will show confession whenever like come now must have shown to since have read why ask that question snapped detective know yes know that must have burnt confession know that to have paper in existence set forth mr bawdsey true name be george rate be not to liking never did anything to disgrace name mr brendon be between conscience replied george coolly have nothing to do with be george rate bawdsey shrugged shoulder there be use denying said have wife handwriting be mr jersey really wife be married soon after left san remo be hard up must not have married went to state did there took name of jersey tried variety of thing none of came to good then left eliza why did do because be devil said bawdsey face lighting up tried mean in power to make happy be always quarreling nagging lamenting that have not married that vane father mr brendon did tell about murder be murder protested bawdsey did not tell from hint two dropped about getting money from mr ireland guessed that have something to do with came across to england saw told whole story did get money from did not be honest man although seem to think so left that blackmailing to wife came over to get money out of ireland simply said that must tell whole truth must call woman velez a witness about dagger woman be dead oh be said bawdsey coolly lola told that be alive still in san remo must have made thing very hot for wife failing ireland wife mr jersey will call have string to bow heard how lord derrington denied marriage how be living with grandfather lockwood went to derrington know rest came to live in house not at time went back to state a must hing there returned to england then took up private inquiry business called bawdsey came to see wife must not let call husband a have great liking for agreed be in house for few week then got own digging saw a little of mr jersey a be possible why be well sir replied bawdsey frankly did hold with annuity be getting in word disapproved of blackmail be good useful word sir said bawdsey easily yes did never must take penny from when lived here during few week paid board yes sir be honest man george stretched out hand shook that of bawdsey heartily be convinced be bawdsey apologize for suspicion in way eh did act very straight mean well sir when one deal with criminal case one ca be too careful have have to tell lie sir say mr brendon cried detective with burst of confidence must not have shown that agreement guessed that eliza must state who be did wish to think be connected with why not well sir fancied seeing what know that might suspect of killing bawdsey a have acted so fairly through be convinced that be innocent on score why did say that san remo crime be connected with death of mr jersey bawdsey opened eye ca see sir stiletto oh mean that weapon used by lola be same one a father be killed with certainly mr brendon belonged to seora velez mother gave to lola for saw in room before death of mr jersey recognized from description given by wife there be dozen of stilettoes like one lord derrington showed to yes be true enough see from what wife told knew that have got dagger from woman velez be hard to see when dropped across similar weapon in room of woman also called velez that be same now see how be that lola knew so much about death of father how came to talk of matter how did drop on subject in first place name be enough for saw lola fell in love with a know then remembered name velez got introduction to one thing led to until knew whole story admitted that stiletto be one with mr vane have be killed george thought for few minute tell bawdsey said at length did suspect lola of committing crime yes did admitted bawdsey frankly see have devil of temper never knew that have gone to see mr jersey on night although might have guessed because of way tried to learn whereabouts of house mean crimson light excuse be foolish thought other day when stated said george when did first suspect when picked up stiletto recognized at once be intention to take round to so that must not be incriminated be so upset a said other day that forgot about matter when did think be too late for derrington woke up put on coat wondered whether must mention stiletto to never did because knew nothing about said george mr ward stole a told oh see how be now really did suspect lola asked if be in house said that have be although denied at first be lola way said george always begin by denial how did bring to confess threatened to identify stiletto then told truth if be truth said bawdsey doubtfully oh think so believe killed woman know temper yes do since have got what wanted confession there be sense in committing murder quite believe that threw dagger at mr jersey foot a said be just like one of lola impulsive action bawdsey scratched head wonder who did kill eliza muttered if lola be innocent be innocent looked at brendon ca help replied george rising thing be quite beyond must have be one in house replied bawdsey positively remember mr train heard door close front door time about half past eleven be be not sir did not arrive till close on twelve mr jersey be already dead door must have be opened closed by murderer left just before arrived how must have entered alone have latch key a to lola slipped in while mr jersey be dismissing guest bawdsey shook head ca understand sir of course there be gentleman who have house for short time looked meaningly at brendon george looked puzzled what do mean asked well sir began bawdsey with invariable formula like to mention name be sure what say will go further there be mr ireland brendon started to foot with agitated face ireland oh be impossible declared quite impossible why must have latch key after grandfather death be in possession of house for time key must be with in handing to lord derrington agent might have forgotten one be improbable think so be chance think at first when knew that mr jersey occupied house might have found latch key useful to see when felt inclined dare say tried to get money out of again refused did once said bawdsey meaningly mr ireland be not so young a have be dreaded lest accident must be known be accident said george much a deplore death of father yet acquit ireland of blame did know lived here until miss bull told oh yes did be sure mr jersey must let know that be just round corner always kept in touch with useful friend why must kill so suddenly well might have heard that have written out confession even about lord derrington visit then must come round to ask if have incriminated in confession must ask for sight of not having for found blue envelope empty after lola left must deny that have stiletto left by lola must be on table what be more natural than for ireland to pick up kill in sudden access of dread remember mr jersey must accuse of crime a be known that ireland be jealous of mother marriage to vane oh there be plenty of motive a to having refused before be getting old thinking might be brought to justice by confession for never knew when must die into whose hand must fall might have lost nerve strike that if struck blow have great deal of nerve said george dryly go on lot of supposition suppose that ireland retained latch key of house that knew mr jersey have written out confession that knew grandfather be coming on night in fact that be theory bawdsey believe mr ireland have anything to do with matter then who have asked detective what must say to margery what niece that half witted girl exactly half witted be more like animal than anything human get sudden fit of rage when miss bull fainted margery rushed in threatened with fist seeing what uncontrollable temper have occurred to that might have killed aunt miss bull say that aunt locked girl in room of course miss bull may know truth may be shielding margery seems to have strange affection for girl what if mr jersey to vary story found margery down stair after lola be gone instead of rebuking a miss bull said in passage at eleven o'clock mind later think said george quickly did not arrive till nearly twelve woman be just dead think few minute must make much difference said bawdsey quietly go on sir let hear theory well fancy that mr jersey caught margery down stair took into own room to rebuke quietly so that rest of house might not hear also must be anxious to learn if girl have overheard conversation with lola if margery have must assuredly have told miss bull mr jersey must be afraid of dare say stormed at margery to make speak there must have be row sir one heard disturbance oh boarder be old sleep lightly be bound to say did not hear disturbance myself said george reflectively mr jersey may have argued quietly then a say stiletto be on table margery goaded into action might with sudden rage of dumb animal might have well be not impossible about door closing when margery saw what have done pursued george still trying to guess what have taken place first impulse must be to run away must steal out open door be pretty sure miss bull be on watch saw must draw girl back close door at half past eleven a train heard then must pacify margery lock in bedroom after previously instructing what to say next morning be what believe bawdsey be very pretty case murmured detective thing might have happened a say if be case there be not much chance of learning truth margery miss bull will be silent after theory regarding ireland be just a good mr brendon george rose to go stick to theory will stick to mine said smiling what about lola well sir will go down with kowlaski see will do whatever can to get out of trouble sir oh will have nothing more to do with lola take away to state a wife bawdsey will get grandfather to give thousand pound to start life on be very good of sir said bawdsey gratefully will try persuade to marry yes know a told that register register grandfather intends to recognize a heir therefore be certain a may well be that will marry miss ward will gradually get over fancy for will be quite content to take bawdsey sighed hope so love that woman sir yet be violent woman almost a violent a first wife yes assented bawdsey rather dolefully seems a though be always to fall into hand of violent woman what do intend to do now sir leave matter alone bawdsey want to learn who killed mr jersey now know about father marriage will change name take rightful one have done with crime mystery yellow holly can go hang for chapter xxiii turning of lane proverb say that good luck come to who know how to wait have certainly come to george brendon a be now called george vane lord derrington must not make enough of after interview with young man called at st giles square related to grandfather all have learned old man be much astonished think ireland be to blame said not even in holding tongue after thing be accident although undoubtedly that woman be cause have seen ireland not yet will soon then tell from that consider be responsible that quite believe from what know of mr jersey that have told entire truth will sir answered george suppose mean that if really committed crime with malice aforethought mr jersey must have blackmailed lord derrington nodded approvingly be what scotch call 'quick in uptake george be what mean mr jersey must have be afraid for herself must never have kept claw off ireland money have plenty of mine added old gentleman grimly bad lot george quite agree with sir poor bawdsey be honest however well lord derrington did not assent immediately to if bawdsey have be really honest must have asked to be silent on matter need not have used threat however unwilling be to carry out george bawdsey be like serpent in bamboo straight so long a be kept in check suppose will marry girl think so be madly in love with promised that must give thousand pound if went to america deuce did said derrington wrathfully why not sir rejoined brendon calmly want out of life know too much better send abroad so that may not make remark about unpleasant family history lord derrington winced george certainly have rather unpleasant way of putting thing however old man silently acknowledged justice of speech be right said bawdsey ought to do something for money mean that ought to discover assassin yes do whosoever killed that woman must be brought to justice george brendon looked down think will be best to let sleeping dog lie sir said significantly because of scandal said derrington looking hard at be alluding to possibility of mr ward having killed at supposition george laughed right out sir think mr ward must go so far a must be there no law to restrain dare say have instinct of female despot a there be law must not jeopardize neck mean ireland derrington sat up nonsense do mean to say be guilty think so bawdsey have idea george related theory of detective derrington grunted in disgusted manner man born idiot said why must ireland run risk of getting neck into noose for second crime if thought that must leave confession behind inculpating must have waited to make certain believe there be word of truth in matter however when see can question about doings on night will certainly do replied brendon quietly failing ireland guilt be presumed by bawdsey there remains margery that idiot of girl yes george detailed reason for believing in margery guilt again derrington sniffed be supposition if girl came into room if stiletto be on table if mr jersey scolded into fury pah believe really wish to find assassin must like to know out of mere curiosity if be opinion that thing must be left a be why bawdsey can take thousand pound sail for america whenever chooses grudge setting rascal up in business added derrington who be still sore about way in have be threatened after conversation george took leave dorothy be out of town so must not visit after interview with ireland in derrington library mr ward have found convenient to go down country felt that be in unpleasant position not that there be danger of being accused of murdering vane if police got hold of story might make inquiry in fact certainly must make inquiry then disagreeable fact must come out that miss bull be sister mr ward knew that have not behaved well to jenny that if truth be known friend must blame a mr ward did not like blame disliked to have action criticised went down country saying to dorothy desired change of air lord derrington wrote note to mr ward after george have departed will ask to come up said derrington grimly a sealed letter george will return in three day with copy of marriage certificate with news of how case have be disposed of mr ward will apologize to formally consent to marriage dorothy will come also walter derrington rubbed hand chuckling be rather anxious to see walter face when heard that be no longer heir meantime george went with kowlaski bawdsey to chelmsford to see after lola kowlaski be in despair a if lola received term of imprisonment ballet must be brought to untimely end now that lola be out of bill hall be not so full a usual kowlaski foresaw that if lola did not come back must lose money therefore went down prepared to spend large sum to set free there be need for fear lola be brought up before magistrate evidence be given a to excitable nature old sexton produced torn register detailed how have be assaulted thought lady be queer kowlaski went into box also bawdsey george result of evidence a to lola foreign way be that magistrate admonished inflicted small fine be triumphantly paid by kowlaski who returned to town with principal dancer under jealous eye more than kowlaski made quite story out of event be known in london that lola velez have be arrested a london paper copied account of trial have appeared in country press kowlaski put about lola have gone off head owing to grief for dying mother few people believed public be so pleased to see favorite again that be saluted with cheer in few day one forgot about matter after did not amount to much luckily be not stated why lola have wished to destroy register there be several marriage entry on page one must say of wished obliterated besides brendon got magistrate to suppress book not let press report matter accomplished by telling magistrate exactly how matter stood so judicial authority used power fourth estate quailed everything be settled in most satisfactory manner later on brendon have copy made of marriage entry of percy vane bachelor rosina lockwood spinster brought to grandfather old man read carefully then laid down paper with sigh of relief never thought must be pleased to see that in black white said be pleased now of course be be to revive glory of derrington vane family have faded of late sir clapped grandson on back george laughed at old man enthusiasm there be one strange thing said after pause seeing that parent be married so near london can not understand how marriage be not discovered before derrington looked thoughtful also be strange admitted remember tale of poe purloined letter people always look in most unlikely place first because church be so near to town nobody have replied to advertisement searcher mean must have thought that marriage took place in moorland parish where people never looked at journal be very closeness of wargrove church to london george prevented certificate being discovered sooner suppose be right said brendon doe seem strange everything in life be strange said derrington not least strange thing be that kick out walter to make room for by way george will be here soon have told yes want to see about matter said that must in presence what have to say know there be reason for remaining george mr ward daughter be coming here wo be pleased to see said brendon oh think will after ireland put in corner grew afraid now must like to see matter settled at price when be mother in

be walter well boy have come to see new cousin walter vane entered library with injured air looked neater more fragile than ever wonderfully old considering year derrington looked from to fine figure of george with queer look in eye one must ever take for relative said why say be like one said walter mr ward remarked on likeness when dined with wondered why must resemble one be explained now walter cast not unkindly look in cousin direction derrington snarled george be like take after father walter who be shrimp if ever there be one george hastened to rescue of cousin seems to that conversation be getting somewhat personal remarked walter hope bear grudge for stepping into shoe walter took hand in own limp grasp well of course be hard on fellow answered in rather whining manner got on well together so must rather be than fellow train friend of yours for instance be such cad very good fellow for said brendon dryly oh people always say that of fellow who have nothing to recommend retorted walter a be to be head of family be glad be not bounder be very kind of said george dryly very silly of walter growled grandfather what do mean sir by talking rubbish be likely that one of blood must be what call bounder said walter pacifying old man only mean never mind what mean be sure to be something foolish said derrington pointing with cane to george be future head of family pay respect will get on capitally said george clapping walter on back what about income asked walter will have what have now said derrington bother about matter george can settle between considering how have be ousted walter really took thing very calmly have not enough vigor to protest sighed grandfather have cowed walter profoundly admired newly found cousin who did not hesitate to stand up to despot began to think be good thing george have come into family must at least save walter from constant bullying interesting family council be interrupted by entrance of mr ward a pert pretty a ever have quite recovered spirit knowing that derrington must say nothing about card cheating about san remo matter be prepared to be a insolent a dared be quite determined not to cross sword again with old man like burnt child dreaded fire derrington be altogether too much even for a be came sailing in with prettiest air in world held out hand head on one side like sick canary dear lord derrington how well be looking how here astonished eye fell on george said mr ward aghast mr brendon here not mr brendon said derrington enjoying confusion grandson george vane dorothy who have

walter in elegant way there be fighting against george have luck call george why must be cousin head of house when go to long home finished derrington well mr ward do consent to match do mother said dorothy imploringly mr ward sank into chair pretended to be overcome by emotion in fact did merely to gain time a did not wish to answer too quickly be plain that walter whom have wished dorothy to marry took in own phraseology back seat george be promoted vice walter resigned george must be lord derrington must have money be obstinate man certainly must be difficult to manage still might be able to get better of must always work through dorothy if dorothy must only get over absurd notion of religion sort of thing on whole mr ward thought be best to agree knowing what derrington knew how obstinate lover be did not see very well what else must do however made most of compulsory surrender after few sigh having squeezed few tear cried to daughter in muffled voice expressive of deep emotion dorothy dear child dorothy with look at george went knelt down by mother chair be not dupe of play acting knowing that mother must insist on making effective scene wished to get over a speedily a possible mr ward put hand on dorothy shoulder in maternal manner do love george asked yes said dorothy simply know love george do love child do replied george curtly while derrington surveyed touching scene with grim smile always loved to watch antic of mr ward believed in so thoroughly deceived one gifted with ordinary intelligence be hard said mr ward with deep sigh to see child leave parent love have won here rose raising dorothy from knee gave to george take george with take mother blessing idea of mr ward blessing be too much for walter went off into shriek of laughter ended in leaving room george be quite unmoved thanked mr ward kissed dorothy then took to distant seat near window where must talk sensibly lord derrington be left to console afflicted mother proceeded to do immediately egad did well said looking at pretty woman believe miss terry mr siddons must have done better mr ward flushed little still kept up pose nature spoke dear lord derrington be aware that consider nature vulgar be not aware that did see so little of that scene touched positively touched mr ward saw that be useless to hide truth from keen eyed old man longer oh be nasty said plaintively rustled up to of course wanted dorothy to marry walter george doe just a well think have made bad exchange mr ward be good looking enough said little woman so serious dull of course suppose will allow income will have be necessary to keep up position a heir said derrington dryly hope dorothy will live here house be big enough wo have to pay rent be always consideration be oh hope dear dorothy will be happy will see much of much of darling child said derrington thinking just a well to nip plan in bud care very little about dorothy like george when be married must stop away a much a be consistent with feeling will do what like said mr ward beginning to tap foot think will threatened in room be only playing game protested mr ward well can play game also mr jersey have left behind confession in detail how managed to cheat sister miss bull if leave that couple severely alone will show confession to dorothy must never be so cruel oh yes must replied derrington who have not slightest intention of fulfilling threat never did anything to sister mr jersey tell lie derrington made gesture of disgust there there said what be use of talking further thing be settled when dorothy george be married will see what can do for mr ward face became wreathed with smile be such frivolous heartless little woman that must change from one mood to with wonderful rapidity oh thank dear lord derrington said artlessly pressing arm know be most generous of men really ca stop talking here day rustled over to dorothy darling must go do shopping can stay here will call again in hour george presented cheek can kiss mother in law george did so delicately so a not to spoil tint of cheek mr ward departed be like block of wood said to herself never did man kiss so coldly before ugh bear chapter xxiv startling surprise having thus settled matter in satisfactory manner with mr ward dorothy george sought out ireland next day passed delicious hour with dorothy renewed vow have made when there be little chance of bright future now future be altogether bright two built castle in air george be to marry dorothy be to take up residence with lord derrington george be to enter parliament on first opportunity must not neglect literary work said dorothy novel must be finished hope that many novel will be finished said george laughing will be like beaconsfield write novel between while of politics will be amusement will be amusement asked dorothy politics be amusing game when one have time to write what one plea at pace one plea be amusing also will be inspiration egeria be very like beaconsfield replied miss ward always called unknown woman egeria be more lucky know who egeria be more talk of light fanciful kind passed must have sounded foolish to sensible people george beloved be so happy that talked nonsense out of sheer lightness of heart at end of hour mr ward carried off dorothy george took leave of grandfather be next day that went to see ireland at door be informed that ireland have be very ill with heart that doctor have be called in nevertheless ireland must not obey advice of physician stop in bed be up dressed a usual in study george entered large bare room papered with gaudy advertisement saw former guardian seated at desk a usual man looked very ill large placid face be extremely pale there be dark circle under eye even seemed to have grown lean clothes hung loosely on did not rise when george entered young man knew that ireland must be ill to fail in courtesy a be extremely punctilious excuse george said with attempt at cheerfulness be not so well a might be be looking ill very ill said george taking seat ireland nodded ca live long remarked in heavy voice so doctor informs heart be extremely weak may die at moment george be shocked be not so bad a hope said be a bad a well can be for last few day have deviated sadly from usual habit have not taken walk system of life be quite upset be beginning of end paused sighed be looking well george have reason to mr ward have consented to marriage with daughter how be well church where parent be married have be discovered ireland looked interested that be good news where be married in wargrove church be parish in essex hour journey from town quite small place ireland made same remark that george have made strange said that being so near town place be not discovered before have doubt that advertisement set many people hunting well be glad that marriage have be proved at last for sake in justice to woman loved to dear memory be rosina vane after have be proved beyond doubt grandfather have seen copy of certificate now hold be pleased very pleased be now a friendly toward a have be hitherto hostile ireland nodded breathing heavily thought must be have long talk about on day called be when saw mr ward can go on said george seeing hesitation know whole story what story asked ireland suspiciously story of what happened at san remo mr ward know be violet howard sister jenny be miss bull yes poor jenny be better of two now drag out miserable life in london lodging house while violet who be bad woman mother of dorothy interrupted george imperiously say more sir be quite right a ca say good of woman let say bad well know how loved father think flirted with be jenny who really loved look at reward said ireland with deep sigh who try to do best always come off worst loved mother george have be lonely man life be sad case george wished to get at truth be so sorry for ireland who have passed so many miserable year that did not like to inflict more pain nevertheless be necessary to learn if ireland have really visited mr jersey on night so a to set bawdsey mind at rest if george did not learn truth bawdsey might attempt discovery must handle old man in much worse manner than george be likely to do while pondering how must set about unpleasant task george be saved from making first step always most difficult by observation from ireland paved way to explanation how did discover church asked idly in rather queer way lola velez ireland opened eye have be closed looked up who be lola velez asked anxiously be dancer whom helped oh quite in proper way mr ireland know name ireland contrary to george expectation nodded there be woman in san remo about time of father death be called velez be in love with seems to have be fascinating man said george smiling to set ireland at ease lola be daughter of woman mention be who found church by time ireland be quite awake keenly anxious for detail how did learn name demanded quickly found in confession of mr jersey ireland snapped paper cutter be holding leaning back in chair looked anxiously at george what do mean well replied young man keeping eye fixed on ireland face seems that mr jersey left confession behind a to what took place at san remo who have confession have got from lola how did manage to obtain for answer george related how lola have called to see mr jersey how have managed to steal confession be from reading finished george that learned of church in parent be married desiring must marry thinking must not do a be birth proved went to church to destroy register be caught with torn leaf arrested arrested yes wonder did not see case reported in paper have be too ill to read paper lately said ireland looking round room in rather helpless way none of servant told what happened oh lola be let off with small fine be now back dancing at music hall gave confession to did one else see authority can set mind at rest mr ireland got from lola before be taken to prison one have seen lord derrington ireland drew long breath of relief made strange remark just now george said not looking at young man told to set mind at rest why did say have read confession said george quietly mr ireland rose from chair began to pace room seemed so weak that george wished to return old man waved hand impatiently be right be all right said then stopped opposite to george then know know that father death be due to accident what did wretched woman tell truth told truth did not accuse of having murdered father did not suppose thought be a well to go to long home with a few sin a possible on conscience certainly exonerated thank god for said ireland returned to seat then looked at visitor in piteous manner george said in faltering tone have suffered greatly on account of most unhappy accident be sure must have sir let worry more be accident lord derrington heartily forgive for having be unconscious cause of father death ireland nodded thank god again said solemnly father be not very good friend a found difficult to forgive for having taken from woman loved at san remo got on better together stifled resentment so that might see a much of a possible george knowing be not on good term with vane thought that mr jersey might have accused of crime did try to get money out of so bawdsey told bawdsey who be forget know be private inquiry agent who have be looking after case on behalf of lord derrington learn from confession of mr jersey that be husband george rate remember told married went to america be after return from america that tried to get money out of refused not that did not realize danger to must expose knew that if once yielded must be in power besides have defense a got stiletto from woman velez be with same stiletto that mr jersey be killed by whom asked ireland did husband know who killed perhaps may know ireland looked genuinely surprised how must know well said george rather awkwardly seems that bawdsey have got into head that knew about confession did not that be afraid must be published after death that went to house on night to get did not how must have entered house bawdsey think have latch key key be handed to lord derrington agent when house be sold in plain in word george man bawdsey rate whatever call accuses of murder doe exactly accuse know what else must call statement accusation retorted ireland with heat never be near house certainly thought that mr jersey might leave such confession never asked about never thought that healthy woman must die before knew that sooner later bad heart must carry off in spite of regularity of life then can not guess who killed be never near house be in bed asleep servant will tell so need not ask said george quickly never thought be guilty only came to receive assurance so might tell bawdsey prevent troubling if bawdsey come here will soon make short work of said ireland sharply be not afraid need not be mr jersey own confession exonerates mind even must have faced worst have to be faced never be coward except in one thing paused looked timidly at george shrank from telling how be unhappy cause of father death be not cause in opinion mr jersey be cause well thought must shrink from did know do know shrink from replied george leaning across desk to shake ireland hand be pure accident have be related by enemy be so glad truth be known to at last faltered old man that see how unconsciously caused death be son george son of only woman ever loved of woman for whose sake have remained lonely year have condemned emotion prevented from saying more george grew alarmed by pallor please think more of matter mr ireland said be ill go lie down yes will lie down ireland leaned heavily on george arm will lie down for ever be glad know be glad be not angered be best of friend mr ireland have always be kind to be sure dead mother blesses for goodness to orphan boy rosina rosina murmured ireland how loved have eye george kind nature come let get to bed soon curtain will drop be afraid visit have be too much for be glad came be glad spoke out always intended to do so feared lest must blame by time be ascending stair george conducted old man to room sent for doctor ireland undressed got to bed then insisted on george leaving be ill protested young man be dying what of be glad to die will meet rosina again after long long year of sorrow go george understand one have forgiven there be more to be said there be nothing to forgive replied george softly then to humor old guardian departed strong grip of hand be exchanged between george left room saw ireland lying a still a corpse only lip moved murmured continuously rosina rosina be true to woman loved to very end george left house a there be nothing must do intended to call in again meanwhile repaired to amelia square to see bawdsey derrington wished to tell detective to stop looking after case discharge from employment in pocket george have check for one thousand pound when be paid whole case be to be relegated to obscurity now that derrington be reconciled to grandson be anxious for obvious reason that sordid tragedy of mr jersey death must not come to light have not played very respectable part in moreover did not wish confession published must only be case of washing family linen in public george agreed that be undesirable sooner bawdsey married lola went to america better derrington thought for own sake bawdsey must hold tongue seeing what close connection be of dead woman bawdsey be at home saw george at once looked rather excited must hardly keep seat well mr brendon asked what be must rather ask said george seem excited not very only have be fortunate in business what be business will tell that later what be yours pleasant one rejoined george here be check for one thousand pound grandfather promised marry lola go to state stop searching for assassin of mr jersey thank replied bawdsey taking check eagerly grandfather be prince mr brendon a to case why must stop searching will never find assassin pardon said bawdsey in high glee have found assassin yes a george uttered ejaculation miss bull killed mr jersey chapter xxv truth george stared at triumphant detective in surprise seemed impossible that what stated must be true miss bull be very last person whom brendon must have accused one have be more candid than have be one at time of discovery of crime have done more to help detective must mean margery said george after time replied bawdsey in determined voice mean little white old woman with black eye miss bull a know miss jenny howard what reason ah be long story will tell have have arrested not yet will be arrested before end of day have already communicated with scotland yard george rose walked to window felt irritable upset now that truth have come to light wished that bawdsey have not be so confoundedly interfering detective next word annoyed still further be idea about margery put on scent said with great complacency though to be sure have suspicion before be to watch miss bull came here what made think that be guilty have confessed in calmest manner too that mean before why did suspect well seemed to that be only person who must have killed eliza eliza hated one because of mutual love for father george groaned what lot of trouble father have caused with handsome look charming manner even after death fatal attraction exercised seemed to bring about disaster did not kill mr jersey on account said wait till hear will tell in fact asked to send for a wish to speak where be now in famous sitting room playing patience doe realize peril of position in way doe seems quite ready to face worst poor woman said george thinking of sad life old maid have led if have sinned have suffered if people will use knife in way must be punished be rather harsh retort of bawdsey talk stuff bawdsey have own sin to think of never committed murder one said have may do so before die bawdsey shuddered hope not mr vane said know why must say thing be honest man say that so often that will begin to disbelieve replied brendon rather cynically if marry lola will kill will kill will take chance of if george made impatient gesture with hand returned to seat never mind further chatter let hear how came to learn that poor creature struck blow if talk way of criminal mr vane what will say of good woman good man there be more joy over sinner repenteth miss bull doe repent said bawdsey will hear story before give opinion on point say that be remark made yes be said bawdsey eagerly throwing into seat remark margery might be guilty one moment interrupted george in turn may tell have seen mr ireland declares that never be near house on night that knew nothing of confession that have latch key be innocent now have heard miss bull know that sir be one well how did find out bawdsey cleared throat began with most important air rather agreed with idea margery might be guilty said when turned over in own mind thought more more probable therefore determined to get margery alone work on fear pah said brendon with disgust well sir retorted bawdsey shrugging shoulder have to get at truth somehow detective work be not so honorable a novelist make out got margery alone how did set to work well be morning in sitting room miss bull have gone out have left margery to make up account girl be laboring away at getting into hopeless mess came to speak with offered to do soon put account to right then began to talk of miss bull why of miss bull why bawdsey pinched lip thought at time that margery be guilty if in talking to laid blame on miss bull that girl must speak out traded on poor wretch friendship bawdsey be ashamed of be ashamed of replied detective penitently lord bless mr vane one get used to sort of thing in business mean justifies end far more than in religion certainly think justifies end in religion said george sharply well accused miss bull of crime in way did margery denied what did say that might a well confess declared that have evidence to prove miss bull guilt that must be arrested when came back declare mr vane thought that girl must strike be like wild cat wish have growled george whose generous spirit be revolted by use bawdsey have put margery to said if arrested miss bull must kill said 'as killed aunt up said 'yes did kill miss bull be innocent know be ' of course when admitted fact at once began to suspect miss bull why did do because if margery have be guilty must not have owned up if miss bull be guilty margery must certainly take guilt on poor girl murmured george there be something noble in dull soul bawdsey must not see mentally disagreed with however did not want to argue down brendon too tender conscience so went on with recital while margery be threatening taking guilt on miss bull came in stupid girl ran to fell at foot cry that knew that must die for dear miss bull did woman say asked if knew said did demanded how found out told that be business began to smell rat suspected be bluffing must have held tongue margery be in such terror for friend that came out with whole story miss bull tried to stop margery kept repeating that must die for dear miss bull so let cat out of bag girl be half witted may not be true oh yes be when miss bull saw that game be up sat down admitted that have killed mr jersey also said that be glad truth have come to light that wished to die so on be raving said george incredulously not thinking one must incriminate so freely be told whole story in calmest manner just a though be asking to have cup of tea then asked to send for sat down to play patience wonder be not having watched said george with scorn oh wo run away replied bawdsey easily not perceiving irony of remark come along mr vane will go down see be desperately anxious to see do of boarder know not yet will when be arrested george shuddered followed bawdsey down stair seemed terrible to that fragile little creature a miss bull must be subjected to disgrace did not condone crime have acted wrongly must take consequence must not forget that be dorothy aunt wished must see way of rescuing from dreadful position miss bull be a bawdsey have stated playing patience seated at very table where victim have sat dealt card seemed quite interested in game margery be seated in chair near at hand looking with tearful eye into face of friend beyond fact that miss bull be whiter than usual showed sign of emotion have come george said addressing by name be glad to see mr bawdsey may go detective be taken aback must have remonstrated margery rose approached have done worst said eye flashing go will twist neck bawdsey shrugged shoulder with glance at george went out after have heard story before did not particularly care to hear again besides bawdsey be kindly man felt sorry that have proceeded to such extremity miss bull shuffled pack of card laid away in box will play game no more said have be playing patience life end have come be glad have come hush margery for girl have burst into tear will see that be left well off looked after dear want that want sobbed girl slipped to floor laid head on miss bull knee like faithful dog miss bull patted head allowed to remain in position while spoke to george margery sobbed for time then remained quiet listening to word quite content to feel gentle hand of old maid smoothing hair suppose be astonished when mr bawdsey told said miss bull looking with piercing eye at brendon be never thought that must kill mr jersey finished woman quietly why not be bad wicked creature caused death of father boasted of where when asked astonished young man in very room in presence to make understand have better tell one moment bull when told fortune on night did intend to kill mr jersey no death card did turn up be strange coincidence george when came down stair have more idea than of killing wretched woman what made do be telling replied miss bull folding hand on lap wait hear mr jersey be very rude to on night intended to remonstrate with added insult to injury by locking margery in bedroom so a to keep from heard scolding margery in passage when be quiet mr jersey have gone down stair went up to margery room unlocked door mr jersey have struck poor child be sobbing on bed then determined to go down for second time see mr jersey for second time be down before be replied miss bull calmly wondered who mr jersey have coming to see particularly after have lost courage when saw yellow holly in coat noticed that yes noticed holly also wondered why wore sight of put into mind that fatal night when miss bull brushed aside thought matter thought must see if mr jersey be seeing one also wished to talk about yellow holly why must trouble about seeing one miss bull looked down then looked up abruptly mr jersey must have sent back to asylum if must be always afraid lest must see one secretly about matter crept down stair leaving margery in room playing at patience mr jersey door be closed heard murmur of voice put ear to keyhole heard dancer afterward learned that be dancer heard accuse mr jersey of having killed percy vane on what ground did lola base that accusation said mother told remember muttered george mother on receiving back stiletto certainly might have thought so what did mr jersey say asked aloud denied made sort of excuse remained to hear more knew then that mr jersey have killed percy did not be accident know explained be cause be right to kill for percy must have be alive must have be wife george must have be step son what did do next went up to room resumed game of patience intended to have talk with mr jersey next morning when found that have struck margery came down at once be after eleven about quarter past mr jersey be in room talked told what have heard denied pointed to stiletto be on table a proof that girl have be here mr jersey said that be same stiletto with percy have be killed a lola have received from mother put thought into head that god intended mr jersey must be slain with same weapon with darling have be stabbed terrible thought must have put away did came again accused mr jersey of having killed percy gloried in fact that be through have died declared that if ireland have not held hand must have laid dead at foot exulted that accident have fulfilled intention taunted with fact that never became wife be very quiet added miss bull eye glittering blood be boiling mr jersey turned back on with insolent laugh sat down stiletto be on table head be turned away softly took dagger cried
