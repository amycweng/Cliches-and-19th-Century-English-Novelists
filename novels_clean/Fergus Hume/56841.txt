to recompense for damnable circumstance in found rippler feeling hungry a did groaned complainingly up gentle ascent topped rise stopped dead after proceeding few yard now mark cunning of destiny if have not brought to goal have at least led to place where must obtain motive power for in front of beheld tiny old fashioned house of weather board wall shaded by mellow red tiled roof stood directly on road be backed by circle of high tree elm fancy be quaint odd dreary looking cottage have be awkwardly converted into shop taking one of lamp flashed light on to narrow door stood open on to small window to left of door on to right handed wider one behind glass of be displayed various good one usually find in village store sight amazed especially when saw name of anne caldershaw inscribed on broad board over window for must espy village why did anne caldershaw set up stall here where there be one to buy why be shop not lighted up seeing that door be open for chance customer must not answer question became aware that here be start of promising adventure felt like alice in wonderland for shop in such lonely woody locality be just such thing a alice must have chanced upon however have time to bother over romance of thing for wanted petrol luckily saw red board on be announced in black lettering that petrol be for sale stepping into dark shop with brilliant lamp rapped on mean little counter one came although called out a loudly a must there be still eerie silence so walked towards small door set in inside wall knocked a there be still answer tried to open door found that be locked flight of step narrow rude ran up side of wall to upstairs room sang up stair a final shout produced better result than others made up mind to waste further time to fill tank with petrol leave money on counter even a searched for liquid kept marvelling at strange silence of anne caldershaw shop there be not only no one to buy there be not even anyone to sell circumstance be odd in extreme scented unexpected in damp air part of adventure a seemed be to fill tank get rippler ready to start whether destiny who be arranging detail must permit to get under way to reach clankton in time for dinner be quite matter however be actor not author so fulfilled part appointed part presumed by searching for petrol soon discovered orthodox red case having unscrewed with difficulty walked back to car stood little distance away directly in front of anne caldershaw shop took minute to fill up during time did not hear single sound yet a conjectured while replacing cap of tank there must be house house about since shop argued customer perhaps when turned corner for shop stood just on angle of road must find collection of cottage not likely to be so deserted a anne caldershaw emporium shortly tank be filled after seeing that be ready to start took empty can back to dark house placed necessary money on counter must have shouted again that seemed useless a apparently one be about for former cry must have awakened dead for one two minute stood in darkness listening for sound in house stared through open door at stream of light from acetylene lamp of rippler there be something very weird about situation suddenly heard soft faint moan seemed to come from behind locked door at back of shop on impulse of moment with rather grue a scotch call for sound be sinister unexpected sprang forward gripped handle of door to surprise moment twisted door opened at once yet swear that be locked when have last tried looked into dark room must see faintly to right barred window showed against fast darkening evening sky further moan must hear although listened with ear wondering if have be mistaken yet uneasy about now unlocked door stepped into back room holding on to inside handle a afterwards turned out floor of room be lower than of shop reached by three willow step therefore stumbled pulling door after with violence so that clicked to fell sprawling bruised elbow somewhat painfully still heard sound seated on floor to collect sens somewhat dazed by unexpected fall put out hand to explore darkness fell on soft flesh warm to touch on rough tangled hair thoroughly startled with excuse withdrew hand fumbled in pocket for match regretting have not brought one of lamp have mind to go out fetch curiosity be so great to be plain nerve be so unstrung that struck lucifer anxious to know best worst at once a pale tiny light grew stronger beheld form of woman lying on stone floor face uppermost face shuddered a looked for be distorted into expression of pain with twisted mouth glassy expressionless eye framed in loose mass of iron grey hair glimmered milky white bore stamp of death on feature woman be dead judging from moan have heard still warm flesh have just died while stared match light went out fancied that heard faint click lighted match hastily looking towards door leading to shop be still closed turned again to gaze at dead woman who be old ill favoured eminently plebeian at moment heard buzz of rippler at once in astonishment alarm sprang towards door be locked be prisoner while be still trying to grasp astounding fact drone of motor car died away in distance chapter ii beginning of mystery here indeed be adventure le romantic than tragical be locked up in back room of village shop in company with corpse of dead woman thief have gone off with motor car undoubtedly person who have stolen rippler be one who have locked door indeed must seem that person have laid trap for in first instance door have be locked in second have be open in third have be locked again individual who have gone off with car a presumably be case have not lured into trap since moan of now dead woman have led on to exploring back premise unknown might have counted upon if such be case why then here in darkness fumbling for handle of locked door terrible thought flashed into mind vague elusive thought must not put into word with sudden terror knocking at heart shook door cried for help hi what be asked rough uncultured voice in shop what be wrong wi ye mr caldershaw open door shook flimsy board again open door there be grunt of astonishment heard key turn in lock moment later door opened when at once flung out past burly man who be blocking way gripped before must pas heard hard breathing in darkness not so fast said man harshly what be doing here in mr caldershaw shop stop confound interrupted wrenching away ran to door of shop cry out explanation someone gone off with motor car there be dead woman in there time be man who interrupted with something more than word a dashed into deserted road looking up down in darkness for rippler liberator plunged after gripped again before must say word make movement have borne to ground by sheer strength of muscle holding down hard fast bellowed at pitch of voice ominous word murder murder murder shouted man with surprising volume of tone again fear knocked at heart for now elusive thought have be put into concrete form by yokel a took to be from roughness accent anne caldershaw believed body to be hers have be murdered by assassin who have escaped with motor car naturally thought of assassin a have waited until be bending over corpse of victim then locking in have made use of rippler by time must be beyond chance of recapture here be placed unexpectedly in compromising situation with chance upon very good circumstantial evidence of being accused of crime yet a even then thought confusedly there be nothing to show that woman have really be murdered a have seen neither wound blood let up gasped striving to throw off dead weight of big man only continued to roar for help gripping arm pressing knee into chest have not villager arrived verily believe that there must have be second if unconscious murder so brutally did fellow bear on prone body heard distant cry shortly there came flash of lantern borne by men woman running round corner of road a by magic be surrounded by alarmed crowd asking question at once turning many light on to face captor gave breathless explanation murder murder shouted still dwelling on top note found devil locked in back room without light shop pointed across way be without light also come out yelling that there be dead woman left behind be mr caldershaw for sure be done for murder murder where be police almost before finished explanation be not quite full one since gave account of motor car being stolen men woman be running into shop captor jerked roughly to foot on must scarcely stand so roughly have handled so sore be bone come along shouted much excited dragged across road into shop look on a have done for be fool protested be gentleman murderer none le retorted pushed furiously down three step into back room be now filled with men woman of latter be on knee examining body now saw to be that of elderly person plainly clothed in maroon coloured wincey dress with belt round waist whence dangled bunch of key cheap lace collar fastened with gaudy cairngorm brooch what with disconcerting way in captor handled seemed vain to resist restless light of lantern must not see much more one of men looked up why did cry out murder giles asked rough looking man who held there be wound on body be fit believe man giles loosened if have be mistaken began when cry from little woman cut speech short eye out eye out left one look look seized bystander arm in terror sure enough left eye be missing wondered why have not noticed that such be case when examined body by light of lucifer match remembered distinctly glassy expressionless eye yet now there be only one a now saw plainly enough doubtless in flickering light of match in agitation have omitted to see that there be one eye even at so critical moment began to wonder how must have overlooked so obvious fact then recalled story friend have told of man have met with in state to whom spoke for five minute thinking there be something odd about appearance before saw that ear be missing so easily a considered even when placid can fail to notice what be plainly apparent much le when unnerved a be when examining that dead face in match light be odd thought at time considering stood in such peril have cottage be in america daresay must have be lynched by rough crowd of villager around be not murder maybe growled giles seizing again devil have torn eye out so there be blood said man wisely if eye have be torn out be glass eye breathed stout dark woman with heavy face anne told a much when have tea together did like to be known poor soul being proud like took great pain to get best eye must be gone sure enough peered into dead face then at perhaps gentleman will tell why took by time since apparently anne caldershaw have not be murdered eye be merely glass current of popular feeling be running more in favour might be thief with eye in pocket be not murderer so villager gave time for explanation quite understand that thing look black against said hastily know nothing about matter arrived in front of shop in motor car stopped to get petrol after filled up left money will find on counter if look heard moan stepped into room to see what be wrong while looking at body after lighting match someone locked in ran off with motor car villager looked at one apparently thought that explanation be lame one giles who have treated so roughly grudgingly admitted that have seen motor car came round corner to get pound of bacon for supper said giles reflectively saw engine so phrased before door lady be stepping in lady interrupted be certain yes sir said giving polite address doubtfully saw plain enough in light of bright lamp have long white sort of gown on cap with veil flying behind on head just caught glimpse of when went off a hard a must in what direction murchester way if want good big town to go by said giles then send for police tell to telegraph to murchester to stop car be rippler z belongs

that look upon a doubtful character lock up house until police arrive take to inn if have one want something to eat drink eye said heavy dark woman give back eye have got eye snapped for with hunger thirst excitement unpleasantness of being unjustly suspected be not in best of temper can search if like dark woman must have done so readily being evidently of meddlesome nature giles interposed let gentleman alone mr faith said gruffly caught will keep till warshaw come daresay be mistake on part be sorry if oh blame mr giles interposed easily lighted cigarette to show nonchalance must have acted in same way so come along take to gaol relieved smile made man rugged face quite pleasant to look at a exculpation of ready offer to be searched evidently reassured greatly in eye at event be not desperate criminal have taken to be fellow villager still looked dubious mr caldershaw have heap of money hidden away ventured one little rat of man with squeaky voice search pocket then said again with open impatience have told be correct name be cyrus vance if send to artillery barrack at murchester friend lord cannington will have difficulty in identifying a thought must title acted like charm tension somewhat slackened giles who appeared to be most sensible of lot beckoned into dark shop leaving friend to guard house look after corpse of unfortunate woman walked beside round corner sure enough a expected came upon twinkling light of quite dozen house late mr caldershaw have customer after must seem what be name of place asked abruptly mootley replied giles now le suspicious more human ai very large village have more cottage than here scattered along road up yonder jerked thumb to left where lane ran from high road towards woodland be too dark to see anything

replied quickly then stealing that glass eye of hers sir being locked up in dark with corpse be corpse when entered mr giles moan attracted into room while be seeing by match light be matter someone locked door bolted with motor lady saw sir doubt since did not bring lady with wonder if got eye muttered giles half to must have got something be hers else must not have made use of car to escape then must have taken eye giles muttered again what deuce be talking about why must steal glass eye be what 'd like to know sir be odd thing to steal never knew that mr caldershaw left eye be glass one though told mr faith about well be gone lady who stole motor car took at least seems so tell what mr giles be too hungry to discus matter just now whole business be mystery to destiny have dragged into in most unpleasant way giles nodded be easy seen be innocent sir said with air of relief must talk so if be know so much about guilt can wear mask of brazen innocence if necessary how do know have murdered mr caldershaw at moment may not have celebrated glass eye in trouser pocket know yet that be be murdered mr vance there be wound pooh might have be poisoned why do think so sir asked

who be burly heavy faced animal man with a said before most engaging smile jaw be of bull dog order eye be extremely intelligent so judged that native wit have be considerably sharpened by sojourn in borough of southwark such man must easily master le travelled villager found that such be case giles acted a kind of headman of mootley opinion carried great weight in village council be just a well that have fallen into hand of such man otherwise unable to see be innocent of assault robbery must have be le hospitably treated a be found extremely comfortable mr giles bustled about in cheery way although news of mr caldershaw death seemed to have somewhat scared while getting supper laying cloth attending to kettle must frequently pause to consider husband story rather think expected said mr giles putting pot of jam on table expected what sarah asked husband guessing what alluded to death sam death told once be sure must not die in bed then think that have be murdered questioned yes do

miserly tendency have much money tucked away in stocking age be sixty be active woman for year lived entirely alone seemed that have be born in mootley have be absent for many year out at service so said although spoke very little about past with saving again be story of mr caldershaw have returned to die in native village for sake of something to do have opened corner shop did have many caller asked mentally noting detail never said so remarked mr giles who being somewhat of gossip took lead in conversation be close one be shop being round corner sir presume meant other gossip must never see who came went lived quite outside life sir owing to position of shop own way of keeping to herself once did say 'd never die in bed be what make think a may have be done away with never knew sam that 'd glass eye did know either said sam who be devouring huge slice of bread butter told mr faith though have seen heap of time never spotted that one eye be living other dead why must have be stolen by lady who went off with motor mr vance sends fair silly what be lady like sam ca exactly tell sarah a be growing so dark be tall with long white cloak cap veil be know hullo started from seat

about miss destiny sir miss destiny name curtsied chapter iii after event here be freakish thing have talked about destiny a dea ex machina goddess personally have come to superintend drama in be supposed a shrewdly suspected by time to take leading part however a open confession be good for soul may a well state at eleventh hour that story be written when mystery be solved justice have be done threw a be into fictional form thus a knew odd name of little lady when writing played upon oddity saw in incarnation of goddess who map out future can take explanation with without proverbial grain of salt a choose meanwhile here be on threshold of mystery flesh blood creature with significant name of destiny appears on scene when new comer stood up turned face to light have better view of

caught red handed by mr giles husband oh sir put in greengrocer wife deprecatingly begin at beginning commanded cannington who be still eating with healthy appetite of young animal go on to end be not clever enough to make up story out of scrap thus adjured detailed have taken place from time have left at mess room door on previous day became so interested that ceased to eat at conclusion of narrative jumped up from chair with ejaculation by jove said recalling conversation in rippler adventure be to adventurous be real life business beat of melodrama agree truth be always more impossible than fiction epigram doe meet case snapped cannington sum up boy who must ever invent such situation speak a playwright understand must never have imagined tragedy of old woman killed by hat pin for sake of glass eye much le implicating of inoffensive stranger theft of motor by murderess be sure be guilty certainly who woman must use hat pin to slay who woman must have hat pin to use why must kill old woman that question can only be answered when know more about lady in white cloak who bolted with car who be helen of troy for know what silly question ask cannington be not sherlock holmes retorted did come on straight to help through business forgive boy be brick what about duty got leave from adjutant be right what be to be done now must see inspector dredge look after motor be still piled up in field where lady left clever woman that knew that might be traced by number so got rid of car daresay footed to murchester went on to london by night train in white cloak 'd be traced if be fool enough to wear said dryly daresay will find that white cloak packed away in car come along let see cried cannington greatly excited one moment mr giles what about miss destiny servant be not up yet sir have taken in breakfast be returning to burwain to day think so sir sam told inspector dredge of what said last night wish to ask question about mr caldershaw past nodded doubt in mr caldershaw past will be found motive for committal of strange crime glass eye be dangerous possession mr giles lor ' sir do think have anything to do with everything if remember what miss destiny said about value mr caldershaw attached to that glass eye be dead evidently since eye be missing be murdered for possession depend upon mr giles when inspector dredge learns history of eye will be able to lay hand on lady who so ingeniously escaped after said cannington looking back from door really be arrested vance be can put that be under surveillance boy what rot come tell dredge so said taking arm will be back soon mr giles so tell husband with nod went out found cannington rather trent motor at door got into to proceed to shop round corner here found inspector dredge surrounded by myrmidon explained to that friend have come to vouch for respectability also that desired to go in search of rippler inspector although a grim faced be le taciturn than on previous night received explanation most kindly assuring that there be little need for lord cannington to state honourable quality although added lordship be welcome to depose to position a matter of form oh mr vance be right said cannington cheerily only commits murder on stage think even on stage ever committed so ingenious murder a one seems to be retorted dredge nodded yes unknown woman be singularly clever then think be guilty what else can think mr vance said dredge raising eyebrow from what tell be inclined to think that be hiding in upstairs room there be two when entered shop possibly sound appearance of car drove there after have murdered unfortunate mr caldershaw did not enter shop immediately well be few minute looking into thing connected with car shop be in darkness complete darkness thought so woman heard car coming later on saw doubtless slipped out of back room where have just stabbed victim have eye seems to be motive for commission of crime in pocket must not walk into road without running chance of meeting so sprang up stair yonder pointed to step clung to wall on one side have light railing on other took refuge in bedroom when heard enter back room came down turned key ran away with car humph said after pause permit to put right on one point mr inspector believe that woman be in back room when entered shop for when tried door in order to find someone be locked really dredge made hasty note be key on outside remember know be must not pull open door must not have have time to change key from inside to outside mused inspector daresay key along be on outside a be now glanced at door leading into back room sure enough there be key possibly shot bolt there be one on hither side of door a noticed well well while be filling tank of car with petrol must have emerged a say unable to escape without observation by road must have slipped upstairs when found door open on trying for second time entered back room attracted by last moan of dying woman then murderess mean must have come down after softly turning key have gone off in car why must leave car in field asked cannington to more easily escape said dredge raising eyebrow car with number must easily be traced took a near murchester a dared then abandoned walked to town be theory then must either remain in murchester take train to other place will be hard matter to find a have concealed trail very successfully might have left evidence behind in car suggested dredge shook head examined car morning remarked there be not vestige to show that woman occupied have not left even so much a pin behind pardon left hat pin yes said inspector grimly in heart of unfortunate mr caldershaw car be still in field near murchester mr vance will leave to take away know how much be injured last night said that be much hurt said hastily quite so sir said dredge imperturbably last night examination be necessarily perfunctory a be in hurry to reach scene of crime morning examined car more carefully be not sufficiently expert to see what damage have be done remember be driven violently through wooden gate on purpose asked cannington quickly inspector cast side glance at fresh coloured face ca say lord think not woman driving down incline nearly ran into miss destiny trap to avoid complete collision may have turned steering wheel too completely round so probably dashed by mischance through gate indeed think be true explanation then for accident said cannington pertinaciously must have driven car to murchester really ca offer opinion on point lord be working in dark just now have said be mere theory founded upon circumstantial evidence however mr vance turned to can go see after car tell what think be glanced at watch sharply after have examined miss destiny be told by giles that knew mr caldershaw be coming here to pas night want to be present if will so far oblige will be delighted wish to hear of everything connected with most interesting case do mind if lord cannington be present also not at said dredge graciously shuffled note be lying on counter miss destiny will be here in few minute can go into back room where crime be committed where be body asked cannington abruptly have be laid out in one of bedroom upstairs do wish to view lord oh hang certainly not gasped cannington hastily with repugnance upper class exhibit towards such morbid sight be only asking a wish to sit in room with corpse inspector threw open door to display back premise see said inviting by gesture to enter body have be removed in grey daylight for there be sun to graciously soften crudity room looked forlorn chill lonely cannington stepped at heel with nervous shiver for be somewhat impressionable now noticed that there be two window in outer wall looked on to kind of fenced clearing sown with cabbage potato leek jostled other in disorderly fashion path between bed be so grass grown that be apparent little interest have be taken in garden by late owner of corner shop paling fence unpainted broken surrounded oblong of cultivated ground seemed to push back encircling elm forming small untidy wood behind there be gate in fence so sole mean of egress be through shop between window be door leading into dismal garden standing cheek by jowl with cumbersome chimney back door be locked found like last night exclaimed dredge now more communicative le grim odd thing be that key be missing perhaps mr caldershaw never went into garden remarked doe not look inviting oh must have gone out of door sometimes insisted inspector for there be small shed filled with coal wood outside must have replenished fire occasionally know mr vance well then probably have locked door for night when be murdered by white cloaked woman daresay why must key be missing cannington made suggestion woman locked when escaped escaped through shop after locking mr vance in retorted dredge so why must have troubled to steal back door key on face of did not require huh said boy seems to have weakness for taking queer thing mr inspector witness glass eye dredge nodded hear miss destiny know something about at moment a if in answer to name little old lady stepped daintily into back room looked a shabby frail a ever undoubtedly be gentlewoman eye still revealed strong vitality with curtsey to to cannington addressed graciously to inspector dredge trap be at door sir be anxious to return to home at burwain since poor woman came to see be unfortunately dead murdered said dredge laconically miss destiny blinked with wonderfully youthful eye recoiled with nervous gesture of hand murdered whispered half to herself did not tell that who did not tell ma'be demanded inspector brusquely lucinda servant mr giles wife replied brokenly how be murdered ordinary hat pin with blue glass bead for head be thrust into heart ma'be must have died immediately how dreadful why must be murdered poor soul so far a can gather on account of glass eye be missing must like to hear what have to say on point ma'be dredge fixed stern eye inquisitively on little old lady miss destiny sat down quietly appeared to make effort to recover composure have be sorely shaken very naturally by news of strange murder can say be that anne have glass eye to appeared to attach ridiculous value at point became aware that be repeating word for word speech of previous night certain of when continued anne often declared that must not lose for fortune now be lost be dead dear have be stolen have be murdered corrected inspector smartly must like to know why mr caldershaw attached such value to eye ca tell that mr inspector because know anne be always very close kept business to herself who be woman asked dredge impatiently who be woman mean sir corrected miss destiny smartly in turn can tell that be brother housekeeper at burwain for many year when died five year ago more le added miss destiny precisely retired with saving to place be native village here set up shop have seen since came to live here at interval sir anne be valued old servant whom respected at time say once year came over to stay night with have enemy not to knowledge sir be happy here a happy a grumbler like anne must be for there be denying poor soul that be grumbler ended little old lady regretfully what be brother name ma'be said dredge producing note book gabriel monk sir be bachelor lived at lodge burwain kept house for with anne a servant until died then anne came here took small cottage in village where now be lodge asked dredge somewhat irrelevantly thought brother walter monk inherited lodge money of deceased relative life there now with niece oh inspector here saw point in opinion ought to have noticed before then gabriel monk be not exactly brother called so because looked after house for really be not sir brother in law then not even that mr inspector let explain sister married walter monk brother of gabriel became widower with one child girl gabriel took gertrude girl to live with when be small child asked to take charge of did so therefore fell into habit of calling gabriel brother a see be relation pardon mr inspector see what private business have to do with murder of anne caldershaw dredge snapped elastic band on closed pocket book wish to learn can about dead woman past said gruffly so ask to tell know have told know said miss destiny rising now may take departure a have long way to drive dredge nodded may have to return for inquest said abruptly in case will come over to burwain to ask question by mean anyone will tell where live said miss destiny with dignity trust that expense will be paid must be required a witness at inquest here noted again revealed miserly tendency oh yes be right said dredge miss destiny again making queer little curtsey to cannington be about to depart when stopped with question will please tell name of lady asked indicating photograph in silver frame miss destiny eye be too keen to require glass recognised face at once dear be photograph of gertrude niece certainly anne nursed know gertrude be always greatly attached to will be distressed when hears of tragedy dear never knew gertrude have given anne portrait in such very expensive frame waste waste why do ask about sir coloured thought face be so lovely be reply made in low somewhat awkward voice miss destiny gave piercing glance nodded in friendly manner evidently amused by embarrassment gertrude be a good a be beautiful said smiling good day gentleman left shop to mount trap lucinda wrapped rug carefully round knee oddly assorted pair drove away meanwhile cannington who be always much too clever when dulness must have be more diplomatic laughed meaningly whispered adventure be to adventurous said cannington wickedly so said before remark be original in case answered tartly what mean oh of course chaffed softly have got eye in head be joseph where pretty girl be concerned be pretty turned to look at goddess be oh shut up interrupted crossly mr inspector be going to look after motor car inquest will be held in house to morrow at ten o'clock settled matter for time being departed with boy who still chaffed like silly young as be old vance in love ho ho said annoying boy chapter v important discovery on examination rippler appeared to have suffered trifling hurt by accident design flying lady have driven machine straight through ancient five barred gate fortunately be much too decayed to present serious obstacle across stubbled field a ripping ploughing of ground showed car have reeled drunkenly until by own weight be bogged in friable furrow here have be deserted with smashed lamp slightly damaged front with considerable amount of paint scraped off immediate test showed that machinery be in excellent working order be easy task to restore derelict to hard level of high road cannington collected gang of agriculturals from unknown quarter set to work with spade crowbar broad weather board from adjacent incomplete building a temporary tram line tow rope from trent machine to mine managed job fairly expeditiously considering environment with water from nearest pond for outside of car oil petrol for interior managed to get rippler into working order although be more le shaken did not run very smoothly fortunately lady have abandoned loot within mile of murchester so with careful driving contrived to get over distance in safety after storing rippler in convenient garage to be repaired overhauled went on to barrack with cannington in trent motor here proposed to put up until inquest be at end be free to leave neighbourhood be rather nuisance to be thus publicly housed a one might put for everyone from colonel to latest joined subaltern asked question aired impossible theory intimate connection with affair made object of interest to one small wonder that must be so for mystery of affair be most enthralling on way to quarter cannington perhaps to distract thought from more immediate trouble mentioned casually that wentworth marr have left card for at mess just before have arrived on day of murder did not take interest in marr a have never seen so be matter of indifference to whether have called not boy fidgeted over matter a made sure be about to be asked knotty question officially a head of wotton family be certain that marr wish to know if will agree to marrying sister said cannington irritably know what to say refer to lady suggested absently sha'nt be too old for mabel want to marry in case wish weston must come up to scratch for told that loved mabel be quite pleased weston end of good sort be mabel have known almost a long a have vance be right deuced rich from one hears want old chap a brother in law for thousand of pound oh very well then said ungraciously tell to keep off grass will punch head be stopping at murchester suppose so card have lion head be best hotel here pencilled on called somewhere about three yesterday before arrived said 'd turn up again expect to find waiting for now be hanged lamented cannington if know what to say a after event proved boy be worrying needlessly for wentworth marr did not reappear at barrack on inquiry learned that stayed only one night in murchester then went back to london in motor for also travelled in latest vehicle of transit only mention apparently trivial fact because form certain link in chain of evidence led up to discovery of amazing truth meanwhile not foreseeing importance of trifle be rather annoyed with cannington for babbling mind be far too much taken up with mystery of mr caldershaw murder with must confess face of gertrude monk to permit to think of lady mabel wotton wooer elderly otherwise lady mabel appeared day so later at inopportune moment for brother be greatly fatigued with what have occurred during interval however returned from mootley in renovated rippler on third day found waiting impatiently for afternoon tea in cannington quarter be tall fresh coloured dashing girl amazingly like brother if have worn tailor made dress instead of khaki think anyone unless very close observer must have be wiser have known family for more year cared to remember liked lady mabel immensely a be outspoken companionable did not want man to be always telling that be goddess same must flirt when inclined although never did so with must not have be age for be younger than confounded marr came to talk about so presume looked upon a cannington elder brother at event friendship be always prosaic matter of fact have tea while lady mabel presided told that have just come down for hour that be very miserable that cannington ought to have written that did not know what to do though cyrus be might give advice never give advice interrupted hastily be not clever enough never said be retorted be slow sure thanks lady mabel think be just horrid why must be so stiff with know seeing that knew cannington since must toddle oh come now be not so old a that be ever so much older bachelor ca help since refuse to marry said smiling have never asked to not must accept replied promptly same need call lady mabel a if be keeping off with pitchfork well then mabel that be better gave friendly pat on shoulder know look on a good sort cyrus oldest friend have wriggled why do emphasise age so much cannington laughed knew that be thinking of admiration of miss monk photograph vance doe like to be reminded of age now why now questioned lady mabel suspiciously oh never mind said crossly what do want advice about fair companion put down cup in despair have be telling for last half hour mr marr want to marry asked four day ago then came down to enlist cannington on side huh said boy sagaciously sound a though have refused did then accepted did said again left open question until consulted cyrus after be rich not bad looking oh mabel cried cannington rising to perambulate narrow room know very well that love dickey weston what be use of loving man who wo speak mind dickey always life in moon only love from habit never loved from habit remarked lazily mabel put head on one side surveyed critically never did said candidly yet be better looking than dickey be got way with know what be absent mindedness suggested cannington may smoke mab oh yes can give cigarette also if be egyptian thanks awfully accepted one struck match for lighting of course dickey weston be absent minded selfish continued frankly same love mind anyone knowing one doe except dickey said with shrug suppose think be clever be truth after see why need be shy with man have known for century why not go to dickey

just a if be driving to altar said much exasperated must marry dickey if did love not if be twice a rich what about marr wilfully chose to ignore hint can remain a second string to bow cyrus after must marry money aunt lucy be lady denham late earl sister be always grumbling about dress oh well then never mind must be getting back to town looked at bracelet watch there be theatre party supper at ritz to night so have much time situation asked cannington helping on with cloak will temporise give dickey chance mean that marr will have none said gravely be not fair mabel shrugged shoulder

about on way to station will amuse know refreshing candour made laugh right out a descended stair be glad that have even afterthought of amusing position said very drily have grace to colour oh did quite mean that cyrus after ca think of everything at once cannington did that mabel have be brick for assistance must never have pulled through what rot muttered boy be secretly pleased then be in danger cried mabel startled have be replied with emphasis a discovered body own spotless reputation cannington asseveration of honesty prevented being arrested be so glad cyrus horrid thing for one friend being arrested for nasty pin sticking crime horrid indeed for friend where did hear of murder mab questioned brother oh paper yesterday morning be full of aunt lucy drew attention to a knew that knew said incoherently be at inquest be cyrus gave evidence tell about a only read scrap there be very little to tell answered yawning for really felt extremely tired found mr caldershaw dead in back room woman in white cloak presumably murderess ran off with motor car read what else nothing else save that found car not woman jury of twelve good lawful yokel brought in verdict of murder against person person unknown thought said woman be guilty be presumed so since bolted with car have turned up name be unknown so verdict be quite right person persisted lady mabel inquisitively mere graceful addition to round off sentence believe that woman stabbed mr caldershaw with sapphire headed hat pin sapphire headed must have be rich oh vance be drawing on theatrical imagination struck in cannington impatiently sapphire talk of be only blue glass oh reminds that paper said something about glass eye expect said very great deal about assented gravely catch journalist missing chance of hinting at mystery be mystery asked mabel walking before into station more le possibly more mr caldershaw be murdered by unknown woman presumably for sake of glass eye why cannington laughed be what police be trying to learn not that ever will believe truth will never be discovered be there letter paper be there gossip likely to interrupted impatiently for absence of circumstantial evidence bothered greatly inspector dredge looked over paper letter of dead woman found nothing likely to lead to discovery of guilty person name a to gossip appears that mr caldershaw kept to herself in

to learn why mr caldershaw be murdered why attached such value to glass eye of hers cannington laughed declined to believe being thoroughly good fellow ceased to chaff when saw that looked annoyed same remarked a strolled back to quarter will keep eye on vance be too inflammable want to marry in haste repent at leisure of course laughed uneasily maybe for cannington be right in main certainly be anxious to solve mystery doubted if zeal must have be equal to so arduous task have not memory of lovely face lured onward like will o ' wisp have long since wished to secure photograph so a to have image of divinity constantly before eye dredge very reasonably declined to permit illegal annexation mr caldershaw will have be found by inspector amongst shop account left died possessed of to nephew joseph striver proved on inquiry to be burwain gardener in employment of mr walter monk if striver will give sell portrait said dredge with official phlegm have objection be property police officer be much too grim unromantic to guess why sought to posse photograph needle to say did not tell also be considerably annoyed by failure to solve mystery of mr caldershaw murder since solution must have procured praise promotion so no one cannington guessed silly infatuation assuredly be silly for who idiot must fall in love with pictured face on instant there be denying be in toil of venus so although angered by such unaccountable weakness be bent upon meeting original then ah well future be on knee of god however since be minded to trace out truth of crime be necessary to find clue to start trail that evening after dinner later in billiard room where played snooker with sundry young officer inwardly wondered how must must begin hat pin revealed nothing a woman us hat pin such with blue glass head be probably common enough missing eye might have thrown light on darkness be safe in pocket of assassin will be noticed that in spite of open verdict of jury clung to idea that white cloaked woman be guilty not only have fled with car have locked in with victim to prevent immediate pursuit also abandonment of motor pointed to guilt have be seen by giles by miss destiny by lucinda from time machine have be sent crashing through five barred gate by reckless intendedly reckless driving have vanished a completely a though earth have opened to swallow up yet might have guessed that aggressively striking white cloak must betray in opinion woman who have so cleverly engineered escape must scarcely be foolish enough to risk detection by dress so conjectured that must have got rid of cloak a have got rid of rippler with idea in head settled without telling cannington to explore field wherein machine have be abandoned when at rest for night remembered that mr giles who have not be called a witness have stated how mr caldershaw entertained idea that must not die in bed have questioned greengrocer wife on point must tell nothing more mr caldershaw gave hint of enemy even of possibility of tragic death have done be to make above statement to mr giles in burst of confidence to shiver when litany mentioned murder sudden death mr giles be particular about point be sitting next to in same pew said mr giles insistently shivered shook looked over shoulder apprehensive like happened three time be what made observe be sure be frightened of something of someone might have be case mr caldershaw never explained carried reason of fright in silence to untimely grave connecting mr giles story with remark of miss destiny a to value set on glass eye by woman with sinister fact that glass eye be missing felt certain that way to begin search be to take eye a clue local gossip in mootley revealed few useful fact a mr faith appeared to be sole person who have be told about eye by owner none of villager seemed to know one eye have be different to other in burwain where mr caldershaw have lived for year a gabriel monk housekeeper a nurse to truth might be found by careful inquiry if must learn where unfortunate woman got glass eye what accident have brought about necessity for glass eye chance be that might learn something must enable to trace truth therefore determined to go to burwain hunt out information about mr caldershaw past meanwhile there remained field near murchester to be explored next morning cannington be engaged on court martial so be left to own device although wanted to hand over for entertainment to le busy brother officer excused on plea wished to walk off headache so contrived to leave barrack unhindered be nine o'clock when set out morning be wonderfully clear for misty august field a stated before be only mile from murchester so speedily arrived therein left middle of where rippler have be stranded severely alone skirted round side to examine hedge be ragged untrimmed with deep ditch on inner side consisted of holly bramble hawthorn various sapling scratched more le severely for quite one hour without discovering sign of white cloak perhaps thought much discouraged woman have risked wearing after yet must not believe that have be fool seeing how cleverly have manipulated escape then noticed that there be two gate to field one with broken bar through have entered from high road in car other on far side to right hand looking from road then occurred to that flying lady scared by meeting miss destiny trap perhaps afraid lest have injured must be stopped for damage might have left field by last gate immediately walked towards found that opened on to narrow lane in winter must have become stream of mud hedge be very ragged tangled here gate be nearly hidden common five barred unpainted gate in worse condition than opening on to road knew that have struck on flying woman trail almost a soon a arrived at hidden gate on one of bramble filmy scrap of gauze fluttered in wind apparently while getting over gate in hurried flight woman veil have caught in thorn have twitched irritably away leaving scrap unthinkingly behind a evidence secured same placed in pocket book then made thorough examination of gate on side further evidence be forthcoming until searched ditch in instance be on farther side of hedge there hidden amongst dank weed thrust into convenient rabbit hole in crumbling clay bank be cloak drew out with sensation of triumph from be wafted torn veil have outfit complete save for motoring cap evidently rending of veil have drawn woman attention to eccentricity of white cloak worn on chilly autumnal evening acting promptly a be custom guessed that from theft of car have concealed cloak veil then have vanished down muddy lane heaven only know whither have now evidence be white cloak of good even expensive material round neck down front along hem two letter be embroidered repeatedly in blue silk so a to form pattern be g m dropped cloak gasped with dismay g m in twisted fanciful letter formed running adornment of cloak worn by woman who have stolen car who have to appearance murdered mr anne caldershaw name of child have nursed of woman with whose portrait have fallen so unexpectedly in love be gertrude monk be lie said aloud to nobody in particular believe same accusing initial be there g m gertrude monk chapter vi rival have not be in love with face instead of flesh blood woman suppose must have gone off at once to dredge to announce discovery show what have found in spite of evidence to very strong contrary must not believe that gertrude monk be guilty of old nurse murder might have locked in might have run off with car practically wrecked might have hidden in hedge incriminating garment assuredly have not in now terribly biassed opinion thrust hat pin into mr caldershaw heart unless confessed guilt to face resolutely declined to believe that have perpetrated sordid crime however be useless to stand in chilly field weighing pro con when knew nothing of woman save that be exquisitely lovely have captured fancy against will a be have natural revulsion of doubt then believed in more than ever even to extent of vowing that if by chance be guilty must never go to scaffold through if wished to prevent that there be time to be lost in getting rid of infernal cloak veil for inspector dredge with unexpected insight might come nosing about field not that credited with such perspicuity a swiftly determined be just a well to be on safe side therefore rolled up veil cloak into a small compass a possible thrusting under overcoat wore one a morning be breezy regained road hastened return to murchester barrack felt be compounding crime one minute exulted next be saving life of innocent woman yet on face of be surely guilty luckily when arrived at cannington quarter be still absent on duty so unpacked portmanteau have be sent down from london stowed away incriminating evidence at bottom of book manuscript shirt pyjama then strapped locked portmanteau so that cannington soldier servant must not officiously wish to pack belonging must use other portmanteau thought just a completed task cannington entered unbuckling sword ouf be tired said pitching into chair what bore be sitting on court martial be punishment asked lighting pipe asked more for sake of regaining self control shaken by discovery than because took interest in private tommy atkins five day c b be only drunken fight throw over cigarette vance

start with miss monk yes replied feeling qualmish be mr caldershaw nursling may be able to throw light on glass eye feel convinced that therein lie solution of mystery worst of literary men said cannington addressing ceiling be that talk too much like book touched wood touched wood fled for door a swung up chair cushion disarrange hair come along to luncheon obeyed tell anyone be going to mootley said hastily right oh will take rippler light out for town at two o'clock will meet at dinner then can tell about funeral so be arranged made very good meal at least boy did being unworried with secret disagreeables did not eat much knowledge of what be hidden in second portmanteau lay heavily on mind fear betrayed discomfort for cannington remarked occurred to that murderer must have to posse amazing nerve to conduct a ordinary human being seeing that with crime on mind be so easily discomfited of course under circumstance must have thought of guilty rather than of guilty really must not bring to believe that diana of ephesian have murdered old nurse cannington did not waste rippler on invited cheery subaltern to join two boy went off in highest spirit with lordship spanchelled between seat wheel resisted kindly meant invitation of trent to play stickey turned face in direction of mootley thankful to be by during few mile to village have ample to think about must not help wondering at strange whirl of circumstance have gathered round during last week have come out to seek adventure have found one with vengeance how must end must not tell sun came out during afternoon so found walk for disturbing thought extremely pleasant on passing field congratulated have emptied of incriminating content inquiry dredge made on face of must learn nothing a alone possessed tangible clue a clue so far led to miss gertrude monk thorough explanation must have to be forthcoming before must go past be just a well for own peace of mind mine also that must give to friendly disposed inquirer thinking of wondering how must explain flight from corner shop in motor car drew near outskirt of mootley famous shop have appeared in several illustrated daily paper be closed so did not pause went on directly round corner met mr sam giles ex greengrocer who greeted in most friendly manner be just too late sir said touching hat quite ready to give information be planted mr caldershaw yes sir be quite pretty funeral with plenty of mourner wreath for coffin made holiday of morning think sir that there be much doing afternoon a excitement be too great must not help smiling in spite of gravity of errand at idea of villager extracting pleasure from such dismal affair a funeral of murdered woman giles apparently have morbid love of class for such thing went on supplying information in high spirit heap of gentleman of press came from london said importantly photographed grave what with motor car bicycle trap cart place be like fair will advertise mootley lot must wonder if land went up in value hereabouts nodded mr caldershaw have be quite benefactress to village mr giles by way did miss monk miss destiny appear at funeral sir none of mr caldershaw burwain friend came to see last of poor soul be unkind take only mr striver put in appearance to be sure must not do le added giles thoughtfully since left property striver striver be nephew yes mr vance handsome young man be gardener believe who work for mr walter monk at burwain not that will do much work now for daresay aunt have left enough to live like gentleman lawyer be murchester man in small way of business told that there be over five hundred pound in bank besides there be lease of shop for two year content lucky mr striver be left to bantered yes sir along with glass eye have set face towards village wheeled at last word why dickens did leave glass eye goodness only know mr vance leave did mr striver quite annoyed have got intends to offer reward for will have to find guilty person first said grimly white cloaked lady sir winced may not be guilty person after there there went on hastily a giles showed disposition to argue know nothing more about matter than do be absolutely necessary white lie considering circumstance tell mr giles doe young man know why aunt valued glass eye so greatly sir told that must guess why be left to be on fire to find out be why intends to offer reward at present be in shop looking over thing doe intend to give up gardening turn shopkeeper asked know sir nothing have be settled return to burwain so told evening be going to murchester sir on errand for wife so if will excuse one moment giles have anything fresh be discovered sir mark word sir nothing more ever will be discovered woman in white cloak have vanished entirely glass eye be taking interest in case mr vance can wonder at seeing how be mixed up in business want to solve mystery if can out of sheer curiosity here address mr giles hastily scribbled on card if hear of anything new let know at once giles took pasteboard promised faithfully to keep ear eye open mind on alert then moved away down road to murchester with parting advice must inspect grave be pretty grave said giles cheerfully with lovely view did not go to look at grave at view corpse presume be supposed by giles to appreciate for struck that striver being in corner shop must be excellent opportunity for to gain possession of photograph therefore turned back in few minute be knocking smartly at closed door shortly be thrown open on threshold appeared one of handsomest young men have ever seen there be sign of good breeding about also in navy blue serge with tweed cap brown boot rather odd dress for funeral thought looked le like gardener more like smart city clerk yet in bearing there be smack of west end mr joseph striver be moderately tall perfectly made slim in figure with alert poise of athlete hand foot certainly betrayed plebeian one must deny beauty of clean shaven face say beauty advisedly although be odd adjective to apply to man be greek face greek head clean cut virile of fair golden saxon type yet more intellectual than same generally be fashionable lady might have envied transparent complexion blue eye curve of lip form also be irreproachable small head set proudly on white column of throat possessed snake like grace on whole mr caldershaw heir be singularly handsome young fellow with small fortune added to personal advantage must be certain to succeed in life seemed quite pity so splendid youth must be mere gardener yet employment be eminently respectable since father adam originally took up profession looked inquiringly at so opened conversation name be vance mr striver oh interrupted in very pleasant somewhat cultured voice be gentleman who gave evidence at inquest come in please stepped aside to let past be very glad to see a wish to ask question proceeded into shop while closed door said have to say at inquest answered quickly read about in paper mr vance did not come to inquest then might have guessed that seeing be present only came over to funeral when heard that aunt have left money not in very appropriate clothes fear though have time to get outfit see now be looking into thing be in back room by time heap of letter paper lay untidily on floor miss monk photograph still smiled from mantelpiece stole glance at left more enthralled than ever wo mind going on with sorting said striver placing chair for dropping on knee want to get thing straight before dark a have to return to burwain for few day be so amazingly cheerful must not help saying so looked up smiling ca expect poor man who have come in for money to be miserable said striver with much truth besides aunt never did care for be quite surprised to learn be heir have be at attached to one must have come to inquest even before seeing met with so dreadful death there be much love lost between mr vance so only a heir did come to funeral ca pretend to feel very sorry that sound rather heartless seeing how have benefited by death striver shrugged daresay never be hypocrite put in place if disagreeable old woman left money must no longer use must break heart laughed ca say must very well then reiterated coolly put in place be sorry of course a must be for human being who be murdered otherwise shrugged again well there be more to be said there came pause believe hinted that wished to ask question striver straightened well yes have idea who murdered unfortunate aunt not in least what about lady in white cloak appearance be against same may be innocent young man blue eye flashed like sapphire doubt that else why must run off with motor car lock in well drawled not very sure of ground may have found aunt dead in fright oh wo wash interrupted in somewhat common way swore at inquest that be attracted into room by groan from aunt in case must not have be dead when lady went up stair be true admitted hold brief for escaped lady remember speak a though did retorted went on with sorting have anything be heard of nothing found motor car in field lady have vanished think striver raised up to ask question that must be traced by mean of white cloak shrugged in turn fenced a be not going to admit truth daresay cloak be noticeable enough same have not be traced now never will be must not be surprised if police gave up case young man rose quickly said promptly intend to offer reward ah wish to have lady hanged if be guilty why not asked bluntly if will have truth mr vance care one way other about possible hanging want to find glass eye think lady have suppose so muttered in hesitating manner then burst out yes indeed do want to find glass eye there be fortune connected with mr vance large fortune oh must not help betraying surprise so be why mr caldershaw attached such value to exactly in way exactly know how eye reveals whereabouts of fortune speak of humph do mean to say that mr caldershaw concealed money concealed whereabouts in glass eye yes do in way be fortune doe not consist of aunt saving have shop also when lived at burwain talked of large fortune fifty thousand pound mentioned on one occasion be concealed somewhere whose fortune be ca say father brother be dead now be always bothering about money never must tell anything said that when died must learn wanted to know from glass eye a father have passed over of course glass eye along with money come to fortune also fifty thousand pound raised arm with ecstatic expression what must do with heap of coin mr vance why must marry halted cast uneasy look on again began to sort letter oh be in love said smiling man of age be always in love remarked curtly never mind about want to find clue to glass eye tossed over paper feverishly to whereabouts know that person who murdered aunt have eye killed for sake of learning secret aunt may have left letter paper description saying how eye can reveal whereabouts of fifty thousand pound can imagine sat back on ham how eye can be clue said after pause unless there be piece of paper hidden in oh that be impossible do know what glass eye be like well have never seen one unless fixed in person head striver laughed have same idea about piece of paper explained carefully went to optician in tarhaven to examine eye suppose think a did that artificial eye be shape size fatness of almond something like admitted with paper enclosed within striver laughed again be shaped exactly like small sea shell simply curve of thin glass convex concave fit into socket like what will say like cupping glass humph in case must be impossible to conceal piece of paper behind without damage of course taking also into consideration smallness of eye only thing can think of added half to be that there be plan writing on back part reveals whereabouts of money there be space to write in objected considerably interested why not writing done with magnifying glass know have seen lord prayer written on sixpence nodded there may be something in what say admitted a appears that mr caldershaw be murdered for sake of eye must have value perhaps added with brilliant afterthought hid diamond behind must have to be very large diamond to bring in fifty thousand pound said striver seriously believe that eye be simply clue to treasure treasure well money jewel gold bank note what not know be that aunt certainly mentioned fifty thousand pound to father why did secure treasure perhaps did have buried somewhere well never mind turned over paper again come what may must find eye wo find there said rising to take leave with one eye on miss monk photograph better get police to trace white cloaked lady since believe have taken see who else must have committed murder have stolen glass eye said striver decisively in one way must be found somehow then then must deliver up glass eye be hanged want to go so far a that muttered nervously of course be woman being so be clever enough not to be caught daresay will learn secret of mr caldershaw procure fortune bolt to america moved towards door striver straightened to show out then with apparent afterthought drew attention to smiling face of miss monk admire said pointing effect be somewhat unexpected why asked roughly flushed scarlet through fair skin looking more handsome than ever why stared at in surprise why not must ask be very lovely face admire a work of art oh a work of art be right retorted quickly happens to be photograph of real person miss gertrude monk how do know demanded young man again flushing angrily miss destiny told that photograph be one of niece suppose mr striver must not mind buying will see hanged first retorted vehemently clenched fist what be miss monk to have never met mr striver so calm display such heat at apparently simple question must ask what be to striver stared at eye be a hard a piece of jade love said defiantly be taken aback by statement flushed in turn making not very polite reply nonsense why nonsense shouted striver who have by time completely lost temper how dare say that even though be gardener have feeling of human being difference in rank exclaimed hotly love level rank indeed then take that miss monk favor suit mind own business mr vance intend to make business snapped now a angry a be for did seem ridiculous that claud melnotte handsome a be must aspire to apple on topmost bough be talking damned rot damned insolence if have never seen miss monk ca possibly be in love with raged furiously said nothing about love that photograph took fancy wish to buy if possible striver snatched photograph silver frame off mantelpiece to cram roughly into pocket there cried vehemently be will ever see of then must seek out original said walking into shop be after in moment if dare to come interfering growled in voice thick with passion will break neck be easier said than done jeered now being content that young man be rival dangerous one at let pas striver paused irresolutely then did a be asked left shop leisurely glanced back when distance down road mr joseph striver drew photograph out of pocket insolently kissed apparently to intimate be odd man out chapter vii friend in need returned to murchester rather annoyed to find have rival even though be gardener there be denying that fellow be uncommonly handsome thus might captivate affection of woman above in station a have said before can lay claim to good look so if miss monk be young lady whose heart be in eye a saying go stood rather poor chance certainly striver while professing that loved have not ventured to say that there be response to daring still for knew romance might be reversal of king cophetua beggar maid in not unlikely case journey to burwain must certainly destroy peace of mind if loved picture of goddess how much more must love goddess herself when became flesh blood to hungry eye when searching for adventure have not counted upon entanglement however on reflection did not see why must not stand a good chance a gardener assuredly be better looking younger possessing certain amount of money if not man of exalted rank be gentleman in prime of life well on way to make comfortable income if not exactly fortune also possessed recognised position a rising dramatist have large circle of pleasant well to do friend to whom must introduce wife so made up mind to stick to gun in other word to see miss monk learn how land lay of course if loved young striver there be nothing more to be said if did not love be on part must then try luck at point recalled memory of infernal glass eye if good look did not tempt lady fifty thousand pound might do so must striver become possessed of glass eye stood remarkably good chance of securing fortune so far be equal for knew a much about case a did nay knew more since have found famous cloak with initial embroidery wondered whether must be better to tell miss monk nothing about discovery dare utmost show that be in power certainly be a mere production of cloak must result in arrest with regard to possession of goddess be therefore in stronger position that mr striver yet did not see how must make use of weapon have in hand man must not very well force lady to marry because must hang if did not moreover might be able to exonerate completely although did not see how then must scornfully refuse to have anything more to do with let put plainly blackmailing ruffian come what might decided to play game fair not only that decided to use information a best must to protect miss monk from gardener in making inquiry might possibly chance upon clue must reveal fact that miss monk be heroine of missing motor car in case might be that must use knowledge to insist upon unequal marriage must then intervene did not see very plainly at moment to what purpose at rate must offer a lady champion then here be crux of matter for knew miss monk might be a much in love with striver a apparently be with only visit to burwain personal interview with goddess must prove truth of then thing occurred to while slowly dressed for dinner if miss monk have stolen motor car have locked in back room along with dead mr caldershaw must necessarily be possessor of glass eye on face of appeared to be guilty must not bring to condemn yet must scarcely have glass eye unless have murdered old nurse with damned hat pin be so grave proof that assassin be woman eye be clue to concealed treasure appeared to be plain enough from what striver have said of late aunt babble so if miss monk became unexpectedly wealthy must prove that be thief if not murderess seemed to be that there be nothing to be done to take up abode in burwain meet lady if possible then play waiting game whether mr striver master daughter got fifty thousand pound guilt must be manifest since must only get glass eye from to learn clue to treasure if have glass eye must have said aloud at point startled cannington servant who be valeting be nothing johnston said went on mentally with defence of miss monk although must not deduce single particle of evidence in favor ca be guilty thought ran furiously be much too lovely to be guilty there must be mistake undoubtedly will be able to explain yet yet oh hang will not decide question one way other until see being settled so far although unsettled mind again again through long night went to mess made pretence of eating cannington friend have not yet returned made believe that two featherheads have smashed car if so be great nuisance a wanted rippler to drive over to burwain on morrow however two arrived about midnight with long account of police trap have detained went off to bed leaving to supper cannington came to bedside to relate london adventure used such bad language that retreated promptly next morning departed immediately after breakfast more puzzled than ever over problem be setting out to solve have miss monk glass eye if so be guilty if have not glass eye who have did love joseph striver must find glass eye consequently fortune if did must marry miss monk etc etc etc brain be absolute chaos well good bye old chap said cannington taking leave looking very spic span in uniform tell about in london tell may not mention name said winked solemnly be as retorted leaning down to whisper thing be much more serious than guess what have learned anything about shut up when return from burwain to town may need assistance right oh said cannington looking grave for saw be in deadly earnest tell anyone where be going be supposed to be on way to london say oh ca stop to chatter hold tongue wait until see again boy understand yes be must have detained for have very cruelly perhaps raised curiosity immensely gave steering wheel twist machinery being in motion glided away before must ask further question glanced back to see shake fist at then spun rapidly through gritty square of barrack down road into street finally emerged through steep lane into country proper long smooth roman road without twist turn lay before a there be policeman in sight let rippler go up to full speed of forty mile hour motion somewhat relieved mind be considerably worried wondered if be held up for exceeding speed limit if second portmanteau be examined what police must say knew very well what must do be lodge in nearest jail a accomplice of lady in white cloak fortunately luck held got through safely ca say that drive be over pleasant a rain came on just after left murchester poured steadily throughout day then a wheel must not bite in particularly soaked slippery place car skidded considerably also gear jammed on two occasion once ran short of petrol never be there such series of accident temper be none of best when struck tarhaven here halted for luncheon went to post

raise eye to miss gertrude master cyrus break neck advised mr gilfin if love how can when ai gentleman born snapped mr gilfin love anybody dog have life in shabby old house like nun in convent toad in stone where young men eye be know ended mr gilfin virtuously indignant spirit rose a spoke be glad be fancy free said rejoicingly there be chance for then being well looking must think so master cyrus said mr gilfin chapter viii beauty of world usually invent plot arrange business consider circumstance when in bed be by far best place for such thought work alone in darkness of silent hour there be external influence to prevent concentration therefore conclusion of best can be reached speedier than in daytime on night of arrival at burwain took advantage of opportunity to think hard long be necessary that matter must be adjusted clearly in own mind before must hope to deal with situation after mr gilfin report desired more than ever to make gertrude monk wife there be obstacle in way only deliberate continuous action must remove clear understanding of position be decidedly imperative now began to see that anne caldershaw hint to brother have reference to missing monies of gabriel monk certainly even if have saved penny of income for eighty year must not have accumulated fifty thousand pound be more than probable that visit to london be connected with various investment that in one way have gained fortune mentioned by mr caldershaw a asked frequently if monk have invested money why be not discoverable since investment can not very well be concealed on reflection decided that man being genuine miser loving color weight feel of gold have probably turned investment whatever might be into hard cash have hidden carefully away in way mr caldershaw have learned whereabouts of specie missing eye indicated hiding place money by gabriel monk will belonged to gertrude monk ex housekeeper wished nephew to get so have left clue to place where be concealed perhaps knew that striver loved young mistress thought that if married after acquiring fortune that justice must be done wished a saying be to kill two bird with one stone two thing puzzled greatly in connection with matter in first place be odd that mr caldershaw aware of whereabouts of money must not have laid hand on in second be difficult to understand how must arrange that glass eye must be clue to possession then began to believe that dead woman have removed coin from where miser have hidden have drawn plan of new resting place have concealed behind eye having regard to shell like shape of eye a described by joseph plan must not be delineated on piece of paper however small a there be shield at back of artificial eye to protect from wear tear plan fancied a did mr striver be drawn on inward curve of eye although be difficult to imagine that detail have not be obliterated by moisture of flesh last conjecture be for moment beside matter what knew be that mr caldershaw glass eye indicated whereabouts of fifty thousand pound belonging by will to gertrude monk to find treasure marry girl be what determined to do to manage be necessary to prevent fortune from falling into striver hand by getting glass eye into own possession be easy task on account of obscurity involved murder theft have led to murder of course gertrude monk knew that be legally entitled to uncle money so be possible that having learned mr caldershaw secret have gone to mootley to insist upon eye being given up for purpose of obtaining right in case must scarcely have murdered woman since have to do be to compel mr caldershaw by law to confess truth might be that have quarrelled with old woman who must not be inclined to disarrange plan for well being of nephew did not think that girl with so lovely face so high character a mr gilfin avouched for must have stooped to committing crime have done so have obtained money conscience must not permit to rest therefore acquitted young lady of homicide cast about in mind to think who must possibly have slain mr caldershaw for sake of fortune miss destiny certainly grudged niece money being miser must have be glad to acquire be too frail little woman to commit murder also at time be driving to mootley have not yet reached place a story of encounter with looted motor car clearly proved have established indefeasible alibi mr walter monk be in london at time of murder mr joseph striver be at burwain must think of other person who must be driven to murder mr caldershaw for secret more thought of matter more complex did become must do decided about three o'clock in morning be to revert to original decision play waiting game then fell asleep woke at nine o'clock with headache result of over thinking however cold bath good breakfast half hour gossip with landlady banished pain somewhere about eleven walked forth to spy out land wished to call on miss destiny through to gain introduction to niece once in touch with miss monk might learn in cautious way how cloak came to be in field certainly on fact of fancied have worn have stolen rippler be just possible that have given to mr caldershaw have not be near mootley at in case began to wonder more than ever who be clever woman who have taken possession of such wondering be futile a have certain fact to go upon gertrude monk alone must give clue seeing that cloak whether worn by not be property there be little difficulty in finding abode of miss destiny who appeared to be a well known in burwain a st paul cathedral be in metropolis miserly character appeared to be common talk when reached end of village sighted cottage must well understand why be secret gentlewoman with certain amount of money however small must never have dwelt in such hovel unless grudged farthing to render sightly comfortable for miss destiny have abode in tiny house of galvanized tin standing distance from main road almost hidden by dank growth of tall weed shrub neglected tree sod fence fringed roadway therein be placed midway rickety wooden gate with broken hinge from crooked pathway made by foot worn by foot preserved a entrance by foot meandered to green painted front door on side dock darnells bramble coarse grass weed flourished in profusion breast high overhanging tin shed must scarcely be called cottage be two gigantic elm dropped decayed branch on roof round wall where lay to add to sordid confusion of place viewing desolation must only think of chateau of yellow dwarf a described by madame d'aulnoy walked up sodden path tin shed seemed to have be built in swamp so oozy be ground rapped smartly at narrow front door on side be two small window through glass of caught glimpse of iron bar proved that miss destiny have made necessary provision against burglar what struck a odd be absence of chimney have time to consider for shortly heard rattle of chain sound of bolt being drawn back then door be opened inch two to reveal dull eye mustached lip of lucinda expression of face be aggressive watchful what do want demanded in beautiful voice struck anew a singularly sympathetic despite rough greeting be mr cyrus vance who be at mootley explained elaborately wish to see miss destiny before ended request heard little low fluttering laugh lucinda opening door widely moved aside to show tiny figure of mistress with outstretched hand prince charming come in search of sleeping beauty cried miss destiny romantically because saw portrait of lady come in mr vance come in can promise flesh blood time dear adventurer there be little change about old lady still wore threadbare black silk dress though without velvet mantle snow white hair be still piled up after fashion of louis xvi ill fated queen thrilled when heard word a guessed that have arrived in happy moment that miss destiny niece goddess of dream be seated within pauper house even lucinda grinned in friendly way a saw color come go in face with self control must not suppress that sign of emotion prince charming said miss destiny introducing directly into bare sitting room for there be passage in cottage yet present to sleeping beauty looked more like fairy godmother than ever a clapped skinny hand gertrude monk be seated in well worn horsehair armchair near oil stove did duty a fireplace to warm bleak room be plainly dressed in blue serge with toque of same on dark head have muff boa of silver fox fur nothing must have be more puritanic than array close fitting frock showed off fine figure to advantage looked uncommonly handsome have already described from photograph so there be need to go over old ground be even more beautiful unapproachable than have believed to be looked more like goddess diana than ever sole thing found lacking to complete perfection be color for face be hue of old ivory even lip looked pale also there be troubled look in large dark eye welcomed with embarrassment last probably be due to oddity of introduction since miss destiny have evidently informed her of admiration for portrait be glad to meet mr vance said sedately with stately bow of head aunt informed of connection with sad death of old nurse think connection with matter be public property miss monk said nervously for name have be in paper a playwright must please said coldly anything for advertisement well tell have be discovered nothing a far a know miss monk oh raised fine eyebrow understood glanced at miss destiny that promised to come inform aunt of new development a be here thought that something have be discovered nothing have be discovered miss monk simply came here to see old servant of mother who keep robin redbreast intend to stay for few day of course be white lie have to make excuse for troubled eye be searching face intently mr gilfin said smile relaxing corner of mouth heaving what took to be sigh of relief be fond of mr gilfin be fond of miss monk have never spoken to about be reply so artful question failed in effect then conversation languished miss destiny babbled to excuse lack of hospitality lucinda have left room must give cup of tea gertrude also mr vance kettle be not boiling baker have not come so must excuse be not hungry thank miss destiny what comfortable little place have here in desperate desire to propitiate little woman told lie miss monk saw that did for lip curled so contemptuously that color came to cheek have be undiplomatic for word have used did not apply in least to bare surroundings shed have originally be shed a afterwards learned be divided by frail partition into four small room two bedroom kitchen parlor be furnished with flotsam jetsam of auction room in insufficient manner if miss destiny have contracted vice of avarice from late gabriel monk have done so very thoroughly bare wooden wall drugget on floor four five stick of shaky furniture evil smelling oil stove made up picture of insistent penury miss destiny lean faced keen eyed restless looked like hag poverty a hovered about bleak room even saw through lying remark comfortable indeed mr vance tittered nervously comfort to mind mean laziness self indulgence lucinda live simple life require only bare necessity of civilization be so poor niece intervened coldly be necessary to inform mr vance of private business aunt oh dear know for instance that be aunt only by courtesy what do mean be mother sister yes poor dear jane what bad marriage made with spendthrift aunt aunt leave father alone dear refuse to be contradicted never liked walter never will so disassociate from in way a sister in law look upon a aunt by courtesy merely by

about good fortune joseph take odd job at time said miss monk trying to speak calmly for really aunt be very trying with unnecessary frankness if offer good wage will come with pleasure oh ca afford to pay money said miss destiny hurriedly be not to be expected especially since gabriel left nothing ah gertrude be lucky one fifty thousand pound miss destiny smacked lip oh if only must be found be not likely to be found mr striver intends to find said incautiously must have bitten out tongue moment afterwards for so crude remark woman turned to face miss destiny with vulture like eagerness miss monk with expression of astonishment what have joseph to do with money asked latter pointedly perhaps doe know that be money miss monk what do mean exactly simply that striver be searching for sum of fifty thousand pound that being amount of money belonging to be missing a miss destiny said just now apprehend that be same must be must be cried little old lady clapping skinny hand for anne never must have saved so much out of wage gertrude always declared that anne knew where money of gabriel be hidden now seems told joseph about did not inform of whereabouts struck in eager to enlist miss monk attention hope to trace by mean of glass eye glass eye echoed miss monk very much amazed know that anne have glass eye that be missing see understand said miss destiny feverishly interrupt gertrude for see anne always attached great value to glass eye so in way from what mr vance say be connected with hiding place of gabriel money perhaps gabriel got anne to assist in hiding dear eye be missing if must only be found gertrude must be quite heiress believe that eye money will ever be found said miss monk impatiently walked towards door be returning to village mr vance hint be unmistakable be only too glad to take advantage of since meant tte fte with goddess mr gilfin will wonder what have become of said glancing at watch oh go go implored miss destiny grasping arm do so want to learn about glass eye money ask joseph striver then replied disengaging know know more ended significantly really truly oh must tell lucinda miss destiny vanished into back room cry for handmaid miss monk seized opportunity to open front door slip out raising eyebrow at meanwhile took hint at once walked down meandering path between weed out on to high road miss monk kept silence for distance be so taken up with admiring face be so delighted to be in presence did not mind lack of speech with compressed lip stared straight in front of then spoke abruptly seem to know great deal

live in miserable place be sarcastic here called comfortable mr vance wished to put miss destiny in good humor said uneasily why be so very direct that nearly came out with truth be absurd on face of to confess crazy love for one have known only hour must take so sudden declaration a insult therefore held peace fenced miss destiny from what said at mootley seems to know something about glass eye be stolen from mr caldershaw head when be dead wish to learn about so a to discover why eye be stolen woman murdered then did come here to question aunt in spite of denial well if must confess came to ask about glass eye miss monk walked on in silence then again spoke abruptly must be honest with mr vance be honest pardon be not since said that did not see what aunt must tell looked like offended goddess be brutally true have equivocated throw on mercy turned pair of surprised eye in direction why on mine appear to have offended hesitated what doe that matter be stranger wish be not said rash

be time at burwain a yet have learned nothing likely to throw light on darkness of mootley murder striver evidently have made up mind to stay where be a gardener at lodge although never spoke always eyed savagely when paid visit to mansion be true that gertrude did not invite into house always saw in garden must dare to come worship at private shrine be quite enough to make striver desperately

very perplexing sole way to end such perplexity be to show miss monk cloak demand explanation did not wish to do until be more certain of ground until understood feeling towards better for by time what with striver persistence own dismissal of miss destiny strange hint be beginning to believe that favored handsome humble attentive rival sha' stand longer thought turning step towards inn very evening will call see must have explanation straight away resolution adhered to so firmly found at door of jacobean mansion one hour after dinner be seeing dined early in country at seven o'clock

drawing room looked quite out of keeping with old world air of mansion be very ancient house verily believe that only ivy held mouldering brick together porch be large chilly when pulled bell jangling echo followed by baying of puddle added to lonely impression produced by place miss destiny called niece sleeping beauty so dismal dwelling might well have be palace only mr striver trim garden looked modern well cared for house be slight improvement on ruin of carthage one servant of lodge white capped sober sedate old creature called trumble came to door seemed doubtful about admitting place be like convent evidently trumble did not wish male to enter while argued with miss monk appeared intimated must come in must have thanked that beauty took breath away even in dim light of hall lamp

olympus though indeed somewhat stern face did not look very gracious at moment owing to intention of calling have arrayed in dress suit for occasion although did not usually prepare for dinner in way at robin redbreast manlike have feeling of vanity that also be ultra civilized have come in tweed must have be ashamed to face gracious vision yet be not vain man though a somewhat unworthy sentiment flashed into mind thought what conceited as be because loved woman wished to appear at best before truly human nature be strange a in present personal instance trifling well asked miss monk slight smile breaking severe curve of lip a saw how persistently stared why have called mr vance be crime asked somewhat annoyed in eye be because asked to go away ah came here to seek for explanation have none to give still a be here may a well sit down can not see for more than hour a father be returning sat down on chair indicated placed on opposite sofa stretched diagonally before fire there be three lamp with rosy shade in large low ceilinged room sat in kind of paphian twilight eminently suited to proposal what with subdued light amidst glimmered like exquisite star own tumultuous feeling wonder that did not take in arm then there to kiss into consenting to be dear wife prudence came to aid be spared necessity of refusal certainly must have be forthcoming have acted a felt inclined to do be silent be silent only sound in room be crackling of fire ticking of french clock on mantelpiece then a gertrude did not speak be forced to begin conversation else half hour must be wasted puzzle miss monk said bluntly purposely said so a to enchain attention do why aunt also puzzle went on ignoring question why asked again uneasy troubled look came into eye declares that will become mr striver within six month mr vance rose impulsively looked highly indignant because continued remorselessly repeating miss destiny exact word joseph have anne caldershaw private paper miss monk turned white gasped sank back nervously into seat aunt be mad to say such thing stammered possibly said dryly have very great idea of miss destiny sanity may be that can explain madness gertrude looked round

monk true friend test find so bent over can not understand put out hand pushed back slightly friend not yet retreated friend so cold word be sufficient for present then saw that whiteness be drowned in rising tide of crimson must have spoken for sudden leap of heart told that feeling be not so indifferent a have imagined to be again put over hand say nothing let remain friend until until when asked eagerly pressing hand between knee stared into fire then spoke in low steady voice never have friend man woman have always wanted one when came thought be foolish on part perhaps thought that might help wish to help in way went on without heeding impetuous speech doubted one always doubt man asked mr gilfin about what told confirmed impression have gained from look felt certain from many

trouble about poor be quite happy in own disagreeable way to meddle with only make discontented yes mr vance stopped suddenly again applied reflective forefinger ah yes remember now saw name a one of witness at absurd inquest be why sounded familiar why do call inquest absurd papa asked gertrude handing cup of coffee for while be speaking have be brought into room such unnecessary trouble over common woman murmured mr monk gracefully with glass eye too incomplete woman so very ugly one redeeming feature be that must cook though with late brother have small opportunity of exercising that great art let change subject child lest horrid dream must come to from contemplating crimson theme of murder be staying here mr vance asked dropping grandiloquent manner speaking alertly at robin redbreast for time shrugged shoulder depends upon fancy must not think burwain have many attraction for young man said mr monk still alert decidedly inquisitive oh be not very young sir after turmoil of london change of scene to restful place be agreeable quite so quite so nodded assent eye behind pince nez be still watchful after mootley tragedy must have thought must have sickened of country by way stirred coffee negligently be there chance that assassin will be found ca say mean to try said grimly wondered why mr monk harped on crimson theme so much disliked meant to try stared sat up quickly why may ask have vice of curiosity be answer circumstance of case be so odd that wish to solve mystery see where mystery come into matter mr vance if will pardon having contrary opinion to yourself woman who ran off with motor car remember what have to do with matter quite well now stabbed anne with hat pin where be mystery there dear papa said gertrude who be perched on arm of chair talk about matter a see agitates greatly glanced at when said a struck that if be woman who have taken car naturally must not like matter to be spoken about appeared to be perfectly calm color did not change when eye met mr monk be far more discomposed than be dear said in answer to remonstrance must steel to hear about old servant at least about gabriel old servant where ask again be mystery in fact that mr caldershaw glass eye be stolen asserted well admitted mr monk reluctantly be strange article to steal agree do know why be stolen mr vance have theory what be theory pursued eagerly late brother left fifty thousand pound to miss monk here explained that money can not be found believe that mr caldershaw in way knew of whereabouts of fortune indicated hiding place in way by mean of glass eye be stolen by person who desired to gain that fortune dear mr monk sat up briskly then rose to foot have ground for strange belief none must satisfy mr monk what do think child there may be something in idea admitted gertrude cautiously may be worth mr vance while to search matter out admit must be glad if must find money if be woman who have taken car speech be strangely daring while made eye be fixed very straightly on mine in fact be eye that fell first before hers must say that puzzled in face of what knew more than ever regretted inopportune entrance of mr monk when have be on eve of making explanation might have solved mystery of behavior yes yes said mr monk trotting up down room must be glad of money again noted that in selfishness did not appear to remember that daughter owned missing fortune well well well well well be strange theory if will pardon saying so mr vance somewhat incredible theory be usually more le incredible said dryly however if glass eye can be found may prove improbable to be possible glass eye h be glass eye of anne caldershaw mr monk halted near chair placed so to speak in witness box questioned most precisely concerning theory weighed reply made suggestion of own appealed several time to gertrude to learn what thought about matter finally concluded that there might be something in matter although confessed that saw chance of recovering missing eye be clue to missing money always presuming be mr monk final remark that be correct there be doubt that fortune be missing that daughter must be glad to obtain chance of finding key if be key to mystery of hiding place be very very remote never mind go on have explained everything know mr monk mean that sir what mean be that desire to go on with search for glass eye for criminal who slaughtered anne how do propose to proceed may ask have least idea replied despondently matter despair nil desperandum be most excellent motto for young ambitious have be motto through life came excellently from man who have done nothing indulge throughout fifty year of existence made statement in light airy manner then turned to daughter dear think that after very criminal conversation might have little music to soothe charm weary soul gertrude whom examination have made thoughtful excused on plea of fatigue so mr monk took possession of piano played gracefully if not convincingly sang little song in pleasant voice of great power must much rather have chatted with gertrude who be now staring meditatively into fire mr monk demanded entire attention be jealous of applause be obliged to watch sitting at piano like enlarged white rabbit thought privately that be infernal nuisance a father of gertrude have to be treated diplomatically come daughterling said monk when have exhausted stock of amiable ditty be looking tired go to bed child leave mr vance to cigarette in smoking room there be fire in smoking room papa said gertrude rising order servant to light one at once love be not worth while expostulated daughter then heard say something in low tone regarding price of coal mr monk must take denial a usual proceeded to gratify selfish inclination however a turned out when sought smoking room fire be not laid so mr monk after few severe word about criminal negligence of servant relinquished point regret to see that be not so excellent housekeeper a must wish to be gertrude finished with chill dignity however let pas before leaving room mr vance pray examine carefully be easy a on entering have lighted two powerful lamp rather have ordered gertrude to light with assistance so room be seen to greatest advantage in mellow radiance be oldest portion of old house explained mr monk waving delicate hand built by ancestor of mine two hundred year ago in order to live monastic life quite like monk have have ended laughing at small jest late brother gabriel always lived in cell call cell mr vance rather dull know beam be extremely fine a can see apartment be of great size with one narrow window opposite to one narrow door of be draped with faded crimson curtain to exclude light draught wide spacious fireplace be decorated with reddish dutch tile at present be filled with fern grass a doubtless have be throughout summer floor be covered with richly hued crimson carpet from cairien loom furniture what there be of consisted of black oak really resembled monastic cell in severe look atmosphere be chill deathlike a though human being ever dwelt in gertrude shivered come back to drawing room papa said impatiently ca smoke in ice house fault of doubtful housekeeping dear one moment wish mr vance to admire beam to called attention time ago see device lettering mr vance odd motto odd device ancestor chose have beam carved very fine piece of work beam to so persistently drew attention be massive length of dark oak stretched across ceiling immediately below flat panel of black wood in powerful radiance of two lamp saw that eagle be carved on beam round swarmed cloud of winged insect beneath ran motto in gothic letter in latin aquila non capit musca eagle doe not catch fly translated mr monk with shrewd glance in direction quaint saying for man to choose there be story attached to be certain perhaps gertrude know of story father interrupted quickly anticipating long conversation in vault like room do return to drawing room will catch cold hint of possible danger to precious person lured mr monk away at once remained behind extinguished lamp for gertrude trying meanwhile to let understand desired to resume interrupted conversation seemed to be absent minded when left chill smoking room did not ask to follow father therefore assumed overcoat took leave at last moment mr monk appeared with hospitable offer glass of wine slice of cake cigarette said graciously ah will have nothing very good let say good night shook hand with royal air remember while be here to come see may be away daughter will always be charmed to show house so pleased to have met so very very pleased finally tore from mr monk blandishment secured friendly smile from gertrude a stepped out into darkness on way back to inn through unlighted village street meditated on position mr monk for own selfish end evidently desired to find criminal le to avenge mr caldershaw than to secure glass eye believed to be clue to hiding place of fifty thousand pound if must manage to be successful be probable that out of gratitude must permit to marry daughter gertrude judging from interrupted conversation be not averse to be ready to take for friend at event from friend to lover be not far remove only needed time perseverance to accomplish seemed to that best plan be to cultivate mr monk society while remained at lodge between while to secure if possible private interview with girl apparently there be something on mind might might not have to do with mootley murder in case if be only frank with must gage attitude more accurately once gained confidence knew to be true friend if not lover might explain to how cloak came to be in possession of eloping lady of course although a have said before persistently declined to believe might be eloping lady in case be apparent must not move single step with clue of cloak until learned about from woman now so devotedly loved having more le roughed out plan be to see a much of gertrude father a possible retired to bed dreamed be married man with famous name large fortune pleasant vision be rendered uncomfortable by constant presence of gigantic eye glared malignantly on on scheme be glad when morning broke for next two three day be pretty constantly at lodge became intimate with mr monk although did not see so much of gertrude a desired father in selfishness must not leave alone moreover learning have motor car requisitioned same to pay visit to surrounding friend went to gattlingsands to tarhaven even proposed visit to mootley in order to inspect scene of crime be quite willing to go can stop at murchester see friend lord cannington who be in gunner suggested mr monk started turned to ask question know lord cannington very well have known for year friend of mine know said mr monk quietly although fancied that be secretly perturbed name struck a familiar charming young man believe wish gertrude knew must money be recovered wish to marry title if possible suggestion did not suit at cannington be just kind of inflammable youth to fall at gertrude foot quite independent of fortune much a liked boy did not see why must search out fifty thousand pound for allow to marry woman loved therefore determined selfishly perhaps to keep mr monk lord cannington apart threw cold water on journey to murchester a mr monk did not seem very keen about visit did not go did take to see miss destiny asked graciously to lodge rather to annoyance of gertrude who have not much love for miserly aunt in fact while monk remained in burwain did for quite week miss destiny hovered round house like bee round flower once twice met driving in so called trap agreed with mr faith that be cart in company of lucinda behaved pleasantly to although must not deny impish delight of hinting at devotion to gertrude not that will ever marry mr vance walter have other plan be to be used to forward fortune a want money said nothing privately determined that girl must not be sacrificed like modern iphigenia on altar of selfish paternal desire kept counsel let monk talk a pleased be unobtrusively agreeable to gertrude miss destiny saw very little of on sixth day of mr monk stay in burwain went one afternoon to lodge found little old lady in conversation with handsome gardener be trying to evade pertinacity of miss destiny who insisted that must look after domain for nothing be sure that brother so spoke of mr monk pay well joseph so can easily give couple of hour day to little place have duty here said striver scowling a approached if mr monk give order can arrange for certain sum oh ca pay single penny cried miss destiny shrilly be not to be expected if come will find friend in what way asked gardener sharply not too politely miss destiny did not answer in word looked at striver then looked at finally glanced towards house where gertrude be standing in doorway rival flushed crimson did also a knew exactly what meant on seeing tell tale color burst into roguish laugh walked towards porch moment later disappeared with niece into house striver looked at one have right to come here said gardener who looked handsomer than ever in rough working clothes what do mean man oh be very well calling man in lordly way said violently know quite well that be in love with there be need to mention name interrupted throwing up hand forbid to speak to in way forbid cried rival laughing bitterly a if feared mr cyrus vance have more need to fear yes after believe know more about aunt death than chose to say did not deign to reply to absurd remark moved towards house in hope of meeting mr monk usually be in drawing room a french window be open three advanced towards middle one while striver leaning on spade looked after enviously grudged must be able to enter house while be chained to garden to work however have time to consider feeling be about to step into room when saw on small table near glittering object be glass eye chapter xi miss destiny speaks there glared at glass eye for sought a striver have said be mere shell on outward curve of be depicted pupil iris of gray eye white portion of fabric being delicately streaked with thin red vein uttering ejaculation tipped over with finger just have time to see that there be piece of silver size of threepenny bit perhaps indeed threepenny bit fastened inside concave when heard mr monk voice calling on terrace flashed across in instant that must not see eye apparently gertrude have carelessly left lying on table must have picked up to slip into pocket sight be so very unexpected that have not presence of mind stepped back again on to terrace leaving sinister object on table at same moment mr monk coming round corner of terrace slipped arm within own heard voice said gently guided towards corner come see green house there be orchid there must like to examine be fond of weird plant such well bred taste too added mr monk languidly love of man for orchid be like love of woman for lace replied mechanically for head be in whirl submitted to be led to far distant corner of garden where greenhouse nestled under red brick wall here while mr monk discoursed learnedly on flower about knew le than nothing wondered in own mind what might be meaning of discovery glass eye must have be left in drawing room by one gertrude since already possessed cloak to show what have hitherto shrunk from acknowledging even to myself that be lady who have stolen motor car then again be one person who have right to fifty thousand pound when found groaned really seemed that pearl amongst woman be guilty of theft murder yet even at eleventh hour must not make up mind to believe that be guilty mr monk mistook groan for weariness became offended fear take much interest in flower mr vance said glaring at through pince nez oh yes interest pray proceed said hastily no air of place be so dense that give headache day be uncommonly warm for season of year let return to house have new song must like to show to morrow return to london will not see for time oh can call on when go back to town said idly for brain be still preoccupied with glass eye problem pardon said mr monk decidedly hastily be going away for few week to continent on business of course business echoed thought be free mr monk sighed shrugged shoulder a slowly walked across lawn towards willow step of terrace have five hundred year declared what be that mere pittance have to allow gertrude something have house to keep up also flat in london have to be rented ca do on ten pound week be on tip of tongue to ask why did not remain at burwain play part of country gentleman to reduce expenditure when proceeded yes be in business of sort connected with commission on loan be will understand mr vance

benefit come mr vance be rising dramatist who must be better known in west end suppose allow at ten per cent to arrange loan for to produce one of better class play have security objected can arrange said mr monk with airy wave of hand if can find eye started violently did not appear to notice get fifty thousand pound will let have money at same percentage will not charge commission ended generously quite forgetting that be proposing to gamble with daughter money that obtuseness be mr monk over if must see in town later on later on said hastily mounting step say in three four month when return from continent then can have talk address be interrupted again will see here will see here will be much more convenient for passed through french window into drawing room mr monk puzzled a did not understand why must refuse to see on so to speak business premise seeing desired to speak with on business matter however froth small talk be driven out of head by discovery that glass eye have disappeared from small table suppose gertrude have put into pocket a be in room arranging flower in vase glanced at keenly appeared to be perfectly cool where be aunt asked monk looking around have gone home again only came to see if must get joseph to attend to place said gertrude busy with flower good morning mr vance good morning answered looking hard at so hard that blushed becomingly certainly not guiltily what be matter asked putting hand to head be hair out of order o o o said hesitatingly for coolness amazed be only delighted to see looking so well blushed again thank be laughing reply for compliment will have flower actually handed late rosebud placed in button hole feeling quite bewildered be impossible that must be guilty yet eye have certainly be on table perhaps have found place in pocket meanwhile mr monk be fuming with injured egotism at being left out of conversation attend to gertrude if please said sharply wish must tell aunt that disapprove of trying to get joseph to attend to garden will not pay man ca work for nothing oh think can said miss monk putting vase of now arranged flower on mantelpiece mr caldershaw left quite fortune for man in station of life why speak to aunt upset nerve always quarrel exactly what happens when speak to rejoined gertrude with shrug so be never pleased when come here be fault papa when be away never call really think must be in love with dear have better take care papa since deceased wife sister bill be law now aunty may wish to marry monk laughed smiled not ill pleased by tribute to look will chose younger wife than aunt dear stepmother may give will be young charming daughter looked at in dismay papa be thinking of marrying again demanded quickly love be too poor to marry if met rich woman well stopped pulled up collar glanced in near mirror adjusted tie apparently thinking be worthy to be wooed by heiress gertrude laughed more at ease in mind must be foolish to marry at age papa have comfortable house good income so why not enjoy a be doing now appeared that have said wrong thing since father be excessively touchy at age gertrude remarked in offended tone forget that be still comparatively young that when marry will be very solitary a to income be mere pittance to man of artistic taste daughter might have reminded that spent most of income on kept on next to nothing passed over whole speech save one remark will never marry papa said quietly why not why not fumed mr monk startled one will have said demurely oh father laughed be all right have be unmindful of child when in town there be one two men to whom must introduce with view to matrimony will arrange please papa prefer to arrange question of marriage foolish foolish child said touchy temper again getting better of will do a tell else will place in disagreeable position of lear walked out of room just like child annoyed because bad naughty table have hurt dear how easily papa be offended sighed gertrude shrugging when banged door must be unpleasant for mr vance what must be family jar oh dear think that answered easily see have to humor father be dear father mr vance sometimes be difficult to deal with offend without meaning to be so sensitive thought man selfish be none of business to say so therefore dropped subject asked miss monk to grant favor wish to come to tea to morrow at inn mr gilfin will play part of chaperon if father ca come think papa can a be going back to london in morning accept with pleasure will ask aunt oh please must rather mr gilfin be present not that need anyone to play

subject to renew conversation of night when father entered so unexpectedly a said then want friend said know what said if say again will begin to think must have chaperon for proposed tea after now must go have heap heap of housework to do also must pack papa portmanteau internally blessed mr monk confounded portmanteau then took departure a have entered by middle window a passed out must not help glancing again at table whereon have seen glass eye miss monk saw inquiring gaze came forward have lost anything be more confounded than ever nothing said hurriedly good day departed at top speed entirely at sea a regard true state of affair yet apart from evidence of cloak presence of glass eye at lodge seemed conclusively to prove guilt of gertrude on way back to inn wondered if by chance miss destiny have seen eye on reaching house be not impossible that after capture by mr monk might have entered drawing room in case being a have frequently found of inquisitive turn of mind be certain that have caught sight of object be even possible that have taken eye in order to find secret hiding place of fortune miss destiny be miser miss destiny have great love for niece so theft of eye must appeal to avarice love of making disagreeable of course must know very well that niece must say nothing without getting into trouble sooner have idea entered mind than wheeled about took road to miss destiny hovel with intention of asking question be not easy to formulate if possessed eye certainly must not acknowledge theft if did not might reveal suspicion of gertrude thus must place weapon in little old lady hand must undoubtedly make use of in hurried walk to destination there be time to arrange what to say so determined to trust more le to chance in doubtful state of mind arrived at tin house miss destiny opened door explained that lucinda be shopping in village appeared to be usual mincing self betrayed uneasiness be invited into sordid shabby sitting room entered into long complaint about brother in law treatment walter be so very mean lamented miss destiny sitting down believe grudge joseph coming to work for mr monk have engaged joseph to attend to own garden reminded lodge garden be in good order snapped whereas mine need lot of attention walter might send man along if pay joseph miss destiny pay interrupted with shriek throwing up hand dear mr vance be a much a can do to keep bread in mouth be reduced to glanced round be by mean abode of gentlewoman gertrude father must let starve sooner than behave a relative must oh protested miss monk be extremely kind have found so demanded vindictive aunt have found charming be cautious reply charm pay tax mr vance suppose added abruptly that intend to marry oh look so astonished young man remember how admired photograph in anne house did come here for nothing oh dear came here to learn must about glass eye so might trace assassin of anne caldershaw oh indeed miss destiny sharp eye twinkled wickedly haunt niece in order to ask question why not ventured cautiously miss destiny laughed significantly why not indeed echoed be opinion that gertrude know much more about glass eye than dare to tell anyone else blood ran cold for moment apparently disagreeable old woman have seen eye on drawing room table thence have drawn very worst conclusion ventured on bold stroke do mean to say that miss monk have glass eye say that then have not glass eye said impatiently drawing breath of great relief say that then what do say miss destiny nothing except will be wise to go away from burwain give up idea of marrying niece why asked very directly because a said gertrude know something about murder be serious thing to say miss destiny on what ground do make such accusation made direct reply rocked to fro know know said with cunning look malicious chuckle ventured still further on dangerous ground upon be treading have seen glass eye in miss monk possession said reply startled for have made sure that dared to speak thus freely from having espied object on drawing room table never said that have glass eye then on what ground oh wish to say anything interrupted having said so much must say more be firm reply have right to make dangerous accusation without proof gertrude can supply proof must not insult by asking to screeched miss destiny jumping to foot like small fury because be fool man who love be fool love gertrude heaven only know what see in see lovely girl accomplished lady good daughter honorable gentlewoman four people rolled into one sneered spiteful little creature quivering with wrath may be lovely in eye know what fool men be good honorable be not prove what say cried only trotted about room tremulous with anger jealousy determined to enrage still further a if completely lost temper might unexpectedly come out with knew be therefore pointedly rude fact be miss destiny be jealous of niece beauty quavered eye flamed jealous yes be also annoyed because niece have gabriel monk money have if have committed murder to get be lie forget sir that speak to lady retorted still carrying out plan be speaking to jealous old woman who be trying to harm innocent girl last speech brought about desired result innocent cried stamped foot if be innocent what be doing at anne caldershaw on night of murder be not there yes be yes be yes be chattered miss destiny thrusting angry face close up to mine said nothing about at inquest a did not wish to get into trouble now that dare to say be jealous of minx brought out word with gasp will speak out dare gertrude to contradict arranged to meet at anne house at five o'clock started on previous day in trap with lucinda stopped night with friend at saxham next day went on owing to state of road slowness of horse did not reach anne house until after crime be committed gertrude intended to go to murchester thence walk to anne house on day when murder took place be sure that be at mootley at five o'clock to keep appointment be after time that anne be stabbed with hat pin hat pin with blue glass head cried miss destiny triumphantly gave gertrude three pin like a christmas present last year now see be guilty certainly looked like declined to admit even shadow of suspicion see said tartly controlling with effort miss monk may have called at five o'clock not finding there may have returned to burwain by evening train oh did mocked miss destiny cruelly then what about blue glass headed hat pin what about presence at mootley about time anne be killed what about lady who stole motor car ca prove lady be miss monk yes can that man giles said lady wore white cloak saw with white cloak gertrude have such white cloak really said bantering although proof of guilt made tremble perhaps recognized miss monk when motor car nearly collided with cart beg pardon trap did recognize said miss destiny sitting down sullenly be darkish gertrude be last person expected to see in motor car saw that lady have white cloak knew niece possessed one never struck that gertrude be driver until came to mootley heard anne have be murdered information about glass headed pin made certain have to be proved said after nervous pause for there be denying that miss monk position be perilous have accused have asked why did meet at mootley said that have decided not to go lie lie cried miss destiny leaping to foot again be there murdered anne stole eye perhaps ca say that for certain only speak of what know a anne be murdered for sake of eye everyone seems to think have doubt that gertrude have have seen in possession asked that before have not seen in possession only speak of what know said again looked dogged there be few minute silence putting together miss destiny statement what knew about eye cloak must seem that proof of guilt against gertrude be overwhelming prejudiced a be in favor blinded more le by love must not help acknowledging that evidence be dead against if miss destiny spoke out gertrude be arrested must be hard put to prove innocence only one thing remained to be done to silence miss destiny until gertrude must explain of course will say nothing said sternly miss destiny looked at sulkily of course asserted love gertrude same wish to see hanged not that word rose put out hand wincing hanged hanged hanged screamed furious old woman be so blinded by love fool that ca see her wickedness murderess be not thief be not turned on heel flung open door miss destiny leaped to side what be going to do intend to see miss monk ask to disprove accusation ca dare will see snapped left house while miss destiny jeered made mouth after like wicked foul old witch chapter xii gertrude defence a may be guessed passed very perturbed four twenty hour until arranged interview with miss monk miss destiny have not seen glass eye in drawing room so far must prove nothing against niece believe that so far be speaking truth a if have seen eye must have only be too pleased to adduce presence a proof of gertrude guilt a thing be what knew be damning enough must swear to girl presence at mootley on evening of murder to ownership of white cloak worn by lady who have stolen motor car fortunately from sheer shame since miss monk be niece miss destiny promised to hold tongue in face of what old woman have said that already knew seemed certain that gertrude be guilty miss destiny must even declare that niece have possessed certain blue glass headed hat pin with one of crime have be committed then again gertrude wished to get money after be rightfully own seemed probable on face of while waiting with anne caldershaw for miss destiny arrival have tried to learn what ex housekeeper knew a to whereabouts of money anne may have boasted that secret be locked up in glass eye then well shuddered to think of what took place nine people out of ten must have pronounced gertrude guilty with greatest promptitude happened to be tenth hesitated to give opinion then be in love decision be biassed really must not believe that so lovely girl be guilty besides demeanor be not that of brazen criminal have seemed really puzzled by over attentive gaze tossing turning on bed tried to see ray of light be utter darkness evidence be dead against gertrude monk fate be in hand of vindictive aunt miss destiny might hold tongue for time being must take very little to set wagging being miser might try to blackmail niece brain ached with trying to get at truth to inspector dredge must have have be readily apparent in face of stern fact refused to believe girl to be guilty then there be giles during night thought good deal of giles whom have met that very evening when returned to robin redbreast be remaining there for night informed that have come over to burwain day in order to see striver about lease of corner shop see mr vance said giles shortly before retired to bed while be in bar wife want to have shop of own so thought must get mr striver to make over lease of mr caldershaw shop to wife be set on having think mr striver will agree to term propose have seen then yes sir went to house to day found be at lodge working in garden sought out there have talk just before miss destiny came to bother went away then afterwards came mind swiftly ran over event of day then be in ground of lodge before arrived yes mr vance said giles readily enough mr striver be in garden at time a have gone round to back of house walked up to front door asked for servant sent message be talking over deal when little old lady arrived spoilt business for time being saw mr striver evening have arranged about matter wife will have shop thought good deal about conversation when in bed giles have be alone in ground of lodge have gone up to house to seek for striver might not have placed eye on table since must easily do so when middle french window be open then have absolutely reason to suspect giles a glass eye must be meaningless to stop must indeed be meaningless certainly mr giles have denied that knew about mr caldershaw glass eye then have admitted that ex housekeeper have said must never die in bed in one way mr giles may have learned secret of hidden money thus giles might have killed mr caldershaw to obtain glass eye be clue after reflection dismissed theory a utterly ridiculous giles must not have gained possession of hat pin belonging according to miss destiny to gertrude monk certainly having eye must not come over to burwain to leave in drawing room of lodge giles on face of be utterly innocent yet be strange that must have be in ground of jacobean house nearly at time have seen glass eye that have disappeared if giles have not placed there might have taken muttered in drowsy tone be absurd giles have nothing to do with matter merely came over to arrange about shop did not place glass eye there did striver if striver have possessed eye must have gained possession of money besides be not at mootley until funeral took place mr monk be innocent enough a be in london when crime be committed moreover if possessed eye also must be in possession of fortune gertrude be only person to whom suspicion point will insist upon full explanation to morrow alone can save if be guilty then fell into troubled sleep reproaching for daring to doubt divinity giles departed next morning before arose did not see again haunted still by undefined suspicion regretted departure determined later to look up at mootley of course mere idea of thinking that respectable sturdy greengrocer be guilty seemed ridiculous in anxiety to save gertrude from danger be willing to sacrifice anyone everyone to state doe love bring most just of mankind by midday post received impetuous letter from cannington who informed that have snaffled word be own couple of week leave for present be staying with aunt lady denham because mabel wished proposed when came up to take room at hotel where must a put be le tied by leg then went on to say that have remained long enough at burwain that if did not come to must come to like mahomet proverbial mountain bearing in mind mr monk aspiration for titled son in law be last thing desired so arranged promptly in own mind to accept invitation besides after interview with gertrude in hoped to come to understanding there must be need for to remain at burwain story might send farther afield in search of new clue reading between line of cannington letter saw that be devoured with curiosity concerning miss monk knew that have fallen in love with portrait a have always regarded a particularly staid sedate personage naturally doubted if must carry on so fantastic romance however evidently have suspicion since chose to linger in dull country village therefore be desperately anxious to see lady who must thus move elderly heart a cannington be most pertinacious mortal wrote by next post must be in london next week then must have much to tell about case a matter of fact did wish to have safe person with whom to discus matter must always rely on cannington to hold tongue even if advice did not prove to be particularly good at event boy must always be relied upon to keep silent be more than must say for many people know so to cannington resolved to confide full tale of discovery in interest of wooing ended letter with repetition of fact be coming to see

have use for here cuckoo answered so have for in be snugly folded celebrated cloak proposed to show to gertrude when time came for explanation at four o'clock be spic span a room be a comfortable a afternoon tea be tempting miss monk duly arrived time without puddle a escort looked more beautiful than ever in plain dress poor girl nearly always wore same frock showed how very short in cash mr monk kept must have be arrayed in silk attire inwardly swore when establishing in deep seated armchair by fire that day must be at expense meantime handed cup of tea piled with thin bread butter much to mr gilfin satisfaction that good lady have looked in to see that be comfortable eat can miss urged mr gilfin look a fat a ought to be gertrude shuddered want to grow fat said laughing there be worse thing than fat said mr gilfin sensibly lean people with wrinkle be never so nice a without if miss destiny have more flesh on bone be more popular after delivering herself of dictum landlady departed with fat chuckle gertrude face clouded when aunt be mentioned noticed commented thereon be not fond of miss destiny remarked have little reason to be replied with nervous air aunt julia be that name yes julia destiny strange name be well then have always behaved harshly to even when be child never liked since uncle gabriel left fortune have scarcely be able to bear sight of then morning what about morning asked seeing hesitation aunt julia came to said manner of dreadful thing even if have not arranged afternoon tea mr vance must have come to see need friend more than ever privately thought be right in thinking so that miss destiny have be making disagreeable over visit to mootley perhaps have added threat however said nothing for moment a wished gertrude to tell story in own way take cake cup of tea murmured sympathetically then can talk gertrude handed cup ca eat drink anything more thank mr vance want to speak seriously to one can hear hope glanced at door window be closed one can hear assented taking chair opposite to can depend upon being secret about choose to tell know that yes looked straightly at royal beauty impressed anew have studied character closely so might be certain of making mistake be satisfied perfectly glanced round again then leaned back in chair listen mr vance interrupt more than can help a be difficult for to tell story clearly be attention said leaning forward know that told of fifty thousand pound uncle gabriel left yes fortune be missing gertrude nodded uncle gabriel be miser concealed rich father have inherited income property fifty thousand pound have be hidden away when will be read learned that sum have be left to whereabouts must not be discovered searched through late uncle paper without result then about end of july came across old box in attic filled with foolscap sheet covered with figure also there be writing in form of diary two three loose sheet pinned together have diary other paper yes can see when come to lodge meanwhile be easier for to tell content a writing be extremely crabbed learned that uncle gabriel have for year used family income of five hundred per annum in purchasing diamond really must buy many valuable stone at price forget that have income for forty year thereabouts lived like pauper be always saving money buying diamond at time a diary said went to london amsterdam paris traded in stone turned over what have bought a matter of fact in one way managed to accumulate fifty thousand pound worth of jewel then fortune be hidden consists of diamond exactly in diary uncle gabriel hinted that jewel be for that mistrusted father must put safely away why did mistrust father asked although have very shrewd suspicion of what answer must be girl flushed uncle gabriel be never just to father said in low voice oh know papa have fault heart be in right place papa have idea of money be like child so uncle gabriel thought that if papa secured diamond might squander value what said significantly when belonged to colored again think papa belief what be mine be see uncle gabriel died when be about sixteen five year ago thought that if papa must lay hand on jewel then that must not come to mistrusted papa with very good reason murmured too low for gertrude to hear walter monk a truly believed must act exactly in way brother suspected must what be that say never mind understand that diamond be concealed so that father might not be tempted surely uncle intended to come into hand sooner later yes diary said that jewel be hidden in certain place what place asked abruptly ah be kept secret uncle gabriel talked about trusting anne ah said rubbing hand with satisfaction now be coming to gist of matter mention of eye see in diary can hardly be called one uncle gabriel only jotted down scrap of scheme in head to make long story short gathered that have entrusted secret of whereabouts of diamond to anne caldershaw a have known for year esteemed honest woman see be not honest think so no evidently intended to tell striver secret since left glass eye in will be to get money then daresay must ask to marry ridiculous said miss monk coloring perhaps nevertheless believe that such be scheme of mr caldershaw for intended to enrich nephew at expense hoping that must marry thus gain benefit of what be rightfully own idea of marriage salved conscience a be idea be absurd must never marry man like joseph although be handsome fairly well educated know that love yes know replied blushing in somewhat cold tone never mind thing a say be absurd might be a say mr vance that anne have scheme in head however understand that gathered from so called diary that knew of whereabouts of jewel yes know that what did do determined to go over see anne caldershaw did yes looked at nervously be at mootley then when when burst out fiercely not though aunt julia swears be oh did not go to mootley at yes did arranged to meet aunt julia at anne house at five o'clock got there before time then be at mootley on evening of murder have never denied said cresting head like snake looking haughty do deny be in house when crime be committed be not woman who ran away with motor car aunt julia may say who be woman then know never set eye on ah said thoughtfully talking of eye be mr caldershaw glass optic in head when spoke to yes be remember please never knew a appears from ingenious theory that secret be hidden in eye came at half past four went into back room where talked with anne related to what have discovered asked to tell where diamond be said did not know did not know echoed in utter astonishment so said declared that uncle gabriel have given cipher in have concealed whereabouts of diamond anne must not read so have idea of where jewel be did ask for cipher yes did refused to give to on what ground gertrude grew red looked nervously into fire may a well be quite frank said with outburst of candor anne really did wish to marry nephew said must give cipher if promised to marry joseph refused then well what then asked impatiently indignant at plot between dead woman gardener to force miss monk into unwilling matrimony then heard voice in shop calling for mr caldershaw went away shortly afterwards returned to ask to leave at once there be someone who wished to speak to did not wish to meet person therefore asked to leave at once did know who person be gertrude hesitated must answer that frankly said after pause a caught glimpse of person through half open shop door mere sight of person sent away a did not wish to meet here hesitated asked inquisitively must rather not say just now replied with reserve must say insisted see that person whether man woman may have be one who murdered mr caldershaw grew pale have thought of said hurriedly therefore refuse to tell who person be if certain contingency happens will speak out wo tell now said somewhat wounded ask to perhaps later on seemed greatly distressed see be terrible thing for to give name of person who might be accused of crime if person be hanged even if guilty must not be able to rest in bed shuddered burst into tear position be very hard wailed can assist if will speak plainly shook head can not speak plainer than be doing later on yes later on may tell just now dare not dare not again began to weep a be evident that have strong reason to conceal name of mysterious person did not press further although be most anxious to learn about matter instead asked question in soothing tone how did leave by back door said gertrude drying eye in way escaped coming face to face with person in question there be gate out of back yard by must escape examined fence did not examine carefully enough gate be at side of house be exactly like fence when be closed one must tell that there be gate expect be why overlooked outside gate path led amongst elm tree little distance until came out on to high road distance down slope went along path on gaining road walked to murchester where caught half past six train so see that have nothing to do with murder be horrified when heard of seeing danger be in of being suspected held peace even denied to aunt julia have be to mootley at saying that have changed mind recalled conversation with miss destiny recognized that gertrude be speaking exact truth mr caldershaw be alive well when left asked rising to drag out portmanteau quite well what be doing will show in one moment mr caldershaw did not appear to be afraid of being killed be quite usual self did take cloak with cloak rose much agitated how do know that wore cloak must have have one to take journey said evasively yes replied gertrude somewhat reassured oh gasped a displayed garment have produced from portmanteau yes said unfolding be cloak worn by lady who took motor car found concealed in field be cloak yes admitted with white lip be cloak chapter xiii love stared at one for quite sixty second standing white faced tongue tied near chair kneeling by open portmanteau to display cloak when must have spoken flung up protesting hand to silence how do know be cloak embroidery in blue silk repeat initial of name found in field where motor

flung abroad arm do believe to be innocent love love repeated mechanically rose still holding cloak in arm spoke vehemently of course must have seen for day love came here because fell in love with photograph because found shook cloak yes can not understand that desired to save to save from what from arrest have anyone found cloak must have be in prison long long ago told one about discovery hid cloak in portmanteau came here to seek explanation knew that must be able to exculpate then needed explanation asked in low tone only that might learn how to save needed explanation to assure that be innocent for moment have doubt when miss destiny spoke to yesterday gertrude interrupted with cry scarlet blood flushed cheek swiftly aunt julia have be speaking to have be speaking to aunt julia listen saw long ago that aunt be not friend feared lest must make mischief therefore called to see yesterday so might learn how much know told know what told interrupted gertrude again flung back head came to morning a explained said manner of dreadful thing such a will tell so that may see place entirely in hand mr vance aunt julia declared be at mootley on evening of murder that hat pin with anne be stabbed belonged to that saw white cloak on lady who drove motor car whom believed to be escaping threatened to tell police thing unless gave half of fifty thousand pound a if must a if must wailed gertrude dropping into seat know where be why not learn from glass eye looked up astonished have not got glass eye stared in turn listen miss monk in face of what have told of what aunt have said believe that be innocent thank god for muttered must not have endured accusation from on hearing be with greatest difficulty prevented from taking in arm to kiss away tear there be much to be cleared up before must do a wished to understand entire belief in innocence went on with emphasis while know that account of interview with mr caldershaw be correct ask to trust a be firm friend fully have trusted fully said plaintively what about glass eye be sure that mr caldershaw did not allow to carry away when left by back door to escape meeting mysterious person speak of be quite sure said gertrude rising with great dignity mr caldershaw glass eye be in head when ran from house be in such hurry to escape meeting person mentioned that left cloak behind also one of blue glass headed pin fastened hat can guess what happened assassin killed anne with hat pin stole glass eye then assumed cloak to escape perhaps added with afterthought to throw blame of crime on assassin be person whom did not wish to meet hand trembled think not hope not ca answer question mr vance why continued hurriedly why do mention glass eye in connection with not having a declare trusted fully because saw very eye on small table near middle window of drawing room at lodge rose quickly looked aghast saw glass eye there said slowly when yesterday rapidly explained circumstance thought that have eye in pocket when came afterwards into room with father said because fancied miss destiny might have seen went along in interest to interview from what said be convinced that have concealed before must set eye on stop cried gertrude did not conceal never saw glass eye save in anne head if have that eye must think guilty eye searched face said firmly only thought that perhaps not quite trusting did not say that anne caldershaw have given to did not have told everything know reason why went to mootley took place left anne in good health walked to murchester to catch train believe oh advanced towards anxiously ca see that believe entirely nothing will ever persuade that be guilty ask be for absolute confidence so can find true assassin free from danger of being denounced by vindictive aunt have given absolute confidence said with dignity yet not unmoved by declaration not entirely know sex name of person from whom fled at corner shop gertrude turned swiftly towards window can answer question on point said in low tone do think person have possession of eye persisted ask more have told can tell will only ask one question if be to learn truth about case save from arrest must have answered do believe that person in question be guilty turned with pearly white face no person be not guilty do wish to swear question be sarcastic winced believe bare word said somewhat coldly have not proved belief forgive in turn moved towards laid beseeching hand on arm be best friend indeed only friend have one to trust love asked trying to catch hand drew away not yet yes now must understand one be not content with friendship gertrude want love be so sudden stammered sudden when have be eating heart out ever since set eye on portrait oh dear ca believe that made objection there be so much to talk about can talk easier when understand one surely can see how devoted be to know that oh yes know that indeed do then held out hand mr vance call by name indeed ca oh oh gertrude time became masterful possessed myself of unwilling hand be there anyone else certainly there be not love idea never heard such nonsense be about to hear good deal of nonsense when sensible man such a be be in love talk heart out did not draw away hand laughed softly in spite of fear insistent trouble what say can never be nonsense then love demanded persistently yes be use denying do love gertrude caught fully in arm before must turn head aside have pressed lip to own bore embrace for one moment then pushed away retreating to armchair sat down to cry softly followed gertrude darling oh what be use of talking how can behave in way when thing be wrong do love be useless to say that heart ache with pain darling knelt beside be here to help know accept help gladly thank god for having sent good man to help dear think of a good have end of fault must not be human otherwise for fault love more mr gertrude well then cyrus dearest own will marry day when suddenly rose assumed resolute air cyrus must not fiddle while rome be burning tell how glass eye came to be at lodge fell into humor a saw that regarded position of thing a far too serious to permit simple love dalliance dear ca tell unless never saw eye interrupted impatiently believe yes never saw eye be miss destiny in drawing room went up to bedroom when came into house saw out of gate just before returned to house to meet father why do ask question do think aunt oh miss destiny did not arrive at mootley until crime be committed must not have got possession of glass eye only wished to be sure that have not seen a did not enter drawing room a have cross questioned be evident that know nothing on point then there be giles who be giles be man who life at mootley who caught in back room with mr caldershaw dead body came over to see striver about lease of corner shop be in garden of lodge wondered if might have placed glass eye on table why must doe know anything of secret think so indeed be honest man who must not harm anyone dear think giles have eye then striver oh cyrus did not go to mootley until funeral do suspect not of murder be just possible that eye be not taken by assassin that striver found when be in shop hunting amongst paper of late aunt be new idea since have always believed that murder be committed for sake of eye know what to believe said wearily passing hand across forehead still someone must have placed eye on table why not striver who be working in garden see supposing theory of murder be true how must have got possession of eye might be one think so gertrude for in concave of eye saw piece of white metal silver fancy on truly believe hiding place of diamond be indicated if joseph have eye persisted although see how must have got must use to find diamond thus must not have placed on table forget said quickly that hiding place of eye be indicated in cipher according to mr caldershaw joseph might have found eye in corner house accuse of murder being unable to read cipher might have placed eye on table to implicate why must when say that love for very reason be jealous of know that will never marry if by implicating must secure arrest then must save by confessing that found eye placed on table might think must marry out of gratitude oh idea be absurd said gertrude petulantly be such roundabout way of going to work let ask joseph said cautiously after what say be merely theoretical if joseph did not place eye on table be use letting know that be there must supply with weapon then think ca say what think a said before muttered rising to pace room if be born detective might unravel mystery a be ca see way to truth if truth be never known remarked gertrude after pause what doe matter much will always be in danger of being denounced by aunt not if give fifty thousand pound quite so dear there again truth must be discovered a ca gain possession of money otherwise can trust servant eliza oh yes have be with for year must not have placed eye on drawing room table what time did see about three o'clock be about to enter room through middle window be open saw suddenly then father called when returned in hour be in room eye be gone have just entered drawing room few moment before came with papa said gertrude thoughtfully entered through window a have be seeing aunt out of gate eye certainly be not on table then must have seen otherwise a did well then be gone just before half past three remarked saw at hour when be in drawing room before time did see anything replied gertrude impatiently told never saw eye at cyrus did not enter drawing room after luncheon until half past three o'clock in morning certainly saw nothing be father in drawing room after luncheon not to knowledge be pottering round greenhouse surely suspect papa color rose certainly not only wondered if have seen must not have seen else must have picked up to show well said with long drawn sigh for mystery of thing perplexed know who placed there who took away perhaps striver removed added with afterthought why must why must echoed be very thing wanted since when saw at mootley be hunting for eye to secure money said know what said be cross interruption so far a can see there be chance of learning truth a dare not risk speaking to striver lest place weapon in hand know what to do well dear said gertrude rising to take departure if ask opinion think be best to leave matter alone will be in danger from aunt tongue think so have promised to give money when be found wo risk losing that since be such miser anne be dead buried so let sleeping dog lie marry asked tenderly yes marry came forward threw arm round neck whispered cyrus let think of ourselves happiness leave mystery alone well shrugged shoulder slipped arm round waist only wished to learn truth in order to shield although deny that mystery of case appeal to if be content to leave alone marry so be let relegate murder of mr caldershaw to already long list of undiscovered crime cloak asked gertrude eye falling on will wrap up in parcel can take back to hang in wardrobe eliza know that have white cloak will never connect with mootley murder even though read account of case have not said gertrude shaking head never read of newspaper only know that anne be murdered may hear talk of course fancy will trouble head doe know that went to mootley on day told be going to london for see did not wish father to know have be to see anne why not can ask knowing what said about uncle mistrust of father if papa knew what have found out about diamond have gone to see anne about matter must at time have be successful have insisted on giving jewel for reason kept visit secret from everyone save aunt be forced to let know a have arranged to see anne on day be bound to meet did tell miss destiny about diary yes be necessary for to ask if thought that anne must be honest enough to give cipher told that believed there must be difficulty in getting a anne having nursed be devoted to interest see ended gertrude with sigh anne must only help on condition agreed to marry joseph then intend to let father have diamond when be found asked wrapping up cloak in brown paper dear papa be best of men doe not know value of money if gained possession of fifty thousand pound must only squander five hundred year have settled on after death ca spend capital will give papa plenty of money within reason when asks for when jewel be mine oh will ask for right enough muttered cynically however gertrude must first catch hare must search for diamond may be that be hidden in house have be turned upside down without result wish have found time to glance at cipher certainly must have be written on piece of silver attached to eye muttered regretfully however be too late now nothing can be done nothing echoed gertrude taking parcel from advancing towards door leave matter alone cyrus let be happy flew after gertrude be going without dear forgot paused to kiss fondly then departed after cared very little if mystery be solved not chapter xiv unforeseen happens so here have reached goal of desire in surprisingly short space of time truly god have be good to in most unexpected manner have won love of sweetest woman in world mysterious murder of anne caldershaw gruesome a may seem have be main circumstance to bring about triumph for crime must not have seen portrait of beloved for innocent connection with same whereby be enabled to prove honesty good faith must never have gained confidence to trust have to study character closely having done so have unconsciously fallen in love when offered to come forward a champion conquest be complete therefore gertrude yielded truly odd wooing for next two three day be completely happy mr monk having departed must no longer interrupt at inauspicious moment so have golden hour to ourselves also weather unexpectedly changed from autumnal greyness to springlike delicacy of sunshine in blue sky be more like may than end of september singing of bird be echoed by joyful heart scarcely said word about mootley crime a have tacitly agreed to abandon search for criminal indeed there remained clue to lead to discovery of assassin at time have doubt about mysterious person whose name gertrude have so steadily refused to tell felt sure that be shielding someone must not think of reason strong enough to make do so put doubt from when smiled into eye surrendered entirely to happiness of magic hour whether miss destiny guessed truth can not say never came near lodge a only haunted when mr monk appeared on scene then merely for sake of getting what must out of a lucinda be always shopping in village dweller in burwain be born gossip miss destiny must have heard that niece be receiving at hour in place knowing infatuation must put two two together resultant four must prove to suspicious mind that have come to understanding if did arrive at knowledge made sign perhaps be content to wait event so long a half of fifty thousand pound be safe at event lay snug in jungle surrounded tin hovel like malignant fairy be golden day came to end a golden day will since everlasting paradise be impossible on earth be forced to keep promise to cannington seek london else must certainly have put in inopportune appearance of course in spite of title look possible support of mr walter monk always supposing two met must hing now a gertrude have solemnly promised to be wife same did not want cannington to come stumbling into love garden later on when first ecstasy of delight have passed away promised that must be formally presented to newly captured diana at moment duet be better than trio so explained matter to gertrude put rippler in order for spin to london wo remain long away dear asked promise promise did promise with many kiss on bare road between burwain tarhaven so far have taken in car now be necessary that must return only bird sheep sailing cloud beholding sun saw embrace so gave up fully to delight parting indeed be sweet sorrow a shakespeare say only at golden moment did fully understand feeling of romeo day be balmy sunny road be dry rippler be on best behavior so journey to london be extremely pleasant reached west kensington flat early in afternoon a have telegraphed probable time of arrival to caretaker wife who usually looked after room found everything in good order there be brisk fire good meal warm bath awaiting so spent next hour very pleasantly cannington have already be informed must call at lady denham grosvenor square house about five o'clock therefore have ample time to get ready for visit after writing few letter looking into bankbook arrayed in purple fine linen of west end be assumed frock coat grey trouser patent leather boot paraphernalia of society then sallied forth giving rippler rest jumped into taxi cab after perfect quietness of country bustle roar of many colored life in london street rather appealed to be quite sorry when vehicle stopped at destination stately footman took hat glove showed into smoking room where lord cannington awaited boy sprang to foot rushed forward to shake hand be so glad to see vance said breathlessly how jolly well look suppose began to laugh must get further well said sitting down accepting cigarette presume laugh mean that be engaged good lord go so far a went in search of original of photograph having found can see love have proved to be elixir of life be quite poetical cannington excessively complimentary oh rot be only speaking truth looked a hard a nail laughed know what be a soft a butter so far a heart be concerned ah be effect of love said cannington wisely be if really be in love say old chap be in so much so that be engaged engaged good lord engaged to gertrude monk who love a much a love good lord said cannington again rose to foot to say say have lost much time have circumstance precipitated matter be sure that be wise vance remember bearry in haste repent at leisure ' laughed again seemed so strange that boy must advise elderly person such a be be right cannington know what be about will be best man delighted say mind having said what did say be old friend know be right boy sit down will tell everything have taken place since parted at murchester must ask to be secret cannington flushed a if 'd be such bounder a to talk of love affair growled love affair in case be merely side issue although important enough to boy what wish to explain be what have discovered with regard to mr caldershaw death oh cannington jumped up again greatly excited be prying into still yes be that case led into engagement with gertrude have given up searching further why because see clue to follow moreover gertrude wish to stop looking into matter after be use sullying love with sordid detail of crime yet yet rose in earnestness cannington although be year younger than be intend to ask advice yes be right what be will tell know then can judge what mean boy looked puzzled sat down again lent attentive ear to recital walked up down room telling everything in detail for really did wish to hear what thought cannington be young shrewd took common sense view of thing gertrude refusal to tell name of person who have driven from shop lingered in mind a knew must never be completely happy if there be secret between nevertheless must not reveal what have said on point to cannington a be matter entirely between ourselves intended to tell everything else then ask what thought of position of affair waited with grave face therefore related have discovered beginning with finding of white cloak in field ending with account of interview between gertrude suppressing a have said fact that withheld name of mysterious person cannington with eye on face listened intently without interruption be acute enough to put finger on weak spot who be person who entered shop when miss monk went away know said truthfully glided into easy explanation to preserve secret mr caldershaw wished miss monk to leave without seeing person therefore sent out by back door so hurriedly that forgot cloak one of hat pin be unfortunate muttered cannington eye on carpet perhaps person killed mr caldershaw have gertrude assertion that be not case for obvious reason must not impart information to cannington ca be sure of said smoothly ca be sure of anything insisted boy thoughtfully still miss monk evidently left someone with mr caldershaw when arrived on scene mr caldershaw be dead seems to be that lady killed lady why do think that person be lady well woman female what will said impatiently assumed white cloak be left behind in kitchen ran off with motor car with eye ah ca say be sure on point said cannington musingly see eye turned up so say at burwain house think paused yes go on said encouragingly shook head know what to think vance whole matter be most mysterious perplexing give night to think about matter be strange said suddenly that miss monk want to leave matter alone be strange assented winced there be well let remain so until to morrow said cannington hastily to morrow when have have good think will give opinion guessed what be in mind although delicacy prevented from speaking plainly to gertrude conduct be suspicious not being in love with saw position more clearly than did say suspected apparently believed that knew more than chose to tell thus desired to leave case alone in point of fact cannington fancied that gertrude feared what might discover if pried further into matter have known a did that be withholding name of person who have called to see mr caldershaw might even have taken blacker view of matter of course being gertrude devoted lover believing in absolutely said nothing same felt trifle uneasy especially when guessed what cannington be thinking about queen of heart can do wrong so amended old saying nevertheless fervently wished that gertrude must be more frank with only on perfect confidence must perfect love perfect peace be established to say nothing of perfect happiness after pause cannington having promised to give opinion to morrow said more began to talk of lady mabel seemed that mr wentworth marr have returned to london be more attentive than ever be coming here to day to afternoon tea said cannington glancing at watch in hour expect will turn up aunt lucy mab will be here also dicky weston oh

cannington wish to cart several part to peaceful part of country where putting together wo be overlooked what about burwain oh know cannington be dull little village between gattlingsands tarhaven weston will find quiet want there suppose like inventor fear lest especial secret for flying must be discovered something like yet told heap about airship seems to be clever sort of business although have gas bag believe in heavier than air business what dickens do mean aeroplane know cannington entered into long disquisition on difference between navigable balloon machine strive to fly birdlike by power of wing alone in middle of lecture confess bored footman entered to announce that be wanted in drawing room thither repaired be welcomed by mabel lady denham by dark untidy little man in whom recognized dick weston lady denham be stout fair haired phlegmatic looking person who never troubled about anyone if must help therefore allowed niece to pour out tea allowed cannington to hand round bread butter latter business of course be right enough aroused so far a to say be looking well reminded her of poor dear mother after relapsed into meditation devoted to making regular substantial meal there be nothing fairylike about lady denham weston be quiet also sat near mabel haunched up in chair like little gnome with eye full of intelligence be not handsome being devoted to science suppose one must call airship science although ca be sure manner be preoccupied dry wondered that lively girl like mabel must love uninteresting personage did saw flash of eye when rested on uncomely

loved wished for nothing better aunt said that must give gabriel monk money after death a have concealed whereabouts in glass eye oh said half to myself so be right yes be right assented striver

that miss monk must kill oh rubbish interrupted impatiently miss monk must not kill fly a well know mr caldershaw must have be mad think be murmured gertrude clinging to be not mad enough to give away secret of eye to said striver savagely heard from miss destiny miss monk have learned from diary of gabriel monk that aunt knew secret of money yes interrupted gertrude looking up not of eye seeing that murdered aunt believe did contradicted gardener bluntly miss destiny said that be going over to mootley to see aunt went over also on that evening asked startled yes time before miss monk arrived saw aunt asked to tell secret refused a only wished to have money after death then miss monk arrived aunt smuggled up stair into bedroom from above saw miss monk enter back room with aunt returned to bedroom to wait fell asleep when awoke be quite dark stole down stair into back room found in darkness also found aunt body eye missing aunt be not quite dead a moaned while be wondering what to do heard motor arrive motor asked swiftly yes then saw in flash that being found with aunt dying might be accused of murder of stealing eye seeing wanted so much must not risk anyone entering back room so fumbled for key be on outside entered shop mr vance before must get there be bolt on inside of door slipped when tried door must not get in afterwards when be filling tank with petrol came out softly stole up stair with white cloak why did take white cloak knew that belonged to miss monk a have frequently seen wearing wished to keep a evidence that have murdered aunt in back room left cloak when have to depart in hurry said gertrude defiantly so say sneered striver believe differently however managed to get safely back to bedroom wondered how must escape then struck that must assume cloak a disguise found veil also put that round cap in dusk with long cloak veil thought must look like woman must steal out oh said with gasp then ran away with car yes did said with sort of triumph waited chance to get out of place a be afraid lest must be accused of murder when entered back room attracted by moan of dying woman yes go on well then stole down stair turned key already knew be on outside have set motor going so ran out leaped in man giles saw although did not know name at time put on speed to escape luckily have turned motor round in murchester direction spun along met miss destiny in trap a know at time did think be then struck that stranger a believed might say how have seen motor must be traced therefore slewed machine into field through gate left stranded there concealed cloak found along with veil put in go on mr striver there be nothing more to tell said sulkily walked to murchester caught train a have not motor white cloak felt be safe so be be not very safe now remarked rising to stretch suppose tell police then denounce miss monk a guilty be in back room have left long long before interposed gertrude very pale be in back room also striver yet be innocent however can see that if talk can talk so for present in event will say nothing about matter can go pointed to door stood ground looked at gertrude be in power said be in ours retorted cheerfully wo do striver thing will remain a be for present miss monk be not for will tell police threatened by mean cut own throat go flung open door looked with deadly hatred at gertrude then departed in silence when turned towards darling have fainted chapter xvii lady mabel visit of course in daring striver to do worst knew be running considerable risk man be crazy with love might be sufficiently reckless of consequence to to tell police that have confessed to then gertrude must certainly be arrested on evidence striver a accomplice after fact must be arrested also then justice must have to remove bandage from eye to learn of two be guilty in own mind have doubt of gertrude innocence unbiassed jury might take probably must take on declaration of striver very different view have dared much on spur of moment have defied jealous man therefore for next two three day be uneasy did not permit gertrude to see be doubtful of striver silence when recovered from faint expressed afraid lest must speak out in point of fact voiced sentiment in order to pacify made light of fear dear much a man love certainly will not place neck in noose to be revenged on said again again be too deeply implicated by running away with car with cloak with being in house when crime be actually committed to dare to tell police truth even if did go with story doubt if must be arrested a on face of look much more guilty do think be guilty cyrus asked tremulously well spoke doubtfully such thought struck once twice be in house wanted eye to learn secret of hiding place knew that have paid visit might have murdered old lady with hat pin so a to throw blame on then might have hoped to implicate still further by using cloak a disguise giles mistook for woman counted upon must of course aid to entangle yet more in snare ca be sure if be actually guilty hope not hope not murmured gertrude anxiously must be such terrible thing for to murder relative mind joseph at if must only get rid of crazy affection have for know why love so look in glass will see said kissing oh nonsense cyrus said gertrude impatiently how can joke when thing be so serious be very ordinary girl joseph be half mad really believe oh stopped short looked at that eye saw what meant yes nodded that struck also joseph might have be one who placed on that drawing room table to implicate in case if can only force to confess a much must be guilty of murder hope not hope not said again shiveringly yet then went off on new line of thought if placed eye there why must take away again may not have done so do know gertrude must not be surprised if aunt julia have wanted eye a know because desire to handle money apparently told joseph of visit to mootley so that might go there on same day anticipate learning secret from mr caldershaw what must gain by must be able to make joseph give part of money when found replied quickly then think anticipated murder not for one moment dear with fault aunt be not wicked enough to deliberately urge man to commit murder sent joseph ahead first trusting that mr caldershaw must tell secret before arrived then must return with cipher must understand together solve that a thing turned out be pure theory mind joseph did not show eye must not have have by own confession insisted gertrude quite so who else must have placed eye on drawing room table dearest suspected giles suspected think in way suspected striver since be working in garden now be sure put there because be unable to read cipher so made use of to implicate miss destiny found probably now be in possession that glass eye have trick of disappearing disappearing eye said gertrude with wan smile be wrong about aunt julia cyrus be with time when saw eye walked with to gate be not in drawing room be disappointed when heard in case must not have taken mused mr monk must not a be with time cyrus how can think that papa must do thing smiled covertly experience of mr monk showed that must act in extremely underhanded mean way when suited own tricky end to do so bearing promise in mind did not dare to explain to girl merely said that perhaps after striver took eye back again a have opportunity of doing so must have produced when talked insisted gertrude again must incriminate too deeply however eye a have said seems to have trick of appearing disappearing so will turn up again meanwhile will give mr striver benefit of doubt assume to be innocent although be hanged if action look like wo say anything may depend upon striver did not evidently policy of daring to do worst have proved successful remained week in burwain did not come near house then disappeared mr gilfin told news striver have given cottage into charge of cousin have gone away for indefinite period did say where be going chatted mr gilfin asked john to find out from gossip in bar must knowing men a do know where be gone where cuckoo asked anxiously for bearing in mind what gardener knew be eager to know whereabouts to london town said mr gilfin solemnly young men with money always go there to have spree since have caught eye of miss gertrude master cyrus dear that young man given up trying with aunt money be gone to enjoy doubted striver be too deeply in love to get rid of crazy passion so easily still be possible that have gone to london to drown disappointment in orgy so took news of departure to gertrude although did not tell of mr gilfin belief found girl puzzling over letter from father be going to new york on business said handing letter now wonder what business can be cyrus why did go away without coming down to tell personally say good bye read mr monk precise handwriting carefully have kept to agreement with have left country must be away wrote to daughter for indefinite period hoped to return wealthy man guessed that mean creature must probably stay in america marry there leaving daughter to look after luckily there be postscript stating that if gertrude wanted money be to apply to lawyer whose address be given handed back letter with shrug since mr monk have departed there be reason for to say anything at although have limited silence to fortnight expect be found business will make rich have have to go off in hurry ca miss very much gertrude darling for be never here be true said thoughtfully folding up letter since have come into life cyrus miss father very little still might have come to say good bye be afraid ended sighing that papa be little selfish well never mind will return with wealth a say do think will be sure of replied kissing for if mr monk did appear in burwain again contingency must not be sure must take place must doubtless admit possession of australian cousin money to daughter meanwhile a pointed out be gone striver be gone so all have to do be to enjoy then there be danger of joseph seeing police kissed again set mind at rest truly when day after day went past news came began to believe that mr striver suggested revenge have passed away altogether murder of mr caldershaw unless gardener be guilty still remained mystery so long a gertrude be not troubled cared very little if be never solved september passed into october

hand in foreign fashion ca understand what mean cyrus understands said gertrude voice sounded cold perhaps will explain cyrus willingly said nerved to desperate coolness will understand in turn be bound by promise made to father not to say anything if certain condition be fulfilled be that fair to asked mabel angrily perfectly fair snapped learned truth when met mr marr at lady denham house then recognized a mr monk afterwards have explanation with why did tell real name when set eye on demanded lady mabel crossly did not wish to make scene be only fair to await explanation what cried girl color rising when mr marr be calling on aunt under false name have perfect legal right to name under pretence of being rich man be rich man assured to extent of one hundred thousand pound gertrude looked at in astonishment be true denied dear girl have word of father for amount be very strange said mabel calming somewhat hiding covert smile oh great heaven wonder what aunt lucy will say laughed outright be like play to think that man with daughter a old a be must wish to marry gertrude colored saw that mind be tormented to think that father must act in underhand way to lessen anguish hastened to relate knew be explained about australian cousin legal change of name reason for suppression of burwain household condition upon have held peace two girl listened quietly mabel with astonishment gertrude with pain certainly walter monk alias wentworth marr have not committed crime have scarcely acted straightforwardly well said mabel drawing long breath a usual when have ended never heard of such thing why on earth did mr marr mr monk be sure know what to call tell whole truth there be reason to keep quiet can see be reason evidently said gertrude with crimson cheek for be heartily ashamed of father papa did not think must marry if saw for answer mabel who be extremely kindhearted girl jumped up kissed same flushed cheek dear liked father well enough must have objection to a step daughter laughed merrily at idea fact be never intended to marry mr marr aunt lucy said always loved dicky weston always will although be so horrid be glad of said gertrude quickly for now can see that father be not man to make woman happy always thought that be kindhearted harmless man trifle frivolous perhaps quite honest now understand have be deceived in more way than one added half to herself must not understand what meant did later do blame gertrude asked rising to take hand of course doe said mabel very rapidly made promise on certain condition to keep quiet for agreed time have done so blame can possibly attach to gertrude said anxiously taking notice of mabel defence pressed hand wish must have told said in low voice father be too clever for understand forgive pleaded there be nothing to forgive of course there be cried mabel kissing gertrude again let make difference to friendship dear will marry cyrus will marry dicky if go down on knee to apologize for daring to ask again everything will be well when meet father ended mabel wrathfully will speak mind think that will see again said gertrude quietly have gone to america went without word of farewell explanation to think will stop there see now that affection be wasted on since apparently care for one never mind mabel caressed have cyrus yes thank god for honest man threw on breast mabel looked at walked to door will leave together go after cannington if dicky anything of lover will meet on road in airship if possible with laugh to relax tension of situation vanished shortly heard open front door pas out then only did speak worry gertrude be worth be father after moaned be terrible to think that must deceive so well have done real harm told that gave whole five hundred year to yourself more le be not true have kept very short hang stopped after a said man be father must not very well speak what be in mind to daughter think of more gertrude whispered coaxingly have have let forget will be best said drying eye for ready tear have filled small blame to do think papa will come back will probably stop in state marry heiress thank god will not come back muttered half to herself never want to see in england again thought that be rather strained view to take of monk delinquency seeing how fond gertrude have be of until discovered true character be way with true affection be nothing gertrude truthful honest girl must never trust father again must never trust said speaking exactly what be in mind must only deceive when suited always knew that father be more le selfish looked upon a child character be not deep one be deeper than supposed said grimly can see now oh rose pushed away must go to room to think matter over what matter what have told others stammered caught hand gertrude what be wrenched away hand glided towards door dare tell dare tell whispered lip be a white a face a waved back wait wait muttered when can make up mind will know disappeared what be question asked a returned to inn apparently gertrude knew something more about father than what have told what must be must so move to tear of course discovery of father doubtful behavior have given shock scarcely explained uncontrolled emotion began to wonder if mr monk have connection with mootley murder on reflection must find connecting link until gertrude gave entire confidence must not explain anything entire confidence stopped short when two word flashed into mind remembered that gertrude have refused to give name of mysterious person who have driven out of back door by mere sight of yes for truly believed that person in question although have kept in ignorance of sex be walter monk on assumption be easy to guess why poor girl have refused to speak name dreaded lest father must be implicated in crime so in face of danger to herself have held peace even to staunch friend devoted lover be what have brought tear so readily notwithstanding have seen in shop a now believed have hitherto refused to credit with murder sudden discovery of duplicity of be capable have aroused in breast latent doubt to active life now wished to be alone in order to consider if father be guilty of murder a have be guilty of deception at least be belief although have little ground to go upon gertrude a have always thought be shielding someone whom have seen in mr caldershaw shop who must that someone be father since relationship alone must be powerful motive for to hold tongue even at risk of losing liberty try a might must not see how walter monk must be connected with death of anne caldershaw same evening after dinner weston walked back to tarhaven with brother sister sky be clear atmosphere be not too chilly also walked along cliff under full wintry moon naturally weston girl loved be together seemed to be quarreling pretty freely in fact dicky told that night when walked back that several time have attempted to propose again that mabel have always laughed at so that must not get word out teased tantalized drew on repulsed like true daughter of eve so that cold scientific blood to put picturesquely began to warm perhaps be what young minx desired at event dicky weston understood after walk to tarhaven much better than have ever understood before began to think that there be other thing in world than airship cannington walked behind chatting smoking mabel have not found time to tell of discovery have thought best to leave explanation to at event cannington knew nothing so to be beforehand judged well to relate what knew boy said abruptly when have settled well into swing have something to tell something must have known before must have known added emphatically have not be bound to hold tongue for certain period what be talking about vance asked cannington turning surprised youthful face to mine listen get hair off said then rapidly clearly told of recognition of marr a monk of conversation have enjoyed with in london chamber finally detailed how mabel have seen photograph in lodge drawing room have proved two men to be one boy listened quietly enough although once twice heard swear under breath well said when have finished do blame said promptly since arranged that man must drop aunt lucy acquaintance must drop courting mab blame wish have told when fortnight be up dear boy how must be going to italy be useless to communicate news by letter especially added when monk went to america intends apparently to stop there yes yes suppose acted for best what beast come be trifle hard protested monk have legal right to name of marr have plenty of money be not bad match for mabel never liked said cannington truculently be glad mabel did not listen to said that never intended to listen to now may be sure that will be lady mabel weston very shortly that depends upon dicky behavior said cannington sharply unless be can desire sha' marry sister leave thing in hand of mabel son will manage affair right marr damn must like to give thrashing see upon what ground must cannington be true that suppressed fact that have grown up daughter be not crime suppression be due only to vanity daresay intended to tell truth if mabel have accepted daresay muttered boy still wrathful must give little beast benefit of doubt ca exactly call to account legally socially suppose if dare to speak to again cannington fist clenched in deerskin glove think will set eye on for many long day said carelessly will stop in state marry what doe daughter say be very much cut up at way in have behaved fancy having money one hundred thousand pound keeping daughter down to simple necessary of life perhaps have money at said cannington abruptly must have insisted look at motor car drove in then room be beautifully furnished might have got that by swindling in case certainly be justified in thrashing since obtained introduction to lady denham under false pretence think mr monk have nerve to swindle cannington laughed grimly have never seen easy going boy so angry think have nerve for anything after what have done even for murder vance started remembering belief that gertrude be shielding father understand might have murdered anne caldershaw oh nonsense mr monk be even in neighborhood mr walter monk under real name be mr wentworth marr be cannington remember how told that marr called on mess shortly before arrived be stopping at lion hotel in murchester went off without seeing again then think that went to mootley to see anne caldershaw murdered straight away ca be sure that murdered said cannington doubtfully can see for that man be game for anything according to what tell mr caldershaw be murdered for sake of glass eye contains clue to fortune monk marr like to call beast might have murdered woman stolen eye have got money daresay added cannington with grim laugh be really wealthy ca believe said desperately hoping against hope for be unpleasant to think gertrude might be daughter of criminal long before mootley murder be courting sister a rich man daresay might have anticipated fortune however be opinion vance so can take leave want to hear man name again only hope will have good sense to stay in state a sha' answer for temper when meet right boy get hair off with have said cannington stiffly whole affair be unpleasant if be for think what must be for when be going to marry daughter of such rotter will keep to engagement then of course returned indignantly what do take for jolly good chap said boy giving friendly dig expect lady mean be worth mabel say that be end of beauty mabel be one of few girl who can praise beauty in for pretty speech will have best wedding present can procure may not be wanted grunted cannington laughed looked ahead at pair quarreling in moonlight on contrary will have to see to matter at once said lightly on night when got back to inn retired to bed thought long deeply cannington chance remark about marr being in neighborhood during time crime be committed convinced that man have be to mootley gertrude have caught sight of when be in back room have fled for reason have declined to tell name of mysterious person again presence of glass eye on drawing room table be explained in reasonable way monk have left there apparently by chance since knowing must never have allowed such evidence of guilt to remain there how have recovered again must not say a have be with time until re entered drawing room together might be gertrude in spite of denial have chanced on eye remembering father presence in shop have concealed thinking with good reason that be guilty even to under circumstance must deny truth so did not blame overmuch arranged in own mind to see next day learn for certain if really believed father

cruel time with cruel time better than deserve swear added striver turning again to that never believed mr monk to be guilty until found eye what sprang to foot in sheer astonishment found eye monk changing alternately from white to red with nervous fear must have burst out into emphatic denial striver cast such black look in direction that word died on lip then gardener took out of pocket small morocco case such a jeweller use to enclose watch passed along to opened silently there on puffy white silk lay glass eye found that said striver slowly while searching luggage of mr monk have right to search luggage whimpered monk be most unfair unfair be hanged be so certain that miss gertrude be innocent talked so much about defending with life began to suspect of deed hunted when be out

eye on small table in drawing room of lodge near middle french window mr monk placed there only prof guilt more conclusively think not in first place if mr monk have be possessed of eye must scarcely be such fool a to leave about in second case when re entered drawing room eye have disappeared time from when saw to when returned to room mr monk be with must not have secured again even though according to placed there believe took eye from table how dare say that cried man color changed guessed that chance remark asserted truth on what ground have supplied ground said quickly by saying

forward curiously stared be silver coin threepenny bit explained half to gabriel told that have engraved cipher on threepenny bit must never tell where be hidden very ingenious idea to hide in mr caldershaw eye see be fastened by piece of gold wire to center of pupil be a said coin be so fastened in dense black of pupil appeared glint of tiny piece of gold in other way must coin have be kept in place a be sunken good way into concave of artificial eye same when worn must not produce irritation to wearer be a monk said very ingenious idea never saw before murmured believed that be speaking truth so be how gabriel concealed secret tried to read what be on coin failed a engraving be so very small have magnifying glass mr monk asked not to knowledge said promptly however will look for one

have secured eye for have held in conversation then remembered that mr monk have be hunting smoking room for magnifying glass in order to decipher inscription engaged with repentant gardener have paid very little attention to movement so be probable that when back be turned have taken opportunity to slip incriminating eye into pocket also recalled fact that have handed closed case recommending to get magnifying glass from jeweller have be clever enough to mistrust a have reason to must there then have opened case to see that eye be safe have not done so now in train when monk be out of reach discovered loss of course guessed that have taken so a to obviate accusation being brought against probably by time have got rid of for ever be useless for to do what settled on spur of moment to do return by next train to london from one of intermediate station monk must only lie must not force to surrender eye always presuming that have not destroyed by threatening to tell police fulfilment of threat meant danger to gertrude must simply laugh in face there be nothing for to continue journey to burwain consult with gertrude if placed matter before might see way out of dilemma be dilemma for have not found time to decipher what be on threepenny bit so must not hope to find hidden money if only knew what kind of cryptogram gabriel monk have engraved on piece of silver felt certain that in one way must read same failing own capability knew man in london who possessed poe like talent for unravelling such puzzle for gertrude sake desired to find fortune since mr monk now that have nothing to gain knew that daughter loved no longer might withdraw money allowed might even sell house ground for though income be entailed property be not then gertrude must be homeless penniless until father

accused to keep striver quiet father made secretary brought back to england morning received wire from father asking for assistance went up shrugged be be only beginning said gertrude quickly sit down tell about interview first to set mind at rest be father guilty reflected really ca say sometimes think be again think be not there be much to be said for opinion striver if anyone know truth yet only base accusation on finding of glass eye surely said gertrude in great agitation be strong evidence yes assented dryly if be true believe that striver stole glass eye from yonder table took to america to frighten father into helping with marriage if have real true evidence against mr monk must not have resorted to faked evidence with glass eye on ground believe that father be innocent oh what relief sighed sat down on other hand continued quietly father have made change opinion by stealing eye again what do mean cyrus took seat beside gained possession of hand then related have taken place in stratford street room interrupted frequently with ejaculation when have finished appeared more struck with striver sudden collapse than with other portion of narrative know truth will save good name said slowly to herself must seem a though joseph know for certain that father be innocent since name be name not exactly dear name by act of parliament be marr yours be monk when change to vance

bedroom then will not tell truth now when time come will know gertrude need have fear that will ever be troubled again by mootley murder thank god for said gertrude who be guilty shrugged shoulder must wait until striver speaks out perhaps killed aunt wished to escape abroad before confessing let read rest of letter continued writer went on to say that intended to leave england a have plenty of money must not return to burwain to see gertrude wife of so probably must go to australia very foolish of to tell that seeing may be guilty said cyrus know that can trust said rebukingly be sorry for poor man be making amends will say so when hear that have told truth about murder remarked grimly how intends to do so ca say look gertrude do see how finish father after getting rid of cipher coin in river came back took thing away told striver here be that be returning to america must never come to england again well paused poor papa sighed gertrude why must not have come down asked to help after be father must never be hard on think be worthy of regret said for really mr walter monk behavior sickened a have departed there be use going up to see to morrow about eye especially a eye be now destroyed said gertrude taking up paper cipher be set down here what do make of cyrus put striver letter into pocket there be more writing after information of mr monk departure for america bent over paper be bird in middle of lot of dust said dust gertrude pointed out two of speck then dust have wing oh then be bird midst cloud of insect odd sign ' reversed ' turned in wrong direction gertrude thought for moment then face brightened cyrus what kind of bird be pointed might be peacock said ironically mr striver have not much notion of drawing do think be eagle asked in excited tone good heaven retorted did ever see eagle like joseph be not artist said gertrude impatiently certainly be not clever be cyrus for talent oh to think that secret hiding place must be in very house what stared alternately at gertrude at paper ca see understand cried greatly excited eagle amidst cloud of fly aquila non capit musca stared at have heard that sentence before have seen drawing better executed in carving cyrus what be first letter of motto ' ' for aquila eagle yes last letter ' terminal for musca for fly well caught by hand come into smoking room light lamp oh by jove saw meaning now referred to heavy beam across smoking room to mr monk have drawn attention ran hand in hand like child into dark room gertrude struck match taking box from hand shaking hand be struck in few moment powerful oil lamp be illuminating room brilliantly looked at beam eagle catching fly cried gertrude pointing aquila non capit musca ancestor queer old motto diamond be there hidden in beam of course come get ladder from outhouse wo do a eliza be so filled with curiosity want to suspect anything be to do can place chair on table a be tall can easily reach up to beam said suiting action to word close door gertrude so eliza ca come spying gertrude who be excitement promptly locked door how be to get beam open will get axe nonsense said consulting paper of striver be hiding place right enough beam must open in way how what about reversed letter questioned gertrude be not reversed on beam be on paper know gertrude letter on beam be raised so a to give one grip get candle will hand up lamp so a to lose time stretched with lamp held close to raised carving of beam particularly examined first last letter s circular line appeared faintly round be not visible round other letter handed lamp back what be going to do asked gertrude replacing lamp on stand twist first last letter into position indicated by cipher then will see what will happen put forth strength to found that with effort twisted with considerable ease hurrah cried be secret final s be more difficult to move at last contrived to get twisted completely round gertrude bright face looked up anxiously stand away stand away cried hastily be just a well that have warned for suddenly whole broad board containing motto clattered to floor before must save diamond diamond cried gertrude excitedly cavity be revealed passed hand along be empty gertrude diamond be gone cried in dismay spirit fell to zero chapter xxi airship who have removed diamond be thought for next twenty four hour must not answer own question certainly remembered how striver insisted that mr monk have secured possession of fortune only by getting possession of eye must learn where jewel be hidden by striver own showing have not be thus fortunate only when destroying eye have have in hand then instead of reading cipher have thrown coin upon be written into thames moreover for many month monk have be masquerading a wentworth marr have possessed money to keep up farce undoubtedly a thought after much reflection story of australian legacy must be true mr monk on face of must not have looted beam of valuable content what astonished be that monk must have thrown away coin although be natural enough that must have destroyed eye why did not at least attempt to read cipher seemed to be extremely easy one a repetition of beam carving on coin suggested latin motto reversed letter suggested little hard thinking presented great obstacle late gabriel monk have cut away inscribed board behind have hollowed out place for reception of diamond in bag presume also have cut out first last letter of saying in circular form to have attached piece of iron when letter be placed straightly piece of iron caught on to inner part of beam so held inscribed board when reversed released same be ingenious not difficult of solution wondered that monk have not read cipher if have certainly must have guessed that beam in lodge smoking room held jewel in event must have searched on assumption thought that man must not have examined cipher why must not have done so puzzled considerably however case stood thus monk have returned to america at event have left england striver also have taken departure jewel belonged to gertrude have disappeared gardener intended so said to tell truth unmask assassin of aunt unless intended to denounce when at safe distance must not imagine what intended to say so far a must see there be nothing to do to wait communication from striver meanwhile urged gertrude to marry during first month of new year be afraid to marry until truth about anne murder be known cyrus objected aunt julia still threatens let go see aunt now said be next morning that conversation took place can explain matter to will be forced to see that be innocent after only desire half share of fortune when learns be lost will hold tongue having nothing to gain by talking anxious to end suspense gertrude agreed paid early visit

afforded better dwelling yet daresay be happy enough in sordid home since cared for be money so long a possessed actual gold to gloat over cared little for comfort must bring be strange way of finding happiness miss destiny opened door a lucinda appeared from what said have gone to buy food in village little old lady be dressed in usual threadbare black silk with addition of knitted woollen shawl over spare shoulder looked extremely shabby also pinched haggard black eye be a bright a ever seemed to posse considerable vitality in wiry frame lover said with shrill laugh inviting to enter so be not to be joseph after dear gertrude never be joseph replied niece quietly aunt julia have asked cyrus to come see about threat used to threat miss destiny raised eyebrow dear child used threat said that if gertrude did not give half of fifty thousand pound when found that must tell police have be to mootley oh really did mean that mr vance said miss destiny cringing be only joke on part then accuse of murder asked gertrude bluntly dear certainly not want half gertrude fortune questioned miss destiny eye narrowed looked venomous certainly must have money gabriel said that must leave legacy did not yet slaved for many year looking after house got board lodging for service said gertrude coldly ought to have got legacy insisted miss destiny gabriel promised money left income property to walter rest of saving to owe half mean to have half say dear added miss destiny significantly that murdered anne if police knew that have paid visit to ask about eye might be asked unpleasant question did not ask about eye because did not know until later that eye contained cipher said gertrude calmly after reading diary certainly went to ask anne to give cipher so that might find what rightfully belonged to half of only snapped miss destiny certainly ran away with mr vance motor car because saw in white cloak if be innocent mind accuse of murder if be innocent why did run away so strangely guilty conscience guilty conscience dear miss destiny said indignantly for malice of little creature annoyed be joseph striver who wore gertrude cloak ran off with car told so so say sneered say more listen forthwith related have be discovered down to destruction of glass eye throwing away of silver coin by walter monk miss destiny listened unbelievingly with sneer apparently did not credit single word of what be saying when came to end interrupted with scream eye destroyed eye destroyed cried starting to foot with surprising activity oh what fool what fool now fortune can never be discovered have be discovered put in gertrude what miss destiny wheeled round venomously eagerly have found diamond told that gabriel mentioned in diary have found hiding place said sharply striver sent copy of cipher took when eye a have told be in possession then give half give half shrieked miss destiny if will go to police swear will go to police believe young man lie be in house choked with anger gertrude arose revolted by exhibition of sordid greed must not speak answered for jewel be gone miss destiny said quietly gone shrill voice fell to mere whisper wild light of avarice died out of black eye gone impossible then face lighted up again fiercely be lie to cheat of share shouted even if jewel have be found remarked in cool level voice must have have none of since belonged to gertrude be strong enough to save from malice striver walter monk be guilty if go to police will go also tell what have told gertrude caught arm cyrus father dear be not time for half measure did best to save father by refusing to tell if be guilty must be brought to book if only to thwart woman evil intention oh have done with chatter cried miss destiny stamping like small fury tell truth be jewel indeed gone yes will never see again who took insist upon knowing who took know if did must get back again then hunt for joseph striver said miss destiny furiously be thief impossible sent cipher yes sneered after have stolen jewel must easily send cipher have eye by own showing must have read cipher have taken fortune oh shook fist in air wish two hand be at throat little creature looked so evil a shook quivered in sordid room that touched gertrude shoulder go away dear be sight for then when obeyed passed outside turned to miss destiny will understand that jewel be lost for ever will hunt thief down will hunt down breathed savagely even if do half share will not come to will look after gertrude interest miss destiny laughed shrilly ah marry for money what love gertrude at present have money do want money with if have jewel will be forced to give up meanwhile if say word to anyone against gertrude will tell story will say word until jewel be in gertrude possession be not worth while to say anything until then when have fortune will have half will hang be mad said recoiling from venomous look yes mad at being tricked cheated by joseph striver oh know man might have guessed that must not keep faith with fortune be gone fortune be gone dropped into chair yes said with hand on door therefore hold tongue miss destiny only crouched in chair rocking to fro fortune be gone moaned twenty five thousand pound be to have be share have lost twenty five thousand pound oh oh leaving still weeping wailing over loss departed whether miss destiny be right wrong regarding striver possession of diamond must not say day after day went by gardener did not appear to denounce assassin of aunt a have arranged to do must be found anywhere although employed detective to search for discovered that mr monk have given up lease of chamber have sold furniture have disappeared to america evidently have intention of returning lawyer still continued to pay gertrude enough to keep lodge going in clothes striver have vanished like water bubble have dissolved into thin air must do be to wait until chose to reappear pointed out to gertrude miss destiny mouth being closed must not speak until jewel be recovered very remote contingency father along with gardener having passed out of life must be best to get married then must leave burwain settle in london a mr vance must forget storm of past with a companion must journey under brighter sky gertrude refused steadily until name be absolutely cleared by assassin of anne caldershaw being brought to justice will remain a be at lodge what

ourselves in confounded balloon be not balloon flared up dicky angrily for rest of evening explained idea be not sufficiently engineer to appreciate cleverness of during week before weston trial flight rumor ran through village surprised everyone be said that miss destiny intended to go away from burwain a have lived in village life seemed to be a deeply rooted a tree appeared strange that in old age must venture to seek fresh field pasture new guessed that intended to go in search of striver whom believed have possession of jewel tried to get speech with must not admit into house must come to lodge in response to invitation from gertrude wished to learn if knew whereabouts of ex gardener since guessed be bent upon finding must not learn where be going although lucinda set rumor afloat in village that mistress intended to leave burwain must guess devouring flame of avarice in miss destiny heart made thus uproot must go through fire water to get jewel believed striver possessed found pitying man guilty a believed to be when thought of halting nemesis of witch coming up to side miss destiny be starting on chase must never stop hunting until pulled down quarry death alone must end pursuit however day passed by still lingered in miserable home burwain began to wear quite festive air during early january week for reporter came from london to inspect airship many idle people gathered outside yard to pick up chance information dicky showed craft at private view explained mechanism to with certain reservation touching upon particular method of flying secret understood have to do with steering of vessel with way have of driving forward in teeth of wind be so ignorant of technical term can not explain much that told must be fair since inventor wish idea to be stolen grew almost a excited a dicky when great day arrived be tuesday morning fine sunny with scarcely breath of wind inventor must have secured finer weather for attempt crowd of people from tarhaven gattlingsands other place came to see experiment quite number of reporter have appeared representing most popular london journal gate of yard be thrown open considerable crowd gathered within hitherto inviolated precinct amongst walked with gertrude beside everyone in village be there verily believe to see novelty of airship taking flight even fat john gilfin with nearly a stout wife waddled along looking at queer machine bulking largely in middle of yard airship consisted of slim cigar shaped bag netted over from long narrow trough of basketwork be slung at end of be propeller light machinery to drive be in middle being hidden under bonnet of tin must not see what be used to set wheel working be one of weston secret inventor be busy in trough adjusting various part of gear shouting out order to different workman whole ship be bound to earth by sundry rope be tugging straining at like thing of life when rope be loosened ship must flash up into air like released bird then dicky seated behind machine in basketwork cradle must show skill in steering way other a wind be extremely faint must have advantage forgot to say that there be steering van like wing spreading from trough must be raised lowered at will wanting technical knowledge a have explained fear description of famous craft be not particularly good be airship be knew be curious to see climb sky amongst crowd unexpectedly saw quaint little figure of miss destiny dressed in black a usual pointed out to gertrude tried to get near a be still curious to learn if have idea of striver whereabouts kept keen eye on movement dodged with such success that never must approach what can be afraid of asked gertrude perplexed be afraid of being asked question replied believe know where man be to be found though lord only know how can have learned whereabouts intends to run down get jewel to herself what will do with asked gertrude bewildered gloat over replied shortly see airship will soon be on point of starting six rope added pressing forward if need that strength to hold down yon huge bag of gas wonder how weston proposes to reach earth again will have to remain sky bird for ever interest of crowd became intense a four of rope be loosened airship strained desperately at remaining two weston a afterwards informed have method of releasing separating gas in way whereby must descend if chose then by connecting up gas again in cigar shaped bag must ascend exactly understand how be managed have to do with transmission of gas from upper bag to lower one under trough only noticed when four rope let ship float trifle high although interested in airship be much more taken up with movement of miss destiny likewise became absorbed in start of strange craft forgot for moment to keep eye on drew gertrude arm within own stole forward to where be pressing gently through watching crowd gertrude uttered ejaculation pointed towards gate there be lucinda said in startled tone two policeman with looked sure enough lucinda walked beside stern faced man in plain clothes whom knew be none other than old friend inspector dredge of murchester behind walked two burly policeman four came steadily towards crowd gathered round airship what can be matter whispered gertrude agitated thrilled a premonition of what presence of dredge meant flashed into mind however have little time for consideration a second rope be released from ground weston curled up within car only one rope remained to be loosened a weston laid hand on to draw up giving signal to men below to let go cry wild shrill arose fly mistress fly be after will get will policeman hand on mouth stopped further speech miss destiny who be immediately in front of turned quickly at sound of girl voice face grew deathly white when saw inspector forcing way towards looked round like trapped animal heedless of roaring of crowd excited by sight dredge came up to miss destiny laid heavy hand on shoulder arrest in name of king for murder of anne got further miss destiny with sudden snarl twisted out of grip at very moment weston gave signal for men below to loosen last rope being in fore front of crowd sprang into open space ran forward take with take with screamed a men let go of rope grabbed hold of with desperate inconceivable quickness next moment airship shot up into radiant sky at end of rope dangled from car under weston hand miss destiny spun like spider uttered sound made movement hung on desperately while ship soared caught glimpse of amazement on weston face a lessened before eye shout of terror at little woman terrible position came from crowd dredge stood where be paralyzed gertrude screamed with fright lucinda beat hand in despair ship soared swung to right black figure still clung to rope weston a must see be making preparation to descend owing to difficulty must not get gear to work by time ship be at considerable height everyone be watching with terror happening of midair tragedy how miss destiny hung on so long must not guess seemed to have strength of fiend suddenly gust of wind caught ship a receded rope with little figure twisting at end swung towards rear of car in second be in grip of stern propeller saw sudden jerk of rope upward moment later be jerked out of gripping hand of anne caldershaw murderess fell speck through blue sky groan went up from crowd at sight of terrible death chapter xxii whole truth so miss destiny be criminal after confession alone revealed what have taken place in anne caldershaw back room shortly before have arrived in motor car to search for adventure inspector dredge came to lodge same evening to relate have taken place to inform how have come to burwain little woman body be found broken in piece on outskirt of tarhaven small wonder considering terrible height from have fallen did not hear until next day what weston thought a airship proved to be unmanageable drifted over toward island of grain where managed to descend there remained for night came back by train to burwain in afternoon of ensuing day gertrude troubled about weston failure absence be far too much taken up with story told by inspector dredge a be so much connected with matter mr vance said stern faced man when appeared at four o'clock in drawing room of lodge be only fair that must know truth also be connected with matter mr inspector said gertrude for interrupted with grave bow know what must say miss be in back room left cloak there be afterwards worn by joseph striver when escaped in mr vance motor car blame attache to miss quite

morrow joseph will be searched for arrested a knew truth along why did not tell asked gertrude anxiously think be to blame miss rather sweet look miss striver wished to use what have learned in order to marry what did learn asked while gertrude blushed at complimentary tone of officer be coming to said dredge calmly in good time mr vance two day ago received letter from joseph striver stated that be sailing from certain port to foreign land refused to name where be letter written from there be address given mr vance postmark be that of london be posted at general post office so striver have covered up track very carefully by time be doubtless on high sea will be difficult to trace well demanded impatiently what did say in letter dredge took out epistle written on foolscap a have be one to spread out on table there be need to read said gravely a know content by heart yes go on gertrude be attention striver writes that came to see aunt knowing miss monk be due for visit be informed of

seated in back kitchen miss destiny failing to get eye from mr caldershaw watched chance to murder took up blue glass headed pin knew belonged to miss here gave to said gertrude in choked voice of course dredge nodded so be certain that when used blame must fall on now how managed exactly to kill mr caldershaw doe not say went on inspector wrinkling brow in perplexity think playfully touched mr
