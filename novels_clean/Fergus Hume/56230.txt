grumbled trifle a loved to wait on lesbia be irishman appreciated love affair did not need much cleverness to see that young walker wished to be alone with beloved if only to enjoy unique situation tim therefore departed couple have breakfast in heavenly solitude lesbia wished to talk about adventure on towing path to ask question george positively refused to speak of anything save most frivolous matter father will return soon explained passing cup for more coffee then will have to tell story over again let talk about of future lesbia after faint resistance be only too pleased to obey so have extremely pleasant meal room be cheerful with summer sun poured in flood of light warmth through window feeling of spring be still in air most prosaically enjoyed food unromantically ate large breakfast time kept looking at one relishing novel situation be brought to end only too speedily by sudden entrance of mr hale tall lean cold stern appeared on threshold stared in surprise at way in young walker be taking possession not only of house of daughter what devil doe mean asked hale politely indignant look at george head cried lesbia with shiver for doubt returned fortyfold at sight of aristocratic father explains nothing said hale drily perhaps mr walker will undertake to tell how come that find making at home in poor abode george who be perfectly cool collected told story hale listened much more discomposed than chose to appear at conclusion of narrative asked one question showed where thought be cross said eagerly have be robbed of cross answered walker positively although believe be attacked for sake of luckily left in drawer of dressing table can guess who attacked said hale coolly can not still if know about cross only know that belonged to wife want to get back a soon a possible lesbia must never have given to a to being attacked so that might be robbed of ca believe that story cross a jewel be not so very valuable besides one lesbia tim knew that have presume ended hale in most sarcastic manner that suspect one of three oh rejoined walker promptly spoke a believed in spite of troubled look lesbia cast on still hale threw up hand to interrupt can talk of adventure later mr walker after cross may have something to do with way in be assaulted although a said appears unlikely want to recover immediately be more eager now have heard of adventure give note to mother saying that cross be to be given to will consent to marriage with lesbia george looked at girl who nodded let father have back cross since so greatly desire said can give something else dear be willing to pay price for father consent george shrugged shoulder be immaterial to said calmly so long a be pleased dear only wished to keep ornament a first love gift to have pencil mr hale thank scribbled note to jenny maid servant explained when handing to tall silent man will admit into bedroom will find cross in right hand drawer of dressing table mother mother went to london yesterday will not be back until three o'clock to day if like to wait can go over with later said hale brusquely mother might make objection know how difficult be to deal with will go stay here with lesbia george be nothing loth when mr hale departed walked with beloved in garden must have talked of adventure lesbia must have told george thought be uppermost in mind namely that father be cognisant of assault did not care to make such accusation upon insufficient ground moreover hesitated to accuse father of such crime therefore willingly agreed to postpone talk of adventure until mr hale return surrendered to pleasure of moment lover spent long morning in garden of love gathering rosebud herrick recommends must be culled in youth time flew by on golden wing hale be sooner gone way to medmenham than seemed to come back must not have be away for more than five minute a appeared to two enthralled by love for time have existence dream of love fled when hale came swiftly down path looking angry alarmed indeed perplexed cross have gone said impossible cried george starting to foot astonished left cross have gone repeated hale decisively cottage have be robbed burgled repeat cross have gone chapter iv family history after delivering message of woe mr hale sat down on garden seat under chestnut tree mechanically flicked dust from neat brown shoe with silk handkerchief be perfectly arrayed a usual on account of heat of day wore suit of spotless drill cool clean looking if clothes be cool certainly be not for usually colourless face be flushed deep red eye sparkled with anger lesbia who have risen with george looked at with compunction in heart after so thought ran have suspected father wrongly if have attacked george to regain unlucky cross assuredly must not now be lamenting loss yet if be innocent who be guilty considering few people who knew that ornament be in existence tim might be impossible to suspect tim burke who be soul of honesty well said hale crossly what be to be done looked directly at george who faced standing with look of perplexity on handsome face be sure that house have be robbed asked doubtfully mr hale shrugged shoulder usually say what mean remarked acridly took note to medmenham found local policeman conversing with mother servant from learned what have taken place indeed be telling constable when came up well seems pursued hale producing cigar jenny a be called yes yes broke in walker impatiently go on well then jenny rose morning to find window of drawing room wide open nothing be touched in room bedroom be ransacked thoroughly clothes be strewn about apparently pocket have be examined drawer be opened even bed have be overhauled there be sign of burglar jenny swears that sleeping at back of house heard nothing have be stolen asked lesbia hesitatingly only cross be sure absolutely gave note together with policeman who by way be bucolic idiot took to bedroom examined right hand drawer be open a be other drawer found that cross be missing jenny declared that nothing else have be taken of course girl be in great state of alarm a be sole person in house feared lest must be accused also very naturally be surprised at being away walker george nodded daresay be rarely that sleep away from home when do give notice humph sat down on grass opposite mr hale gripped ankle what do think sir hale made vague motion of despair what can think know a much a do nothing more must mind putting in witness box walker by mean ask what question desire will be counsel for defence said lesbia sitting down beside lover with rather wry smile appeared to that mr hale wished to recall offer to let marriage take place also that wished to get george into trouble if must how proposed to do so girl must not tell however be anxious listened with ear mr hale raised eyebrow at odd speech took further notice of be too much interested in examination lesbia said mr hale quietly gave cross yesterday evening in presence so to speak what did do with slipped into breast pocket said walker promptly rowed back to medmenham a saw on arriving placed for safety in drawer of dressing table then later a explained at breakfast came down to see lesbia be assaulted by unknown man did show cross to anyone say to jenny if have shown to jenny must not have mattered suspect honest girl like presume honest girl may yield to temptation of stealing such fine ornament a cross said hale drily however may set mind at rest if say that suspect jenny have stolen cross must not have have imagination to upset room leave window open so a to suggest burglary think again walker did show cross to anyone after leaving garden said george positively certainly did not be not voluntarily ah then one else did see said hale with satisfaction with marked eagerness come man speak up have almost forgotten said walker slowly perhaps blow on head made forget remember now remember what asked a eager a father that gipsy saw cross gipsy hale daughter glanced at one yes be walking up lane to home when passed gipsy encampment while doing so pulled out handkerchief cross have placed in breast pocket fell out handkerchief twitched suppose flashed down on grass glitter caught eye of man lounging near caravan came forward pointed out where have fallen a have not noticed whereabouts for moment by time picked up two three of gipsy have gathered round saw restore to pocket then thanked man went home lesbia clapped hand why be perfectly plain cried delighted that man must have assaulted on towing path to steal cross not finding on robbed house what do think father hale nodded think a do so best thing to be done will be to come see constable inspector here in marlow must have gipsy searched before go away encampment be still there morning saw sign of removal george leaped to foot yes must be so cried eagerly daresay man robbed cross being flamboyant be just thing must attract then must see inspector must get cross back be pity remained at cookham last night with sargent have be here must have gone at once to medmenham be midnight father care mere fact that walker here be assaulted must have proved to that cross be wanted since left at home thief must probably have burgled house might have caught red handed oh why did come home last night mr hale be genuinely moved over loss of ornament yet lesbia must not think that be mere sentimental attachment thereto a having belonged to dead wife made so downcast also in cross be of comparatively little value lesbia suspicion returned again dismissed a unworthy moreover if hale have assaulted george have committed burglary must not be so eager to set police on track whosoever be guilty at least must be innocent cold a father be to little affection a bore be agreeable to find that be honest though to be sure child expects to find parent above reproach perhaps sixth sense told lesbia that father be not must be in other way must guess how came to be so ready to think ill of up to present have suspected wrongly so be pleased hale young walker went to marlow police office explained in concert what have occurred officer in charge of station heard tale unmoved a be nothing more exciting than robbery by vagabond went with personally to medmenham there met village constable who presented report did not include reference to gipsy superior whose name be parson questioned learned that thief thief have left no trace behind on evidence of jenny maid have stolen nothing save cross parson then went to mr walker house questioned girl jenny be naturally much agitated be reassured by george who declared that one suspected must think not sir cried firing up growing red did even know that cross speak of be in house never showed to sir acknowledged walker truthfully certainly did not did see of gipsy lurking about house asked parson said jenny positively did not mr george went out for walk at ten o'clock lay down at half past never knew anything heard anything guessed anything when got up at seven a usual went to dust drawing room found window open did scare a thought mr george might have opened when got up knew that be not in house said hale alertly never did sir went to wake after found drawing room window open found that have be to bed room be upset too just a saw if 'd known be alone in cottage must have be scared out of life thought mr george came in late have gone to bed a usual nearly fainted can tell cried jenny tearfully fancy weak girl like being left alone with horrid gipsy down lane slept through never saw gipsy about when saw bedroom upset that mr george be there called in quain policeman be know if missus doe give notice when come back 'd have know that be respectable girl a doe rob anyone jenny have much more to say on subject to purpose so three men went to camp found vagrant making preparation to leave shortly be in middle of what promised to be free fight gipsy be most indignant at being accused for certain awe of police must certainly have come to blow with who doubted honesty man who have seen cross accounted for movement on previous night be in village public house until eleven so must not have assaulted walker on towing path afterwards be in bed in one of caravan a be deposed to by wife in fact member of particular tribe be mostly lovels from new forest proved that have nothing to do with assault burglary finally parson entirely beaten departed with other two men gipsy proceeded to move away in high state of indignation do really think that be innocent asked hale who surveyed procession of outgoing caravan with frown yes do said parson who be not going to be taught business by civilian so do struck in walker men who saw cross have accounted for whereabouts last night be not near mother house across river on towing path hale smiled drily have opinion of walker intelligence of mr parson possessed rogue vagabond a people be stand by one will swear to anything to keep one of number out of gaol put much faith in various alibi must have searched caravan officer men woman also suppose sir said parson quietly have warrant to do so let remind even gipsy have privilege under english law also if anyone of men be guilty must easily have passed cross to one of woman buried might have searched found nothing only to lay open to lecture from superior still began hale unwilling to surrender point of view let remind mr parson that let remind sir broke in officer stiffly that only ornament speak of be stolen if gipsy have broken into house must certainly have taken other thing again gipsy must have carried mr walker into parlour seeing that not one member of tribe be aware of existence much le where cottage be situated be ignorant on score having thus delivered with anger for supercilious demeanour of hale irritated parson strode away intimated curtly to two men a turned on heel that if heard of anything likely to elucidate mystery must communicate with also advised if found clue to see hale laughed at last request fancy see placing case in hand of such numskull george shook head if employ police who be to look into matter asked gravely answer be unexpected be said hale coldly decisively george stopped be walking back to marlow when conversation took place stared in amazement at companion why be very worst person in world to help said aghast to help mean remember promised to consent to marriage to lesbia only on condition that got back cross be not fault that cross be lost never said that be retorted hale tartly same will have to find return to before will agree to marriage with daughter must have be much better have handed over to last night daresay said george somewhat sulkily be not man to give up anything when demand be made in such tone a used besides see how can find cross please boy unless do lesbia marries sargent sargent blood rushed to walker cheek voice shook with indignation do mean to say that must give daughter to broken rake to worn out ta ta ta said hale in airy french fashion glad to see young man lose temper sargent be very good friend be brother officer when be in army must make lesbia excellent husband a be handsome well off amiable idiot gambler 'd better not let hear talk like walker laughed fear one let tell mr hale mr sargent captain sargent a call have right to call so be captain be not usually thought good manner to continue title after man have left army said george drily recovering temper saw must never have lost with hardened man like hale for instance call there there be enough walker cried elder man impatiently know term that cross consent otherwise lesbia marries sargent love will never obey cried lover desperately will find mean to compel consent said hale coldly surely mr walker have common sense at age sargent have money certain position have can make position then go do so when be rich highly placed can talk hale be a hard a iron a cold there seemed to be chance of getting what be wanted by appealing to tender feeling since have none whatsoever after swift reflection walker thought of something might make man change mind listen mr hale said when lesbia father be on point of moving away from conversation found unprofitable disagreeable did not intend to tell a engagement with lesbia be at stake will make clean breast of hale wheeled round with cold light in eye be going to confess that stole cross got up comedy to hide theft george laughed be not clever enough for be about possible fortune wish to speak one may come to through mother fortune hale flushed for only mention of money must touch hard nature never knew that mother have money have not now may have go on said hale seeing that young man hesitated watching with glittering eye have known mother for year never told that have money expected must not tell said walker bluntly so hesitated have business to interfere with mother affair however must speak since want to marry lesbia be attention grandfather left large fortune equally divided between two daughter one be mother husband father ran through lot leaving only trifle to live on help to keep said hale coldly already know what know be that aunt mother sister be ran away with unknown person during father lifetime be angry forgave on death bed left fair share of money be half a mother inherited fifty thousand there be equal amount in hand of mr simon jabez lawyer in lincoln inn field waiting for aunt must ever come back if doe not asked hale anxiously then if death can be proved money come to mother humph say aunt ran away with someone to marry man suppose what if there be child walker face fell child inherits said softly hale laughed harshly have found mare nest said coolly see reason to change decision with regard to possible marriage with lesbia aunt may be alive may appear to claim money if be dead child child may come forward on other hand if mother doe come in for fifty thousand pound speak of be a know hard woman agree with said young man moodily sadly be a hard a be mr hale if inherits grandfather money be aunt share have one to leave to be only child mother said hale deliberately be hard a say be be a sensible a be if marry against will will not leave one farthing of money after may never come into possession why must object to lesbia asked george when meet see how lovely be bah hale looked scornful talk like fool a if woman be ever moved by beauty of woman besides mother hate be old enemy rather than see marry daughter must go to funeral with joy if married against will a assuredly must in making lesbia wife must leave nothing also dislike match on account of mother why be enemy yours asked george bewildered be long story one intend to relate unless driven to speak if lesbia marries will lose two thousand year can give when die if want to drag girl love down to poverty mr walker then marry secretly tell that if make lesbia wife mother will help yet said that must make lesbia wife if found cross yes did say that still say if get cross will marry have two thousand year when die must be wiser for to leave lesbia alone marry marry whom asked george cheek flaming maud elli retorted hale with sneering laugh turned away chapter v mr walker opinion after one extraordinary adventure broke so remarkably monotony of george walker life thing went very smoothly for time be progressed in usual humdrum way be trying to young man ambitious spirit wanted to marry lesbia to make home for to attain position beauty must adorn saw mean of doing so went regularly to office earned small salary dreamed dream must never be realised at least there appeared to be chance of realisation what must man of moderate attainment with money friend hope to do in way of cutting figure in world mr walker duly returned home jenny gave highly coloured account of burglary heard in stern silence be tall grim woman with hard face stiff manner be invariably arrayed in plain black gown devoid of trimming hair still dark in spite of age be smoothed over temple in plain early victorian manner pale countenance be a smooth a of young girl that be gentlewoman must easily be seen manner be repellent suspicious also thin lip hard grey eye did not invite sympathy how such puritanical person ever came to have handsome gracious son such a george perplexed more than one person general opinion be that inherited look charm of manner from late father report credited honourable aylmer walker with more fascination than principle truth to tell posthumous reputation be better than have enjoyed when living having ascertained fact of burglary loss of amethyst cross mr walker held peace did not discus subject with son george indeed ventured upon lame explanation received in dead silence after hint given by mr hale young man be not desirous of disclosing engagement to lesbia discussion about stolen cross must inevitably lead to truth becoming known to mr walker sooner later knew that must have to speak postponed doing so until must see future more clearly if must only procure better post in city must then afford to keep lesbia in comparative comfort pas love in cottage existence until be in position to do so avoided confiding in mother also mr walker be not sympathetic mother must certainly not have encouraged young man love dream one evening mr walker unexpectedly broached subject at dinner be seven day after adventure of cross during time george have never set eye on lesbia several time have rowed a usual to garden foot have waited in vain for girl appearance inquiry at house provoked response a tim lesbia came to fast closed door george in despair have written to anxious letter have received no reply lesbia remained silent cottage barred bolted so george began to believe that hale have smuggled away daughter lest must elope with lover of whom so strongly disapproved state of uncertainty wore walker nerve thin lost appetite night rest mechanically went to tait office did daily work returned home again fretting time after girl who be beyond reach even tried to see mr hale that gentleman be conspicuous by absence never be lover in so dismal situation on especial evening george in evening dress faced silent mother at dinner table mr walker wore plain black silk gown perfectly cut wholly unadorned like mr hale always insisted upon certain style being observed dined so to speak in state tiny room be well furnished with remnant of former prosperity looked like abode of gentlewoman nothing must have be more perfect than table appointment if food be plain way in be served left nothing to be desired jenny neatly dressed waited deftly at conclusion of dinner placed decanter of port before george along with silver box of cigarette dainty silver spirit lamp a rule mr walker withdrew at moment to enjoy coffee in drawing room while george sipped wine trifled with cigarette on occasion remained can bring coffee here said to jenny in unemotional voice george wondered at departure from usual routine for mother have never broken domestic rule have instituted a far back a must remember however did not feel called upon to say anything poured out glass of port lighted cigarette when mr walker obtained coffee jenny have departed spoke to son through gathering twilight have received letter from mr hale said mr walker in coldest voice sat bolt upright with eye on comely blonde face of son what george flushed started laughed nervously be very strange said after pause mr hale have never written to before there be reason why must not have written to before a there be reason why writes to now may know reason asked george quietly inwardly anxious certainly mr walker be disagreeable excessively polite a never forgot manner whatever provocation in fact have waited to explain think have better tell story first what story that of engagement to lesbia hale of cross be stolen from cottage what george rose restlessly grew redder than ever know know everything said mother imperiously mr hale be annoyed by way in be haunting marlow cottage have asked to use influence with to stop annoyance be quite likely rejoined george fuming decline to give up lesbia mr hale know that know apparently that be obstinate foolish said mr walker in chilly manner a infatuation for be nothing else can lead to nothing must ask to stop hopeless visit mother if knew lesbia know that lesbia be daughter of man whom despise hate said mr walker moved to cold anger son will never marry have not power to stop marriage said george quietly be quite true have money to threaten disinheritance legal power over man who be of age might indeed appeal to affection fear that must be useless george flung cigarette out of window thrust hand moodily into pocket affection be strange word to use between remarked bitterly have always be strict straightforward painfully polite have given good education have instructed in good manner home looked round rather home permit to share pardon george forget that contribute to domestic economy of home such a be go on mean cried george desperately for manner chilled that have never be mother to in accepted sense of word have done duty said mr walker without flinching duty duty what be duty when wanted love have lived in freezing atmosphere have nearly changed into statue can wonder sought out someone to love perhaps not since be young foolish regret that someone must be girl can not possibly receive a daughter in law what do mean by demanded george sharply nothing detrimental to girl replied mr walker calmly may have beauty in world virtue probably have in eye be walter hale daughter so can not be mine why do hate mr hale mother said mr walker sitting very upright be private business when interferes with happiness can not help that said rigorously what be past be past what be dead be dead understand mean that must must point out that association with girl have already led into danger have be assaulted robbed have come into contact with police be always undesirable renounce lesbia george lest worse befall robbery assault be mystery none le be dangerous can explain more than can mr hale be dangerous person to knowledge tell what know interpolated son said mr walker with iron determination must do good to break silence of year can say be that will never marry girl with consent if do without chafed george irritably then will never set eye on again returned mr walker quietly mother woman calmly finished coffee rose noiselessly time may come when can explain said in precise voice meanwhile can only command implore whichever please to leave girl alone go no more to marlow cottage see why must obey blindly cried george angrily at least give reason for objection to lesbia have given be daughter of walter hale be sin of father whatever may be to be visited upon child mother quoting bible will not alter determination said mr walker absolutely cold impassive must do a request be prepared to see more mother can not explain about mysterious cross refuse to mean can not know nothing about cross about assault made on indeed about burglary do know be that mr hale be dangerous man be connected with dangerous people what have occurred prof surely think that mr hale be connected with mystery think nothing because know nothing moved swiftly forward placed slim hand on son broad shoulder be wise give up girl wife who be waiting for will suit better george grew crimson wife stammered maud elli mr tait niece love have told so if marry will bring money uncle will forward interest to morrow be stopping for week end at mr tait house before return here on monday ask maud to be wife will hing of sort said george fiercely how can propose to one girl when love maud elli adores george know doe seems conceited to say so be quite aware of adoration like be rich handsome rest of marriage with mean getting on in office same hesitated then finished sentence with rush love lesbia so there be more to be said mr walker removed hand glided to door again cold self quite agree with said exasperatingly cool however know determination act a please affection called out george a opened door must give way to commonsense when alone young man dropped into chair looked moodily at disordered dinner table be very much to be pitied for having mother of warm affectionate nature george hungered for object upon to expend love mr walker have always be granite image unapproachable chill doubt be fond of handsome son in own cold way have never given maternal love craved for be small wonder that boy have gone afield to find satisfaction for craving lesbia supplied want on side found same joy a lover in mutual affection mr hale in way be a cold repellent to a mr walker be to son yet two people not giving longed for love to child be trying to rob hungry heart of spiritual sustenance dog in manger attitude did not commend to george felt that lesbia be severely alone conscious only of other environed by mystery must understand mr hale must explain so must mr walker explanation be volunteered george did not know where to look for elucidation of several attitude mr walker certainly professed ignorant of amethyst cross mystery apparently spoke truly a dislike to match with lesbia appeared to be wholly based upon hatred of walter hale that hatred have to do with hale past of george knew a little a did of past of mother hale knew something about cross accounted for extraordinary behaviour although declared that did not know who have stolen george be also greatly perplexed to know who have taken to marlow cottage while be insensible sitting in chair with eye on ground frowningly perplexed with problem be of use so brushed aside trouble after changing evening dress for boating flannel went to river hoped by exercise to rid of phantom so indistinct yet so real having launched boat settled to work george spun down stream current own effort carrying along with what

advantage of such law order to prevent daughter from marrying man disapprove of why do object to discussed that before gave answer also if will remember gave chance of having thing own way be desire that lesbia must marry friend sargent if will recover lost cross for will permit marriage with ca find cross growled george sullenly then ca marry lesbia replied hale very distinctly a be forcing to

of be also pale in fact sargent looked like sheet of paper prepared for sketching must have painted upon background of character wished to represent provided be not strong one contrast between washed

must have be interested to hear that sargent also be seeking for mysterious ornament to hale appeared to attach such value captain looked at friend curiously why do want cross so much asked that business what have to do be to find in turn mr hale went away leaving sargent caressing moustache in perplexity presently everyone went to dinner be banquet delicately cooked splendidly served tait be quite devoted to pleasure of table paid chef large salary food be perfect wine flowed freely so that by time guest repaired to drawing room everyone be in best of spirit house party be large one a there be about twenty people present not one of must have be acceptable in sunday school there be lady belonging to smart set perfectly respectable from worldly point of view who cared for nothing save bridge dress flirtation pleasure there be also men with title many with brain of speculative money making order tait be not entirely in society by reason of wealth public position a philanthropist hovered on fringe of helped social butterfly to make money on stock exchange lent sum large small to lady who must advance in mayfair belgravian circle be always open to consider scheme promised to bring in cash thus house party be composed of heterogeneous mass of people good bad titled untitled gay grave general air of restlessness prevailed in splendid mansion one appeared to

ardent gambler sat down to bridge few restless spirit went to dance group gathered round young man at piano who sang latest comic song there be plenty of champagne together with cigar cigarette of best so fun waxed fast furious a hour drew on to midnight everyone grew more le excited within bound of course a maud elli be too clever to permit henley palace to earn name for neronian extravagance entertainment just paused on verge of orgy under maud skilful management did not over step mark that young lady have be watching george night although did not speak to again towards twelve o'clock found near rallied on pensive air don quixote in love said in airy manner then lowered voice impressively meet in picture gallery at three o'clock said for lesbia sake chapter vii after midnight have george be more of man of world must have wholly mistrusted maud must have declined invitation to meet in picture gallery in small hour of sunday morning must not have be credited by judge of human nature one woman must make such appointment with man loved to plead cause of rival to give helping hand to bring about marriage be dead against feeling of heart george in spite of year virile look be unsophisticated man who must not guess what be below surface be kind of society tender foot perhaps in measure constituted charm in eye of miss elli who have experience enough to fit out dozen men at least two woman at event although wondered that liking for a termed have lapsed so suddenly yet determined to keep appointment to listen to scheme might propose likely to accomplish marriage with lesbia in way be strong men twisted to feminine purpose by woman from samson downwards man have be sufficiently cunning to get better of delilah there be therefore excuse for george attention be drawn from own thought by lively discussion going on between mr tait three four lady with sprinkling of men a be now long after midnight people have retired to bed others be preparing to follow tait be night bird who liked to stay up a long a possible probably because a robber of widow orphan pillow must have have thorn to entertain guest who remained wakeful especially feminine portion thereof mentioned that have lately come into possession of wonderful jewel famous rather infamous demi mondaine of paris have sold of course lady be more than anxious to see gem on account of beauty value because of celebrity of former owner one clamoured for sight of a mr tait have purposely stimulated curiosity to keep from retiring be not unwilling to gratify wish therefore led way to picture gallery pointed out small narrow door at end of there be safe said proudly rather strong room queer place for safe drawled sargent with shrug for reason safer be friend here tait glanced round graciously looked more like silenus than ever so mind revealing whereabouts of twenty thousand pound worth of jewel thief must dream that safe be here even if did added stockbroker drawing out watch chain safe can not be opened save by key might be broken open george ventured to remark tait laughed in jolly manner must take cleverest thief in london to break into safe there be only two key to open have one on watch chain maud niece have other guest looked at one have not tait be flushed with wine excitement must not have be thus free in speech be not man who talked at large a rule lateness of hour presence of many people light music gambling wine chatter have unloosened usually cautious tongue maud frowned when uncle spoke so rashly a thought that be fool to do so certainly there be one present who must have broken open safe since everyone be respectable even if a word go rackety same revelation of whereabouts of safe information so guilelessly supplied be risky to say least of miss elli shook head at venturesome uncle say too much remarked in low voice even safe may not be strong enough to withstand burglar of new school well care cried stockbroker recklessly inserting key into lock jewel be insured come lady can all feast eye a have bought gem to sell again be open to offer said jokingly yet meant to sell if must of guest drew back rather annoyed a thought that mr tait be going too far in importing city manner into house party maud ever watchful again whispered to uncle shook off entered strong room now open to bring out jewel when box contained be placed on near table content be displayed thought of tait bad manner disappeared in amazement delight at sight of precious stone be truly beautiful many be set in tiara bracelet ring chain locket in various ornament for hair corsage other stone lay loose glittering to be arranged used a required there be diamond sapphire ruby emerald many inferior gem whole forming dazzling heap made mouth water with avarice for tait estimate present be good judge of jewel must have deemed radiant pile worth twice amount mentioned try on lady said genial stockbroker try on be friend here placed tiara on head of niece who stood near with frown on face began to think that uncle be crazy to display wealth in reckless manner in few moment of female guest be glittering with jewel surveying delightedly in hand mirror have be brought by tait order stockbroker with cynical smile looked at avaricious face listened with sneering pleasure to delighted little scream gave at interval jewel have much greater effect on woman than on men there be not woman present must have gone great length for sake of possessing even one of ornament gretchen be not only woman who must be lured by glitter of gem be so much superior to mere gleam of gold tait amidst splendour looked more like mammon than ever early hour of morning pleasure came to end in fifteen minute lady taking off jewel restored to owner tait be really glad to get back counted carefully for look in eye of of lady actually frightened half thought that must run away with treasure however made sure that one of ornament have be given back replaced in box deposited in safe after that guest went to bed gallery with strong room carefully locked be left in silence darkness sleep of many be disturbed by thought of nibelung treasure so near at hand yet so impossible to obtain george be indifferent to gem a thought that lesbia eye be brighter much more beautiful left gallery while tait be displaying hoard retired to very comfortable bedroom maud care have provided a mere clerk must not have have such luxurious surroundings indeed have be in splendid house at loved must not do enough for therefore george be housed like king after manner of youth took comfort easily never occurred to that in humble position have right to be pampered petted by right of good look delightful manner have hitherto gone through world very much spoiled by fair sex therefore took everything a right while waiting for three to strike from stable clock be now two seated before fire lighting pipe gave up to dream of lesbia in one way be determined to make wife be difficult to see how proposed to keep on small salary particularly when much of same salary be required to support mother that george indulged in rosy dream of youth have profound belief in kindness of fortune must have dismissed proposed marriage a impossibility hale be against so be sargent mother did not approve of marriage there be maud elli to be considered more hopeful man may well have be despondent not george felt sure that everything must come right that life be fairy tale in fated prince who be carried off lovely princess who of course be lesbia be in enchanted castle so glorified rose cottage watched by two dragon canning mr petty helped also by faithful dwarf by name tim burke finally there be mr hale a wicked magician to be reckoned with perhaps maud might act a malignant fairy somehow marriage must be brought about in way sufficient money must be provided so that prince princess must live happily ever afterwards lesbia must not have thought in comfortable fashion in face of such obstacle a barred way to altar then be much more practical than lover in spite of fact that dwelt in seclusion while battled in work day world then a george fondly imagined have discovered few hour previously maud elli be not wicked fairy after rather be about to play agreeable part of fairy godmother bring together two lover parted by adverse circumstance when maud afterwards thought of trust george placed in wondered at folly have contempt for upright character must estimate human nature so highly george never doubted for one moment that appointment be made in good faith for express purpose of helping suit with lesbia therefore waited impatiently for striking of clock only once did cross mind a odd that maud must choose that hour that meeting place to forward interest since must easily have spoken to in convenient place at becoming hour in morning brushed thought aside a unworthy of kind heart when hour of three chimed out opened door softly slipped out to keep appointment george have stayed so frequently at henley mansion that knew way to picture gallery exceedingly well also be mr tait hobby to have corridor many of room lighted in subdued manner night prevented burglary declared certainly sight of illuminated house must daunt who prefer to work in darkness only by light of bull eye george therefore found in soft glow when emerged from bedroom stole on tip toe towards head of stair here descended took way towards back of house to picture gallery portion of great mansion be not lighted seemed odd remembering what mr tait said about light scaring burglar seeing also that safe be placed here be stockbroker whim george found long gallery in darkness a have entered by door placed directly in middle of halted there doubtfully must see light save what filtered through sky light did not know where maud waited for at far end of gallery be double glass door leading down step into garden be usually shuttered at night george noted with surprise by gleam of starlight came through on special night shutter have not be put up be strange considering valuable be concealed in safe then a young man reflected be also strange that tait must place treasure house at other end of gimcrack gallery must be so easily broken into after on authority of poe tale of purloined letter more unlikely place in valuable be hidden safer be not one of london fraternity of thief must believe that wary stockbroker must be so foolish a to place safe strong room treasure house liked to call in locality therefore creature of night must come to rob there be considerable method in tait apparent madness after george have scanty time for such reflection a hour be swiftly moving towards dawn yet have to converse with maud eye grew more accustomed to semi darkness of gallery glanced up down to see if must espy darker form of girl at moment heard clink of metal upon metal sound came from direction of strong room a turned gaze thereto suddenly saw vivid stream of light proceeding apparently from bull eye in flash struck that strong room be being burgled almost without thinking uttered loud cry sprang forward to lay hand on thief light disappeared a raced up when within measurable distance of safe stumbled over body motionless on floor be that of woman a walker must tell by drapery mechanically clutched in fall before must pick up two dark form dashed past towards glass door george anxious only to lay hand on thief ran down gallery at heel left woman where be intruder easily opened double door evidently have be left ajar george followed saw two men

firing up on instant tait shook bullet head scowled with little pig eye jewel be worth twenty thousand pound retorted care if be worth twenty million said george turning pale for realised employer meaning know nothing about be in gallery when came down to gallery because heard noise interrupted walker furiously told police story told did best to catch thief now have audacity to accuse exactly accuse look very like must admit that conduct be suspicious protested stockbroker admit nothing of sort people wander about house after everyone be in bed without reason snapped tait with searching glance george bore scrutiny without flinching have explained how came to be wandering about declared proudly be sitting by fire on hearing suspicious noise came down with what result know how dare accuse tell again that accuse vociferated tait crossly have acted foolishly to say least of how else must have acted on hearing noise must have aroused have done so must not have be in time to see thief what good did do by seeing since have escaped be added tait slowly if there be two men stop threw up fat hand a young man be about to speak angrily be use going round bush may be innocent may not be story may be true may be reverse mr tait george held temper under by mere force of will why must rob stockbroker opened pig eye why demanded in amazement do not know that be desperately poor

to be innocent said stockbroker confounded by frankness of story maud arose indignantly man love can never be guilty cried george blushed rosy red saw that have not behaved over well to brave girl who have so cleverly exonerated although really have reason to accuse of duplicity towards in confused way felt that be heaping coal of fire on head be more drawn to than have ever be before here indeed be friend worth having with lesbia a wife maud a friend life must indeed be joyous in innocence never struck young man that male can drive in double harness in tandem fashion two woman who love thought that maud having discovered that true meaning of love be sacrifice behaved thus because of newly acquired knowledge thank miss elli said simply look implied volume more tait be displeased have grudge against george whom liked well enough did not like solution of mystery to be thus upset mean well maud said at length have shielded walker very cleverly same can not accept explanation miss elli rose in alarm uncle do mean that will have mr walker arrested when know that be innocent for mother sake will not do said elder man if mr walker will give back jewel will not dismiss from office

where to find stalked out of room with head in air maud elli looked after with hungry look heaved deep sigh when door closed within hour george have asked permission of inspector to leave house obtained whatever guest believed police apparently thanks to maud report accepted a wholly guiltless person gave address to officer so that might be called a witness in event of thief being brought to book then shook dust of splendid henley mansion from foot be glad to get away for several people looked at askance evidently there be uneasy feeling that knew more than must confess one hinted openly that be concerned in robbery be merely thought that presence in gallery required more reasonable explanation than weak one of having heard noise still george must not help feeling that be suspected by guest servant be gall wormwood to proud young man that must be case walker carried portmanteau down to river a have rowed up to henley from medmenham be now late in afternoon with heavy heart prepared to launch boat return news that have to take to mother be unwelcome wondered how must receive information that have left tait office mr walker circumstance be very desperate a income be so small greatly depended upon son earnings present phase of thing must be worse than ever george winced a contemplated coming interview just a be about to step into boat mr hale cigar in mouth sauntered up addressed walker be in mood for conversation must have pushed off with curt nod that elder man uttered sentence made pause indignantly so tait did have arrested walker said mr hale cruelly george turned pale looked straight at speaker if be not lesbia father said quietly must fling into river for word quite believe must must rejoined hale looking admiringly at splendid figure of young man will not make more innocent if be guilty if mr tait believed to be guilty must have be arrested long since said walker with effort mere fact that be permitted to leave house show that be considered guiltless tait be always absurdly good natured said hale coolly again risking plunge into river george looked at again believe that stole jewel asked of course do made lame excuse for being in gallery

took up oar pushed off into midstream hale lingered on bank still scoffing will tell lesbia everything walker called out mr hale clearly slowly will never marry now dear burglar unhappy lover pulled swiftly down stream with last word ringing in ear must indeed trust lesbia to continue engagement in face of being accused of sordid crime knew that loved a dearly a loved must go through fire water to prove love same there be something so mean contemptible about stealing from friend house that even great love might not be proof against father story george clenched teeth pulled for dear life in order to control emotion must hing in face of have taken place save wait patiently trusting in tait friendship for mother in maud loyalty knew that must not be disgraced openly idea lesbia might believe guilty be desperately hard to bear still loved trusted in love be must do for glance around showed that be helpless amidst black circumstance have so suddenly environed mr walker bald blunt tale from george said very little in reply not even when declared that have thrown up situation did rebuke on contrary rather applauded a son said stern cold woman must hing else then believe that be guilty mr walker looked at scornfully relation a mother son have never be sentimental said quietly must know better than to ask that thank mother said george simply for such speech meant much from spartan woman who be usually so reticent want thanks for being just remarked coldly what have to do be to clear name by searching for thief how be to do leave to own cleverness meanwhile will see mr jabez get to advance sufficient to live on until name be cleared have got situation a to girl lesbia give up never never never said george mother looked at coldly disapprovingly left in silence matter

similar tactic treatment on lesbia be met so firmly put in place so quietly that being coward at heart a bully be left girl a severely alone a be possible while executing mr hale instruction be to keep strict eye on daughter to prevent intrusion of george walker mr petty after several rebuff contented by watching from afar managed by always being on spot when lesbia least expected to fulfil

about be shortly after canning departure that hale returned from henley with story made lesbia write write willingly letter of dismissal have broken walker heart after sent away father patted shoulder spoke kindly to be now acting a sensible girl said with chill politeness there be longer need for mr petty to remain know that like so will send away evening canning have also gone will not return thing can revert to original course can manage house along with tim remember lesbia that if heart softens towards scamp will recall shadow mr petty to watch over lesbia with white face set lip looked straight at father will write to george again will see said with stifled sob say about guilt remember that believe be innocent then why not stick by asked father cruelly know well enough why why can not george be now entire stranger must remain so until mystery of burglary be cleared up will never be cleared up because there be nothing to clear up said father calmly george stole jewel of tait for sake be only tait friendship for mother maud kind heart prevented walker being arrested condemned a thief lesbia lip curled mistrust miss elli kind heart said hale shrugged thin shoulder can do what like about that remarked carelessly remember that hold george in hollow of hand have to do be to forget marry sargent said lesbia positively will never see george again since circumstance be too strong for for will never marry captain sargent be sure of that love love say more father what say stand by said much before have not held by retorted hale temper rising circumstance may prove too much for however sargent can wait so can meanwhile since have dismissed young fool be free to come go a desire one moment said lesbia a father turned on heel what about amethyst cross hale wheeled round with colour in parchment cheek suspicious look in cold grey eye what do mean declared that if george recovered cross must marry hold to since be not man to go back on word how can marry george when say that can prove be guilty of burglary maud elli can prove not returned mr hale paused bit lip hard believe in face of walker new escapade that know who took cross former behaviour may have be sham a be acting in gallery let bring cross perhaps after may be able to marry will never marry until character be cleared said lesbia firmly hale shrugged shoulder again will find difficult to clear dear sneered went away mr hale must have spoken rightly in connection with le determined girl lesbia for fragile look be very determined also very much in love with george walker appearance be against judging by circumstantial evidence certainly be guilty lesbia must not bring to believe that man loved have sunk to being common thief now that be free to leave cottage wander whither must be easy matter to seek out george at medmenham ask direct question lesbia did not do because father have detailed fully that walker have said that have done so there be more to learn in quarter moreover hale have stated with sneer maud elli be desperately in love with young man lesbia recalled george hesitation about speaking of desire to leave tait office there be other thing to be considered walker have said then have blushed now girl knew intuitively that referred to maud elli lesbia face grew flushed angry a thought of rival trusted george who be very own instinctively knew wile of woman dreaded lest letter of dismissal must throw young man into arm of stockbroker niece thus came about lesbia meditation led not to mr walker cottage at medmenham to splendid mansion at henley where maud elli be waiting for george to come to maud have learned from mr hale george have received letter of dismissal from lesbia so waited to catch on recoil must certainly come back to who have so boldly stood by when have be accused a day went by george did not come be heart grew sick for be honestly in love uncle be absent in city still seeking for lost jewel local police together with couple of detective from scotland yard be doing best to solve mystery effort be in vain trace have be found of thief jewel must not be recovered tait invited no more people to henley mansion remained great deal in london grumbling over loss maud must have gone up also that waited vainly at home in hope that george must come to for consolation one afternoon while be thus waiting have arrayed in prettiest frock on chance of visit footman intimated that young lady wished to see have card said footman have simply stated that name be miss lesbia hale maud eye flashed when heard name of rival ordered man to lead guest at once to long drawing room miss elli be desperately anxious to see face have captured heart of george walker before repairing to drawing room altered few thing about dress for being very much woman knew that be about to meet dangerous foe man must not notice dress overmuch woman must at very first glance maud be determined that there must be flaw in armour so far a frock frill went lesbia very pale quite calm waited impatiently for appearance of miss elli when young lady sailed into room with outstretched hand beaming smile lesbia rose with stony face cold distant manner maud hand fell when saw that be being kept at distance became formal also in heart grew angry when saw lesbia beauty for being very sensible knew that own look be much inferior shade passed over face soon be replaced by malicious smile maud knew that beauty beauty held trump card must win game at leisure lesbia saw that smile know why look like said abruptly maud straightened neat figure raised sandy eyebrow what very strange speech to make at first meeting miss hale said coldly superciliously ah retorted lesbia see that be not used to society be there occasion to tell that asked maud sweetly lesbia be too desperately in earnest to be daunted by such feline talk there be occasion to tell many thing said be there need for beating about bush father have told everything about what may ask about burglary about george george miss elli raised eyebrow again george repeated have right to call so rejoined lesbia hotly be engaged to miss elli be engaged understand yes lesbia suddenly looked fatigued must have dearly liked to sit down pride prevented maud saw scratched again wo sit down thank replied lesbia stiffening be only here for few minute can say have to say in time miss elli flicked scented handkerchief across lip to hide smile looked searchingly at visitor white face really know why talk to like oh yes do in same way knew why smiled when entered think that can win game sha what game game play for george father have told love george love also father seems to be very well informed sneered maud flushing usually be lesbia assured with great coolness be only when father told about burglary learned loved george do love cried maud defiantly see that matter to now matter great deal said lesbia coldly be only unsophisticated girl miss elli intend to give up man love without struggle understand that have given up for time being until can force to prove innocence force miss elli raised eyebrow for third time face grew angry for did not like very straight speaking what have to do with matter believe that george be innocent told uncle so indeed have not stood up for george must now be in gaol lesbia smiled contemptuously be part of game retorted be woman not man miss hale can see very plainly how george walked into trap set for set trap if george say george say nothing have not seen for long time father told how george be in gallery also did tell that george came to meet asked maud maliciously do believe then did be lie said lesbia impolitely very firmly believe ask george cried maud will tell that have meeting at three in morning lesbia who be looking at gave ironical laugh oh believe now said slowly can see truth in eye yes george did meet by appointment why know because loved never loved cried furiously looked so angry that maud hastily stepped back pace thinking must be struck love only inveigled into gallery into trap made use of burglary to force to be husband told uncle that george be innocent yes because suited book to do so told father passed message on to that if did not dismiss george must prove guilt maud tore handkerchief to ribbon can too said between teeth be quite right to world must say nothing to can say what please love same man want be going to get did trap george into meeting burglary be unforeseen can make use of let remind miss hale have not done yet remember be chloroformed key be taken from neck to open safe what must be easier than for to declare that george walker asked to meet in gallery rendered insensible stole jewel after taking key buried in garden coming back to tell falsehood if speak wo speak will speak rather than let george marry flashed out maud lesbia sneered remind of motto of french revolution said brother will kill ' so george be to marry go to gaol exactly thank lesbia moved swiftly to door now that know intention can go what will do maud followed aghast at abrupt departure prove george innocence marry try said maud between teeth try fail chapter x deus ex machina if lesbia have be trifle more versed in way of wicked world must have remained longer in conversation with maud if only to learn about lady plan maud declared that unless george became husband must have put into gaol for burglary be difficult to know how intended to proceed of course must declare that walker have chloroformed have stolen key of strong room to steal jewel have one to prove truth of story plausible a be in face of walker known presence in picture gallery be george word against maud therefore law must have easy matter to prove young man supposed guilt lesbia be so hot with indignation at discovery of maud mean plot that ended interview abruptly walked quickly away trying to stifle rage for george sake be necessary that must keep clear head be necessary also that must learn truth of conspiracy a verily believed to be come what might lesbia decided in own mind that george must marry to bring about have not only to clear character to find amethyst cross restore to father where cross might be must not guess mystery of robbery of george presence in cottage on fatal night have never be cleared up walking swiftly down to river lesbia thought over thing thought still more when entered tim boat little man have rowed up to henley at request took back same way have detailed reason for visiting miss elli have received scanty comfort from tim be disposed to take gloomy view of matter be crass bad luck to groaned tim when told how badly have fared sure there be nivir bin moment pace sinse be lost be very true rejoined lesbia steering boat towards lock reviewing in own mind untoward circumstance have disturbed life since proposal of george in garden from time when cross have be given to there have be nothing incessant trouble father have raged lover have be assaulted liberty have be curtailed george have lost situation through being accused of sordid crime to crown woman of whose existence have scarcely heard have stepped in to claim walker a future husband be very true sighed lesbia dolefully cross have brought nothing trouble if must get back again thing might mend question be how to recover tim bent to oar shook head with groan let bide miss let bide sure want more kick ups mother rist sowl towld that crass wud bring lashins av worry whin guv off av yer hand ' be truth spoke dear do know where got cross tim sure miss ' did tell ye whin died 't be yer mother know more that dear 't be mother a for masther garge cud ye forgit miss cried lesbia indignantly will love george a long a live can no more forget than can forget must have marry captain sargent sure ' wud be proud baste if ye married dear 'd be afther bringing to gallows for treatmint av ye miss lesbia then let talk more about matter cried lesbia impetuously will keep faith with george wud ye like to see miss said girl promptly told in letter that must never meet again will until mystery of burglary be cleared up intend to clear up how miss ye have wan to help ye lesbia reflected there be shadow said quietly ' what wud poor cratur be afther doing miss know offered to help so will put profession of gratitude to test tim to night must go down to cookham bring back with augh groaned tim annoyed that anyone must do anything for darling sure be out av house so let bide dear if go to cookham will said lesbia firmly ' have trouble wid baste av captain dear will go tim be a good a word lesbia reached cottage to find that father have left note saying have gone to london for few day hale be always stealing off on mysterious errand possibly connected with equally mysterious business of late odd character have be coming to cottage hale be absent much more frequently on occasion absence be welcome a gave lesbia chance of arranging plan with canning what might be have a yet very clear idea intended to do be to explain situation ask shadow what be best to be done when received opinion must then take step forward into veiling mist surrounded while tim rowed down to cookham did after landing lesbia at bottom of garden girl ran into cottage found that have to herself a true to promise mr hale have dismissed mr petty good lady liking easy place have retired in high dudgeon must have shown fight that hale quelled with glance of cold grey eye hale indeed possessed great power perhaps hypnotic power over who came to cottage have not canning fallen sick thus have be removed from influence be very questionable if must have offered service to lesbia however have done so girl be about to accept gratefully lesbia passed time in dressing for dinner in partaking of be homely meal consisting of cold meat salad bread cheese glass of prime claret afterwards lesbia made cup of black coffee sat down in tiny drawing room with book pending arrival of shadow thought wandered from printed page to george more than ever longed for coming have cost her much to write letter of dismissal in face of maud threat a conveyed to by hale must hing else worst of be that have not be permitted to assign cause for what george must regard a heartless behaviour however very luckily have scanty time for sad reflection for shortly heard hearty voice of tim a entered house by back door later sibilant whisper of shadow in few minute canning presented looking more lean more dismal than ever in customary suit of black haggard face be lighted up with eager smile mere fact that lesbia have decided to avail herself of service made a gay a such sad personage well must be canning be desperately anxious to repay kindness have received be glad to see said cordially lost time miss whispered grim man who stood with long hanging arm at door captain sargent went to london to day with father came back with tim at once be so glad want to help miss need help very badly sighed lesbia passing hand across brow will not sit down canning in presence miss please excuse be yet weak after illness sit down want to thus urged shadow sank softly on to extreme edge of convenient chair placed near door here fixed sad eye on beautiful vision at window adored in silence lesbia turned matter over in mind knew that must have to speak very plainly have natural reluctance to doing so since canning be servant stranger still be sole person who must help a now that george be out of life temporarily at event felt very lonely father neither gave affection desired certainly must not put out hand to save george much le clear character why must when wanted walker out of way so that daughter must marry sargent lesbia thought of thing with eye on floor finally determined to confess everything a plight that of george be too desperate to permit of over nice feeling with colour therefore related whole story from time walker have proposed to result of visit to maud be forced to dismiss mr walker said in addition because father came back to tell that miss elli have threatened to have mr walker arrested saw miss elli also a have told declares that can prove mr walker guilt will do so unless marries canning with sad eye fixed upon heard whole tale without comment at end nodded what do wish to do miss want to learn who committed burglary at mr tait house so mr walker can be cleared how can do miss when be servant to captain sargent have duty to consider know lesbia faltered became downcast then have experience in looking into thing be sorry can not help did not say that miss then will shadow reflected did not take eye from eager face yes said at length will help oh canning thank so much how ca say yet miss in first place must leave captain sargent lesbia rose impulsively want to lose situation have intended to give captain notice long ago explained canning rising in turn what say decides will go to london in one way may be able to learn who stole jewel why in london be stolen at henley quite so two thief if mr walker be to be believed there be two must have taken jewel to dispose of in london leave everything to miss be in inquiry office once know how to go about matter hesitated will require money oh lesbia uttered ejaculation of dismay have none ca father give miss lesbia shook head want to marry captain sargent so will not allow to help mr walker father will give nothing what be to be done know miss have money must have at least fifty pound to work on will learn about burglary first then will discover who knocked down mr walker stole cross paused have tim saved money poor soul sighed lesbia father never pay wage be sure must lend money if have there be one from whom can borrow here sudden idea came to girl flushed crimson with mingled hope nervous fear oh cried might might who might miss asked man sharply lesbia took notice fifty pound murmured be large sum of money still might stopped again a saw shadow looking at curiously go away canning return to morrow evening hope to have fifty pound by then miss canning spoke slowly impressively have honoured with confidence will never regret doing so a be entirely devoted to add to confidence by telling from whom design to borrow fifty pound there be reason why must not know said lesbia quickly be thinking of lord charvington mr hale cousin oh know that cried surprised yes shadow laughed in whispering silent way rather oddly know more than give credit for see added slowly with downcast face be at school with father charvington lesbia gasped in astonishment stared at lean dusky untidy figure before then remembered scrupulous refinement of man noted anew excellent diction suddenly saw in weird face figure evidence of good breeding mr canning said suddenly gave new position at once be gentleman be gentleman replied bitterly dropping use of word miss now be captain sargent valet wastrel be also very devoted servant miss hale bowed let remain at how did come to ask ask said canning hurriedly day will learn how came to occupy position meanwhile get fifty pound from charvington lesbia noted that spoke quite a equal of nobleman give to will save lover make path straight for can do mr canning answered simply good night miss hale please tell tim have mentioned say nothing to charvington to morrow night will come for fifty paused opened closed hand several time then vanished with sigh might indeed have be veritable shadow from noiseless way in disappeared lesbia remained spell bound in flash occurred to that must long ago have guessed that shadow be other than appeared to be many thing have puzzled became plain wondered how gentleman have sunk so low a to be spy to occupy position of sargent valet have too much delicacy to question canning until such time a chose of own free will to speak out besides have much to think about in connection with proposed borrowing of fifty pound from lord charvington unless must procure that sum there must be chance of george being saved from clutch of maud elli nobleman in question be cousin of mr hale have once twice be to cottage indeed lesbia have reason to believe that lord charvington allowed father certain sum quarter although seemed strange in face of hale assertion that must give two thousand year if married to liking there be also business in city about lesbia knew nothing why must man in business accept annuity be very strange then everything connected with mr walter hale be strange now that lesbia began to think began to mistrust father why did keep business secret why did accept annuity then declare that must give large income why did have such shady people at cottage whom scarcely permitted to see altogether lesbia became aware that there be something sinister about father position felt like watcher of black cloud waiting for to discharge lightning more than ever did determine at least to have mystery of burglary of cross cleared up old time of peace have passed away for girl now felt that must have to go forth do battle with regard to charvington knew moderately well have always be kind to have heard father state that nobleman be godfather seemed rather cool to apply to for loan of fifty pound lesbia be not only desperate also very unsophisticated in worldly way almost without considering what be about wrote hurried letter asking to lend fifty pound for six month promised to explain later why desired loan proposed in own mind to repay money by selling amethyst cross when canning must get back for a believed must of course whole business be very naive very childish girl more versed in worldly thing must never have ventured to take step lesbia just like trusting child asked for money posted letter with prayer that god must grant request like newly fledged gambler who win game through sheer ignorance lesbia desperately played card turned up trump in four twenty hour lord charvington sent cheque by return of post invited to come explain matter to personally lesbia danced with joy now said to herself george be safe thank god chapter xi seamy side when mr hale returned in three day from london be surprised to find lesbia extremely cheerful have right to be since have given fifty pound cheque to canning be now in town looking into matter of henley burglary how canning managed to get away from master so expeditiously lesbia must not tell did inquire be quite enough for to know that shadow be searching into case to lord charvington have sent letter thanking for money promising to come over tell everything a soon a must thing made hopeful bright in spite of enforced severance from george managed by looking towards bright future to posse soul in patience hale be ignorant of what be doing behaviour puzzled thought loved walker said abruptly with suspicion of course do rejoined girl cheerfully doe not seem like lesbia shrugged shoulder what be use of cry over spilt milk asked going about with long face will not make george position more endurable day when character have be cleared thing will change will never change said mr hale coldly severely walker have committed sordid crime can never marry believe that be guilty retorted lesbia deliberately even if grant for sake of argument that be miss elli doe not seem to think that guilt be bar to marriage with be love sick fool so be with difference that can marry ca talking of miss elli went on hale becoming more stern than ever saw in london told that have actually be to see why not asked lesbia defiantly be crime be impertinence to see to talk to a did why did go lesbia wished to find out how proposed to force george to become husband have learned that much intends to force by telling lie how do know that what say be lie demanded hale angrily because read in eye man must not have done so be woman can trust one woman to learn everything woman leaf unsaid especially when man be stake between must have more modesty snapped father uncomfortably lesbia coloured have behaved properly in way said in wounded voice a love george have right to learn how woman proposed to take from well know now that can think can said lesbia with emphasis be different nonsense can prove that took key from neck stole jewel insisted mr hale be word against rejoined lesbia drily until miss elli prof truth of statement believe in george innocence lesbia cried father rising have come to formerly used to be quiet well behaved did a be told now now said girl getting on foot looking very straight at father now be woman fighting for happiness so will do best to hold own against tyranny hale did not like word said so be father tyrant be much more latter than former know how be said lesbia pondering have idea that be using a pawn in game be playing miss elli be in game also so be captain sargent what game may be know decline to be pushed about chess board without knowing why move will do a be told said hale livid with secret rage not daring to show openly lest must lose more of already waning influence will do a think fit retorted girl spirit up in arm care if be fifty time father will not treat in way longer if can clear george character will see marry if dare to bring in mr petty to spy on will appeal to godfather godfather who may be told once have never forgotten lord charvington be spoke at random broke in hale hastily be not godfather be nothing more than cousin friend benefactor said lesbia unable to resist shaft being so what will say if learns how unkindly be behaving lesbia be mad for year have be puppet lately have discovered that be human being with will of own so long a leave alone be content to behave a daughter decline to endure tyranny decline to be made use of in mysterious game be playing be very glad spoke to morning father a be time that came to understanding lesbia with head up marched out of room must have be scared have looked back seen expression on father face be little le than devilish with rage baffled cunning worm have be obedient for so long that hale have never expected turning came upon with shock must not afford to let lesbia appeal for protection to noble relative a knew that lord charvington be kindest of men must undoubtedly interfere of course in ordinary case hale must have prevented such interference between father daughter with charvington who allowed annuity be different if hale did not behave well to lesbia felt very certain that charvington must punish by taking away quarterly sum in spite of business in city boast that must give lesbia two thousand year hale must not afford to lose so certain income therefore said more to lesbia on subject of george miss elli burglary did bring back shadow mr petty indeed must not bring back former a have heard from sargent that man have thrown up situation have gone to london being case if lesbia chose to see george be impossible to prevent from having own way hale trusted that after letter of dismissal george must refuse to have anything to do with girl who have apparently thrown over meanwhile asked sargent to cottage frequently advised to prosecute wooing with zeal if secure girl soon will lose said hale emphatically will do so a soon a can get chance of seeing alone said sargent strove to look handsome gallant lover be after dinner that spoke thus in light came through rosy shade of candle seemed wonderfully young not at bad looking a usual be perfectly dressed in evening array yet have that ultra fashionable air be mark of inferior breeding captain alfred sargent looked like gentleman yet there be something lacking in manner to complete dress pretension rosy light made look le colourless for moment when in pursuance of object strolled into garden to meet lesbia became quite wan white worn looking in warm summer moonlight miss hale in simple white dress looking sweet girlish remarkably pretty sat on bench under chestnut in very place where george have made memorable proposal disliking sargent a did more so since father wished to marry have early left dinner table to take refuge in love haunted spot dream of george with inconsequence of woman rather resented fact that lover have not replied to letter of dismissal have not thought that must accept decision so readily in heart desired that must come along to take by storm at time fancied indeed that must suddenly appear to carry off to nearest church so frequently sought garden to afford opportunity to play young lochinvar there be also reason in garden hoped to meet shadow lately have sent line through tim stating that have discovered clue to robbery that must come down to tell about lesbia appointed bottom of garden a best place of meeting a father rarely came there canning must easily row up to landing stage in twilight evening expected a yet have not appeared thus be much annoyed when beheld slender form of ex captain in distance with cigarette in mouth be languidly smoking sargent strolled pensively down path finally came to halt before pretty figure on garden seat lesbia looked at blankly gave encouragement penny for thought miss hale said gallant captain forced by silence to utter first word be worth bank of england replied lesbia resolving to make best of bore since to get rid of by plain speaking only meant unnecessary trouble with father in case said sargent softly advancing nearer may hope be of if be so very egotistic said girl bitingly can think so be cruel muttered sargent somewhat disconcerted have not expected so cutting speech from so apparently timid girl why be so cruel to lesbia may call lesbia may not said lesbia coldly see reason why must a to being cruel captain sargent be not aware that be surely fenced captain be aware that love lesbia laughed be more disconcerted than ever be aware that father wish to marry said nothing of love left for to say well then say remarked miss hale cruelly sargent have met plenty of woman with good look reputation for wealth have usually scored easy victory girl be so straightforward so absolutely calm that did not know how to proceed with uneasy laugh strove to fall into humour love stammered why asked lesbia still calm exasperating look in glass ask why said ardently can behold such loveliness captain sargent broke in smiling broadly speak just like lover of mid victorian epoch have read such speech in book have always thought exceedingly silly be more original don giovanni must have turned restive when advised to alter style of love making captain sargent waxen face grew red with wrath be bloodless person so anger be more like of fretful child than of man lesbia looked at with contempt found hard to bear wanted man to master a woman do saw that wooer must never dominate be very unkind lesbia be sargent must find to say in case why not leave go back to father because came from father want to marry want also come went on coaxingly be wife lesbia will have everything that world can give daresay everything husband will be husband looked up down until reddened to root of straw coloured hair must rather be excused wo marry certainly not sargent grew childish with rage if there will be trouble can ruin man love that bounder walker be not bounder be man will take stronger man than captain sargent to harm can harm will do so cried captain delicate face took on expression of cunning weak a be lesbia must see wounded vanity might make dangerous burglary what do know about demanded lesbia imperiously walker be guilty miss elli say so for own end say so act in same way want to marry george want to marry wo do captain sargent thing be not to be settled in fashion have better laughed marry miss elli love want to marry be sorry said lesbia sedately decline for father sake urged sargent weakly angry looking more dangerously cunning than ever can harm also can saw from startled expression on girl face that be saying too much abruptly turned on heel will come for answer to morrow lesbia called out a walked swiftly towards house girl remained where be wondering what new threat meant must understand how must support father maud in harming george be difficult to understand how must harm mr hale in flash old unrest came over lesbia again pondered father unaccountable secrecy recalled shady acquaintance then again there be canning who be gentleman have be to school with mr hale only to degenerate into sargent valet be very singular somewhat startling lesbia puzzled over hopelessly until be aroused from somewhat painful brown study by low whistle looked up around to see boat by landing stage in boat mr canning apparently more frail than ever sargent be also shadowy dawned upon lesbia that two might be related captain sargent have just left said running down to landing stage wanted to marry refused be quite right miss hale if married sargent must be ruined for ever threatened to harm father if did not george also mr canning threw back head laughed silently can do best to harm walker by supporting miss elli in lie will take much stronger man than alfred to here became aware that have appeared unduly familiar with late master name thought so said lesbia recalling how like two men be in look fragility be related to captain sargent be brother yes said mr canning looking very pale since have guessed so cleverly may a well admit will not tell story now later will be time enough meanwhile say nothing to father about having guessed that alfred be brother how did oh said lesbia smiling be exactly alike pale slender with same cast of face same colour of hair oh be wonderful believe be twin mr canning shirked question came ashore passed with lesbia under chestnut tree behind trunk in fact so that might not be seen from cottage window have discovered truth said in usual whisper at present must not ask how came to learn george walker be innocent mr tait have jewel stolen so a to get insurance money lesbia gasped with amazement be certain demanded when nodded asked question how did learn so quickly be secret just now said canning equably remember that warned before must not ask that question be sufficient to say that found out how mr tait insured jewel for large sum of money then employed two clever london thief to steal tait will get insurance money will also unset jewel sell in india america of course thief will have to be paid for risk took though be not great one a tait left gallery door open gave key have on watch chain to open safe if miss elli have not come down if walker have not followed there must have be scandal mr canning said lesbia after moment thought did miss elli know that robbery be about to take place from have heard of be deep in uncle confidence can not be sure if be accessory before fact replied canning speaking in legal phraseology can cried girl leaping to conclusion with intuitive certainty of woman see whole scheme miss elli knew that jewel must be stolen somewhere about three o'clock in morning so appointed that hour to meet george implicate in crime be carefully arranged trap into walked wholly unconsciously reason asked canning somewhat perplexed lesbia laughed be mere man mr canning can not understand take woman to fathom duplicity of woman miss elli loved george a must not marry willingly lured into trap so a to oh lesbia broke off clenching little fist stamping with anger will not will not will see defy mr canning be returning to london to hide said man quietly can come down here when be necessary will send address a soon a arrange where to conceal why must conceal be too long story to tell at present be enough for to know that what have discovered about tait what have told be dangerous to miss hale ask further question for dare not answer have jeopardised liberty perhaps life by what have done for understand said lesbia somewhat scared be a well that said canning sombrely bluebeard chamber be dangerous room to look into when be necessary if ever be will know what be concealing now meanwhile will go into hiding in london what be to do see miss elli rejoined shadow promptly tell have discovered give name a authority be say how captain sargent servant looked into matter can suppress fact of being gentleman sargent brother tell miss elli also that when time come can prove that uncle have jewel stolen so a to get insurance money in addition to money from sale of jewel in order to tide over financial crisis twenty thousand from jewel like amount from lloyd ended canning cynically will give mr tait ample fund with to retrieve position be in danger of bankruptcy crime engineered by have saved credit what wickedness murmured a canning moved towards boat oh such doings be classed under head of business by people like tait must get away before brother father see canning loosened painter slipped into boat took oar not without anxious glance at cottage thank for what have done cried lesbia softly remaining for obvious reason behind tree trunk not at have only repaid debt be if such debt can ever be paid au revoir miss hale raising shabby cap with good breeding of gentleman canning pulled away with easy clean stroke must only have be learned at public school chapter xii counterplot captain sargent be somewhat disheartened by lesbia steady opposition to wooing be not virile enough to take heart by storm usual tactic did not seem to succeed with cool quiet observant girl who looked at so straight also threat of harming george walker mr hale proved to be blunt weapon must not penetrate shield of lesbia composure sargent retreated from field of battle thoroughly beaten must have confessed a much to hale for gentleman took daughter to task when returned to cottage after secret interview with canning unsuccessful lover have already departed lesbia listened for ten minute to father denunciation of what be pleased to style wickedness ought to be flattered that so rich handsome man love raged mr hale who for once in life lost self control seem to forget that if died to morrow might a heart be affected must be left penniless lesbia raised eyebrow understood to say that must leave two thousand year observed quietly if marry a wish cried father furiously not otherwise failing becoming wife of dear friend sargent will leave money to lord charvington well said girl cheerfully must only be fair since have paid pension for so long what do know about snapped hale changing colour very little certainly told in expansive moment that lord charvington a cousin allowed small income precious small muttered hale not contradicting why doe allow anything asked lesbia very directly with two thousand year can not wish for help hale took turn up down room then stopped to daughter spoke in quieter tone none le emphatic be not enjoying two thousand year at present declared slowly so accept annuity from charvington who being cousin have right to assist see that murmured girl shrugging doe matter what see what see cried hale temper again getting beyond control do a be told chance consequence be pawn in fact rejoined ironically pawn on chess board hale shrugged in turn put how like retorted obey certainly not be human being have right to have right to hing broke in father desperately see here girl be making great mistake by not letting guide have be open about amethyst cross must never have allowed to give to george walker possession mean more than think two thousand year depends upon production oh lesbia opened eye widely see then be willing must marry george if get two thousand yes said hale bluntly for circumstance concern prefer that must marry sargent marriage with anyone concern great deal said lesbia coolly decline to marry man love a to cross be own property left to by mother if production will bring two thousand year be very sorry be lost did not say that meant two thousand year to said hale uneasily with scowl pardon assume that since be owner of cross however be lost know where to find that being case refuse to marry captain sargent will marry george have sent away forget that can bring again to foot lesbia lesbia be playing with fire probably will continue to play until tell meaning of thing have told about cross quite so interrupted girl drily now know why george be assaulted mother cottage robbed dare to say that be guilty person demanded father suspiciously oh if be must have cross thus being able to get two thousand year must not oppose marriage with george be innocent thank for nothing sneered hale coolly can reckon on lesbia that if must have knocked down george have robbed of cross must have done so be candid father asked to be candid hold tongue else talk sense must marry sargent will not allow to throw away on thief stop cried lesbia rising indignantly will not call george name in hearing be thief can prove that be on tip of girl tongue to speak out accuse tait first desired to see maud elli in order to cut claw therefore with self restraint far beyond year shook head hale sneered again be silly romantic fool scoffed sooner later will force to do will never never never oh very well replied hale baffled by obstinacy then will go to london leave here will not speak to eat with have anything to do with until obey a daughter must turning on heel departed in cold anger hale duly kept promise went away leaving girl to own device so clever man must have known that punishment a deemed be punishment at have never be father to lesbia in accepted sense of word have small affection for alone with tim be much happier than when in mr hale chilling presence preferred room to company also be really playing into hand a wished to be alone in order to see maud bring to reason be not lesbia wish to call again at henley a thought that must deal better with miss elli when be on native heath therefore now that hale be out of way be free to do what desired set to work to concoct plot whereby to bring maud elli to cottage at marlow to end wrote letter stating that george be to be married shortly that miss elli scheme have failed artful epistle posted to henley hoping that if miss elli be in london must be forwarded to there felt certain since being woman knew woman nature better than man must know that maud must seek interview come to rose cottage of course there be chance that maud might first interview walker then learn falsity of statement in case george must come to learn truth then must tell what canning have discovered in fact owing to skilful way in lesbia played one trump card be certain to bring to cottage maud elli george walker whichever came be prepared to deal with situation same hoped that maud must be one to put in appearance a if must silence must then call at medmenham cottage explain to lover reason why have dismissed accordingly when letter setting trap be posted lesbia sat down to think over behaviour of walker puzzled that must so tamely accept dismissal on face of have treated cruelly have given reason for abruptly breaking off engagement same considered woman like that must not have acquiesced too readily to proposal that must never meet again forgot that george be proud man that sole reason must assign for dismissing be fact that be suspected of robbery if believed guilty george a might have thought must have argued in way have not sufficient love to stand up for then be not worthy of worship bestowed on lesbia did not think thus only knew that have sent george to right about that have gone away without looking back for single moment be not a must be said woman within therefore secretly felt annoyed with walker for too ready obedience can therefore be seen that lesbia hale be intensely feminine perhaps on account george loved more since unexpected in woman be always what lure man however think what must argue a might fact remained that walker kept away from rose cottage that have not sufficient courage to face lover when under wing of mother lesbia missed golden day of wooing dreadfully in absence be anxious to carry on counterplot if only to fill in time besides there must be considerable amount of pleasure in beating miss elli with own weapon be therefore happy day to lesbia brought stockbroker niece into trap a time biter be about to be bitten lesbia being woman dealing with woman determined to show mercy since maud have shown none besides two be fighting over man so reverted to ethic of cave life pre historic struggle within four day of posting of letter miss elli arrived be shown by tim into tiny drawing room be empty a lesbia have seen rival coming therefore have departed to change frock also hoped to make maud lose temper by enforced waiting knowing that if did there must be le difficulty in dealing with unsophisticated a lesbia be instinctively knew how to fight tactic be correct for when entered spick span smiling into drawing room found maud fuming restlessly quite ready to pick quarrel on score of uncivil treatment have be kept waiting said miss elli in louis xiv tone putting up lorgnette to glare at much too beautiful rival be so sorry responded lesbia politely be not dressed to receive anyone visit be unexpected maud laughed contemptuously knew must come declared with conviction have be looking out for day say so said lesbia still graciously for since last interview at henley have changed tactic with miss elli will not be seated chair be most comfortable have back to light need to sit with back to light flashed maud indignantly oh beg pardon from lorgnette thought that eye might be weak sit here then in full warmth of sunshine miss elli knew better than to let searching light reveal age too clearly to hostess will sit here declared abruptly came to rest on sofa be right said lesbia caressingly be nice shady corner maud bit lip knowing perfectly well that lesbia be casting reflection on age having taken seat must scarcely leave without laying open to further pointed remark so remained where be came to object of visit at once what do mean by writing letter demanded producing epistle of hostess mean to show that plot to part george have failed miss elli crushed up letter savagely have inquired seeing that have broken engagement how do know that mr walker told very glad be can tell mr walker be old friend of uncle have known for year want george to marry told so only few day ago a if mattered what said retorted lesbia contemptuously be george mother one denies a be son must obey even when want to marry woman care nothing for george doe care for cried deep flush overspreading face even to root of sandy hair admit that when be engaged to must not look at now that have thrown over so cruelly have turned to for consolation believe said lesbia quickly must will snapped miss elli very much in earnest look here sort of thing wo do what sort of thing enmity have towards know why be behaving so exasperatingly wailed maud plaintively when came to henley be first time met for father sake be anxious to make friend of be so rude so silly must not be willing to make allowance for want of training so have come here to ask to be friend oh mind provided will leave george alone sha so there love so do a love have prior claim have broken engagement so have left field open to be dog in manger be not love george have always loved sent letter did because of what father told lured george into trap a said at henley can get arrested because of attitude be compelled to dismiss see ruined miss elli put up lorgnette with air of triumph have stated case accurately save for one remark declared can ruin george walker will do so unless marries did not lure into trap merely took advantage of circumstance knew existed what do mean by what say retorted lesbia keeping eye on maud face appointed that place that hour of meeting in order to implicate george in robbery knew be about to take place miss elli sprang to foot with white face trembling hand go too far said in suffocating voice why must why must oh stamped remark be infamous be true be lie be not true have idea that uncle strong room be to be robbed of jewel on night at hour if have known must have prevented robbery mr tait must not have thanked for doing so replied lesbia meaningly be mad gasped maud face became dull brick red answered lesbia drily be merely well informed informed of what miss elli moistened dry lip mr tait wanted money to tide over financial crisis arranged to have jewel stolen so that must sell secretly be lie lie cried maud again perspiration broke out on quivering face uncle be wealthy man everyone know that if wanted money must have sold jewel openly be own forget insurance at lloyd maud dropped on to sofa a though have be shot insurance yes mr tait insured jewel for something like twenty thousand pound so have stolen certainly must have sold openly a say then must have got only money requires money maud gasped again suddenly looked double age of course twenty thousand pound by insuring jewel by having stolen will gain proceeds of sale have arranged with thief besides twenty thousand from insurance dare to accuse oh maud jumped up fiercely stamped angrily be ridiculous what proof have of absurd tale have absolute proof said lesbia quietly rising in turn mr canning shadow who watched here at father request found out what say if necessary can prove truth of what found out will at request if promise to leave george alone swear that will not accuse of crime of a knew time be innocent maud heard only speech canning shadow muttered do mean captain sargent valet yes nursed through illness have shown gratitude to by discovering uncle plot proving knowledge of can prove what say with canning assistance will do so unless promise to do a have asked maud buttoned jacket with trembling hand moved towards door hastily be talking rubbish muttered in thick voice refuse to talk of matter be too silly faced round will tell uncle will have put in gaol will be in gaol retorted lesbia a soon a leave house will arrange with mr canning to go to police state what told must not dare yes must unless swear not to accuse george promise to leave to said that before say so again for last time be maud be about to say that be lie for third time word died away on lip whether maud be cognizant of plot to steal jewel lesbia must not say a made remark on point very silence showed that be in business lesbia attitude left alternative to make term since if left house there be danger that uncle might be arrested if do what ask will hold tongue maud demanded faintly then admit that what say be true countered miss hale almost shouted miss elli still mud stick however wrongly thrown want uncle to suffer through a to canning oh uncle will deal with promise not word agree to ask must will not accuse george will leave to leaned forward with snarl will bring misery on at eleventh hour defy retorted lesbia with scorn very good maud smiled in evil way will see who win dangerous game be playing broke off abruptly left in haste chapter xiii mr walker visit meeting of two girl who loved george seemed destined to end abruptly on first occasion lesbia have broken short interview at henley on second maud have hastened away from rose cottage lesbia wondered that have not remained to talk further be rather anxious when remembered that maud have left with threat on lip miss elli be clever cunning reckless in one way might work mischief not that lesbia saw chance of doing since knew too much for maud peace of mind without doubt what canning have discovered be true else maud must not have surrendered so easily lesbia thought until be weary about matter especially how canning must have discovered truth so speedily must have asked point blank in spite of prohibition that be in london a yet have not written to tell where be hiding however a thing stood there be doubt that maud must keep promise that george be safe on day after stockbroker niece have paid visit lesbia wrote long letter to walker detailed that canning have discovered also narrated effect on maud elli further gave george to understand how have be compelled to write letter of dismissal ended up with fond wish that lover must come see at once when letter be posted lesbia began to dream of walker speedy return haunted garden in order to see boat coming swiftly down river boat never came did letter from george day after day lesbia watched stream watched also postman in case be disappointed walker must have received letter else must have be returned through dead letter office so be strange seeing how have explained matter that did not appear at least might have written girl wearying for love grew peaked wan much to distress of tim who must not understand finally lesbia told whole story sent over to cottage at medmenham to see if walker have received letter tim returned somewhat downcast masther garge have be in london six day said tim misthress blissid mother towld 'd sint letter to be got dear divil know why doe write ye scratch av pen augh dear nivir trouble again sure there be more fish in say ivir come out av same george be only man in world for said lesbia firmly although tear be in eye will never give up until hear say that love be miss elli work och murder dear be baste be entoirely from what ye towld miss ye drew teeth av went away with threat sighed lesbia dismally ca force george to marry now evidently can prevent returning to a want to oh tim what be to do now see masther garge ask plain miss have not money to go to london besides know where george be stopping protested lesbia wringing hand see ould mother saint be good to for iceberg be suggested tim after pause sure will tell ye where be dear tim mr walker hate father must rather die than see son become husband hate masther be ut muttered crooked little man frowning if so darlin ' heart why shud come to see come to see echoed lesbia staring why mr walker have never be here to see father in life understood from george that hated father in case will never come here if did come sighed lesbia might soften heart so that might be on side be sure must win over well miss lesbia ye can try for ould woman be coming here to morrow afternoon to see masther be away tim sure miss sint scratch av pin sayin ' be coming back very day towld ould woman whin axed so be coming to have talk wid ' divil will make third wid two muttered tim crossing saint kape from harm lesbia be much astonished at news a mr walker have never be to rose cottage before moreover on word of son despised hated mr hale girl wondered if visit have anything to do with letter have lately written to george perhaps maud threat have meant that must enlist mr walker on side to stop marriage since maud for obvious reason be powerless to do so then in case mr walker disapproved of marriage so there be need for maud to interfere also if letter have be forwarded to george in london lesbia saw reason why must not have be forwarded must have received same if so why did not reply seeing that have completely exonerated herself be anxious to renew engagement for george own sake have be forced to break poor lesbia thought over question until be weary head ached must find reply only thing to be done be to wait until formidable mr walker arrived then few minute conversation with might reveal reason of george strange behaviour mr hale duly returned seemed even angrier more sullen than have be before went away scarcely spoke to daughter several time looked at with positive dread in usually cold eye appeared a though considered lesbia a careless child with box of match who might at moment set house on fire lesbia have feeling that be terribly angry with yet that anger be mixed with certain amount of dread however contented with looking dagger to avoid further disturbance did not ask question house be very uncomfortable then at breakfast next morning on day when mr walker be expected hale surprised girl by announcing invitation saw lord charvington when be in town said hale keeping pale eye on plate for reason chose to remember existence lesbia gasped wondered if charvington have told father of money have borrowed in case hale must question a to use have made of then counterplot with canning must come to light with disastrous result hale further conversation made plain that charvington have said nothing about loan asked how be pursued hale softly still keeping eye on plate if have grown up pretty girl have seen for long time remember considering how badly have behaved lesbia spoke better of than deserved so charvington prepare for surprise have asked to stop at country house told that wife must send invitation be very good of said lesbia faintly really want to go father hale looked up with scowl always opposition grumbled will go child if wo marry sargent there will be chance of making good match when under lady charvington wing have daughter of own too so will have very good time why must lord charvington ask ca say suddenly seems to have remembered existence of course a daughter be related to however chance of visit at country house be very good one for so get ready to start when invitation come do want frock have everything said lesbia rising after perhaps change will do good must like to see little of world will see plenty of with charvington wife be gay couple entertain largely be at country seat near maidenhead for week if play card well lady charvington may take to london for rest of season lesbia nodded went into garden here sat on bench under chestnut thought over glittering prospect be now open to loved george be contented with quiet life provided shared with a be absent be behaving so very strangely thought that must be best to plunge into society if only to forget aching heart if george must not marry might be that must meet with other man who must take away from uncomfortable life with father in own heart lesbia knew that must love one george walker still must not force to marry appeared to have accepted letter of dismissal a final in spite of second epistle stating why wrote first poor girl felt very sad very lonely tear rained down salt bitter a sat solitary figure under glorious tree blackbird be piping again a have done when george proposed seemed to ear that song be now sad probably be mere fancy at one o'clock lesbia returned to cottage wondering why trouble have come upon really seemed a though tim idea about bad luck of cross be true for ever since have bestowed on lover there have be nothing sorrow mystery even george have not escaped misfortune since have be assaulted robbed have lost situation through being accused unjustly of crime have never committed lesbia be reader of fairy tale remembered that prince princess always have much grief before peace joy arrive so hoped that in way must not see how bad luck be upon george must pas away leaving married rich happy at present must be confessed that there did not appear to be much chance of such good fortune ould woman have come very minit whispered tim meeting girl at back door have put in parlour masther be out father be certain to come into luncheon said lesbia hurriedly av coorse be muttered tim mighty dainty man be inside av be axing for miss will go to interrupted lesbia meanwhile tim lay place at table daresay mr walker be hungry with instruction lesbia sought small parlour entered to find occupied by modern lady macbeth mr walker clothed in rich funereal looking garment of deepest black be seated majestically on sofa without rising raised pair of piercing eye to look at girl brief expression of surprise flitted across impassive face have scarcely expected to find girl so beautiful a have always taken son enthusiastic description with grain of salt however privately admitted that george be right for once greeted girl with stiff kindness indeed be hard even for lady of mr walker hard nature to be angry with lesbia who looked child who behaved so sweetly be very glad to see said mr walker looking anxiously into girl delicate face remind of someone who ca recall of whom remind still searched anxiously be very like someone knew perhaps mother lesbia ventured to remark late nurse bridget burke told closely resembled mother never met mother said mr walker dropping lesbia hand quickly becoming stiffer than ever father be never friend dear must not be here to day save have come to ask about business connected with money expect to inherit also added mr walker unexpectedly wanted to see george have talked much of child seems to have loved greatly ca blame wonder be that must give up lesbia clasped small hand sank into chair face white eye widely open george have never given up said faintly wrote told why be forced to send first letter yes yes mr walker waved beautifully gloved hand be in other day in fact took letter to george showed to told everything what did say mr walker deep black brow drew together of course whole thing be rubbish said harshly only love sick girl like maud elli must act in way suppose much must be forgiven a really love son after behaviour will never consent to marrying must never do especially now that know uncle be such rogue wanted george to tell police refused lesbia cared very little for fate of tait what much desired to know be own said that george have ceased to care for remarked with pale smile understand mr walker gave pitying look do now have seen dear like father never did must rather have died than have seen george marrying daughter look nature have made change mind there be nothing of father about have seen before mr walker broke off shook stately head be too late george will not renew engagement oh ca believe that cried girl weeping trembling strange muttered elder woman have be quite heroine in clearing george character for be greatly obliged to yet here be cry like schoolgirl love so much love so deeply poor child be fate of woman to have heart broken know why george still refuse to renew engagement in face of letter doe here mr walker took envelope out of bag handed to shaking girl can read decision in own handwriting asked to give with great delicacy turned away head while lesbia tore open envelope with shaking hand there be only few line intimated plainly that george have accepted dismissal must not seek to renew engagement love still dearest wrote walker in conclusion fate will that must part for ever then there be few tender word epistle ended abruptly a though writer must not trust emotion lesbia read line folded letter replaced in envelope put into pocket eye be dry now white face be flushed with colour with deep sigh touched elder woman on shoulder understand said calmly mr walker whose sympathy remarkably in so cold woman be now entirely with lesbia grew snappy to conceal emotion said acidly when george return to medmenham will have explanation with be fool said lesbia face growing even deeper red ca see that george be only acting in way to save to save from what asked mr walker shortly know ca say lesbia spoke more to herself than to visitor feel sure that george wrote letter a wrote first one to wrote to save now refuse to renew engagement to save understand still be sure that everything will come right trust in god do well to do so said mr walker gravely for only can help

falsehood to serve own private end in face of what knew appeared a though be telling one now why must not conjecture while be trying to puzzle out reason mr walker rose swept across to window of drawing room looked out into road see yet muttered to herself consulted bracelet watch attached to left wrist be expecting anyone asked hale politely mr jabez family lawyer replied curtly returned to

must certainly have to leave room then shame in presence of child madam said hale thickly vein on forehead began to swell with anger beg pardon said mr walker with careless laugh forgot how have deceived into thinking angel hale suddenly rose walked to window be in furious rage be trying to keep cool since knew that loss of temper must give mr walker advantage did not intend to gain sat quietly smoothing lesbia hand with glittering eye quite ready to continue hostility a soon a enemy recovered breath lesbia remained passive wondering what trouble be about one other of disputant

have not be to see before since loved be innocent darling must like one better for daughter must be unfair to visit sin of father on so sweet child yet if child be sweet said george drily must not mind doing so be somewhat inconsistent be not so inconsistent a be said mother skilfully avoiding reply by carrying war into hic camp what wish to know be why do decline to renew engagement have money situation be true reason be sole reason choose to give there be necessity to be rude george said mr walker with great dignity can not get situation not easily tait will give reference do care to ask for situation be hard to get without reference mr walker clasped strong white hand together frowned be quite absurd that son son of father must be mere clerk in city burst out ca do something better replied george gloomily be not clever have not be brought up to trade trade trade son in trade george be sad enough at heart yet must not forbear smiling at horror expressed on countenance there be nothing disgraceful in trade remarked quietly grandfather morse be merchant grandfather casterton be earl snapped mr walker there be uncle present owner of title why not go to see if can not assist when ask what excuse can make be uncle have right to assist fear might not see thing in same light mother besides have qualification george paused then added gloomily out of door colonial life must suit give enough to get to canada australia mother there can carve way what about asked mr walker reproachfully must make home for beyond sea can come out later mr walker shook head be too old to travel so far said grimly moreover intend to wait until get fortune of sister be dead be sure from what walter hale say that there be child so in end jabez must give fifty thousand pound that money must put thing right marriage included not with lesbia said young man colouring there be chance of coming together besides to get money must find that cross nothing of sort said mother quickly jabez only requires production by possible child a mean of identification very silly idea call know that be judith morse so by father will inherit now that sister be dead george shook head doggedly believe that will never get fortune until cross be found then find ca have tried best to learn who assaulted robbed cottage be still in dark ended conversation for time being a day went by mr walker still continued to express disgust at george obstinacy regarding lesbia knew that still loved girl must not think why must refuse to renew engagement in face of lesbia letter of course excuse of having situation be rubbish so mr walker decided a lesbia be willing to marry without one penny if truly loved a did poverty must be bar when be poverty ever bar to union of two young heart even admitting that george wanted to provide home before renewing engagement surely must have seen lesbia explained reason for behaving a be doing never went near marlow refused to mention name a mr walker being a obstinate a son insisted on discussing unfortunate love affair wrangling over same george took to remaining for day in london on plea that be looking for work time thus passed very miserably for grim widow one day george came down with news that have received note from lord charvington asking to call at court maidenhead why must wish to see george must not guess a have never met in letter charvington said that have be friend of aylmer walker so desired interview mr walker be also puzzled be well acquainted with lord charvington after scampish husband death have kept away from former society frequented on account of poverty same advised george to keep appointment be made for next day if only to hear what charvington have to talk about be strange coincidence in fact that lady charvington motor must stop on afternoon of very day at gate of medmenham cottage never before to george knowledge have mother mentioned lord charvington name yet on very day when be on lip because of letter wife of nobleman arrived to pay visit why must do so be not quite clear mr walker entered drawing room with frown sister kate have be school girl together have never approved of lady greeting

kate have not complexion hair nasty temper snapped mr walker who felt extremely nasty know why must talk of good look at age be not old judith be older than be quite so wear ever so much better look

expected lady charvington to mention girl than have expected must arrive on very day when name have first be mentioned in cottage be husband name what do know of lesbia lady charvington asked taking

that lesbia name must be mentioned in house only with respect oh know that love son that love unfortunately why so asked george very directly still red with anger be beginning to dislike pretty perfumed dainty woman who looked a frivolous a mother be stately because be shrewdly suspect lady charvington hesitated for young man looked so angry mr walker so grim that feared to bring out hateful

kissing lesbia brow be safe now can come to harm be brave a have be for little time longer will end well george said lesbia stretching arm like weary child dearest young man kissed gave into mother charge so two woman passed into cottage while watched sadly sorrow have not yet done work chapter xxi two interview at present moment george walker have plenty of time on hand being naturally

of very disorderly affair lesbia must no longer remain with father a character be so extremely bad hale have left cottage must be certain to return again therefore george wished to see if must not marry lesbia say within month so a to rescue from trouble by be environed to do required assistance believed that must receive from lord charvington who appeared to be particularly well disposed towards girl idea of emigrating to colony if mr walker must be persuaded to lend approval to suggestion be by mean bad one a then whole unhappy past must be set aside for ever in country with better prospect unaffected by sordid life compulsorily spent with sordid people george foresaw that must be able to make calm bright happy future for wife therefore crossed river walked to maidenhead with idea of explaining scheme to charvington asking to advance necessary fund before starting new life george wished to round off old saw very plainly that for reason amethyst cross have be cause of late trouble since loss everything have gone wrong be necessary that must be found if thing be to be put right jabez lawyer insisted that must be produced before must part with fifty thousand pound trust money if then ornament must be found given into jabez hand mr walker must benefit certainly there be chance that late sister have left child in absence of proof difficulty might be overcome at event production of cross appeared to be necessary to force jabez into dealing with trust money accumulation then again george wished to do something for canning man be wastrel ne'er do weel have one to take interest in have done lesbia service at considerable risk be only fair that must be rewarded undoubtedly belonged to gang of clever thief have repented sufficiently of wickedness to help lover

drawing wheeled chair looked at guest briskly have time to talk of old story let come to point have heard about lesbia stay here yes said george very distinctly lady charvington told mother about matter lord charvington face grew dull brick red when did see wife yesterday called on mother at medmenham what did say asked elder man abruptly anxiously george gave detail in blunt cool way exaggerating nothing suppressing nothing effect on lord charvington be very marked jumped up from chair paced room holding head in hand good heaven oh good heaven muttered woman woman how dare helen speak so what doe guess what doe know about what asked george with keen curiosity question recalled lord charvington to fact seemed to have forgotten in agitation that be not alone never mind said sharply returned to seat more composed do mean to say that lady charvington stated that have found cross in library yes sir thought that might know know nothing interrupted charvington violently nervously shifting various article on writing table know that there be cross remember mr samuel morse gave to daughter remarked on oddity how did get into library did not bring here sir no charvington again rose began to walk off uncontrollable agitation have not seen that cross for year last time set eye on miss morse may a well call miss morse since mother have not revealed married name wore round neck wife say that found here tell mr walker know how came into room never saw how strange said george believing speech wondering nevertheless how come asked charvington wheeling that know about amethyst cross mr walker received from lesbia a love gift explained george went on to relate circumstance of assault robbery charvington walked up down nodding muttering at interval when george ended came to halt before young man lesbia told much of what tell said quietly of course be ignorant that wife have taken cross from room did not tell can not understand said george in turn can not understand why lady charvington be so bitter against lesbia ah woman woman said charvington with gesture of despair who can understand nature of woman let leave question for time being mr walker what have to do be to get at root of matter if cross be in wife jewel case a asserts undoubtedly burglary be committed to gain possession of hale be thief a know have sent back case intact received morning a only on condition of being restored must consent to hush matter up hushed up for daughter sake mr walker charvington wrinkled brow threw back white mass of hair amethyst cross be not amongst jewel hale probably kept back want know a have idea of getting money by producing yes yes heard something about muttered charvington of course be impossible unless unless paused opening shutting hand feverishly damn burst out with stamp of foot must like to throttle a nearly throttled george looked up in surprise throttled yes said charvington impatiently ca see must have be hale who assaulted on towing path to get back cross a expert thief took ornament from cottage on face of appears probable said george slowly same think be case why not wanted amethyst cross quite so if have obtained from cottage so long ago must have taken to mr jabez to procure money if possible mere fact too that be willing must marry lesbia if found missing ornament show that hale did not commit assault robbery then who must have done so george shrugged shoulder ca say probably person who placed in room if ever be in room muttered charvington darkly wife declares oh yes oh yes know what declares well thing be not to be threshed out in five minute mr walker stopped short before george do wish to marry lesbia with heart soul have come together again last night renewed love vow must never have be broken said charvington impatiently never be save by circumstance said george solemnly heart be always true related plotting of maud walter hale devil devil muttered charvington with stamp be fault fault what george scarcely knew if have heard aright fault say charvington clutched head with expression of pain know ca guess never mind will put end to will marry lesbia make happy will settle hale once for come what be idea idea said george deliberately be when entered room to ask to give enough a loan to marry lesbia so must take to australia canada begin new life now have changed mind a can guess in way can arrange matter without having to adopt extreme course yes said charvington quietly believe that can arrange matter in very surprising way must have be arranged long ago only for fact have not courage be very hard to do right sometimes time have come mr walker in three day certain people must be brought together into room what people sir walter hale lesbia mother mr jabez wife when be assembled will be able to straighten thing crooked a be at present ask to see that people saving wife who will be invited by to be present be here on third day from now at three o'clock in afternoon then then will marry lesbia be happy ever afterwards now go george went without word wondering very much at turn event have taken have hoped that charvington must arrange destiny that of lesbia old nobleman seemed able ready to arrange destiny of many other people george must not entirely understand meaning of charvington behaviour after brief reflection did not attempt to decided to write note telling hale lesbia to be at court at appointed time also to go personally to london to see mr jabez arrange for presence having thus made up mind what to do george strode towards home whistling with load off mind in one way thing must surely be put right then came surprise while passing through nightingale thicket young man saw canning looking more shadowy than ever flitting down road to meet a man drew nearer george saw that usually pale face be flushed that be dressed spick span a gentleman that there be general look of opulence about glided up to walker swiftly for appeared too unsubstantial to do anything save glide broke into voluble explanation walker cried in loud tone contrasted markedly with usual whispering speech came down morning especially to see told have gone to charvington place so crossed river walked in direction on chance of meeting what be hurry asked george surprised by change of clothes look manner be leaving england have come to say good bye let sit down on grass by roadside one will come along after have explained will push on to maidenhead take train to london from london go to italy yes old aunt of mine have remembered in will at eleventh hour have inherited two hundred year annuity principal of can not touch luckily for said george taking out pipe must waste daresay be always wrong 'un however go to italy because there can live like fighting cock on income mean penury in england go also because tait hale rest of be making thing too hot for before departing wanted to see to confess george lighted pipe looked sideways in surprise confess what that assaulted said canning nervously george glanced in amazement at frail figure yes of course took by surprise must have knocked into cocked hat can punch now walker want to punch a put said george bluntly of course acted like skunk in sneaking behind knocking on head to say nothing of tying up same tied up said canning who have lain down be smoking cigarette because did not wish to recover get back to cottage at medmenham until have secured cross george turned indignantly then be thief declared yes admitted canning coughing kick will take lying down said george after pause have done service through lesbia by preventing success of maud elli plot evil have done be counterbalanced by good how did get into rose cottage canning sat up looked puzzled did do that said earnestly left trussed on towing path like fowl how deuce got into cottage know more than do have never found out said george promptly be beginning to find out many thing be just possible may solve that riddle also by way why did sneak amethyst cross brother wanted sargent yes hale came to cookham on evening when proposed to miss lesbia told alfred that have given cross alfred insisted must rob primed with champagne to do what wanted started for cottage with sandbag rope to stun bind hoping to take by surprise saw coming along towing path in twilight then yes george cut short know rest crept up behind stunned bound then sneaked back to rob cottage be pretty bad lot must say be said canning languidly now have enough to keep wolf from door will reform besides can kick a said want to poor devil since have confessed have done service why did because miss hale be only human being who be ever kind to said canning throwing away cigarette oh walker know terrible life have have never be wicked really be only weak only easily led hated time be working for alfred accursed wretch associated with hated mankind because be treated so badly miss hale changed nature by kindness did what must to repair wrong towards towards because loved have confessed because want to know truth then pas out of life yours for ever take address in london canning handed pencilled card will find for next week after go to italy tell miss hale everything have told then ask to write say that forgives want to think badly of george nodded slipped card into pocket feeling very sorry for miserable man only one question must like to ask said rising from grass why did brother want cross lady charvington a found out from overhearing conversation between asked to get george thought of lie told by lady a to cross having be found by in library why did want ca say replied canning moving away ask good bye walker dear fellow added one last word maud elli hale be plotting to get money must come to mother good bye disappeared down road withdrawing swiftly like receding mist be last george saw of arthur sargent alias canning alias shadow chapter xxii plot that canning fairly ran away george must have stopped to ask further question have told much be new strange explained great deal last remark hinted at further difficulty apparently hale have not yet given up idea of procuring money although how hoped to do so in absence of child george must not understand of course walker felt very certain that hale have kept back amethyst cross when sending jewel to lord charvington production by hale must have effect on mr jabez lawyer wanted cross to be produced by child of katherine morse married name might be according to hale dying woman have child mr walker indeed have stated that sister have written about sick child have probably died if not surely during twenty year child must have come forward to recover inheritance george be naturally puzzled with new development decided that to learn truth must be best to go to fountain head be if hale intended to use cross to procure money must have to produce to mr jabez in office in lincoln inn field be thus best to go at once to mr jabez inform of what canning have said about new plot what maud elli have to do with matter be impossible to say george must no more understand connection with matter than must understand why lady charvington have employed captain sargent to get cross what possible interest must have in amethyst cross why have told deliberate lie about being in library george be quite bewildered with complicated state of affair jabez a believed alone must solve mystery george duly gave mother lord charvington message received in silence with change of colour did not escape notice mother asked abruptly what do know about lord charvington be not lord charvington when knew confessed mr walker after pause philip hale hale know be family name lesbia father bear a cousin charvington have not come into title twenty more year ago knew very well liked sighed be always weak george looked incredulous weak echoed seems to to be very strong man one who know own mind have doubt learned by experience replied mr walker heaven only know how badly needed to learn so be going to speak at last must have done so long ago about what mother mr walker pursed up mouth never mind george prefer that lord charvington must tell own story if doe walter hale will find in trouble will be glad of have waited long to see punished soon will be satisfied why do hate hale so mother have cause to hate cried mr walker vindictively eye glittered year ago loved walter hale loved that man said son slowly what be there strange in snapped mother trying to keep restless hand still be handsome clever rich loved thought that loved gave heart found out only too late that be playing with be always cruel wicked hard selfish to core thinking only of be engaged added mr walker drooping head in lower tone confessed then that have very little money believed be heiress so be to extent of fifty thousand pound father did not like declared that if married walter must cut off with shilling did not care for loved man for loved for money when learned father decision threw over went after other woman who be rich lesbia mother suppose so said mr walker pretending indifference vanished out of life heard that be courting heiress in hope of making good marriage for pocket be left alone married father aylmer walker not because loved because be kind sympathetic aylmer be spendthrift wasted money same be kind hearted not scoundrel like walter hale then be born shortly afterwards misfortune came be only married four year when father broke neck leaving penniless then kate eloped with mr walker paused eloped be can say saw walter hale again learned learned oh rose wrung out hand what villain man be will be punished now swear if charvington will not punish will punish not word cried mr walker passionately ca bear to discus matter when meet at charvington place long hidden truth will come to light until then stopped closed mouth shook head left room hastily george wondered what must be hidden truth referred to must come to conclusion wrote letter to lesbia saying that be to come to lord charvington place stating that must call to take over then smoked pipe retired to bed intending next day to go to london see mr jabez in lincoln inn field mr walker did not put in appearance again on that evening of course george a lover lay awake thought of lesbia be sorely inclined to postpone visit to mr jabez go over to marlow on morrow be necessary to execute business before indulging in pleasure since when everything be settled must have lesbia beside always a dear wife therefore restrained longing for sight of face gradually dropped off to sleep next morning mr walker have breakfast in bed did not see son george left message that must return in evening went to henley in boat to catch mid day train soon arrived in london without wasting time went to see mr jabez old lawyer have large expensive office in lincoln inn field from number of clerk be apparently much sought after a solicitor received walker a soon a young man sent in card a seemed that george have luckily arrived during slack season week ago said mr jabez in precise way must have have to keep waiting for hour room in jabez received client a george be be large apartment with painted ceiling three long window looking out on to garden of square probably in georgian day have held brilliant company now since tide of fashion have rolled farther to west be given over to dry a dust detail of law jabez looked a hatchet faced a ever still wore large blue spectacle to aid weak eye welcomed george politely in dry way waited to hear what young man have to say lord charvington want to come down to court day after to morrow at three o'clock said george abruptly why demanded jabez quietly more puzzled than chose to admit can only answer by telling have taken place answered young man forthwith related what knew nursing chin in hollow of hand jabez crossed lean leg listened quietly enough nodding at interval thought must come to observed when young man ended come to what explanation of what of many thing will astonish said jabez drily of course be acquainted with lord charvington when be merely honourable philip hale then jabez suspended further confidence be best to allow lord charvington to speak for do know what intends to say partly yet mused solicitor looking at neat shoe there may be something interesting know however main point be that will arrange to be there at stated time gathering promise to be interesting cross jabez stopped h be cross see now how hale got stole from lady charvington who procured from sargent who employed canning to thieve from explained george so said before be not so stupid a to require double explanation said jabez crustily be wondering how hale hope to get money by mean of cross certainly declares that have found child what cried george starting to foot in amazement jabez looked up raised hand speak so loud voice go through head said in testy manner yes searched amongst paper here be letter from walter hale saying that will call to morrow at noon with child of katherine morse doe mention aunt married name no answered jabez sucking in cheek be what make suspicious of affair however what have told to day about lady charvington share in business husband attitude give idea send wire to lord charvington asking to meet here to morrow then can both see mr hale child must like to what use there there have time to waste go do what be told said jabez rising with angry gesture may be wrong may be right putting two two together stopped walked to window musingly yes believe may be so what may be so questioned george picking up hat jabez wheeled crossly oh be there still go away send that wire at noon to morrow bring lord charvington here good day rang bell get out young walker be taking up time wondering at behaviour of lawyer george departed forthwith sent prepaid wire to charvington asking to come to lincoln inn field office have mind to go down explain personally a must not explain very much relied on wire hoping that charvington curiosity must be sufficiently aroused to make obey summons late in afternoon answer came intimating that charvington must be at jabez office at appointed time george be greatly pleased a foresaw that hale little plot must in way be frustrated charvington apparently knew of much to hale disadvantage hence wily old lawyer have induced to be present having come to conclusion walker wired to mother saying that must remain in london employed evening in going to music hall positively have to do so for if have remained alone in hotel brooding over riddle must by mean solve felt that brain must not bear strain still in vague way felt that thing be being shaped to happy end light be coming out of darkness have enshrouded thing for so long at quarter to twelve in morning george met charvington in semi courtyard in front of mansion wherein jabez have office elder man jumped out of hansom in have driven from railway station walked towards young one with elastic step after have paid fare what be walker demanded abruptly why did wire for to come up on day at hour to place come upstairs to mr jabez will explain said george leading way up step can not linger here hale may see hale charvington followed hurriedly caught young man arm why be hale coming here have found so say cousin cousin aunt child heir to property mr jabez have held for so long charvington stopped on landing so hale be going to anticipate muttered without waiting to be announced opened door of jabez private room strode in lawyer looked up irritably be engaged lord charvington well might have guessed a much from abrupt entry have changed much in impulsive way lord charvington threw down hat stick glove flung into chair have changed very much in look retorted however there be time for personality walker indicated young man who have followed closely tell that hale intends to produce heiress to aunt property jabez looked inquisitively at charvington through blue spectacle believe so said quietly cautiously with glance at watch hale will bring girl here in few minute be girl then sneered charvington mentioned word 'heiress ' remarked jabez with emphasis mere guess what of cross hale say that girl will produce believe that girl will produce stolen property know that cross be stolen from house so believe said jabez politely yes walker here told though how got into library can tell now lord charvington interposed george a heard truth from canning other day sargent employed canning to steal cross in order to pas over to wife charvington bounded from chair what did want with ca say hush said jabez who at sound of wheel in courtyard have gone to one of tall window here come hale heiress go into next room with walker lord charvington when require will summon why do bring here at demanded charvington brusquely jabez looked straight at long finger played tune on table have idea said gravely may be able to tell if idea be correct what be idea can not tell to until see heiress very good charvington sat down again introduce hale said jabez anxiously must never do wait until hear hale story then hale will only tell pack of lie interrupted charvington violently besides stole cross jabez put hand against breast of angry speaker pushed gently towards side door go in there wait said insistently also walker cried charvington sha if said solicitor very quietly will wash hand of matter already hale heiress be waiting in ante chamber if voice be recognised will not come in why not because believe that be of hale wicked scheme let hear whole invention have made up then can call upon to substantiate story ca wait want to know who girl be ca guess demanded jabez leading deftly to door of inner room where wished to wait can do more than guess know humph muttered jabez thought so thought what never mind if know rightly will be able to help charvington stamped believe be lie want to see girl well said jabez resignedly will do thing have never done before since will not be quiet otherwise in panel of door there be small knot hole look in see if charvington rushed into room dragging walker after closed door shortly afterwards heard entrance of two people old man applied eye to knot hole then laughed silently made george apply eye look at heiress said sneeringly walker looked eagerly saw maud elli chapter xxiii one part of truth be indeed maud elli who entered on arm of mr hale be carefully dressed a usual have made best of look such a be appeared to be anxious to be strung up to fighting pitch after manner of woman who anticipated that be not going to get own way without battle on entrance measured lean lawyer with eye of antagonist then sat down in chair politely pushed forward a to walter hale looked much same a always did cool polished composed of course be perfectly arrayed in bond street taste manner be a irreproachable a be costume if miss elli be nervous hale assuredly be not to jabez suggested bowie knife odd comparison one came unexpectedly into lawyer unimaginative brain know of course mr jabez said hale when seated what have come to see about solicitor who have taken usual chair before table nodded pointed to hale letter lay on blotting paper before to produce amethyst cross said gravely something more important than cross allow hale stood up to give word due effect to present to miss katherine morse oh interrupted jabez drily understood from that died in wimbledon house year ago be thinking of mother put in maud boldly indeed be dead be child be called after even to name of morse later said hale with dignity can give married name of young lady mother meanwhile cross be be here said maud opening little bag be swinging on wrist extracted therefrom red morocco case handed to jabez opened gravely beheld long lost ornament be dear mother added miss elli with feigned pathos a though sight be too much for tender heart grandfather gave to mother gave to ended jabez seeing with usual keen gaze that eye be dry behind handkerchief be holding to replied unexpectedly sadly never set eye upon until mr hale saw few day ago permit to explain said hale a watchful a cat a told miss morse still married name muttered solicitor ironically will be told later remarked hale provokingly possessed have first to tell story go on jabez stretched leg put hand in pocket be sure to be interesting hope so rejoined hale making sign to maud that must not talk already know much of let see yes remember told at rose cottage in presence of mr walker miss morse died at wimbledon house in arm of wife gave cross to wife who afterwards gave to nurse bridget burke in turn gave to daughter lesbia who presented to young walker from whom be stolen be right perfectly said hale gravely so can see how miss morse here never set eye on until brought to how did become possessed of will explain that when have heard miss morse story maud put up veil wiped lip be only too anxious to tell declared eagerly jabez cut short be sure be before hearing must like to remind mr hale that declared in presence in presence of mr walker that there be child quite so said hale promptly be not bound to tell anything desire to keep silent think will have to do so if wish young lady to get fifty thousand pound said jabez coolly of course be why be here refer to interview at marlow cottage then be not bound to speak speak now there be not child with miss morse when died at wimbledon house with last breath told where have left child in poor neighbourhood with poor woman who be very good to said maud with tenderness very well acted dear mr tait will ever forget kindness tait humph so be name be name of foster mother who brought up for year have be called maud elli only when mr hale came to see bringing cross did learn true name parentage why did foster mother call elli asked jabez passed off to world a sister child said maud glibly why can not see need said miss elli with swift glance at hale who know human heart mr jabez one so far a know be saying if will permit to tell story can make everything clear be quite certain that can said lawyer politely ironical go on mr tait kept lodging house in bloomsbury mother lived there after leaving husband father who treated very badly be right added turning to hale in saying behaved like brute said hale emphatically then always be brute be sorry to say dear murmured jabez proceed please mother left with mr tait a have very little money went to seek out father at wimbledon one bitterly cold snowy day turned from door nearly perished in snow fortunately good man maud glanced pathetically at hale who tried not to look too conscious took in starving chilled woman mother died be left to mr tait kind care what about cross asked jabez abruptly stifling yawn can explain interposed hale quickly indeed have already done so be given to wife of course of course remember now well jabez turned to maud so remained with mr tait until died then husband adopted a niece with lived retaining name of maud elli there be husband then yes said hale anxiously may know of mr michael tait stockbroking philanthropist oh drawled solicitor quietly same man who lost jewel other day yes admitted hale quite ignorant of how much jabez knew same be poor when miss morse miss elli if like came to wife mr tait kept boarding house to help then tait made lucky speculation be clerk in city began to grow rich before must make fortune mr tait died thus never benefited poor dear be so very kind said maud sweetly however when uncle grew rich uncle queried jabez maud coloured to root of sandy hair have fallen into habit of calling friend mr tait uncle indeed until other day almost thought that be uncle until knew truth a be saying mr jabez uncle for still call mr tait so placed magnificent tombstone over remains when grew rich that be story very interesting one said jabez politely then take that be young lady entitled to fifty thousand pound be understood that when came presented that cross maud pointed to ornament on table that money must be given to certainly said a much to jabez chimed in hale anxiously quite right cross jabez waved hand be only little attempt of mine to introduce romance into dry detail of law of course be mean of identification will be necessary for miss elli to produce certificate of birth baptismal certificate hale bit finger with vexation anticipated that objection interrupted in hard tone knew must make in interest of mr walker must make yes yes fact be that only mr tait besides mother knew where certificate of birth that of baptism be to be found be dead a have heard so so ended jabez rising to stand before fireplace so there will be chance of young lady getting money believe story demanded maud angrily oh yes one have only to look into face dear madam to be certain that speak a believe law be not so tender hearted a be law requires proof amethyst cross be one proof others be required then see cross be stolen have not be in possession year be not very strong proof of identity can make affidavit said hale sharply swearing that mother told where child be to be found quite so doubtless mr tait then in bloomsbury lodging house kept by wife can make affidavit showing how mother left child in wife charge of course assented hale readily tait will do anything ask uncle said maud for must call uncle will only be too glad to see come into kingdom oh be certain of said jabez trimming nail rapidly with little knife to show gratitude will doubtless divide money with oh uncle be too rich to need help said maud virtuously jabez shut knife restored to pocket so made enough by double deal of jewel insurance fraud to tide over financial crisis threatened said deliberately maud turned pale uttered exclamation understand do mr hale asked jabez said man coldly know nothing of tait business rubbish rubbish see here hale young woman before came here to try game on must have made certain that knew nothing of doings a be from mr walker from son from various other people know have taken place in connection with cross from time miss lesbia hale gave to lover insult miss morse interrupted hale furiously miss maud elli mean sneered lawyer stretched out long arm snatched cross away before hale must lay finger on belongs to mr walker niece be mr walker niece panted maud standing up with red furious face since jabez appeared to know so much saw very well that plotting of herself hale have come to untimely end nevertheless like woman persisted in fighting even when game have be irretrievably lost will acknowledge lawyer slipped case containing cross into pocket of coat faced round if mr walker will acknowledge a niece declared will give money what be use of talking in way cried hale angrily know well enough that mr walker want money for will certainly not help poor girl to gain right girl echoed jabez cruelly with eye on maud plain face showed elderly line be judge of lady age brute brute cried miss elli making for door hale come away be not going to stand here be insulted be coming said hale sullenly then turning to lawyer a to veiled accusation bring against oh want to speak clearer very well then mr hale miss maud elli belong to gang of clever thief police have be trying to break up gang for year hitherto have not succeeded now will lay hand on one oh gasped maud trembling what nonsense talk police think so hale have better make yourselves scarce for one of gang have given rest away canning blast shouted hale fiercely ah jabez turned on admit then that speak truth admit nothing muttered hale wiping face a please jabez moved towards door leading into inner room where lord charvington george be concealed canning be now in communication with police learned yesterday that knew got address from young walker have seen to save own skin will turn king evidence miss elli there dear uncle sargent few others including mr petty will be damn cried hale while maud stood trembling at outer door have not strength enough to open will kill with outstretched hand lunged forward to grip lawyer jabez on watch dexterously slipped aside flung open door hale unable to restrain impetus plunged right through entrance into strong arm of george walker that young gentleman picked up like feather carrying into outer room flung into jabez chair maud uttered cry of alarm did not know lord charvington knew george guessed that have overheard whole wicked plot overcome with shame tore blindly at door opened hurriedly fled away pulling down veil to hide shameful face must not meet eye of man whom have wronged so deeply because loved too well none of three men followed a attention be taken up with hale over stood george righteously indignant confounded blackguard cried george between teeth if be not lesbia father must murder set mind at rest on point george said lord charvington who be strangely white be lesbia father george recoiled dazed startled katherine morse be first wife be lesbia father now said george to hale can choke wicked life out of charvington stopped leave to god chapter xxiv part of truth day so after scene in lincoln inn field office party of interested in circumstance connected with amethyst cross assembled in library of court george be present with lesbia by side lesbia still ignorant of true parentage mr walker looking le grim than usual have seat near mr jabez who have come down to hear lord charvington story to witness righting of wrong have be done to lesbia two people who must have be on spot be absent walter hale lady charvington on returning from london where have admitted truth charvington have interviewed wife what took place between be never known for out of shame for lady behaviour charvington said a little a must when explaining fully wife must have be dissatisfied with conversation for left court returned to london in spite of what husband said absolutely refused to be present at rehabilitation of lesbia must be confessed that charvington felt relieved knew wife fiery temper vindictive nature well therefore dreaded lest must make scene besides be manifestly in wrong when given inch lady charvington immediately took ell with zest of ungenerous woman mr walker having be lady schoolfellow have something to say on subject reserved remark until heard charvington story for one be not astonished at lady charvington failure to put in appearance at conference have never credited with kindly heart willing to forgive forget time proved that estimate be right a to hale interview in jabez office have more le done away with necessity for presence admitted truth of charvington statement to jabez after confessing whole of wicked plot to gain possession of mr walker money rather money now belonged to lesbia a mother heiress have be permitted to depart did knowing that police be on track that unless must get out of country must be in danger of arrest if be arrested knew well enough that must suffer long term of imprisonment destiny a mr walker have remarked have be very kind to hour have arrived when demanded return of good fortune have lent hale lurked in byway trembling for payment of bill police a destiny agent be trying to present did best to give police chance of presenting longed like david for wing of dove that might fly away be at rest enough people be present to give charvington opportunity of confessing weakness folly to be plain cowardice to be generous want of courage only george jabez knew what be about to say a already have heard confession in office mr walker lesbia be ignorant although guessed that have be brought there to hear how thing must be righted little suspected way in must be accomplished lord charvington glanced round at attentive face then abruptly plunged into middle of story be not easy one for to tell only sincere repentance made bold enough to open mouth have to right great wrong said with considerable emotion wrong done to lesbia to girl looked surprised clutched george hand tighter yes listen for to understand must go back over twenty year remember that time judith yes said mr walker quietly must go back nearly thirty year philip george be now five twenty married father seven year previous to time speak of begin twenty three year ago said charvington after pause a be then that married sister katherine lesbia turned to girl be now twenty believe yes what have to do with have everything to do with interrupted charvington for be father lesbia guilty cowardly cruel father what mr walker rose slowly with pale face indignant eye do mean to say that girl be sister child yes a such inherits money want said lesbia who be a pale a wintry moon for must scarcely grasp significance of father statement mr walker waved objection aside mind about money said harshly if george marries lesbia money be well bestowed to think that philip must know truth conceal always thought that be more sinned against than sinning philip a hale be evil genius if knew that lesbia be daughter why did permit to call wretch father ' be about to explain said charvington trying to speak quietly remember time judith when must not have called wretch remember also said mr walker sitting down time when loved man know philip how deceived left threw into arm of george father can neither forgive forget cruelty with treated allowed own child poor kate daughter to call father how must how must be wrong judith wrong repeated strongly be wicked cruel what induced to arrange matter so why be not lesbia given into charge be aunt have right to look after expect mr jabez made up matter between pardon said lawyer politely knew nothing for ever so long if have known

charvington must never have married heaven know have learned to know said man bitterly allow to explain one moment put in jabez wish to explain on part to mr walker that knew nothing of truth for year be only when madam addressed directly to mr walker told of theft of amethyst cross how son have obtained from miss hale got idea fancied on account of cross that miss hale might be sister child hale swore if remember that there be child yes said george caustically then tried to pas off maud elli a child so a to get money that plot be doomed to fail from first said jabez waving hand a by then knew too much did not like to declare belief that miss hale be missing child until have further proof in one way proof came to hand when lord charvington appeared in office at request immediately before hale called with miss elli be then pretty well convinced that be miss hale father be right knew for year that have be sister husband said mr walker knowing that must have asked about child knew also why did not ask because from kate letter to saying that child be dangerously ill believed that have died told that said jabez thought so also perhaps have be blind have not done justice to legal
