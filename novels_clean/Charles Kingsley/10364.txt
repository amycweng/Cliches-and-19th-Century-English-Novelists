transcribed by david price email ccxcoventryacuk yeast problem preface to fourth edition book be written nearly twelve year ago so many thing have changed since then that be hardly fair to send into world afresh without notice of improvement if such there be have taken place meanwhile in southern county of england with alone book deal believe that thing be improved twelve year more of new poor law have taught labouring men greater self help independence hope that virtue may not be destroyed in once more by boundless indiscriminate almsgiving have become fashion of day in most parish where there be resident gentry if money be now given away in different form to agricultural poor must be spent in making dwelling fit for honest men to live in then life moral poor rate must be saved to immense amount a see how to carry out such plan have right to complain of others for not seeing meanwhile cottage improvement sanitary reform throughout country district be going on at fearfully slow rate here there high hearted landlord like duke of bedford be doing duty like men in general apathy of educated class be most disgraceful labourer during last ten year be altogether better off free trade have increased food without lessening employment politician who wish to know effect on agricultural life of wise just measure may find in mr grey of dilston answer to query of french government country parson will not need to seek so far will see if be observant man in face figure of school child will see rosier fatter bigger boned race growing up bid fair to surpass in bulk puny ill fed generation of equal perhaps in thew sinew to men who saved europe in old french war if must be so a god grant may there be little fear that labouring men of england will find aristocracy able to lead in battle field to develop agriculture of land at home even better than did grandfather of old war time to thoughtful man point of social horizon be more full of light than altered temper of young gentleman have fault folly still for when will young blood be other than hot blood when one find more more swearing banished from hunting field foul song from university drunkenness gambling from barrack when one find everywhere whether at college in camp by cover side more more young men desirous to learn duty a englishman if possible to do when one hears altered tone toward middle class word benob ' thanks very much to mr thackeray used by in true sense without regard of rank when one watch a at aldershott care kindness of officer toward men over above when one find in profession in of soldier a much a young men who be not only 'in world ' in religious phraseology 'of world ' living god fearing virtuous useful life a christian men must then indeed one look forward with hope confidence to day when men will settle down in life become a holder of land leader of agricultural progress guide guardian of labouring man be bound to speak of farmer a know in south of england in north be man of altogether higher education breeding be even in south much better man than be fashion to believe doubt have given heavy cause of complaint be demoralised a surely if not a deeply a own labourer by old poor law be bewildered to use mildest term by promise of protection from men who knew better worst fault after have be that young old have copied landlord too closely acted on maxim example now that landlord be growing wiser be growing wiser too experience of new poor law experience of free trade be helping to show what always be at heart honest englishman brave persistence industry sturdy independence self help last not least strong sense of justice vast good nature be coming out more more working better better upon land labourer while among son see many growing up brave manly prudent young men with steadily increasing knowledge of what be required of a manufacturer of food employer of human labour country clergy again be steadily improving mean merely in morality for public opinion now demand that a sine qua non in actual efficiency fresh appointment seems to on whole better one than last be gaining more more love respect of flock be becoming more more centre of civilisation morality to parish be working for most part very hard in own way indeed great danger be that must trust too much in outward 'business work do so heartily that must fancy that administration of school charity be chief business literally leave word of god to serve table must that clergyman must learn of be learning already influence over people be not to be gained by perpetual interference in private affair too often inquisitorial irritating degrading to party by showing personal friend of like passion with let priest do let make people feel that speak to feel to a men to men then more cottage enter better if go into neighbour house only a judge inquisitor at best gossip be best a too many be at home in study must too that must recollect duty be among other thing to preach gospel consider firstly whether what commonly preach be gospel good news at not rather worst possible news secondly whether preach at whether sermon be not utterly unintelligible being delivered in unknown tongue also of dulness not to be surpassed whether therefore might not be worth while to spend little time in studying english tongue art of touching human heart mind to return improved tone if truth must be told be owing far more than people be aware to triumph of liberal principle for whig have fought for last forty year of sounder natural philosophy of have be consistent patron england have become whig death of whig party be best proof of victory have ceased to exist because have done work because principle be accepted by ancient enemy because political economy physical science grew up under patronage be leavening thought act of anglican of evangelical alike supplying with method for carrying out own scheme lord shaftesbury truly noble speech on sanitary reform at liverpool be striking proof of extent to evangelical leader have given in adherence to scientific law original preacher of have be called by lordship party heretic infidel materialist rationalist be so provided truth be preached what matter who preaches provided leaven of sound inductive science leaven whole lump what matter who set working better perhaps because more likely to produce practical success that novel truth must be instilled into mind of educated class by men who share somewhat in prejudice superstition doled out to in such measure a will not terrify disgust child will take medicine from nurse hand trustfully enough when must scream into convulsion at sight of doctor so do more harm than medicine must do good doctor meanwhile unless be one of hesiod 'fools who know not how much more half be than whole be content enough to see part of prescription got down by hand whatsoever there be cause for improved tone of landlord class of young men of what be commonly called aristocracy be growing moral earnestness be in great part owing that justice may be done on side to anglican movement how much soever neo anglicanism may have failed a ecclesiastical theological system how much soever may have proved by national dislike of by defection of master mind to be radically un english have at least awakened hundred perhaps thousand of cultivated men woman to ask whether god sent into world merely to eat drink be merry to have 'their soul saved ' upon spurgeon method after die have taught answer to question not unworthy of english christian anglican movement when dy out will leave behind at least legacy of grand old author disinterred of art of music of church too school cottage charitable institution will form so many centre of future civilisation will entitle to respect if not to allegiance of future generation more than have sown in heart of young gentleman young lady seed will not perish though may develop into form little expected by who sowed will develop at least into virtue more stately reverent more chivalrous self sacrificing more genial human than can be learnt from religion of stock exchange reigned triumphant for year day in popular pulpit have said that neo anglicanism have proved failure a seventeenth century anglicanism did cause of failure book have tried to point out not one word be spoken of therein have be drawn from personal too intimate experience now peace to ash be so great sin to have be dazzled by splendour of impossible ideal be so great sin to have have courage conduct enough to attempt enforcing of ideal in face of prejudice of whole nation if ideal be too narrow for english nation for modern need of mankind be that so great sin be other extant ideal then so very comprehensive doe mr spurgeon then take so much broader nobler view of capacity destiny of race than great genius john henry newman if world can not answer that question now will answer promptly enough in five twenty year meanwhile let not party system have conquered boast too loudly let take warning by whig suspect a many looker on more than suspect that triumph may be a with whig ruin that
