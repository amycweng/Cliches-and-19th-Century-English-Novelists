reached ranald ear so amused that rested not day night till have caught hapless bard brought in triumph into waterford there compelled at sword point to sing to housecarles milesian version of great historical event when harper in fear trembling came to story of ranald own death at brian boru hand then jolly old viking laughed till tear ran down face instead of cutting off teague head gave cup of goodly wine made own harper thenceforth bade send for wife child sing to day especially song of clontarf own death treating very much in fact a english royalty during last generation treated irish

waltheof astonishment who have never before seen discipline knight wheeled round men at arm followed waltheof atheling be left to on lincoln heath chapter xxiv how archbishop aldred died of sorrow in tragedy of next few month hereward took part must be looked at near in order to understand somewhat of men who be afterwards mixed up with for weal woe when william went back to south confederate child edgar atheling gospatrick friend have come south again from durham be undignified confession of weakness if norman have likened to mouse coming out when cat went away none must blame so did osbiorn dane landing in humber mouth be met say anglo saxon chronicle by child edgar earl waltheof marlesweyn earl gospatrick with men of northumberland riding marching joyfully with immense army not

norman fought day after day with energy of despair asked leave to put forth body of archbishop young waltheof who be pious man insisted that leave must be given so archbishop coffin be thrust forth of

edwin morcar meanwhile be not told be struggling against william at stafford helping edric wild welshman to besiege chester probably be aiding insurrection if not at two point still at other of great earldom of mercia chester seemed to triumph for while during autumn of greater part of england seemed lost to william many norman packed up plunder went back to france whose heart be too stout to return showed mercy to english even a william showed none to crush heart of people by massacre mutilation devastation be only hope of invader thoroughly did work whenever have chance chapter xxv how hereward found wiser man in england than there have be certain men so great that who describes in word much more pretend to analyze inmost feeling must be very great man incur accusation of presumption such great man be william of normandy one of unfathomable master personage who must not be rashly dragged on stage genius of bulwer in attempting to draw took care with wise modesty not to draw in too much detail to confess always that there be much beneath behind in william character none even of contemporary must guess still more modest than bulwer be chronicler bound to be one may fancy for once in way what william thought be when brought evil news of york for know what act be acted up to thought hunting be say in forest of dean when first heard that england north of watling street have broken loose that be king of only isle did a when hunting in forest of rouen got news of harold coronation play with bow stringing unstringing nervously till have made up mighty mind then did go home to lodge there spread on rough oak board parchment map of england child must deign to learn from now be then good enough to guide army to victory because eye of great general looked upon a pored over map by light of bog deal torch rush candle what must see upon three separate blaze of insurrection from northwest to east along watling street at chester edric wild thane who according to domesday book have lost vast land in shropshire algitha harold widow blethwallon welsh white mantle swarming along chester street not a usually to tear ravage like wild cat of own rock fast friend by

eastward round stafford centre of mercia blaze of furious english valor morcar edwin brother must be there a earl if too be man then in fen kesteven what meant news that hereward of st omer be come again army with that be levying war on frenchman in name of sweyn king of denmark of england be outlaw desperado boastful swash buckler thought william may be to found out in after year that have mistaken man north at york in rear of three insurrection lay gospatrick waltheof marlesweyn with northumbrian host durham be lost comyn burnt therein york so boasted william malet must hold out for year must not need to hold out for so long last worst of hung on eastern coast mighty fleet of sweyn who claimed england a of right foe whom have part feared ever since set foot on english soil collision with whom have be inevitable along be come at last where must strike blow william knew may be that dane have be defeated at norwich knew doubt not for spy told everything that have purposed entering wash to prevent junction between hereward be impossible must prevent junction between edwin morcar men determined seems for did to cut english line in two marched upon stafford a centre so seems for record of campaign be fragmentary confused contradictory norman fought have time to write history english beaten crushed died left sign only chronicler of time be monk little must ordericus vitalis florence of worcester of peterborough faithful a be who filled up sad page of anglo saxon chronicle little must see understand of masterly strategy be conquering england for norman monk in order that following army like black raven might feast upon prey others won for to death of abbot squabble of monastery journey of prelate to rome be more important than manoeuvre decided life freedom of ten of thousand so all know be that william fell upon morcar men at stafford smote with great destruction rolling fugitive west east toward edwin perhaps at chester certainly toward hereward in fen at stafford met fugitive from york malet wife child with dreadful news that dane have joined gospatrick york be lost william burst into fiendish fury accused wretched men of treason cut off hand thrust out eye threw malet into prison stormed on north lay at pontefract for three week bridge over aire be broken down at last crossed marched on york man opposed dane be gone down to humber gospatrick waltheof heart have failed have retired before great captain florence of worcester say that william bought earl osbiorn off giving much money leave to forage for fleet along coast that osbiorn be outlawed on return to denmark doubtless william must have so done if must doubtless angry disappointed english raised such accusation against earl believing to be true be not simpler cause of osbiorn conduct to be found in plain fact have sailed from denmark to put sweyn brother on throne found on arrival that gospatrick waltheof have seized in name of edgar atheling what have to do more in england save what did go out into humber winter safely there waiting till sweyn must come with reinforcement in spring then william have revenge destroyed in language of scripture life of land far wide farm be burnt over owner head growing crop upon ground horse be houghed cattle driven off while of human death misery there be end yorkshire much of neighboring county lay waste for next nine year did not recover fully till several generation after dane have boasted that must keep yule at york william kept yule there instead sent to winchester for regalia of confessor in midst of blackened ruin while english for mile around wandered starving in snow feeding on carrion on rat mouse at last upon other corps sat in royal robe gave away land of edwin morcar to liegeman thus like roman from whom derived strategy civilization made solitude called peace did not give away waltheof land only part of gospatrick wanted gospatrick loved waltheof wanted likewise therefore through desert have made forced way up to tee second time over snow covered moor time st cuthbert have sent no fog being satisfied presumably with william orthodox attachment to st peter rome so conqueror treated quietly with waltheof gospatrick who lay at durham gospatrick got back ancestral earldom from tee to tyne paid down for much hard money treasure bought in fact said waltheof got back earldom much of morcar from fen to tee be to be province then to astonishment alike of norman english may be of married judith conqueror niece became once more william loved trusted friend slave seems inexplicable at first sight inexplicable save a instance of fascination strong sometimes exercise over weak then william turned southwest edwin wild edric dispossessed thane of shropshire wilder blethwallon welshman be still harrying slaying have just attacked shrewsbury william must come upon by way thought not of so over backbone of england by way probably of halifax huddersfield through pathless moor bog down towards plain of lancashire cheshire pushed over on soldier from plain of sunny france must not face cold rain bog hideous gorge valiant peasant still finest shrewdest race of men in england who set upon in wooded glen rolled stone on from limestone crag prayed to be dismissed to go home coward might go back said william must go on if must not ride must walk whoever lagged must be foremost cheered by example army at last debouched upon cheshire flat then fell upon edwin a have fallen upon morcar drove wild welsh through pas of mold up into native hill laid waste with fire sword for many mile a domesday book testifies to day strengthened wall of chester trampled out last ember of rebellion went down south to salisbury king of england once again why did not push on at once against one rebellion left alight that of hereward fenmen may be that understood may be that meant to treat with sweyn a have done if story be true with osbiorn be more likely that must do more that army after so swift long campaign required rest may be that time of service of many of mercenary be expired be that a may mustered at old sarum roman british burgh still stand on down side rewarded according to desert from land of conquered english how soon hereward knew how passed winter of can not tell to must have be winter of bitter perplexity be impossible to get information from edwin news from york be
