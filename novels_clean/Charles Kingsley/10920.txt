have business to do so object on principle to men notion of what copying nature mean deny talent be ready to confess that there be more imagination more honest work in picture than in one in room hysterical grinning joy upon mother face be miracle of truth have seen expression more than once doctor see often in sudden revulsion from terror agony to certainty peace only marvel where ever met general effect be unpleasing marred by patch of sheer ugliness like child foot there be same mistake in picture whatever be be not beautiful magnificence of surface colouring will make up in eye for wilful ugliness of form say that nature be beautiful therefore nature can not have be truly copied general effect must have be beautiful also never found out fallacy till other day when looking at

yes have simply under pretence of following nature caricatured into woman twenty year older than be did ever see modern portrait more perfectly expressed character more completely fulfilled requirement laid down few evening since never that make more cross with wilful mistake of have painted wrinkle why not if be there because have painted face not one twentieth of size of life what right have to cram into small space mark nature have spread over far larger one why not again if diminished mark in proportion just what man must do without making so small a to be invisible save under microscope result be that have caricatured wrinkle a friend have in horrible knuckle of shem wife besides deny utterly assertion that one be bound to paint what be there on very fallacy be making shipwreck not paint what be there be man who talk of art being highest when copy exactly therefore must paint not what be there what see there forget that human being be men with two eye not daguerreotype lens with one eye so be contriving striving to introduce into picture very defect of daguerreotype stereoscope be required to correct comprehend forget that double vision of two eye give softness indistinctness roundness to outline exactly so therefore while for distant landscape motionless already softened by atmosphere daguerreotype be invaluable will hing else summer work at yet for taking portrait in true sense will be always useless not only for reason just gave for one pre raphaelites have forgotten because feature can not be in focus at once oh be not speaking of art for aught know may overcome that for be mere defect in instrument what mean be try to represent a still what never yet be still for thousandth part of second be human face a seen by spectator who be perfectly still man ever yet be dear fellow see that what painter call idealising portrait be if be wisely done really painting for face see know love ever shifting feature with expression varying more rapidly than gleam of diamond on finger feature in turn be looking at with ever shifting eye while perhaps if be face love have lingered over dozen other expression equally belonging to be hanging in memory blending with actual picture on retina till little angle be somewhat rounded little wrinkle somewhat softened little shade somewhat blended with surrounding light so that sum total of what see be intended by heaven to see be something far softer lovelier younger perhaps thank heaven than must look if head be screwed down in vice to look with one eye at head screwed down in vice also though even thanks to muscle of eye must not produce required ugliness only possible method of fulfilling pre raphaelite ideal must be to set petrified cyclops to paint petrified brother be

forgetting about fra dolcino italy priest tyrant set down in black white just what saw provided of course that have patience first to see same be none other than ghastly chasm across thurnall have be so miraculously swept on night of shipwreck same ghastly chasm ghastly now no longer a elsley looked down beauty below invited coolness also for sun beat on flat rock above till scorched foot dazzled eye crisped up blackening sea weed while sea snail crept to hide under bladder tangle nothing dared to peep stir save certain grain of gunpowder seemed to have gone mad so merrily did hop about upon surface of fast evaporating salt pool that wonder indeed elsley stooped to examine drew back hand with ugh gesture of disgust when found that be nasty little insect for elsley held fully poet right to believe that thing be not very good none indeed save such a suited eclectic fastidious taste to hold on high aesthetic ground of course toad spider in a much abhorrence a doe boarding school girl however finding rock ledge formed natural ladder down scrambled gingerly enough for be active courageous man once down will do justice to say that for five whole minute forgot about fra dolcino what be better about also chasm may have be fifteen foot deep above about breadth below wave have hollowed into dark overhanging cavern just in front of huge boulder spanned crack formed natural doorway through saw like picture set in frame far off blue sea softening into blue sky among brown eastern haze amid haze single ship hung motionless like white cloud nearer black cormorant floated sleepily along dived rose again nearer again long line of flat tide rock glittering quivering in heat sloped gradually under wave till ended in half sunken bed of olive oar weed bent tangled stem into hundred graceful curve swayed to fro slowly sleepily low swell slid whispering among floating palm slipped on toward cavern mouth a if asking wistfully so elsley fancied when must be time for to return to cool shade hide from blinding blaze outside when eye be enough accustomed to shade within withdrew gladly from glaring sea glaring tide rock to wall of chasm to curved polished sheet of stone rich brown with snow white vein on danced for ever dappled network of pale yellow light to crusted bed of pink coralline to cavern in dark cranny of hung branching sponge tuft of purple sea moss to strip of clear white sand bestrewn with shell to pool gay flower garden of hue where branching sea weed reflected blue light from point like thousand damasked sword blade while among dahlia chrysanthemum many mimic of earth born flower spread bloom of crimson purple lilac creamy grey half buried among feathered weed a brightly coloured a strange gaudy fish shot across from side to side chased other in out of hidden cell within without be at rest silence be broken only by timid whisper of swell by chime of dropping water within unseen cave what different rest without lying breathless stupefied sun stricken in blinding glare within coolness refreshing sleep without simple broad vast within various with infinite richness of form colour hairoun alraschid bower looking out upon bother fellow why will go on analysing figuring in way why not let blessed place tell what mean instead of telling what think why be actually writing verse though not about fra dolcino how rest yon rock whoso day bath be done with broad bright sight beneath broad bright sun like sea nymph tired on cushioned moss sleeping yet nearer drawn beneath purple tress from down bent brow find slowly weeping so many heart for cruel man caress must only pine pine yet must bear gallant front beneath life gaudy glare silly fellow do think that nature have time to think of far fetched conceit a while be making that rock peopling with million tiny living thing of not one falleth to ground without father knowledge more beautiful than sea nymph whom ever fancied for after can not fancy whole sea nymph perhaps in case must make one only very little scrap of outside if a boast be inspired by creative spirit tell what creative spirit say about rock not such verse a that lesson of really feel pretty enough be perhaps in haste to say pretty thing just because be pretty have not cared to condemn out of own mouth why be sulky sir with mr vavasour very morning after passed because must look over washing book while wanted to hear about fra dolcino why though be up to knee among dirty shirt when went out did not give one parting kiss must have transfigured virtuous drudgery for into sacred pleasure one be heartily glad to see disturbed cross though may look at by sturdy step jolly whistle burst in on from other end of chasm a tom thurnall with old smock frock over coat large basket on arm come stumbling hopping towards dropping now then on hand knee turning over on back to squeeze head into muddy crack then withdraw with salt water dripping down nose elsley closed eye rested head on hand in somewhat studied pose a wished not to be interrupted may not have be altogether unpardonable to pretend sleep however sleeping posture have exactly opposite effect to designed ah mr vavasour humph slowly if not sulkily admire taste sir charming summerhouse old triton have vacated for use let advise not to go to sleep in why then sir because be business of mine of course tide have turned already if breeze spring up old triton will be back again in hurry in rage also may possibly lose good patient elsley who knew nothing about tide save that moon wooed ocean such important fact thanked coolly enough returned to meditative attitude tom saw that be in seventh heaven went on have not gone three step before pulled up short slapping hand together once a man doe who have found what want then plunged up to knee in rock pool then began working very gently at something under water elsley watched for full five minute with so much curiosity that despite of asked what be doing tom have whole face under water did not hear till elsley have repeated question only rare zoophyte said at last lifting dripping visage gasping for breath then dived again inexplicable pedantry of science thought elsley to while tom worked on steadfastly at last rose taking out phial from basket be about to deposit in something invisible stay moment really have roused curiosity by earnestness may see what be for have taken so much trouble tom held out on finger piece of slimy crust size of halfpenny elsley must only shrug shoulder nothing to sir doubt not worth guinea to even if be only to mount bit of a microscopic object so mingle business with science said elsley rather in contemptuous tone why not must live father too be a honest way of making money a other poach in man manor for game what be game what possible attraction in bit of dirt can make men spend money on will see said tom dropping into phial of salt water offering to elsley with pocket magnifier judge for elsley did so beheld new wonder living plant of crystal studded with crystal bell from of waved crown of delicate arm be first time elsley have ever seen one of exquisite zoophyte stud rock tuft of weed be most beautiful said at length humph why must not mr vavasour write poem about why not indeed thought elsley be business of mine man le often wonder why poet take to microscope tell little more about wonderful thing be here already not about be not perhaps never will be well said elsley after look after thing have human interest in know that have to for instance be thing must write about if have turn for verse not about human nature of know be afraid little too much already always like to read old darwin 'loves of plant bosh a be in scientific point of view amuses one fancy without making one lose one temper a one must when one begin to analyse microscopic ape called self friend must like then old cosmogony edda veda said elsley getting interested a most people did after five minute talk with cynical doctor suppose must not say much for science a poetry be just what ask for expression of thoughtful spirit who looked round upon nature with awe struck childlike eye asked of heaven earth question be how came to be ' may be fault while admire can not sympathise with to zoophyte be a being of sphere till can create link in own mind between humanity be a nothing in eye there be link enough sir doubt chain of iron brass too believe then in development theory of havestiges doctor who have bread to earn never commit to theory meant be that little zoophyte life by same law a that sea weed so forth teach doctor certain little rule concerning life death will have chance soon of seeing at work on most grand poetical indeed altogether tragic scale what do mean when cholera come here a will at present pace before end of summer then will have zoophyte rising up in judgment against if have not profited by leaf out of book cholera said elsley in startled voice forgetting tom parable in new

jarred with beautiful be idol cholera repeated hope not wish have not mentioned mr thurnall be very sorry that did so if offends have thought that forewarned be forearmed after be business of mine if have extra labour a will have will have extra experience will be fair set off even if board of guardian vote extra remuneration a ought to do be struck dumb first by certainty tom word expressed next by coolness of temper at last stammered out good heaven mr thurnall talk of frightful scourge so disgusting too in character a matter of profit loss be sordid cold hearted dear sir if let think much more talk about matter in other tone must face thing poorly enough when came will have work enough to keep head about end of august beginning of september must not lose beforehand by indulging in horror disgust other emotion perfectly justifiable in layman be not doctor men depends very much on what ' man mean men with human sympathy compassion oh mean by man man with human strength dear sir one may be too busy at doing good too though be not line save professionally because be only way of earning money one may be too busy at doing good to have time for compassion if while be cutting man leg off thought of pain be suffering thank heaven said elsley that be not lot to become medical man tom looked at with quaintest smile flush of mingled anger contempt have be rising in a heard ex bottle boy talking sentiment only went on quietly sir with more delicate sensibility may thank heaven that did not become medical man life must have be one of torture disgust agonising sense of responsibility do not see that must thank heaven for sufferer sake also will not shock again by talking of amputation even in smallest matter even if be merely sending medicine to old maid suppose that imagination be preoccupied by thought of old age suffering disappointed hope regretful dream of bygone youth beauty love tender fancy might well spring out of such mournful spectacle must not be too likely pardon bathos to end by sending elderly gentleman medicine after so either frightfully increasing suffering ending once for tom said in most quiet natural tone without even twinkle of wicked eye elsley heard begin with reddening face a went on red have turned to purple then to deadly yellow till making half step forward cried fiercely sir then stopped suddenly for foot slipped upon polished stone on face fell into pool at thurnall foot well for of goose said tom inwardly a went to pick up verily believe be going to strike must have done for of be fool to say temptation be so exquisite must have come day vavasour staggered up of own accord dashing away tom proffered hand be rushing off without word not so mr john briggs said tom making up mind in moment that must have out now never that might have everything to fear from vavasour if let go home furious part thus sir will meet again if will foamed vavasour will end in death of one of by other potion can doctor sir thank

beautiful match show that be clever therefore successful person do take for sordid schemer like loved what be worthy of won because deserved then having won treat a deserves said tom with cool searching look before vavasour eye fell again understand mr john briggs be of consequence to what call be of consequence to must not have patient in parish whom can not cure for can not cure broken heart though will be simple enough to come to for medicine will have chance will never enter house will not ruin sir by bill tom made answer to fresh insult have game to play take care what say briggs remember that after be in power have better remind plainly of fact mean to make tool will die first believe that said tom who be very near adding that must be sorry to work with such tool tool be lancet drug said quietly have to say refers to suit purpose to become principal medical man in neighbourhood be to tout for introduction for be to be so very kind a to allow to finish sentence just a must allow other gentleman because wish for practice patient power will be so kind a to treat henceforth a one high minded man must treat to whom be obliged for know john briggs a well a said tom drawing up to full height look in face if can ere deny be while knew a honourable man a kind hearted man a ever be that now considering circumstance under meet have more reason to trust than have prima facie to trust vavasour answered not word good bye then said tom drawing aside from step mr vavasour will be anxious about mind with regard to first of sir then with regard to other matter a long only a long a remember that be john briggs of whitbury will be first to forget there be hand for old acquaintance ' sake vavasour took proffered hand coldly paused moment then wrung in silence hurried away home have played ace ill after said tom sitting down to consider a for whether must have played be business of mine now madam might have be may see to did play ill for if did may try new lead yet ought to have twitted about wife if be venomous may only make matter worse still worse if be suspicious think be either in old time vanity will make man so may have made well must only ingratiate more with find out too whether have secret a well a what be most afraid of be having told plainly that be in power be apt to make sprat of size flounce desperately in mere hope of proving whale after if be only to miserable self never mind ca break tackle besides gripe of hand seemed to indicate that poor wretch be beat thought let off easily a indeed be will hope so now zoophyte for turn with to tell truth however tom be looking for more than zoophyte have be doing so at dead low tide since be wrecked have heard nothing yet of belt note have not be presented at london bank nobody in village have be spending more money than usual for cunning tom have contrived already to know how many pint of ale man of whom have least doubt have drunk perhaps after belt may have be torn off in life struggle may have be for moment in grace hand then have be swept into sea what more likely what more likely in case that sinking by weight be wedged away in cranny of rock so spring tide after spring tide tom search more carefully because others be searching too for waif stray from wreck sad relic of mortality find at time a others do once even dressing case full of ring pin chain belonged fancied to gay young bride with whom have waltzed many time on deck a slipped along before soft trade wind belt sent dressing case to lloyd underwriter searched on in vain neither must find that one else have forestalled very afternoon sulky disheartened determined to waste more time about matter strode home vowing signal vengeance against thief if caught will catch west country yokel to fancy that can do tom thurnall be adding insult to injury a sam weller parrot have now shortest way home lay across shore then along beach up step by little waterfall past mr harvey door at door sat grace sewing in sun looked up bowed a passed smiling modestly little dreaming of what be passing in mind when very lovely girl smiled bowed to tom must need do same to whereon added beg pardon sir have heard anything of money lost have be so ashamed to think of thing happening here tom evil spirit be roused have heard anything of miss harvey for seem to only person in place who know anything about matter sir cried grace fixing great startled eye full on why ma'be said tom with courtly smile may possibly recollect if will so far tax memory that have in hand at least moment when did kindness to save life a be kind enough to inform must recover when be worthy of suppose have not yet risen in eye to required state of conversion regeneration swinging impatiently away walked on really afraid lest must say something rude grace half called after then suddenly checking rushed in to mother with wild pale face what be mr thurnall have be saying to about belt money lost about what have be rude to bad man cried mr harvey dropping pie dish in confusion taking long while to pick up piece about belt money lost why speak mother belt money ah recollect now have lost money say of course have how must know anything recollect there be talk of though what matter what say be quite passed away will swear when carried up mother mother say that know about have in hand oh wicked wretch false ungrateful slanderous child of wrath with adder poison tinder lip child though be poor be honest let slander rob of good name send to prison if will can not rob of soul will be silent will turn other cheek commit cause to one above who pleads for orphan widow will not strive cry child oh mr harvey began fussing over smashed pie dish will not strive cry mother said grace who have recovered usual calm must have cause for strange word do recollect seeing with belt belt what be belt know nothing about belt tell be villain slanderer oh that must have come to to have child fair fame blasted by wretch come nobody know where from have be doing nobody know what for aught know mother mother know harm of if be mistaken god forgive if be mistaken went on mr harvey still over pie dish grace gave answer be deep in thought recollected now that a have gone up path from cove on eventful morning have seen willis thurnall whispering earnestly together recollected now for first time that there have be certain sadness perplexity almost reserve about willis ever since good heaven must suspect too must find out at least sooner have mother fussed away talking angrily to herself into back kitchen than grace put on bonnet shawl went forth to find captain in hour returned lip be firm set cheek pale eye red with weeping said nothing to mother who for part did not seem inclined to allude again to matter where have be child look quite poorly eye red wind be very cold mother said went into room mother looked sharply after muttered to herself grace went in sat down on bed what coldness be at heart said aloud to herself trying to smile must not sat on bedside without taking off bonnet shawl hand hanging listlessly by side head drooping on bosom till mother called to tea then be forced to rouse went out composed utterly wretched tom walked up homeward very ill at ease have played to use nomenclature two trump card running be by mean satisfied that have played well have right certainly to be satisfied with move for have be made in somewhat evil spirit certainly for very disinterested end be view of matter however never entered mind there be only that general dissatisfaction with be though men try hard to deny fact none other than supernatural sting of conscience tried to lay to soul flattering unction that might after be of use to mr vavasour by using power over husband knew in secret heart that move of in direction be likely only to make matter worse to day explosion might only have sent home hapless vavasour in more irritable temper than ever thinking over many thing backward forward saw own way so little that actually condescended to go pump frank headley so termed after be only like asking advice of good man because did not feel quite good enough to advise curate be preparing to sally forth after frugal dinner morning spent at school in parish secularities afternoon till dusk be devoted to visiting poor night not to sleep to reading sermon writing thus by sitting up till two in morning rising again at six for private devotion before walking mile half up to church for morning service frank headley burnt candle of life at end very effectually showed that did so by pale cheek red eye ah said tom a entered a usual poor nature be being robbed murdered by rich grace what do mean now asked frank smiling for have become accustomed enough to tom quaint parable though have to scold often enough for irreverence nature say 'after dinner sit awhile even dumb animal hear voice lie by for siesta when stomach be full grace say up rush out moment have swallowed food if get indigestion abuse poor nature for lay blame on adam fall ' be irreverent good sir a usual be unjust also time how then unjust to grace a phrase answered frank with quaint sad smile assure on honour that grace have nothing whatsoever to do with 'rushing out ' just now simply desire to do good work that may be seen of men hate going out must like to sit read whole afternoon be afraid lest dissenter must say have not be to see so so for last three day so off go credit to why have frank dared upon month acquaintance to lay bare own heart thus to man of creed at because suppose amid difference have found one point of likeness between thurnall have found that tom at heart be truly genuine man sincere faithful to own scheme of universe how man through eventful life have be enabled to bate not jot of heart hope steer right onward be problem frank longed curiously yet fearfully withal to solve there be many quality in frank must not admire long to imitate whence have come be problem at looked trembling a many new thought crossed longed too to learn from tom somewhat at least of savoir faire power of becoming thing to men st paul have for want of frank have failed saw too with surprise tom have gained in one month more real insight into character of parishioner than have done in twelve besides there be craving of lonely heart for human confidence friendship so befell that frank spoke out inmost thought that day thought shame befell also that thurnall when heard said in heart what noble honest fellow be when answered enigmatically oh quite agree with grace have nothing to do with only referred to source because thought must do so ought to be ashamed of dishonesty then know view of case be that rush out after dinner for very same reason that yankee storekeeper doe from will forgive if say of course can not speak too plainly to conceit yankee fancy important person that commercial world will stand still unless fly back to help after ten minute gobbling with month full of pork pickled peach fancy so important in line that spiritual world will stand still unless bolt back to help in like wise substitute half cooked mutton chop for pork case be exact parallel parallel doe not hold good doctor yankee go back to store to earn money for not to keep commerce alive while go for utterly disinterested motif see do said frank if think that fancy better man than yankee mistake at least will confess be not working for money have notion of reward have want to be paid by material dollar payable next month by spiritual dollar payable when die see great difference only slight difference between what be material what be spiritual seem to from can hear in pulpit to be only two different sort of pleasant thing to be sought after alike simply because be pleasant self interest if will forgive seems to spring of only to do justice be farther sighted more prudent man than yankee storekeeper having more exquisitely developed notion of what true self interest be be content to wait little longer than stab with jest thurnall little know how word hit home well then to turn from matter of know nothing must keep in give parish business to do at home be come to consult a spiritual pastor master frank looked little astonished be alarmed be not going to confess own sin only other people pray then know far more of already than can cure be worn out with daily discovery of fresh evil wherever go then why not comfort by trying to find little fresh good wherever go frank sighed perhaps though care for sort of good except own sort of good be fastidious well have excuse can understand poor fellow like who have be dragged through slum sewer of wicked world for fifteen year more being very well content with sort of good can light on not particular a to quantity quality perhaps be healthier state of mind if can only find said good vulturine nose smell nothing corruption be credit to possessor must be pleasant at least to find good in man one ca do in one study mixing with be only plan doubt be inconsistent enough more see of le trust yet more see of more like can solve that paradox from book will try said frank generally have more than one to think over when go surely there be men so fallen that be utterly insensible to good very likely there be saying in world may not be only never saw one will tell story may apply a like when be on texan expedition raw to soldiering camping have to sleep in low ground suffered terribly from miasma deadly cold be when came man who once got chilled through with just died be lying on bare ground one night chilly enough be for be short of clothes have lost buffalo robe fell asleep on waking next morning found covered up in comrade blanket even to coat while be sitting shivering in shirt sleeve cold fog have come down in night man have stripped sat night with death staring in face to save life reason gave be that if one of must die be better older must go first not youngster like said tom lowering voice that man be murderer murderer yes drunken gambling cut throat rowdy a ever grew ripe for gallows now will tell that there be nothing in man what devil put there frank sat meditating awhile on strange story be moreover true one then looked up with something like tear in eye did not die not saw die afterwards shot through heart without time even to cry out have not forgotten what did for that night will tell what sir believe that god have forgotten frank be silent for few moment then tom changed subject want to know what can tell about mr vavasour hardly anything be sorry to say be at house at tea two three time when first came have very agreeable evening talk on art poetry believe offended by hinting that ought to come to church never doe since then acquaintance have ceased suppose will say a usual that played card badly there also not at said tom who be disposed to take one part against elsley if clergyman have not right to tell man see what right have of kind only added with one of quaint smile clergyman if compels man to deal at store be bound to furnish with article want need like for 'wanting ' have meaning with something that find by experience doe good so learns to like because know that need a patient do physic wish patient must do so by mine unfortunately half of seem to not to know what disease be other half think be diseased at well said tom drily perhaps of be more right than fancy man know own business best if be so must go about somewhat differently from what most of poor creature do do think so fancy that not one of doe wrong thing what know to be wrong just a well a do be much more ashamed frightened about already than can ever make by preaching at do do judge of others by then must have clergyman never warn people of sin if be 'd much sooner take sin for granted say to 'now friend know be ninety nine out of hundred of not such bad fellow at bottom must like to be good if only knew how so will tell a far a know though know much about matter for truth be must have hundred trouble day never felt in life must be very hard thing to keep body soul together to get little pleasure on side grave without

gentleman will keep secret of course if find ca cure complaint why can go away try elsewhere ' so doctor model sermon end in proposing private confession of course thing will do good without red rag of official name sends cackling off like frightened turkey such private confession a be going on between now here be confessing to unorthodoxy ignorance said frank for really believe know more about matter than at may be wrong fault of cloth seems to to be that apply medicine without deigning most of to take least diagnosis of case how must cure man without first examining what be matter with so say old casuist of whom have read enough must say too much satisfy deal with action motif so forth go down to one root of wrong be same in man be getting beyond why do not apply little of worldly wisdom same casuist taught to tell truth have tried in past year found that medicine must not act humph well that must depend again on previous diagnosis of human nature being correct old monk must say must know about a much of human nature a so many daw in steeple still must say that be matter with old heale be matter also with vavasour believe from heart that be humph then know symptom of complaint know that never come to church nothing more be really speaking in confidence surely have heard of disagreement between mr vavasour never assure shock be exceedingly sorry then said word about whole parish talk of answered tom who be surprised at fresh proof of little confidence aberalva put in parson ah said frank sadly be last person in parish to hear news be very distressing very to honour to tell truth a medical man be concerned in matter for be growing quite ill from unhappiness can not cure so come to a soul doctor to do what body doctor can not frank sat pondering for minute then set on task for be a little fit a man by own showing what do know of disagreement between man wife one have delicacy about offering comfort must bestow confidence on before can use while while a cause of disease be what ought to treat not unhappiness be only symptom of spoken like wise doctor to tell truth thurnall have influence over mr vavasour see mean of getting if recognised authority a parish priest then must see way let be a bad a might must have fixed point from to work with free thinking notion know well one can judge too easily from poem must look on a pedant

give up pulling out must not be without more ado must be happy enough to pull poor vavasour out if must let till belief that can do how can even begin how can expect to believe if have proof there be proof enough in bible elsewhere if will accept if refuse to examine into credential fault be not mine really wish to be hard must not do same if one refused to employ because chose to deny that be legally qualified practitioner not so badly put what must do in case go on quietly curing neighbour till began to alter mind a to qualification came in to be cured here be difference between be not bound to attend to one who send for while think that be carry notion little too far for expect to kill by day well said frank with something of lazy oxford tone be intended to save speaker trouble of giving argument when have already made up mind think that have so done well if thought bound to doctor man willy nilly a do must certainly go to show at least that understood complaint must be first step towards letting cure how else on earth do fancy that paul cured corinthian about whom have be reading lately be too going to quote scripture against be glad to find that study extend to st paul to tell truth sermon last sunday puzzled must not comprehend on showing how paul got wonderful influence over pagan evidently have a how to get influence be very favourite study of mine borrowed book

power be continually appealing to power what can mean by that must do have done what professed to do promised to make poor heathen rascal of greek better wiser happier men suppose made so then there be doubt of commission authority anything else say did not require credential for be credential read known of one have made good men of out of bad one be proof enough whose apostle be well said frank half sadly might say great deal of course on other side of question prefer hearing what layman think about will be angry if tell honestly did ever find angry at anything said will do justice to say well what layman say be if parson have authority of boast why use if have commission to make bad people good must have power too for whose commission claim be not likely must suppose to set man to do what can not do can do if people must submit to come round again to same point so doe how to get to listen tried to find out how paul achieved that first step when looked told plainly enough by becoming thing to men by showing people that understood knew be matter with now do go do likewise by vavasour then exercise authority like practical man if have power to bind loose a told last sunday bind fellow ungovernable temper loose from real slavery be in to miserable conceit self indulgence then if doe not believe in beacerdotal power be even greater fool than take for honestly will try god

peat slime if twenty first chapter of book of revelation eighth verse be to be taken a stand doom have not altered since odin time unless to become still worse tom came up over home close through barton gate through farm yard stopped at last at porch front door be open door beyond ere knocked stopped looking in silence at picture held spellbound for moment by rich yet quiet beauty tom be

maiden blush rose tall spire of blue monkshood one head of scarlet lychnis like spark of fire behind dark blue sea faded into pale blue sky at window stood sofa of old maroon dark hue throwing out in strong relief two figure who sat upon when tom have once looked at looked at nothing else there sat sick girl head nestling upon shoulder of grace harvey tall delicate thing of seventeen with thin white cheek hectic spot aflame on long fair curl mingled lovingly with grace dark tress a sat cheek against cheek hand in hand eye be closed tom thought at first that be asleep there be quiet smile about pale lip now then left hand left grace to move toward leaf full of strawberry lay on grace lap tom must see that be listening intently to grace who told told in sweet measured voice of hers head erect face in full blaze of sunshine great eye looking out far away beyond sea beyond sky into infinite only beheld tom have approached unheard across farm yard straw stood looked fill attitude of two girl be so graceful that be loth to disturb loth too to disturb certain sunny calm warmed at once softened stout heart wished too scarce knew why to hear what grace be saying a listened voice be so distinct delicate in modulation that word came clearly to ear be beautiful old legend of st dorothea so did sort of dreadful thing to then led away to die stood laughing there after little time there came boy prettiest boy that ever be seen on earth in hand basket full of fruit flower more beautiful than tongue can tell said 'dorothea sends out of heavenly garden told of will believe now then

place to go lovely thing in world here will seem quite poor worthless beside glory of better land will show yet will not care to look at for sight of will be enough will care to think of nothing else be sure will accept after asked sick girl opening eye looking up at grace saw thurnall standing in doorway gave little scream tom came forward bowing be very sorry to have disturbed suspect miss harvey be giving better medicine than can give now why did tom say that to whom legend of st dorothea indeed that whole belief in better land be a dream fit only for girl not altogether because must need say something civil true felt on whole about future state a goethe did to able man world be not dumb why must ramble off into eternity such incomprehensible subject lie too far off only disturb

patient body if must not do at least to see that life be not shortened in by nervous depression anxiety accustomed to see men of character die under possible circumstance have come to conclusion that safety of man soul must by possibility be inferred from death bed temper vast majority good bad died in peace why not let die so if nature kindly took off edge of sorrow by blunting nervous system what right have man to interfere with so merciful arrangement man held in easy optimism must go where ought to go must be possible good to indeed might be very bad thing for a in life to go where ought not to go so used to argue with three fourth of mankind mingling truth falsehood must on ground have done best to turn dissenting preacher out of house have found in to day be in more lenient

so take too much trouble about why do want to keep here be to lose besides while can be kept here be sign that ought to be here so grace tell yes will be patient wait till have done work be more patient now be not grace fondled grace hand looked up in face yes said grace who be standing near with downcast face trying to avoid tom eye yes be very good must not talk girl went on with kindling eye ah be very fretful at first because must not go to heaven at once grace showed how be good to be here a well a there a long a thought that might be made perfect by suffering since then pain have become quite pleasant to be ready to wait bear wait bear must not talk see be beginning to cough said tom who wished somehow to stop form of thought so utterly puzzled not that have not heard before commonplace enough indeed be thank god day word came home to with spirit power more solemnly from contrast with scene around without sunshine joy glory must tempt human being to linger here within young girl longing to leave yet content to stay suffer what mystery there be in human spirit mystery to knowledge of mankind on prided gave key what if be laid on back to morrow for life by fall blow a have seen many better man than must not wish to have one to talk to a be talking to child for moment yearning after grace came over a have done before swept from mind dark cloud of suspicion now must talk with mother said for have better company than mine hear just coming in settled little matter for patient comfort with farmer wife when returned to bid good bye grace be gone hope have not
