campian till stouter hearted of two recovering breath at last sir do know sir curse pronounced on who after putting hand to plough look back eustace be one of impulsive men with lack of moral courage who dare raise devil never dare fight after have be raised now tried to pas off speech by winking making sign in direction of father a much a to say that be only trying to quiet old man fear campian be too frightened parson too angry to take hint have to carry part through read be father parson that such be not fit for kingdom of god of high honor have for time past felt unworthy have much doubt just now a to vocation in meanwhile have not forgotten that be citizen of free country so saying took father arm walked out last word have hit jesuit hard have put poor cobweb spinner in mind of

altering tactic somewhat while be here thereupon long conversation began between two who have be sent together after wise method of order in obedience to precept two be better than one in order that campian might restrain parson vehemence parson spur on campian gentleness so act a supplement of other also must be confessed gave advice pretty nearly contradictory to fellow if occasion must require without danger a writer have of seeming changeable inconsistent upshot of conversation be that in day two during time mr leigh eustace also have made amende honorable matter went smoothly enough father campian asked father francis household chaplain to allow a especial favor to hear eustace usual confession on ensuing friday poor father francis dared not refuse so great man assented with inward groan knowing well that intent be to worm out family secret whereby power must be diminished jesuit increased for regular priesthood jesuit throughout england be toward other in state of armed neutrality wanted little at moment to become open war a did in james first time when meek missionary by gentle moral torture literally hunted to death poor popish bishop of hippopotamus be to say london for time being however campian heard eustace confession by putting to such question a may be easily conceived by who know anything about confessional discovered satisfactorily enough that be what campian must have called in love though must question much propriety of term a applied to fact poor prurient campian discovered indeed knew how to discover seeing that swine have eye for pearl have found out enough smiled set to work next vigorously to discover who lady might be if have frankly said to eustace feel for if desire be reasonable lawful possible will help with heart soul might have have young man secret heart saved hour trouble of course took instinctively crooked suspicious method expected to find case worst possible a man be bound to do who have be trained to take lowest possible view of human nature to consider basest motif a mainspring of human action began moral torture accordingly by series of delicate question poor eustace dodged in possible way though knew that good father be too cunning for that must give in at last nevertheless like rabbit who run squealing round round before weasel into whose jaw know that must jump at last by force of fascination parried parried pretended to be stupid surprised honorably scrupulous even angry while question a to being married single catholic heretic english foreign brought tormentor step nearer goal at last when campian finding business not very bad one have asked something about worldly wealth eustace saw door of escape sprang at even if be heretic be heiress to one of wealthiest merchant in devon ah said campian thoughtfully be eighteen say only eighteen ah well son there be time may be reconciled to church may change will die first ah poor lad well may be reconciled wealth may be of use to cause of heaven will be of use only absolve let be at peace let have cried piteously want wealth not let have for one year one month one day rest money fame talent yea life hers if be needed be at service of holy church ay will glory in showing devotion by special sacrifice desperate deed prove now see what there be will not do so eustace be absolved after campian added be indeed well son for there be thing to be done now may be at risk of life prove cried eustace impatiently here be letter be brought last night no matter from whence can understand better than longed to have shown that feared son have become feared wrongly then dear father campian so campian translated to cipher of letter to evan morgan gentleman at mr leigh house in moorwinstow devonshire news may be have by one who will go

venial one ah son have not absolved already what have to do with fair face nevertheless will come to show that trust may be to help towards reclaiming heretic saving lost soul who know so two set out together a be appointed have just got to top of hill between chapel stow mill when up lane came none other than mistress rose salterne in glory of new scarlet hood from under large dark languid eye gleamed soft lightning through poor eustace heart marrow up to tripped on delicate ankle tiny foot tall lithe graceful true west country lass a passed with pretty blush courtesy even campian looked back at fair innocent creature whose long dark curl after then country fashion rolled down from beneath hood below waist entangling soul of eustace leigh within glossy net there whispered trembling from head to foot can excuse now have excused long ago said kindhearted father ala so much fair red white must have be created only a feast for worm feast for god mean cried eustace on whose common sense naive absurdity of last speech struck keenly then a if to escape scolding deserved for heathenry will let return for moment will follow let go campian saw that be of use to say nodded eustace darted from side running across field met rose full at next turn of road started gave pretty little shriek mr leigh thought have gone forward came back to speak to rose mistress salterne mean to to

english twenty minute after winter captain who be on shore be drying round peat fire on beach talking over skirmish when will cary asked where be leigh who have seen be sadly afraid have gone too far be slain slain never le gentleman replied voice of very person in question a stalked out of darkness into glare of fire shot down from shoulder into midst of ring a might sack of corn huge dark body be gradually seen to be man in rich armor who being so shot down lay quietly where be dropped with foot luckily for mailed in fire say amyas of have better take up if be to be of use unlace helm will cary pull foot out of ember dare say must have be glad enough to put to scarpines be reason must put to a have be hinted there be love lost between admiral winter amyas amyas might certainly have reported in more ceremonious manner so winter whom amyas have not seen have not chosen to see asked pretty sharply what plague have to do with bringing dead men into camp if be dead be not fault be alive enough when started with kept right end uppermost way what must have more sir mr leigh said winter behoves to speak with somewhat more courtesy if not respect to captain who be elder commander ask pardon sir said giant a stood in front of fire with rain steaming smoking off armor be bred in school where getting good service done be more esteemed than making fine speech whatsoever school be trained in sir said winter nettled at hint about drake doe not seem to have be one in learned to obey order why did not come in when recall be sounded because said amyas very coolly in first place did not hear in next in school be taught when have once started not to come home empty handed be too pointed winter sprang up with oath do mean to insult sir be sorry sir that must take compliment to sir francis drake a insult to brought in gentleman because thought might give good information if dy meanwhile loss will be yours rather queen help then said cary glad to create diversion in amyas favor will bring round while raleigh rose catching winter arm drew aside began talking earnestly what murrain have leigh to quarrel with winter asked two three say reverend father dear child do get don talking tackle free again leave admiral to settle own way there be more than one captain sitting in ring discipline degree of rank be not so severely defined a now amyas a gentleman adventurer be on land in position very difficult to be settled though at sea be a liable to be hanged a other person on board on whole be found expedient to patch matter up so captain raleigh returning said that though admiral winter have doubtless taken umbrage at certain word of mr leigh yet that have doubt that mr leigh meant nothing thereby what be consistent with profession of soldier gentleman worthy of of admiral from proposition amyas found impossible to dissent whereon raleigh went back informed winter leigh have freely retracted word fully wiped off imputation mr winter might conceive to have be put upon so forth so winter returned amyas said frankly enough admiral winter hope a loyal soldier that will understand thus far that naught have passed to night will in way prevent finding forward obedient servant to command be what may supporter of authority among men honor against foe even with life for must be ashamed if private difference must ever prejudice by grain public weal be great effort of oratory for amyas therefore in order to be safe by following precedent tried to talk a much a must like sir richard grenville of course winter must answer nothing to in spite of plain hint of private difference that must not fail to show captain worthy of so valiant trusty gentleman whereon whole party turned attention to captive who thanks to will cary be by time sitting up standing much in need of handkerchief looking about having be unhelmed in confused doleful manner take gentleman to tent said winter let surgeon see to mr leigh who be enemy whether spaniard italian know not

took thing a came like true soldier of fortune till after have be with grenville hardly month old salterne mayor came to supper now don guzman however much might be puzzled at first at strange english way of asking burgher such low bred folk to eat drink above salt in company of noble person be quite gentleman enough to know richard grenville be gentleman enough to do only what be correct according to custom propriety so after shrugging shoulder of spirit submitted to eat drink at same board with tradesman who sat at desk made up ledger took apprentice hearing talk with grenville unwisely in vulgar fashion actually before evening be out condescended to exchange word with whereon found very prudent courteous person quite aware of spaniard superior rank making feel in sentence that be aware thereof yet holding own opinion asserting own right a wise elder in fashion spaniard have only seen before among merchant prince of genoa venice at end of supper salterne asked grenville to do humble roof honor etc etc of supping with next evening then turning to don said quite frankly that knew how great condescension must be on part of nobleman of spain to sit at board of simple merchant that if spaniard deigned to do such favor must find that cheer be fit enough for rank whatsoever company might be invitation don guzman being on whole glad enough of anything to amuse graciously condescended to accept gained thereby excellent supper if have chosen to drink much good wine now mr salterne be of course a wise merchant a ready a man for adventure to foreign part a be afterwards proved by great exertion in settlement of virginia be therefore equally ready to rack brain of guest whom suspected of knowing anything concerning strange land so thought shame first to try to loose guest tongue by much good sack next to ask prudent well concocted question concerning spanish main peru moluccas china indie part first of scheme failed for spaniard be a abstemious a monk drank little

away from mind with self denial on plumed much pleasure of chase equally exciting to pride love of danger a for sinfulness of said chase of course thought more of than other southern european did then than blush again to have to say english did afterwards in day of stuart nevertheless have put lady grenville out of mind so left room to take rose salterne into not with distinct purpose of wronging a said before half to amuse half too because must not help for there be innocent freshness about rose of torridge fond a be of being admired be new to most attractive train of peacock a said to yet heart of dove made so charming combination that if must have persuaded to love one perhaps might become fool enough to love one at thought be seized with very panic of prudence resolved to keep out of

south west of at moment said amyas marked shoulder of a ran in suppose meant to take there question set light to train angry suspicion be blazing up one after amyas silenced with countermine fool if have not wit enow to look ahead little farther than do where must be be mad a well a reckless to rise against own captain because have two string to bow go way say a live will blow up ship soul on board save pain of rotting here by inch men knew that amyas never said what did not intend to amyas intended to do because knew that threat must be enough so agreed to go be reassured by seeing that old pelican men turned to work heartily cheerfully there be use keeping reader for five six weary hour under broiling rather stewing sun stumbling over mangrove root hewing way through thorny thicket dragging sick men provision up mountain steep amid disappointment fatigue murmur curse snake mosquito false alarm of spaniard misery save cold flesh be heir to suffice that by sunset that evening have gained level spot full thousand foot above sea backed by inaccessible cliff formed upper shoulder of mighty mountain defended below by steep wooded slope needing felling of few tree to make impregnable amyas settled sick under arched root of enormous cottonwood tree made second journey to ship to bring up hammock blanket for while yeo wisdom courage be of inestimable value a pioneer have found little brook up forced way have encouraged to climb cliff over fell arguing rightly that on course be sure to find ground fit for encampment within reach of water have supported amyas when again again weary crew entreated to be dragged farther have gone back again dozen time to cheer upward while cary who brought up rear bullied cheered on straggler who sat down refused to move drove back at sword point more than one who be beating retreat carried burden for sang song on halt in thing approving gallant hopeful soul have always be till amyas beside with joy at finding that two men on whom have counted most be utterly worthy of trust went so far a to whisper to in confidence very night cortez burnt ship when landed why must not yeo leapt upright then sat down again whispered do say that captain 't be from above then be certain for be be hanging on mind too day there be hurry quoth amyas must clear out first know while cary sat silent musing amyas have evidently more scheme in head than chose to tell men be too tired that evening to do much ere sun rose next morning amyas have hard at work fortifying position be a said strong enough by nature for though be commanded by high cliff on three side yet there be chance of enemy coming over enormous mountain range behind still le chance that if came must discover through dense mass of tree crowned cliff clothed hill for thousand foot above attack if took place must come from below against amyas guarded by felling smaller tree laying with bough outward over crest of slope thus forming abatis a one who have shot in thick cover know to cost warranted to bring up in two step horse dog man trunk be sawn into log laid lengthwise steadied by stake mould three four hour hard work finished stockade must defy anything work done amyas scrambled up into bough of enormous ceiba tree there sat inspecting own handiwork looking out far wide over forest covered plain blue sea beyond thinking in simple straightforward way of what be to be done next to stay there long be impossible to avenge upon la guayra be impossible to go until have found out whether frank be alive dead seemed at first equally impossible be brimblecombe cary eighty men to be sacrificed second time to private interest amyas wept with rage then wept again with earnest honest prayer before must make up mind made up there be hundred chance to one frank be dead if not be equally past help for be amyas knew that too well by time in hand of inquisition who must lift from pit not amyas at least cry aloud in agony god help for can not amyas made up mind to move whither many hour thought thought alone there in airy nest at last went down calm cheerful drew cary yeo aside must not said refit ship without dying of fever during process assertion of hearer be bold enough to deny even if refitted must be pretty certain to have to fight spaniard again for be impossible to doubt indian story that have be forewarned of rose coming to doubt that eustace have be traitor let try st jago then sack come down on la guayra in rear take ship there so get home nay will if have strengthened against at la guayra where have little to lose surely have done so at st jago where have much hear town be large though new besides how can get over mountain without guide with one said cary with sigh looking up at vast wall of wood rock rose range on range for mile be strange to find at least throwing cold water on daring plot what if have still more daring one did ever hear of golden city of manoa yeo laughed grim joyful laugh have sir so have old hand from pelican jesus of lubec doubt not so much better amyas began to tell cary have learned from spaniard while yeo capped word thereof with rumor tradition of own gathering cary sat half aghast a huge phantasmagoria unfolded before dazzled eye at last so be why wanted to burn ship well after nobody need at home one le at table wo be missed so want to play cortez eh will never need to play cortez who be not such bad fellow after will because will have such cannibal fiend tyranny to rid earth of a have trust will fear god enough not to play pizarro so conversation dropped for time none of forgot in mountain nook party spent ten day more several of sick men died from fever superadded to wound probably from having be bled by surgeon others mended steadily by help of certain herb yeo administered much to disgust of doctor who of course wanted to bleed poor fellow round be mutinous when amyas stayed hand in meanwhile by dint of daily trip to ship provision be plentiful enough beside raccoon monkey other small animal yeo veteran of hawkins crew knew how to catch fruit vegetable above delicious mountain cabbage of areca palm fresh milk of cow tree brought in daily paying well thereby for hospitality received day long careful watch be kept among branch of mighty ceiba tree what tree be hugest english oak must have seemed stunted bush beside borne up on root rather wall of twisted board twelve foot high between whole crew ammunition provision be housed roomily rose enormous trunk full forty foot in girth towering like tall lighthouse smooth for hundred foot then crowned with bough of be stately tree whose topmost twig be full two hundred fifty foot from ground yet be easy for sailor to ascend so many natural rope have kind nature lowered for use in smooth lianes hung to very earth often without knot leaf once in tree be within new world suspended between heaven earth a cary said wonder if like jack when climbed magic bean stalk have found castle giant few acre of well stocked park packed away somewhere amid labyrinth of timber flower garden at least be there in plenty for limb be covered with pendent cactus gorgeous orchis wild pine while one tree be clothed in rich foliage other half utterly leafless bore on twig brilliant yellow flower around humming bird whirred day long parrot peeped in out of cranny while within airy woodland brilliant lizard basked like living gem upon bark gaudy finch flitted chirruped butterfly of size color hovered over topmost twig innumerable insect hummed from morn till eve when sun went down tree toad came out to snore croak till dawn there be more life round that one tree than in whole square mile of english soil amyas a lounged among branch felt at moment a if must be content to stay there forever feed eye ear with wonder then started sighing from dream a recollected that few day must bring foe upon force to decide upon scheme at bravest heart might falter without shame so there sat for often took scout place looking out over fantastic tropic forest at foot flat mangrove swamp below white sheet of foam flecked blue yet sail appeared men a fear of fever subsided began to ask when must go down refit ship amyas put off a best must till one noon saw slipping along shore from westward large ship under easy sail recognized in thought did so ship have passed upon way if be must have run past to la guayra in night have now returned perhaps to search for along coast crept along slowly be in hope that might pas river mouth lay to close to shore after while amyas saw two boat pull in from vanish behind mangrove sliding down liane told what have seen men tired of inactivity received news with shout of joy set to work to make ready for guest four brass swivel have brought up be mounted fixed in log so a to command path musketeer archer clustered round with tackle ready dozen good marksman volunteered into cotton tree with arquebus a post whence man might have very pretty shooting prayer followed a matter of course dinner a matter of course also two weary hour passed before there be sign of spaniard presently wreath of white smoke curled up from swamp then report of caliver then amid growl of english spanish flag ran up above tree floated horrible to behold at mast head of rose be signalling ship for more hand in effect third boat soon pushed off vanished into forest hour during men have thoroughly lost temper not heart by waiting talked so loud strode up down so wildly that amyas have to warn that there be need to betray that spaniard might not find after that might pas stockade close without seeing that unless hit off track at once must probably return to ship for present exacted promise from that must be perfectly silent till gave word to fire wise command have scarcely passed lip when in path below glanced headpiece of spanish soldier then fool whispered amyas to cary be coming up in single file rushing on own death lie close men path be so narrow that two must seldom come up abreast so steep that enemy have much ado to struggle stumble upwards men seemed half unwilling to proceed hung back more than once amyas must hear authoritative voice behind presently there emerged to front sword in hand figure at amyas cary started be surely know leg among thousand though be in armor be turn for now cary remember silence silence men spaniard seemed to feel that be leading forlorn hope don guzman for there be little doubt that be have much ado to get on at fellow have heard how gently handled guayra squadron whisper cary have wish to become fellow martyr with captain of madre dolorosa at last spaniard get up steep slope to within forty yard of stockade pause suspecting trap puzzled by complete silence amyas leap

unbidden on dominion of king of spain devil take king of spain together shout amyas laughing loudly ground belongs to no more than doe to to queen elizabeth in whose name have taken a lawful possession of a ever did of caracas fire men god defend right party obeyed order amyas dropped down behind stockade in time to let caliver bullet whistle over head spaniard recoiled a narrow face of stockade burst into one blaze of musketry swivel raking long array from front to rear front rank fell over other in heap rear one turned ran overtaken nevertheless by english bullet arrow tumbled headlong down steep path out men charge see don be running like rest scrambling over abattis amyas about thirty followed fast for have hope of learning from prisoner brother fate amyas be unjust in last word don guzman a if by miracle have be only slightly wounded seeing men run have rushed back tried to rally be borne away by fugitive however spaniard be out of sight among thick bush before

refused to eat for after much questioning gave a reason that must make kill at once for fat must not gradually gave to understand that english always so at least spaniard said fatted ate prisoner like carib till saw go out bury body of spaniard nothing must persuade that corps be not to be cooked for supper however kind word kind look present of inestimable treasure knife brought to reason told amyas that belonged to spaniard who have encomienda of indian fifteen mile to south west that have fled from master lived by hunting for month past having seen ship where lay moored boarded in hope of plunder have be surprised therein by spaniard forced by threat to go with a guide in search for english now came part of story filled soul of amyas with delight be indian of llano great savannah lay

catastrophe upon that might avoid well enough by common justice mercy toward savage have learned from incomparable tutor francis drake now be time to speak assembling men around amyas opened whole heart simply manfully be only hope of safety of have murmured that must perish like john oxenham crew plan be rather only way to avoid perishing like don guzman must certainly return to seek not only land force from st jago even if stockade be not forced must be soon starved out why not move at once ere spaniard must return begin blockade a for taking st jago be impossible treasure must all be safely hidden town well prepared to meet if wanted gold glory must seek elsewhere be there use in marching along coast trying port ship must outstrip country be already warned there be one chance on
