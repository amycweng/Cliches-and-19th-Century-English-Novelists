followed authentic history especially socrates account of closing scene a given in book vii para of ecclesiastical history be inclined however for various historical reason to date death two year earlier than doe tradition that be wife of isidore philosopher reject with gibbon a palpable anachronism of at least fifty year isidore master proclus not having be born till year before hypatia death contradicted moreover by very author of photius who say distinctly after comparing hypatia isidore that isidore married certain 'domna hint moreover of having be married appears in contemporary author name of isidore nowhere occurs among of many mutual friend to whom synesius sends message in letter to hypatia in if anywhere must find mention of husband have one existed to synesius most charming letter a well a to of isidore good abbot of pelusium beg leave to refer reader who wish for further information about private life of fifth century can not hope that page will be altogether free from
