more of out of sight be out of mind now tom be right away into heather there be rock stone lying about everywhere instead of moor growing flat a went upwards grew more more broken hilly not so rough little tom must jog along well enough find time too to stare about at strange place be like new world to saw great spider there with crown cross marked on back who sat in middle of web when saw tom coming shook so fast that became invisible then saw lizard brown gray green thought be snake must sting be a much frightened a shot away into heath then under rock saw pretty sight great brown sharp

tempered so answered be kick kick kick go catch spider go catch spider kick so tom went on on hardly knew why liked great wide strange place cool fresh bracing air went more more slowly a got higher up hill for now ground grew very bad indeed instead of soft turf springy heather met great patch of flat limestone rock just like ill made pavement with deep crack between stone ledge filled with fern so have to hop from stone to stone now then slipped in between hurt little bare toe though be tolerably tough one still must go on up must not tell why what must tom have said if have seen walking over moor behind very same irishwoman who have taken part upon road whether be that looked too little behind whether be that kept out of sight behind rock knoll never saw though saw now began to get little hungry very thirsty for have run long way sun have risen high in heaven rock be a hot a oven air danced reel over a doe over limekiln till everything round seemed quivering melting in glare must see nothing to eat anywhere still le to drink heath be full of bilberry whimberries be only in flower yet for be june a for water who can find on top of limestone rock now then passed by deep dark swallow hole going down into earth a if be chimney of dwarf house underground more than once a passed must hear water falling trickling tinkling many many foot below how longed to get down to cool poor baked lip brave little chimney sweep a be dared not climb down such chimney a so went on on till head spun round with heat thought heard church bell ringing long way off ah thought where there be church there will be house people perhaps one will give bit sup so set off again to look for church for be sure that heard bell quite plain in minute more when looked round stopped again said why what big place world be so be for from top of mountain must see what must not see behind far below be harthover dark wood shining salmon river on left far below be town smoking chimney of colliery far far away river widened to shining sea little white speck be ship lay on bosom before lay spread out like map great plain farm village amid dark knot of tree seemed at very foot have sense to see that be long mile away to right rose moor after moor hill after hill till faded away blue into blue sky between moor really at very foot lay something to a soon a tom saw determined to go for be place for deep deep green rocky valley very narrow filled with wood through wood hundred of foot below must see clear stream glance oh if must get down to stream then by stream saw roof of little cottage little garden set out in square bed there be tiny little red thing moving in garden no bigger than fly a tom looked down saw that be woman in red petticoat ah perhaps must give something to eat there be church bell ringing again surely there must be village down there well nobody must know what have happened at place news must not have got there yet even if sir john have set policeman in county after must get down there in five minute tom be quite right about hue cry not having got thither for have come without knowing best part of ten mile from harthover be wrong about getting down in five minute for cottage be more than mile off good thousand foot below however down went like brave little man a be though be very footsore tired hungry thirsty while church bell rang so loud began to think that must be inside own head river chimed tinkled far below be song sang clear cool clear cool by laughing willow dreaming pool cool clear cool clear by shining shingle foaming weir under crag where ouzel sings ivied wall where church bell ring undefiled for undefiled play by bathe in mother child dank foul dank foul by smoky town in murky cowl foul dank foul dank by wharf sewer slimy bank darker darker farther go baser baser richer grow who dare sport with sin defiled shrink from turn from mother child strong free strong free floodgate be open away to sea free strong free strong cleansing stream a hurry along to golden sand leaping bar taintless tide awaits afar a lose myself in infinite main like soul have sinned be pardoned again undefiled for undefiled play by bathe in mother child so tom went down while never saw irishwoman going down behind illustration chapter ii mile off thousand foot down so tom found though seemed a if must have chucked pebble on to back of woman in red petticoat who be weeding in garden even across dale to rock beyond for bottom of valley be just one field broad on other side ran stream above gray crag gray down gray stair gray moor walled up to heaven quiet silent rich happy place narrow crack cut deep into earth so deep so out of way that bad bogy can hardly find out name of place be vendale so tom went to go down first went down three hundred foot of steep heather mixed up with loose brown gritstone a rough a file be not pleasant to poor little heel a came bump stump jump down steep still thought must throw stone into garden then went down three hundred foot of limestone terrace one below other a straight a if carpenter have ruled with ruler then cut out with chisel there be heath there first little grass slope covered with prettiest flower rockrose saxifrage thyme basil sort of sweet herb then bump down two foot step of limestone then bit of grass flower then bump down one foot step then bit of grass flower for fifty yard a steep a house roof where have to slide down on dear little tail then step of stone ten foot high there have to stop crawl along edge to find crack for if have rolled over must have rolled right into old woman garden frightened out of wit then when have found dark narrow crack full of green stalked fern such a hang in basket in drawing room have crawled down through with knee elbow a must down chimney there be grass slope step so on till oh dear wish be over so did yet thought must throw stone into old woman garden at last came to bank of beautiful shrub white beam with great silver backed leaf mountain ash oak below cliff crag cliff crag with great bed of crown fern wood sedge while through shrub must see stream sparkling hear murmur on white pebble did not know that be three hundred foot below must have be giddy perhaps at looking down tom be not be brave little chimney sweep when found on top of high cliff instead of sitting down cry said ah will just suit though be very tired down went by stock stone sedge ledge bush rush a if have be born jolly little black ape with four hand instead of two while never saw irishwoman coming down behind be getting terribly tired now burning sun on fell have sucked up damp heat of woody crag sucked up still more perspiration ran out of end of finger toe washed cleaner than have be for whole year of course dirtied everything terribly a went there have be great black smudge down crag ever since there have be more black beetle in vendale since than ever be known before of course owing to tom having blacked original papa of just a be setting off to be married with sky blue coat scarlet legging a smart a gardener dog with polyanthus in mouth at last got to bottom behold be not bottom a people usually find when be coming down mountain for at foot of crag be heap heap of fallen limestone of size from that of head to of stage waggon with hole between full of sweet heath fern before tom got through be out in bright sunshine again then felt once for suddenly a people generally do that be b e t beat must expect to be few time in life little man if live life a man ought to live let be a strong healthy a may when be will find very ugly feeling hope that day may have stout staunch friend by who be not beat for if have not have best lie where be wait for better time a poor tom did must not get on sun be burning yet felt chill over be quite empty yet felt quite sick there be two hundred yard of smooth pasture between cottage yet must not walk down must hear stream murmuring only one field beyond yet seemed to a if be hundred mile off lay down on grass till beetle ran over fly settled on nose know when must have got up again if gnat midge have not taken compassion on gnat blew

not be very reason why story be written there be great many thing in world never heard of great many more nobody ever heard of great many thing too nobody will ever hear of at least until coming of cocqcigrues when man will be measure of thing there be such thing a water baby how do know have be there to see if have be there to see have seen none must not prove that there be none one have right to say that water baby exist till have seen water baby existing be quite different thing mind from not seeing water baby thing nobody ever did perhaps ever will do surely if there be water baby somebody must have caught one at least well how do know that somebody have not must have put into spirit into illustrated news perhaps cut into two half poor dear little thing sent one to professor owen one to professor huxley to see what must say about ah dear little man doe not follow at a will see before end of story water baby be contrary to nature well dear little man must learn to talk about such thing when grow older in very different way from that must not talk about ai ca when speak of great wonderful world round of wisest man know only very smallest corner be a great sir isaac newton said only child picking up pebble on shore of boundless ocean must not say that can not be that be contrary to nature know what nature be what can do nobody know wise men be afraid to say that there be anything contrary to nature except what be contrary to mathematical truth for two two can not make five two straight line can not join twice part can not be a great a whole so on at least so seems at present wiser men be le talk about can not be very rash dangerous word can not if people use too often queen of fairy who make cloud thunder flea bite take just a much trouble about one a about other be apt to astonish suddenly by showing that though say can not yet can what be more will whether approve not therefore be that there be dozen hundred of thing in world must certainly have said be contrary to nature if did not see going on under eye day long if people have never seen little seed grow into great plant tree of quite different shape from tree again produce fresh seed to grow into fresh tree must have said thing can not be be contrary to nature must have be quite a right in saying so a in saying that most other thing can not be illustration suppose again that have

sailor when said that in country water turned to marble rain fell a feather must tell more knew of science elephant be impossible monster contrary to law of comparative anatomy a far a yet known to must answer le more thought illustration did not learned men too hold till within last twenty five year that flying dragon be impossible monster do not now know that there be hundred of found fossil up down world people call pterodactyles be only because be ashamed to call flying dragon after denying so long that flying dragon must exist truth be that folk fancy that such such thing can not be simply because have not seen be worth no more than savage fancy that there can not be such thing a locomotive because never saw one running wild in forest wise men know that business be to examine what be not to settle what be not know that there be elephant know that there have be flying dragon wiser be le inclined will be to say positively that there be water baby water baby indeed why wise

that there be danger coming longed to warn foolish salmon who kept staring up at light a if be bewitched before must make up mind down came pole through water there be fearful splash struggle tom saw that poor salmon be speared right through be lifted out of water then from behind there sprang on three men three other men there be shout blow word tom recollected to have heard before shuddered turned sick at now for felt somehow that be strange ugly wrong horrible began to come back to be men be fighting savage desperate up down fighting such a tom have seen too many time before stopped little ear longed to swim away be very glad that be water baby have nothing to do more with horrid dirty men with foul clothes on back foul word on lip dared not stir out of hole while rock shook over head with trampling struggling of keeper poacher of sudden there be tremendous splash frightful flash hissing be still for into water close to tom fell one of men who held light in hand into swift river sank rolled over over in current tom heard men above run along seemingly looking for drifted down into deep hole below there lay quite still must not find tom waited long time till be quiet then peeped out saw man lying at last screwed up courage swam down to perhaps thought water have made fall asleep a did then went nearer grew more more curious must not tell why must go look at must go

salmon more be quite certain that when man becomes confirmed poacher only way to cure be to put under water for twenty four hour like grime then tom went on down for be afraid of staying near grime a went vale looked sad red yellow leaf showered down into river fly beetle be dead gone chill autumn fog lay low upon hill sometimes spread so thickly on river that must not see way felt way instead following flow of stream day after day past great bridge past boat barge past great town with wharf mill tall smoking chimney ship rode at anchor in stream now then ran against hawser wondered what be peeped out saw sailor lounging on board smoking pipe ducked under again for be terribly afraid of being caught by man turned into chimney sweep once more did not know that fairy be close to always shutting sailor eye lest must see turning aside from millrace sewer mouth foul dangerous thing poor little fellow be dreary journey for more than once longed to be back in vendale playing with trout

people will only laugh at call much ado about nothing know one man who must not be officer with pair of gray moustache a long a arm who said once in company that two of most heartrending sight in world moved most to tear must do anything to prevent remedy be child over broken toy child stealing sweet company did not laugh at moustache be too long too gray for after be gone called sentimental so forth one dear little old quaker lady with soul a white a cap who be not of course generally partial to soldier said very quietly like quaker friend be borne upon mind that be truly brave man now may fancy that tom be quite good when have everything that must want wish must be very much mistaken being quite comfortable be very good thing doe not make people good indeed sometimes make naughty a made people in bible who waxed fat kicked like horse overfed underworked be very sorry to say that happened to little tom for grew so fond of sea bullseyes sea lollipop that foolish little head must think of nothing else be always longing for more wondering when strange lady must come again give what must give how much whether must give more than others thought of nothing lollipop by day dreamt of nothing else by night what happened then that began to watch lady to see where kept sweet thing began hiding sneaking following about pretending to be looking other way going after something else till found out that kept in beautiful mother of pearl cabinet away in deep crack of rock longed to go to cabinet yet be afraid then longed again be le afraid at last by continual thinking about longed so violently that be not afraid at one night when other child be asleep must not sleep for thinking of lollipop crept away among rock got to cabinet behold be open when saw nice thing inside instead of being delighted be quite frightened wished have never come there then must only touch did then must only taste one did then must only eat one did then must only eat two then three so on then be terrified lest must come catch began gobbling down so fast that did not taste have pleasure in then felt sick must have only one more then only one more again so on till have eaten up while close behind stood mr bedonebyasyoudid people may say why did not keep cupboard locked well know may seem very strange thing never doe keep cupboard locked one may go taste for fare accordingly be very odd so be be quite sure that know best perhaps wish people to keep finger out of fire by having burned took off spectacle because did not like to see too much in pity arched up eyebrow into very hair eye grew so wide that must have taken in sorrow of world filled with great big tear a too often did said be ah poor little dear be just like rest said to herself tom heard saw now must not fancy that be sentimental at if do think that be going to let off human being when do wrong because be too tender hearted to punish then will find very much mistaken a many man doe year day what did strange fairy do when saw lollipop eaten did fly at tom catch by scruff of neck hold howk hump hurry hit poke pull pinch pound put in corner shake slap set on cold stone to reconsider so forth not bit may watch at work if know where to find will never see do for if have knew quite well tom must have fought kicked bit said bad word turned again that moment into naughty little heathen chimney sweep with hand like ishmael of old against man man hand against did question hurry frighten threaten to make confess not bit may see a said at work often enough if know where to look for will never see do for if have must have tempted to tell lie in fright must have be worse for if possible than even becoming heathen chimney sweep again leaf that for anxious parent teacher lazy one call who instead of giving child fair trial such a must expect demand for force by fright to confess own fault be so cruel unfair that judge on bench dare do to wickedest thief murderer for good british law forbids ay even punish to make confess be so detestable crime that be never committed now save by inquisitor king of naples few other wretched people of whom world be weary then say have trained up child in way must go when grew up have departed from why then did solomon say that must not depart from perhaps way of beating hurrying frightening questioning be not way that child must go for be not even way in colt must go if want to break in make quiet serviceable horse illustration folk may say ah fairy doe not need to do that if know everything already true if did not know must not surely behave worse than british judge jury more must parent teacher so just said nothing at about matter not even when tom came next day with rest for sweet thing be horribly afraid of coming be still more afraid of staying away lest one must suspect be dreadfully afraid too lest there must be sweet a be to be expected having eaten lest then fairy must inquire who have taken behold pulled out just a many a ever astonished tom frightened still more when fairy looked full in face shook from head to foot however gave share like rest thought within that must not have found out when put sweet into mouth hated taste of made so sick that have to get away a fast a must terribly sick be very cross unhappy week after then when next week came have share again again fairy looked full in face more sadly than have ever looked must not bear sweet took again in spite of illustration mr bedonebyasyoudid when mr doasyouwouldbedoneby came wanted to be cuddled like rest said very seriously must like to cuddle can not be so horny prickly tom looked at be over prickle just like sea egg be quite natural for must know believe that people soul make body just a snail make shell be not joking little man be in serious solemn earnest therefore when tom soul grew prickly with naughty temper body must not help growing prickly too so that nobody must cuddle play with even like to look at what must tom do now go away hide in corner cry for nobody must play with knew full well why be so miserable week when ugly fairy came looked at once more full in face more seriously sadly than ever must stand no longer thrust sweetmeat away saying want ca bear now then burst out cry poor little man told mr bedonebyasyoudid word a happened be horribly frightened when have done so for expected to punish very severely instead only took up kissed be not quite pleasant for chin be very bristly indeed be so lonely hearted thought that rough kissing be better than none will forgive little man said always forgive one moment tell truth of own accord then will take away nasty prickle be very different matter put there only can take away how can do asked tom cry afresh well think be time for to go to school so will fetch schoolmistress who will teach how to get rid of prickle so went away tom be frightened at notion of schoolmistress for thought must certainly come with birch rod cane comforted at last that might be something like old woman in vendale be not in least for when fairy brought be most beautiful little girl that ever be seen with long curl floating behind like golden cloud long robe floating round like silver one there be said fairy must teach to be good whether like not know said little girl did not seem quite to like for put finger in mouth looked at tom under brow tom put finger in mouth looked at under brow for be horribly ashamed of little girl seemed hardly to know how to begin perhaps must never have begun at if poor tom have not burst out cry begged to teach to be good help to cure prickle at grew so tender hearted that began teaching a prettily a ever child be taught in world did little girl teach tom taught first what have be taught ever since said first prayer at mother knee taught much more simply for lesson in world child have such hard word in a lesson in therefore water baby like better than like lesson long to learn more more grown men can not puzzle quarrel over meaning a do here on land for lesson rise clear pure out of everlasting ground of life truth so taught tom day in week only on sunday always went away home kind fairy took place before have taught tom many sunday prickle have vanished quite away skin be smooth clean again dear said little girl why know now be very same little chimney sweep who came into bedroom dear cried tom know too now be very little white lady whom saw in bed jumped at longed to hug kiss did not remembering that be lady born so only jumped round round till be quite tired then began telling other story how have got into water have fallen over rock how have swum down to sea how have flown out of window how other till be talked out then began over again ca say of two talked fastest then set to work at lesson again liked so well that went on well till seven full year be past gone may fancy that tom be quite content happy seven year truth be be not have always one thing on mind be where little ellie went when went home on sunday to very beautiful place said what be beautiful place like where be ah be just what must not say be strange true that one can say that who have be oftenest in even nearest to can say least about make people understand least what be like there be good many folk about other end of nowhere where tom went afterwards who pretend to know from north to south a well a if have be penny postman there a be safe at other end of nowhere nine hundred ninety nine million mile away what say can not concern dear sweet loving wise good self sacrificing people who really go there can never tell anything about save that be most beautiful place in world if ask more grow modest hold peace for fear of being laughed at quite right be so all that good little ellie must say be that be worth rest of world put together of course that only made tom more anxious to go likewise miss ellie said at last will know why can not go with when go home on sunday will have peace give none must ask fairy so when fairy mr bedonebyasyoudid came next tom asked little boy who be only fit to play with sea beast can not go there said who go there must go first where like do what like help somebody like why did

heathen because must not worship idol tom must bear more ran away hid among rock illustration when ellie came back be shy with because fancied looked down on thought coward then grew quite cross with because be superior to did what must not do poor ellie be quite surprised sad at last tom burst out cry must not tell what be really in mind while be eaten up with curiosity to know where ellie went to so that began not to care for playmate for sea palace anything else perhaps that made matter easier for for grew so discontented with everything round that did not care to stay did not care where

decently like julius caesar suppose said tom cut up great whale like into whole shoal of porpoise at old whale laughed so violently that coughed up creature who swam away again very thankful at having escaped out of terrible whalebone net of from bourne traveller return tom went on to iceberg wondering when came near took form of grandest old lady have ever seen white marble lady sitting on white marble throne from foot of throne there swum away out out into sea million of new born creature of more shape colour than man ever dreamed be mother carey child whom make out of sea water day long expected of course like grown people who ought to know better to find snipping piecing fitting stitching cobbling basting filing planing hammering turning polishing moulding measuring chiselling clipping so forth a men do when go to work to make anything instead of sat quite still with chin upon hand looking down into sea with two great grand blue eye a blue a sea hair be a white a snow for be very very old in fact a old a anything be likely to come across except difference between right wrong when saw tom looked at very kindly what do want little man be long since have seen water baby here tom told errand asked way to other end of nowhere ought to know for have be there already have ma'be be sure forget about then look at a tom looked into great blue eye recollected way perfectly

of old so people fancy be not going to trouble to make thing little dear sit here make make be clever fairy indeed thought tom be quite right be grand trick of good old mother carey grand answer have have occasion to make several time to impertinent people there be once for instance fairy who be so clever that found out how to make butterfly mean sham one real live one must fly eat lay egg do everything that ought be so proud of skill that went flying straight off to north pole to boast to mother carey how must make butterfly mother carey laughed know silly child said that one can make thing if will take time trouble enough be not one who like can make thing make people yet believe that mother carey be a clever a come to will not till too go journey to other end of nowhere now pretty little man said carey be sure know way to other end of nowhere tom thought behold have forgotten utterly be because took eye off tom looked at again recollected then looked away forgot in instant what be to do ma'be for ca keep looking at when be somewhere else must do without a most people have to do for nine hundred ninety nine thousandth of life look at dog instead for know way well enough will not forget besides may meet very queer tempered people there who will not let pas without passport of mine must hang round neck take care of of course a dog will always go behind must go whole way backward backward cried tom then will not be able to see way on contrary if look forward will not see step before be certain to go wrong if look behind watch carefully have passed especially keep eye on dog who go by instinct therefore ca go wrong then will know what be coming next a plainly a if saw in looking glass tom be very much astonished obeyed for have learnt always to believe what fairy told be very sorely tried for though by keeping dog to heel rather to toe for have to walk backward must see pretty well way dog be hunting yet be much slower work to go backwards than to go forward what be more trying still sooner have got out of peacepool than there came running to conjuror fortune teller astrologer prophesier projector prestigiators a many a be in part there be too many of everywhere bawling screaming at look head only look head will show what man never saw before right away to end of world be proud to say that tom be such little dogged hard gnarly foursquare brick of english boy that never turned head round once way from peacepool to other end of nowhere kept eye on dog let pick out scent hot cold straight crooked wet dry up hill down dale by mean never made single mistake saw wonderful hitherto by mortal man imagined thing be duty to relate to in next chapter illustration chapter viii last here begin never to be too much studied account of nine hundred ninety ninth part of wonderful thing tom saw on journey to other end of nowhere good little child be requested to read that if ever get to other end of nowhere a may very probably do may not burst out laughing try to run away do other silly vulgar thing may offend mr bedonebyasyoudid now a soon a tom have left peacepool came to white lap of great sea mother ten thousand fathom deep where make world pap day long for steam giant to knead fire giant to bake till have risen hardened into mountain loaf island cake there tom be very near being kneaded up in world pap turned into fossil water baby must have astonished geological society of new zealand hundred of thousand of year hence for a walked along in silence of sea twilight on soft white ocean floor be aware of hissing roaring thumping pumping a of steam engine in world at once when came near water grew boiling hot not that hurt in least also grew a foul a gruel moment stumbled over dead shell fish shark seal whale have be killed by hot water at last came to great sea serpent lying dead at bottom a be too thick to scramble over tom have to walk round three quarter of mile more put out of path sadly when have got round came to place called stop there stopped just in time for be on edge of vast hole in bottom of sea up be rushing roaring clear steam enough to work engine in world at once so clear indeed that be quite light at moment tom must see almost up to top of water above down below into pit for nobody know how far a soon a bent head over edge got rap on nose from pebble that jumped back again for steam a rushed up rasped away side of hole hurled up into sea in shower of mud gravel ash then spread around sank again covered in dead fish so fast that before tom have stood there five minute be buried in silt up to ankle began to be afraid that must have be buried alive perhaps must have be that while be thinking whole piece of ground on stood be torn off blown upwards away flew tom mile up through sea wondering what be coming next at last stopped thump found tight in leg of most wonderful bogy have ever seen have know how many wing a big a sail of windmill spread out in ring like with hovered over steam rushed up a ball hovers over top of fountain for wing above have leg below with claw like comb at tip nostril at root in middle have stomach one eye a for mouth be on one side a madre poriform tubercle in star fish be well be very strange beast stranger than dozen may see what do want here cried quite peevishly getting in way tried to drop tom held on tight to claw thinking safer where be so tom told who be what errand be thing winked one eye sneered be too old to be taken in in way be come after gold know be gold what be gold really tom did not know suspicious old bogy must not believe after while tom began to understand little for a vapour came up out of hole bogy smelt with nostril combed sorted with comb then when steamed up through against wing be changed into shower stream of metal from one wing fell gold dust from silver from copper from tin from lead so on sank into soft mud into vein crack hardened there whereby come to pas that rock be full of metal of sudden somebody shut off steam below hole be left empty in instant then down rushed water into hole in such whirlpool that bogy spun round round a fast a teetotum be in day work like fair fall with hound so all did be to say to tom now be time youngster to get down if be in earnest believe will soon see said tom away went a bold a baron munchausen shot down rushing cataract like salmon at ballisodare when got to bottom swam till be washed on shore safe upon other end of nowhere found to surprise a most other people do much more like end of somewhere than have be in habit of expecting first went through waste paper land where stupid book lie in heap up hill down dale like leaf in winter wood there saw people digging grubbing among to make worse book out of bad one thrashing chaff to save dust of very good trade drove thereby especially among child then went by sea of slop to mountain of mess territory of tuck where ground be very sticky for be made of bad toffee full of deep crack hole
