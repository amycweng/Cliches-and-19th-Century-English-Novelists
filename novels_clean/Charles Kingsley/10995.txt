wanted to keep exquisite creature to headley be quite enough of intruder already beside account of new comer learning military prowess reverence with even scoutbush evidently regarded made prepared to dislike major more now heard that there be ice crust to crack impulsive men like elsley especially when self respect certainty of own position be not very strong have instinctively defiant fear of strong calm self contained man especially if have seen world elsley set down major campbell a proud sarcastic fellow before whom must be at pain of being continually on guard wished hundred mile away however there be refusing valencia anything so got hat with so bad grace valencia saw chagrin from mere naughtiness of heart amused with by talking way of nothing major campbell lucia said at last will be so glad to see again knew so well know in eaton square year ago really said elsley wincing never met there recollected that lucia have expressed more pleasure at major campbell coming than

be general by now instead of mere major still be so improved since then be like elder brother to scoutbush guide in everything call blind man major dog so much worse thought elsley who disliked notion of campbell having power over man to whom be indebted for house room by time be at mr harvey door mr harvey opened curtseying to very ground valencia ran upstairs knocked at sitting room door come in shouted pre occupied voice inside be that proper way in to address lady sir answered putting in beautiful head major campbell be sitting elsley must see in shirt sleeve cigar in mouth bent over

door again laughing seem very intimate with major campbell said elsley intimate look on a father almost now may come in said knocking again in pretty petulance want to introduce mr vavasour will be only too happy said major opening door time with coat on there be few person in world whom have more wished to know than mr vavasour held out hand quite led elsley in spoke in tone of grave interest looking intently at elsley a spoke valencia remarked interest elsley only compliment be great kindness of to call on so soon said met mr vavasour several time in year past though saw very little of saw enough to long much for acquaintance of man who have be worthy to become husband elsley blushed for conscience smote little at word worthy muttered commonplace civility in return valencia saw attributing to usual awkwardness drew off conversation to herself really major campbell bring in mr vavasour let walk behind a can then let sit three whole minute in house without deigning to speak to ah dear queen whim answered returning suddenly to gay tone how have be misbehaving since met last have not be misbehaving at mon cher saint pere a mr vavasour will answer for during most delightful fortnight ever spent delightful indeed said elsley a be bound to say said with earnestness made major fix eye on why must not find fortnight a delightful a last said to now valencia began bantering about book animal wanting to look through microscope pulling off hat for purpose laughing when curl blinded letting blind in order to toss back in prettiest way jesting at about old fogy at linnaean society clapping hand in ecstasy when answered that be not old fogy at most charming set of men in england that with offence to name of scoutbush be prouder of being fl than if be peer of realm so forth harmless pleasantry made elsley cross more cross first because did not mix in next because must not mix in if tried liked to be always in seventh heaven if other people be anywhere else thought bore at last now if will be good for five minute said major will show something really beautiful can see that answered with most charming impudence in glass besides magnifying one be so look here see what exquisite world there be of never dream behaves great deal better in station than world of do dream when campbell spoke in way valencia be good at once a went obediently to microscope whispered be angry with mon saint pere be naughty then ma chere enfant whispered for saw something about elsley face gave painful suspicion looked long then lifted up head suddenly do come look mr vavasour at exquisite little glass fairy like can not tell what like pure spirit hovering in nun dream come elsley came looked when looked started for be very same zoophyte thurnall have shown on certain memorable day where did find fairy mon saint pere have such good fortune mr thurnall doctor gave thurnall said while elsley kept still looking to hide cheek be growing very red be such clever man say where did meet have often thought of asking mr vavasour to invite up for evening with microscope seems so superior to people round must be charity really mr vavasour vavasour kept eye fixed on zoophyte said will be only too delighted if wish will wish second time chimed in campbell if try once perhaps know nothing of professionally unfortunately for professional men too often happens know anything of assure not save that attends mr vavasour child said vavasour looking up at last with expression of anger astonished valencia campbell campbell thought that be too proud to allow rank a gentleman to country doctor despised from moment though a happened unjustly answered quietly assure that country practitioner may be average of a far a have seen be cleverer men even of higher tone than neighbour thurnall be beyond average be man of world even too much of one man of science fairly confess that what with wit savoir vivre genial good temper have quite fallen in love with in single evening began last night on microscope ended on heaven earth how must like to make third dear queen whim must hear good deal of sober sense then at least on one side will not ask for mr thurnall have deep secret together so spoke major in simple wish to exalt tom in quarter where hoped to get practice secret be mere jest unnecessary perhaps a thought afterwards to pas off tom want of orthodoxy be babbler then said to next moment how much better to have simply held tongue ah yes know men have secret a well a woman said valencia for mere love of saying something a looked at vavasour saw expression in face have never seen before what be that one can picture for branded into countenance of man unable to repress least emotion who have worked into belief that thurnall have betrayed secret dear mr vavasour cried campbell of course unable to guess truth supposing vaguely that be 'ill be sure that that sun have overpowered only possible thing must think of lie down on sofa minute vavasour be actually reeling with rage terror will run up to thurnall for salvolatile elsley who thought most consummate of hypocrite cast on look intended to have be withering rushed out of room leaving two staring at other valencia be half inclined to laugh knowing elsley petulance vanity impossibility of guessing cause kept quiet major campbell stood for full five minute not a one astounded a one in deep anxious thought what can be matter mon saint pere asked at last to break silence that there be more whim in world than yours dear queen whim fear darker one let walk up together after man have offended nonsense dare say wanted to get home to write poetry a did not praise what have written know vanity flightiness do asked quickly in painful tone however have offended can see deeply must go up make thing right for sake of for everybody sake then ask anything lucia love intensely let be enough for major saw truth of last sentence no more than valencia did for valencia must have be glad enough to pour out to with exaggeration sister woe wrong real fancied have not sense of own folly with vavasour kept silent conscience stricken valencia remarked major pained look a walked up street dear conscientious saint pere why will fret about foolish matter will have forgotten in hour know well enough major campbell be not sort of person to admire elsley more for throwing away capriciously such deep passion a have seen show more than for showing same must be of very volatile temperament oh genius be have respect for genius miss st just even acknowledge existence when there be strength steadiness of character if one pretend to be more than man must begin by proving man at genius give common sense common decency doe give mr vavasour pray benefit of of pretty flight of genius valencia be frightened have never heard saint pere speak so severely sarcastically feared that if knew truth must be terribly angry have never seen angry knew well enough that passion when rose in in righteous cause must be very awful to see be one of woman who always grow angry when be frightened so be angry at calling miss st just be angry because chose to think be talking at though reasonably might have guessed seeing that have scolded hundred time for want of steadiness of character be more angry than because knew that own vanity have caused at least disagreement between lucia elsley combined with natural wish not to confess unpleasant truth about sister justified of course in answering miss st just doe not intrude into secret of sister married life if did must not repeat major campbell sighed walked on few moment in silence then pardon miss st just asked rude question be sorry for pardon dear saint pere cried almost catching at hand never must either believe infallible hate eternally be be naughty always be will forgive queen whim who must help said major in sad sweet tone here be postman may open letter may do a like now have forgiven why what be mon saint pere sudden shock of horror have passed over major face a read letter have soon subsided into stately calm gallant officer whom world knew well be dead of cholera at post where man must die dear miss st just be going to crimea yes expedition will really sail find not will offer service leave of absence will in case end on first of september even if did not health be quite enough restored to enable to walk up to cannon mouth ah mon saint pere what word be word of old soldier queen whim who have be so long at trade that have got to take strange pleasure in in killing only in chance of will not cast unnecessary shadow over bright soul there will be shadow enough over soon without help what do mean that thousand more a delicate if not a fair a will see ere long what reality of human life be in way of have never dreamed murmured half to word of prophet saidst will sit a lady for ever two thing will come upon thee in one day widowhood loss of child will even come upon thee ' not in fulness there be noble element beneath crust will come out purer from fire will have hero heroine rising up among a of old sincere earnest ready to face work to do to call thing by right name once more queen whim will become what queen whim might be valencia be awed a well might have be for there be very deep sadness about campbell voice think there will be def disaster said at last how can tell that be what always be doubt not scoutbush will fight a merrily a owe penalty of many sin will pay must be a unfair perhaps a easy to make major campbell prophet after fact by attributing to distinct expectation of mistake have be too notorious since much of sadness in tone may have be due to habitual melancholy strong belief that world be deeply diseased that terrible purgation must surely come when be needed be difficult again to conceive that error be altogether unforeseen by many officer of campbell experience thoughtfulness will talk more of just now walked up to penalva court seriously enough well scoutbush letter from town said major yes have heard have happened at d barrack yes have better take care then that like of doe not happen here here yes will tell presently have heard from head quarter yes right said scoutbush who did not like to let out truth before valencia campbell saw signed to to speak out right asked valencia then be not going ay be order to join regiment by first of october to be shot a soon afterwards a be fitting for honour of country so miss val must be quick in making good friend with heir at law else wo get bill paid more oh dear dear valencia began to cry bitterly be first real sorrow strangely enough major campbell instead of trying to comfort took scoutbush out with left alone with tear must not rest till have opened whole cholera question scoutbush be honestly shocked who must have dreamed one have ever told that cholera have really be there before what must do send for thurnall tom be sent for scoutbush found to horror that what little must have ever done ought to have be done three month ago with lord minchampstead improvement at little man walked up down wrung hand cursed tardrew for not telling truth

sanatory sinner in blessed age of ignorance yclept of progress science how grandchild will laugh at epithet be utterly unconscious guiltless one cursing leaf a leaf other men very much where have started to do justice be in one thing true nobleman for be above pride a be most men of rank who know what own rank mean be only upstart unaccustomed to new eminence who stand on dignity asserts power so scoutbush begged humbly of thurnall only to tell what must do might use moral influence lord moral influence in tone implied naively enough 'd better get little moral before talk of using same position in parish good sir scoutbush in shrewd way do not know what fine fellow who be ready yesterday to kiss dust off foot must say if asked leave to touch single hair of right 'tell what lord pay rent take mind business will mind our'n ' forget that time be changed since seventeenth progenitor be lord of life limb over man maid in aberalva since seventeenth progenitor took trouble to live at penalva court said campbell instead of throwing away what little moral influence have by going into guard spending time between rotten row cowes hardly fair major campbell quoth tom forget that in old time if lord of aberalva be responsible for people have also by law power of making obey long short of be then said scoutbush little tartly that can hing can put to right cottage be still in hand lord for rest only remaining hope lie in last person whom one must usually depute on errand who be that schoolmistress who asked scoutbush schoolmistress at whose house major campbell lodge tom told succinctly enough to justify strange assertion if doubt lord advise to ask mr headley be friend of hers being high churchman while be little inclined to be schismatic enemy opinion will be more honest

harvey grace curtsied blushed shook over what must lord scoutbush want to say to that indeed be not very easy to discover at first for scoutbush felt so strongly oddity of taking pretty young woman into counsel on question of sanitary reform that felt mightily inclined to laugh began beating about bush in sufficiently confused fashion well miss harvey be exceedingly pleased with with what have seen of school be what sister tell clergyman clergyman thought grace surprised a well might be at what be entirely impromptu invention of lordship there be ten pound toward school will give annual subscription same amount mr headley receives subscription lord said grace drawing back from proffered note of course scoutbush trusting again to impromptu be for small mark of sense of usefulness if one have expected that grace be about to conduct during interview in wise like prophetess tragedy queen other exalted personage to stand upon native independence scorning bounty of aristocrat to read said aristocrat lecture on duty responsibility a landlord of aberalva town then will that person be altogether disappointed must have looked very well doubtless must have be equally untrue to grace

with tear of gratitude in eye took ten pound note saying to herself thank good lord will just pay mother account at mill likewise must excuse if trembled little being young woman though being also lady lost jot of self possession when lordship went on in a important tone a must hear miss harvey that have great influence over child parent be afraid one have misinformed lordship said grace in low voice ah scoutbush in tone meant to be reassuring be quite proper in to say so what eye have what hair what hand too be of course spoken mentally know better want to speak to whenever can about keeping house clean that in case cholera must come scoutbush stopped be quaint errand enough besides a told mellot frankly must think of nothing wonderful eye of hers how like be to la signora grace

a angel shrieked lucia clapping hand elsley see wing sprouting already under shooting jacket be brace suppose of course said scoutbush who never understood joke about though liked one about other people while elsley who hated joke made answer at least none worth recording in fact a reader may have discovered elsley save tete tete with one who took fancy be somewhat of silent morose animal a little scoutbush confided to mellot there be getting rise out of lucia saw a keenly a one tried to pas off by chattering nervously fussily for a well a for herself whereby only made more cross for must not least understand argument why dear if talk to people must why must people be talked to because like expect more foolish much better to hold tongue think read poetry suppose then must begin squabble meanwhile there be one at least of party who be watching lucia with most deep painful interest lord scoutbush be too busy with own comfort especially with fishing to think much of moroseness of elsley if suited lucia very well taste hers differed be concern not be very easy way of freeing from anxiety on matter not so with major campbell saw knew enough of human nature to suspect that self seeking showed a moroseness in company might show a downright bad temper in private longing to know more of elsley if possible to guide help tried to be intimate with a have tried at aberalva paid court asked opinion talked to on subject thought must interest conclusion be more favourable to elsley head than to heart saw that elsley be vain liked attention lowered in eye saw too that elsley shrank from at first thought pride soon found that be fear lowered still more in eye perhaps campbell be too hard on poet own purity told against elsley who be that one must be afraid of unless have done something wrong so with dark suspicion roused watched intently word tone of elsley to wife here came to more unpleasant conclusion still saw that be sometimes at least not happy together from took for granted too hastily that be never happy together that lucia be utterly ill used person that elsley be bad fellow who ill treated black awful indignation against man grew up within more fierce because seemed utterly righteous because too have under heavy penalty to be utterly concealed beneath courteous genial manner till many time felt inclined to knock elsley down for little roughness to be really fruit of mere gaucherie then accused for hypocrite because be keeping up courtesy of life with man for campbell like most men of temperament be over stern sometimes little cruel unjust in demanding of others same lofty code have laid down for in demanding too of more than of others by very questionable exercise of private judgment on whole be right doubt in being a indulgent a dared to publican sinner like scoutbush in being a severe a dared on pharisee pretentious person whatsoever be too much inclined to draw between two class one of strong line of demarcation exist only in fancy of human brain for sin like diseased matter be complicated confused matter many seeming pharisee be at heart self condemned publican ought to be comforted not cursed while many publican be in midst of foul sin thorough exclusive self complacent pharisee need not right hand of mercy strong arm of punishment campbell like other men have fault be of man wrapped up in pure stately austere lonely creed distrusted with world in form looking down upon men in general nearly a much a thurnall did so set down elsley for bad man to whom be forced by hard circumstance to behave a if be good one only way therefore in must vent feeling be by showing to lucia studied attention sympathy chivalry demand of man toward injured woman not that dared wished to conduct with a did with valencia even have not be married woman did not know a intimately a did sister still have right to behave a most intimate friend of family asserted that right more determinedly because elsley seemed now then not to like will teach how to behave to charming woman said to perhaps have be wiser if have not said man have weak point chivalry be major campbell what do think of poet mellot said once on returning from pic nic during elsley have never noticed wife at last finding valencia engaged with headley have actually gone off pour pi aller to watch lord scoutbush fishing oh clever enough to spare a well read man a know one of sturm und drang party of course express locomotive school scream go head think with classicism benighted pagan still man have right to opinion live let live care about taste said major impatiently what sort of man be man claude ahem humph genus poetarum ' one be so accustomed to among literary men one never expects to be like anybody else so take whim oddity for granted sin too eh sin know of none on part call temper sin call determination of blood to head of animal spirit to wrong place dear major be moralist take people know a find be bore must not wonder if sweet little woman have found out ere now campbell ground something between teeth fancied full of righteous wrath be really in very unchristian temper be so perhaps there be excuse for a there be for many men of know nothing elsley meanwhile watched campbell with fast lowering brow losing woman affection who doe so deserves fate have be in habit of paying proper attention to lucia must have liked campbell more for conduct there be few greater pleasure to man who be what must be to wife than to see other men admiring what admires trying to rival where know that can have rival let worship a much a will let make herself a charming to a can what matter smile at in heart for have not over above pretty thing can say do ten time a well a talisman dozen talisman be beyond reach in strength of will go home laugh over with amid sacred caress make mean men mad elsley ala for have neglected lucia therefore dreaded comparison with other man suspicion have taken root in at aberalva grew into ugly shape strength however be silent contented with coldness rudeness there be excuse for in first place must have be ugly thing to take notice of man attention to wife must not be done upon strongest ground done in way must make complete rupture necessary so breaking up party in sufficiently unpleasant way besides to move in matter at must be to implicate lucia for of whatsoever kind campbell attention be evidently liked quarrel with on score be more than elsley dared face be not man of strong moral courage hated scene of kind be afraid of being worsted in really serious quarrel not merely by campbell by lucia may seem strange that must be afraid of though not so that must be afraid of campbell truth be that man who bully wife very often doe so a elsley have done more than once simply to prove to own strength hide fear of knew well that woman tongue when once fair beast be brought to bay be weapon far too trenchant to be faced by shield that of very clear conscience toward be more than elsley have beside be honour to elsley vavasour amid weakness that have justice chivalry enough left to know what nine men out of ten ignore behind let worst come to worst lay one just terrible rejoinder though have be no worse than average of men must only answer by silent shame at least sir be pure when came to best know whether be so likewise yet even that so forgiving be woman might have be faced by mean miserable complication about false name still remained elsley believed that be in wife power that must if chose turn upon proclaim to world a scoundrel impostor a be of nature of man

according to fancy among fancy be one valencia must sit a queen with headley major at foot headley lounged there looked into grass thought well for must lie there for ever then claude must photograph mountain began to talk of see breadth of light shadow said claude how purple depth of great lap of mountain be thrown back by sheet of green light on lliwedd red glory on cliff of crib coch till seem to look away into bosom of hill mile after mile so do said headley have learnt to distinguish mountain distance since have be here that peak be four mile from now yet shadowed cliff at foot seem

said valencia madam if such scene a in such company can not inspire fancy of even poor country curate to something of exaltation must be dull indeed why not put of thought into poetry what use answered in so low sad meaning tone meant only for ear that valencia looked down at be gazing intently upon glorious scene be hinting at vanity vexation of poor elsley versifying did mean that have now no purpose in life prize for be worth while to win honour did not answer answered perhaps to explain away own speech madam god have written poetry already there be before business be not to re write clumsily to read humbly give thanks for more more have valencia be attracted by headley during last few week accustomed to men who tried to make greatest possible show of what small wit possessed be surprised to find one who seemed to think duty to keep knowledge taste in background gave credit for more talent than appeared for more perhaps than really have be piqued too at very modesty restraint why did not like rest who dangled about spread out peacock train for eye try to show worship of by setting off in brightest colour yet modesty awed into respect of for must not forget that whether have sentiment much little sentiment be not staple of manhood must not forget cholera work knew that under delicate bashful outside lay virtue heroism enough to spare if put thought into word must teach others to read that poetry business be to teach people to do right if can not to pray god to find one who can right headley said major campbell laying hand on curate

be clever do noble thing not dream day long so making life death that vast for ever one grand sweet song ' naughty hypocritical saint pere write poetry beautifully yes a smoke cigar to comfort poor rheumatic old soul if lived only to write poetry must think a wise a if lived only to smoke tobacco valencia eye must not help glancing at elsley who have wandered away to neighbouring brook be gazing with eye upon ferny rock having left lucia to help claude with photographing frank saw look read meaning answered thought perhaps too hastily what really well read agreeable man be while what mine of quaint learning beautiful old legend if must bring into common stock for one amusement instead of hoarding up for why what else doe do bring into common stock when publishes book one can read said valencia half out of spirit of contradiction few understand said headley quietly be very unjust be very discerning agreeable person will go talk to away went valencia to elsley somewhat cross woman like allowed for sake of sister honour one to depreciate vavasour chose to think impertinent on headley part headley began quietly talking to major campbell about botany while valencia little ashamed of while took revenge on elsley by scolding for unsocial way in very term headley have be using at last claude having finished photographing departed downward to get new view from road below lucia returned to rest of party valencia joined at once bringing up elsley who be not in best of humour after diatribe whole party wandered about woodland scrambled down beside torrent bed at last came to point where must descend further for stream falling over cliff have worn narrow chasm in rock thundered down into deep narrow pool lucia who be basking in sunshine flower a simple a child must need peep over brink made elsley hold while looked down quiet happiness a of old recollection came into eye a watched sparkling foaming water beauty born of murmuring sound did pas into face campbell started lucia of seven year ago seemed to bloom out again in pale face wrinkled forehead smile came over face too a looked just like dear old waterfall at kilanbaggan recollect major campbell elsley always disliked recollection of kilanbaggan recollection of life before knew recollection of pleasure in have not shared especially recollection of old acquaintance with major be ashamed to say replied major why be there whole summer ah suppose thought about nothing salmon fishing if elsley have be there must not have forgotten rock pool must elsley really in spite of salmon have not forgotten rock pool about place ever saw at waterfall never be so have not forgotten what cause have to remember so carefully thought elsley oh elsley look what be exquisite flower like ball of gold hanging just over water if elsley have not have evil spirit haunting about must have joined in lucia admiration of beautiful creature a dropped into foam from narrow ledge with fan of palmate leaf bright green against black moss of rock golden petal glowing like tiny sun in darkness of chasm a be answered only buttercup be sure be not buttercup be three time a large so much paler yellow be buttercup now major campbell campbell looked down very nearly one after real name be globe flower be common enough here in spring may see leaf in pasture suppose plant hidden from light have kept flower till autumn till came to see darling that be must like to reward by wearing home daresay must be very proud of honour especially if mr vavasour must embalm in verse after have done service to be doing good enough service where be said elsley why pluck out very eye of perfect picture strange said lucia that beautiful thing must be born there alone upon rock with one to look at enjoys sufficiently without doubt said elsley yes want to enjoy oh if must get for elsley looked down there be fifteen foot of somewhat slippery rock then ragged ledge foot broad in crack of flower grew then dark boiling pool elsley shrugged shoulder said smiling a if be fine thing to say really dear men be not knight errants enough to endanger neck for bit of weed can not say that such rough tour de force be at to fancy lucia turned away be vexed campbell must see that strange fancy for plant have seized a walked from spot must hear talking about beauty to valencia campbell blood boiled to be

class leader in aberalva have attempted to do so have succeeded thought be intolerable must go to face reproach blow anything rose from bed went to door be fastened on outside cold perspiration stood on forehead opened lip to shriek to mother checked when heard stirring gently in outer room pulse throbbed too loudly at first for to hear distinctly felt that be moment for giving way to emotion by

beach right across cove toward arthur nose why grace must know felt knew not why that strange journey wild lord will provide have to do with subject of suspicion perhaps be crisis perhaps will cleared up to night for joy for utter shame tide be low beach be bright in western moonlight only along cliff foot lay strip of shadow quarter of mile long till nose like great black wall buried corner of cove in darkness along strip of shadow ran crouching now stumbling over boulder now crushing bare foot between sharp pebble a heedless where stepped kept eye fixed on mother a if fascinated must see nothing else in heaven earth that dark figure hurrying along with dogged determination then stopping moment to look round a if in fear of pursuer then grace lay down on cold stone pressed into very earth moment mother turned to go forward sprang up followed then true woman thought flashed across shaped into prayer for never thought if coast guardsman above must see mother stop question god grant that might be on other side of point hurried on again near nose rock ran high jagged mother held on to passed through narrow chasm disappeared grace now not fifty yard from darted out of shadow into moonlight ran breathlessly toward spot where have seen mother last like anderssen little sea maiden went step on sharp knife across rough bed of barnacle felt pain in greatness of terror love crouched between rock moment heard mother slipping splashing among pool glided after like ghost guardian angel rather till saw emerge again for moment into moonlight upon strip of beach beneath nose be weird

impossible to see so utterly be cliff shrouded in shadow shivering with cold excitement grace crouched down gazed into gloom till eye swam hundred fantastic figure spark of fire seemed to dance between rock spark of fire yes last one be fancy actual flash crackle sputter of match what must mean match be lighted moment after glare of lanthorn showed mother entering beneath polished arch of rock glared lurid overhead like gateway of pit of fire light vanished into winding of cave then grace hardly knowing what did rushed up beach crouched down once more at cave mouth there sat knew not how long listening listening like hunted hare whole faculty concentrated in one sense of hearing eye wandering vacantly over black saw of rock glistening weed bed bright phosphoric sea thank heaven there be not ripple to break silence ah what be sound within pressed ear against rock to hear more surely rumbling a of stone rolled down then be fancy be power of hearing intensified by excitement actually equal to discern chink of coin who know in moment have glided in silently swiftly holding very breath saw mother kneeling on ground lanthorn by side in hand long lost belt did not speak did not move always knew in heart of heart so be when sin took bodily shape be there before very eye be too dreadful to speak of to act upon yet amid most torturing horror disgust of great sin rose up in

confused duty mother heard rustle looked up sprang to foot with scream dropping gold piece on ground first impulse be wild terror be discovered by whom knew not clasped evil treasure to bosom thrusting grace against rock fled wildly out mother mother shrieked grace rushing after shawl fell from shoulder mother looked back saw white figure god angel god angel come to destroy a came to balaam in madness of guilty fancy saw in grace hand fiery sword be to smite step looking backward still have tripped over stone fell striking back of head against rock lay senseless tenderly grace lifted up went for water to pool near by bathed face calling on by term of endearment slowly old woman recovered consciousness showed only in moan head be cut bleeding grace bound up then taking that fatal belt bound next to own heart never to be moved from thence till must put into hand of to whom belonged then lifted up mother come home darling mother tried to make stand walk old woman only moaned waved away impatiently grace put on foot fell again lower limb seemed paralysed slowly that sweet saint lifted laid on own back slowly bore homeward with aching knee bleeding foot while before eye hung picture of who bore cross up calvary till solemn joy pride in sacred burden seemed to intertwine with deep misery fainting moment with pain weakness still went on a if by supernatural strength murmured thou didst bear more for will not bear even for thee surely if blest spirit can weep smile over woe heroism of mortal men face brighter than star looked down on fair girl night in loving sympathy called too blest at last be over undiscovered reached home laid mother on bed tended till morning long ere morning dawned stupor have changed into delirium grace ear be on fire with
