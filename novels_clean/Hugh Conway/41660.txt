gaspard dufour besides man westerner rather over bostonized can tell by voice mixed manner mr hope must know suggested person addressed meet hub literati know literati snarled critic putting end to further discussion few minute later mr gaspard dufour came down passed out of hotel taking way into nearest ravine wore very short coat slouch hat in hand carried bundle of fishing rod joint man of build look far from dignified in such dress at best nothing must have accentuated more sharply absurd grotesqueness of appearance than peculiar waddling gait assumed a descended steep place passed out of sight fish basket bobbing beside red kerchief shining around throat everybody looked at neighbor smiled inquisitively now that have discovered name question arose what have gaspard dufour ever done that must be accorded place of honor in hotel helicon one save crane in shadowy way have ever heard of before doubt felt little twinge of resentment dufour disappearing down ravine have in

average summer sojourner at event be mostly light hearted set given over to freedom of speech action must have horrified on lower plane scarcely have gaspard dufour passed beyond sight down ravine in search of trout brook than became subject of free discussion nothing strictly impolite be said about everybody in way expressed amazement at everybody ignorance of man whose importance be apparent whose name vaguely tauntingly suggested to one of half recollection of having seen in connection with notable literary sensation be there member of french institute by name of dufour inquired r hobbs lucas historian thoughtfully knitting heavy brow be sure not said hartley crane for met most of member when be last at paris recall name there go that bourbon again muttered laurens peck critic if one

ferris opened eye in quiet way glanced at peck who however did not appear to notice remark there be set of in boston new york crane went on who watch revue de deux mondes london atheneum ready to take cue from even american book must stand fall by turn of foreign thumb be very ancient grumble said ferris in tone indicative of impartial indifference take crude loose awkward almost obscene russian

of tolstoi what must say of ferris if must write so low dirty story a crime punishment by dostoieffsky oh know begging grace care straw ferris replied publisher must steal profit in event do really

dunkirk co be answer well said will wager anything can come within twenty of guessing sale up to date of book have sold just eleven hundred forty copy laughed merrily betrayed dangerous closeness of guess by coloring little oh invariably just eleven hundred forty copy matter what kind of book be what publisher have continued have investigated have settled matter historian be suddenly thoughtful little mr philpot appeared to be making abstruse calculation crane be silently gazing at ground peck with grim humor in small eye remarked that eleven hundred forty be pretty high average upon whole just at point figure appeared in little roadway where made last turn lapsing from wood toward hotel rather tall slender angular young woman bearing red leather bag in one hand blue silk umbrella in other strode forward with pace of tragedienne wore bright silk dress leaf green in color black bonnet of nearly salvation army pattern be set far back on head giving full play to mass of short fine loosely tumbled yellow hair be very much out of breath from walk up mountain there be plucky smile on rather sallow face enterprising gleam in light eye walked right into hotel a if have always lived there heard talking volubly to servant a be following to room everybody felt waft of free western air knew that hotel helicon have received interesting guest original if not typical with quality soon must make respected in degree walked from station mr philpot ventured in querulous though kindly interrogation up mountain miss moyne added with deprecatory inflection carried that bag exclaimed rest v gaspard dufour whose accumulation of adipose tissue appeared to serve good turn a descended steep rocky ravine hummed droll tune be broken at interval by sundry misstep down sitting side wise bump against jutting crag perspired freely mopping brow meantime with vast silk kerchief that hung loosely about short neck wood grew denser a descended damp mouldy odor pervaded space underneath commingling bough of oak pine cedar sassafras here there lizard scampered around tree hole darted under fallen leaf overhead certain shadowy flittings betrayed presence of occasional small bird demurely going about business of food getting main element of surroundings however be gloom silence breeze current astir in valley rippling over gray peak of mt boab must not enter leafy chamber of wooded gorge heat of peculiarly sultry sort seemed to be stored here for a dufour proceeded began at length to gasp for breath be with such relief a none suffocating can fully appreciate that emerged into open space surrounded almost with butting limestone cliff cut across by noisy little stream went bubbling down into valley through cleft bedecked with fern sprinkled with perennial dew from succession of gentle cascade ideal trout brook be so far a appearance must go at foot of tiny water fall be swirling pool semi opaque giving forth emerald flash silver glint bearing little cone of creamy foam round round on bosom thousand noise one water note rising all along line of brook broken current clashed together with effect like of hearing far off multitude applauding distant army rushing on charge so much out of breath so deluged with perspiration be dufour that flung upon ground beside brook lay there panting mopping face overhead bit of sky be like turquoise below slender glimpse of valley shone between rock wall like sketch subdued almost to monochrome of crepuscular purple fitful breath of cool air fell into place fanning man almost purple cheek forehead while wood thrush whose liquid voice might have be regarded a part of water tumult sang in thorn tree hard by in half reclining attitude dufour gave over to delicious effect of indulging at same time in impolite ridiculous quite shakespearian habit of soliloquizing jingo remarked jingo be daisy prospect for trout if pool be full of beauty then there be nothing in waltonian lore life be worth living have jingo there went one clean above water ten ouncer at least sprang at rod a if to break to piece facility with fitted joint reel run line tied cast be really wonder knew be here muttered just a soon a laid eye on water who ever did see such brook at third cast of fly brown hackle by way up came trout with somersault misty gleam of royal purple silver attended by spray of water short bubbling sound dufour struck deftly hooking beautiful fish very insecurely through edge of lower lip immediately reel began to sing rod to quiver while dufour eye glared almost savagely lip pursed with comical intensity round round flew trout now rushing to bottom of pool now whisking under projecting ledge anon flinging clean above water shaking convulsively angler be led hither thither by active prey exercise bedewing face again with perspiration whilst foot felt cool bath of water soothing embrace of tangled water grass mere switch of bamboo rod bent almost into loop shook like rush in wind dufour be ill prepared to formulate polite response when at height of sport gentle curiously earnest voice exclaimed snatch out snatch out dog gone yer clumsy hide snatch out er will do for trout must have heard for a angler turned to get hasty glance at stranger up leaped by desperate shake broke snell confound cried dufour face redder than ever confound meddlesome tongue why did keep still till landed there be tableau set against gray lichen bossed rock two men glaring at other new comer be tall athletic brown faced mountaineer bearing gun wearing two heavy revolver towered above dufour gazed down upon a if about to execute latter did not quail grew angrier instead ought to have better sense than to interfere with sport in such way who be anyway cried in hot fierce tone mountaineer stood silent for moment a if collecting word enough for what felt like saying then see yer drawled rather musically ef take ye by scruff o ' yer neck ' heel o ' yer stockin ' jest chuck ye inter thet

appeared to coalesce for single wild whirling resounding instant then mountaineer went over headlong into middle of pool with great plash disappeared dufour in truly gladiatorial attitude gazed fiercely at large dimple in antagonist be buried for instant out of presently projected with great promptness then a new thought came to seized fallen gun of mountaineer cocked leveled upon owner there be peculiar meaning in word a stormed out lie down down with blow hole clean through instantly promptly enough mountaineer lay down until water rippled around chin floated flaxen beard moment of peculiar silence followed broken only by lapsing gurgle murmur of brook dufour with arm a steady a iron bar kept heavy gun bearing on gasping face of unwilling bather whilst at same time be dangerously fingering trigger stout short figure really have muscular doughty air heavy face certainly looked warlike stranger seein ye have got drap onto bepose swear off ' make up friend man in

found rod broken reel injured by having felt weight of wesley tolliver foot so too turned to retrace step such adventure must not fail to gain in spectacular grotesqueness a took place in memory imagination of dufour have be in habit of seeing such thing on stage of condemning out of hand a baldest melodramatic nonsense so now must not fairly realize matter a something have taken place in life be very tired hungry when reached hotel helicon vi oh yes walked way up mountain from railroad depot explained young woman whose arrival chronicled in chapter stopped over night at cabin on way discovered just delightful character tollivers regular craddock sort of people old lady son by method known only to herself have put upon speaking plane with dufour who a approached be standing in

beyond semi circle of pale straw colored fire gleamed in lowest angle of notch sent up long wavering line of light almost to zenith paling strongest star intensifying shadow in mountain gorge valley grim a angry god pine stood along slope a if gloomily contemplating dark scheme of vengeance real sapphic said crane dropping into poetical tone a elocutionist doe when be hungry for opportunity to

show fine critical acumen in being very fond of crane be desperately silent be handsome man too suspect be genuine love affair mr bridge went on fanning complacently back forth walking slowly conversing in soft minor key save when now then miss moyne laughed melodiously promenaders passed repassed peck never deigning to glance toward crane who have forgotten sappho moon miss moyne did

of self devotion must come to in form of liberal copyright statement from long suffering charitable publisher out in west have disease called milk sickness awful malady of everybody stand in deadly terror nobody have ever seen if set out to find case of milk sickness be like following will o ' wisp be always just little way farther on over in next settlement never find really successful author in america be like milk sickness never visible except on remote horizon hear much of never have pleasure of shaking cunning right hand fact be be myth on other hand however american city be full of successful publisher who have become millionaire upon profit of book have starved author of course appears to be paradox suppose that can be explained by rule of profit loss author loss be publisher profit foregoing be in substance opening part of address delivered by ferris before assembled guest of hotel helicon mr nancy jones black presided at meeting indeed always presided at meeting on occasion be informal impromptu ferris be in excellent mood for speaking a just have be notified by letter from dunkirk co that be expected to pay in advance for plate of new romance mysterious missive that personal check must not be accepted draft on new york must be sent forthwith although ferris be thoroughly good fellow who cared nothing for money a money demand for sum half of must not command if life be at stake hit like bullet stroke chance to talk off soreness of wound be accepted with avidity felt guilty of meanness be true in thus stirring up old trouble opening afresh ancient hurt in breast of listening friend relief to be so great that must not forego american publisher went on proclaims fraud by demanding of author contract place author business wholly in control of publisher take that publisher be just a honest just a dishonest a other class of respectable men know know that a rule man who trust business entirely to others will in long run be robbed administrator of estate rob heir in two third of instance a probate lawyer well know merchant have to treat clerk salesman a if be thief if will become thief government have to appoint bank examiner to watch banker yet steal indian agent steal from government senator steal alderman steal wall street men steal from one from everybody else canada be overflowing with men who have betrayed robbed who trusted business with even clergyman poorly paid much abused class now again fall before temptation offered by demon of manipulated return of trust fund fact be one may feel perfectly safe in saying that in regard to profession trade occupation there be absolutely safety in trusting one affair wholly in hand of great applause even milkman water milk dairyman sell butter that never be in churn if neglect to keep pas book grocer run up bill to great rustle excited whispering up to something enormous of course be not everybody be dishonest experience show that if man have temptation to defraud customer constantly before with absolutely need to fear detection will soon reason into believing right to have lion share of go into hand now be strange in view of premise nobody ever heard of such thing a publisher being convicted of making false return be possible that business of book publishing be so pure good of that attracts to none perfect men great applause publisher do fail financially once in while book of account invariably show just eleven hundred forty copy of copyrighted book on list have be sold to date more le suppressed applause nobody ever saw cleaner better balanced book of account than kept by publisher foot up correctly to cent indeed must be very strange thing if man must make book balance under such circumstance prolonged hand clapping be rather poor at double entry fancy must make credit of eleven hundred forty copy sold so a to have show up right cheer must not lose head in speaking on subject for can not permit to misunderstand motive so long a author submit to per centum method of publication so long will be prey of publisher only method by justice can be assured to author publisher be cash sale method if author in america must refuse to let manuscript go out of hand before have received cash value for trade must soon adjust properly in case author reputation must be own property so soon a have made audience manuscript must command certain price if one publisher must not pay enough for must a method now be make little difference whether author have reputation not indeed most publisher prefer to publish novel for example of clever tiro because fledgling be so proud of seeing in print that never think of questioning copyright statement eleven hundred forty copy usually will delight almost beyond endurance laughter applause go look at book list of publisher will feel truth of what have said now let ask if can give if publisher can give one solitary honest reason why publishing business must not be put upon cash basis manuscript for so much money publisher control own business know nook corner leaf line of must be able to say just a corn merchant doe will give so much to author must say will take will not take what be good of standing here arguing believe word speak expect to profit by will go on gambling at publisher faro table just a long a will smile deal card of day will win think poor deluded wretch go on die in faith sooner have ferris ended than lucas historian arose expressed grave doubt a to propriety of address be decidedly of opinion that author must not afford to express so freely if must say recklessly how must mr ferris substantiate by proof of damaging allegation have made against publisher of high standing what mr ferris have said might be strictly true fact be certainly very hard to come at thought hoped that mr ferris address must not be reported to press here glanced appealingly at miss crabb at least not a sense of meeting such thing must in opinion be liable to work great harm to present felt sure that publisher must resent whole thing a malicious libellous throughout audience there be nervous stirring looking at one askance be a if cold wave have flowed over nobody have anything further to say be great relief when dufour moved adjournment sine die be carried by vote suggested reserve of power face in audience with exception of dufour wore half guilty look everybody crept

be be one of mr howells hobby to represent men a rather flabby nonentity woman a invalid doll be got men down fine replied hubbard guess be rather light on woman will admit however that dissects feminine meanness inconsequence with deft turn make fun of woman said mr philpot little testily caricature wreaks humor on know very well that misrepresents even in most serious quasi truthful mood hubbard laughed there be something essentially vulgar in note of laugh mr philpot admitted mentally found shrinking from steadfast almost conscienceless eye imagine must be a bad husband a did into mr philpot interrupted with start little cry dear be married asked in exclamatory deprecation of what word have implied laughed again very coarsely looked at with eye almost lured married exclaimed do look like marrying man newspaper man ca afford to marry how strange reflected mr philpot how funny mr howells call realist realist laughed hubbard why doe not know enough about actual world to be competent to purchase family horse be capital fellow good true kind hearted what doe know about affair doe even know how to flatter woman how absurd exclaimed little mr philpot hubbard must not be

made up comparison estimate of decided that miss crabb have style savoir faire repose then miss stackpole be forward almost impudent in appearance greater ease of manner be really ease come of long training in intrusiveness of rubbing against older civilization felt quite distinctly decided dash of vulgarity in three newspaper representative before must not help suspecting that must not be safe to judge press reporter by example question arose in mind whether after howells henry james maurice thompson have acted fairly in taking a representative newspaper people have met great many newspaper people have learned to like a class have many good helpful friend among unconsciously be showing to present that be dissecting three reporter unfavorable opinion of slowly took expression in tell tale

market westward to bristol channel nevertheless respected in little world a wonderful judge of beast great authority on tillage above man who always have balance in favor at somersetshire bank type of extinct race prosperous farmer who looked on townsman with contempt thinking a farmer must think that owner of broad acre engaged in agriculture be alone worthy of respect yet to day in spite of advantage acquirement farmer leigh looked on fifteen acre meadow with puzzled discontented expression on honest face moreover murmur of dissatisfaction be proceeding from lip farmer somersetshire

complain of drop of rain so badly wanted have be long in coming have come just in nick of time to save grass if crop outwardly looked little thin mr leigh experienced eye told that undergrowth be thick that quality of hay must be first class moreover what corn root have looked promising so seems strange that farmer must be grumbling when have one to listen to must lean so disconsolately upon

landlord about domestic difficulty possession of son only child of about fifteen who instead of making useful on land did little else save wander about in dreamy way looking at object in nature animate inanimate employed in mysterious pursuit father described a messing with mud such conduct be departure from respectable bucolic tradition of leigh family so great that at time father thought infliction laid upon for cause other by inscrutable providence there be certain spanish nobleman who on account of antiquity of family service rendered be permitted to enter royal presence with covered head be perhaps for somewhat similar reason custom handed down from father to son established by time that tenant of watercress farm paid rent to landlord in person not through medium of agent mr herbert being important man in west country leigh family valued privilege a highly a ever hidalgo valued one above mentioned mr herbert refined intellectual looking man of about fifty received

now let see boy said mr herbert after disclaiming sense of trouble leigh went to door of room shouted out jerry jerry come down be wanted man in moment door opened cause of mr leigh discontent came upon scene in form of dark eyed dark haired pale faced boy tall slightly built not so far a physique went much credit to country side yet in respect striking looking if not handsome lad dark eloquent eye strongly marked brow must arrest attention face be too thin too thoughtful for age must scarcely be associated with what commonly constitutes good looking lad yet regularity of feature be there one must dare to be sure that beauty must not come with manhood be not seen at moment under advantageous circumstance knowing nothing about distinguished visitor have obeyed father summons in hot haste consequently entered room in shirt sleeve be certainly not very clean with hand covered with red clay mr herbert looked amused while little princess turned up nose in great disdain poor abraham leigh be much mortified at unpresentable state in son showed to make matter worse boy be not soiled by honest legitimate toil tut tut said crossly of muck a usual boy who felt that father have right to complain hung head showed sign of retreating mr herbert came to rescue never mind said patting young leigh on shoulder have be working in own fashion have come on purpose to see modelling of yours

herbert up stair to room destitute of furniture save old table chair bucket half full of common red clay stood in one corner on table be several of little clay figure have excited farmer ire consternation crude defective full of fault a be there be enough power in to make mr herbert look at lad in wonderment almost envy be man who worshipped art who have dabbled a amateur in painting

modeller copyist must take first rank if in addition to manual dexterity have poetry feeling imagination might well be that one of greatest sculptor of nineteenth century stood in embryo before a mr herbert glanced from rough clay sketch to pale boy who stood breathless a one expecting verdict of life death wondered what must have be cause of such divergence from trait habitual to leigh then remembered that twenty year ago abraham leigh have chosen for wife not one of own kind dweller in city governess who exchanged doubt life of penury servitude for rough comfortable home somersetshire farmer be willing to give mr herbert remembered remembered how utterly out of place delicate refined woman seemed to be a leigh wife remembered how few year after birth of boy sickened died be from mother side artistic taste came mr herbert although kind man be cautious have intention of raising hope might be futile yet felt word of encouragement be due to lad of figure show decided talent said after seeing need scarcely ask if wish to be sculptor young leigh clasped hand together oh sir gasped if must only be care to be farmer like father must never be farmer sir be not fit for yet if

where condescended to drink glass of new milk by time have returned to garden two be a good friend a different station in life must permit young leigh who saw in dainty little maid incarnation of fairy nymph goddess other ideal in dim way be forming in brain endeavored after first shyness have passed away to show what beautiful shape form must be found in flower leaf tree other thing in nature

betimes went for short stroll returned whilst standing at door of house be positively startled by beauty of girl who passed entered a if be regular inhabitant of place not rosy scotch lassie such a

guessed reason be only one in have undisputed possession of friend of course bantered great deal on portfolio episode took in good part attempting little defence indeed before night have told with boy fervor how have loved madeline rowan at first sight how in short space of time have elapsed since meeting have wooed won how good beautiful be how worshipped how happy felt how when went south must accompany after making few necessary arrangement return at once bear bride away must only listen to congratulate be not place to act elder advise for against marriage carriston have only to please if made rash step only to blame for consequence why must have dissuaded who in two day envied boy good fortune saw great deal of madeline rowan how strange out of place name face seemed amid surroundings if at first somewhat shy retiring soon if only for carriston sake consented to look upon a friend talked to freely unreservedly then found that nature be a sweet a face conquest did make of save for one chimerical reason must have felt quite certain that carriston have chosen well must be happy in wedding girl of choice heedless of humble position in world absence of fitting wealth when once wife felt sure that if cared for to win social success look bearing must insure from great improvement a have already said noticed in health spirit believed that marriage must make life longer happier better now for objection seems almost laughable one objected on score of extraordinary resemblance so far a man may resemble woman existed between charles carriston madeline rowan more saw together more be struck by stranger might well have taken for twin brother sister same delicate feature drawn in same line same soft dark dreamy eye even same shaped head comparing two needed phrenologist physiognomist to tell where one excelled other excelled where one failed other be wanting now must have selected wife for friend must have chosen one with habit constitution entirely different from

only sitting at lover foot speaking word yet be handsome couple never have seen two people so utterly devoted to other a two seemed to be during autumn day spent with soon have clear proof of closeness of mental resemblance one evening carriston madeline be sitting out of door watching gray mist deepening in valley at foot two of party be of course hand in hand third seated at discreet distance not so far away a to preclude conversation far enough off to be able to pretend that saw heard only what be intended for eye ear how certain topic must have avoided discussing with carriston be started hardly remember probably strange tale have be passed down from wilder even more solitary region than ours ridiculous tale of highland superstition doubt embellished augmented by one who repeated to fellow from awed talk soon found that madeline rowan perhaps by reason of scotch blood in vein be a firm believer in thing visionary beyond nature a ever charles carriston in silliest moment must be a soon a must stopped talk next day finding girl for few minute alone told plainly that subject of kind must be kept a far a possible from future husband thought promised obedience with dreamy eye looked a far away full of vision a carriston by by said have ever spoken to about seeing strange thing yes have hinted at believe of course do told so be unanswerable pretty pair will make muttered a madeline slipped from to welcome lover who be approaching will see ghost in corner goblin behind curtain nevertheless young people have doubt about coming bliss everything be going smoothly pleasantly for carriston have at once spoken to madeline aunt obtained old scotchwoman ready consent to union be rather vexed at still keeping to absurd whim concealing true name said be afraid of alarming aunt by telling be passing under alias whilst if gave madeline true reason for so doing must be miserable moreover found have formed romantic plan of marrying without telling in what enviable position must be placed so far a worldly gear went kind of lord burleigh surprise doubt commended to imaginative brain last day of holiday came bade long sad farewell to lake mountain accompanied by carriston started for home did not see parting proper between young people be far too sacred thing to be intruded upon even when protracted affair be over waited many many minute whilst carriston stood hand in hand with madeline comforting by reiterating only six week six short week then then be girl who at last tore away then carriston mounted reluctantly by side on rough vehicle from edinburgh travelled by night train greater part of way have compartment to ourselves carriston a lover will talked of nothing coming bliss plan for future after while grew quite weary of monotony of subject at last dozed off for little time slept shrill whistle told tunnel be at hand aroused companion be sitting opposite to a glanced across at attention be arrested by same strange intense look

precious boon to left undisturbed be still fast asleep when about mid day gentleman called upon sent up card supposed came to consult professionally moment entered room recognized be thin lipped gentlemanly person whom have met on journey to bournemouth last spring man who have seemed so much impressed by view on insanity have manifested such interest in description have given without mentioning name of carriston peculiar mind must have at once claimed acquaintanceship with visitor before must speak advanced apologized gracefully for intrusion will forgive added when tell name be ralph carriston remembering chance conversation thought that after charles carriston wild suspicion be well founded flashed through like lightning great hope be that visitor might not remember face a remembered bowed coldly said nothing believe dr brand continued have young relative of mine at present staying with yes mr carriston be guest answered be old friend ah did not know that remember having heard mention name a friend a be so no one know better than do unfortunate state of health how do find to day violent pretended to ignore man meaning answered smilingly violence be last thing must look for be tired out exhausted by travel be in great distress that believe be whole of complaint yes yes to be sure poor boy sweetheart have left something a doctor must know that mental condition be not quite what must be friend be very anxious about fear that little restraint temporary hope must be put upon action called to ask advice aid in what mr carriston in young man ca be left free to go about threatening friend life have brought dr daley with know of course be below in carriage will call up with permission must then see poor charles needful certificate must be signed by two doctor mr carriston said decidedly let tell in plainest word that cousin be at present a fully in possession of wit a be dr daley whoever may be must sign certificate in day asylum must dare to keep mr carriston within wall unpleasant sinister look crossed listener face voice still remained bland suave be sorry to differ from dr brand said know better than do have seen a have never yet seen only last night came to in frantic state expected moment must make murderous attack on perhaps fancied have reason for anger said ralph carriston looked at with cold eye of cousin have spoken if boy have succeeded in converting to of delusion can only say that doctor be more credulous than fancied question be not worth arguing decline to assist so must do without good morning dr brand left room a gracefully a have entered remained in state of doubt be curious that ralph carriston turned out to be man whom have met in train evidence offered by coincidence be not enough to convict of crime of endeavoring to drive cousin mad by far fetched stratagem a inveigling away of madeline rowan besides even in wishing to prove charles carriston mad have much to say on side supposing to be innocent of having abducted madeline carriston violent behavior on preceding evening must have seemed very much like insanity in spite of aversion with ralph carriston inspired scarcely knew side to believe carriston still slept so when went out on afternoon round left note begging to remain in house until return then found up dressed looking much more like when entered dinner be on table so not until meal be over must talk unrestrainedly upon subject be uppermost in mind a soon a be alone turned toward guest now said must settle what to do there seems to to be one course open have plenty of money so best plan be to engage skilled police assistance young lady ca be spirited away like without leaving trace to surprise carriston flatly objected to course said will not go to police man who took away have placed where police can find must find find why may be month year before do good heaven carriston may be murdered worse will know if further evil happens to then will kill ralph carriston tell have clew to trace by do talk plainly tell nothing carriston smiled very faintly clew that at rate will believe in said know much be prisoner somewhere be unhappy not a yet ill treated heaven do think if did not know must keep sens for hour how can possibly know by gift extra sense whatever be deride knew must come to day little thought how must welcome know that in way will find by tell have already seen three time may see again at moment when strange fit come over fantastic nonsense be spoken so simply with such air of conviction once more suspicion a to state of mind be aroused in spite of brave answer have given mr ralph carriston felt that common sense be undeniably on side tell what mean by strange fit said resolved to find out nature of carriston fancy hallucination be kind of trance fall into seemed loath to give information on subject pressed for answer yes said at last must be kind of trance indescribable feeling come over know that eye be fixed on object presently that object vanishes see madeline how do see seems to stand in blurred circle of light a cast by magic lantern be only way can describe figure be plain clear might be close to carpet on stand can see chair on sits table on lean hand anything touch can see more have seen talking knew be entreating one that one be invisible yet if touched that person virtue of touch must enable to see so far a must see carriston case appeared to be one of over wrought unduly stimulated imagination have always considered to be mind of most peculiar construction in present state of love grief suspense hallucination might come in same way in dream come for little while sat in silence considering how must best combat with dispel remarkable delusion before have arrived at decision be called away to see patient be short time engaged then returned to carriston intending to continue inquiry upon re entering room found sitting a have left directly opposite to door face be turned fully toward trembled a caught sight of be leaning forward hand on table cloth whole frame rigid eye staring in one direction yet knew capable of seeing nothing must see seemed even oblivious to sound for entered room closed door behind without causing to change look position moment saw man knew that have be overtaken by what called strange fit first impulse natural one be to arouse second thought told that be opportunity for studying disease must not be lost felt must call by other name than disease so proceeded to make systematic examination of symptom leaned across table with face about foot from looked straight into eye betrayed sign of recognition knowledge of presence be ashamed to say must not divest myself of impression that be looking through pupil be greatly dilated lid be wide apart lighted taper held before must see expansion of iris be case confess entirely beyond comprehension have experience might serve a guide a to what be best course to adopt must do be to stand watch carefully for change save for regular breathing sort of convulsive twitching of finger carriston might have be corpse statue face must scarcely grow paler than have be before attack altogether be uncomfortable sight creepy sight motionless man utterly regardless of went on around seeing giving one idea that saw something far away sighed a looked at strange spectacle foresaw what end must surely be although longed for to awake determined on occasion to let trance fit run full course might notice in what manner how soon consciousness returned must have waited watched ten minute minute seemed to interminable at last saw lip quiver lid flicker once twice eventually close wearily over eye unnatural tension of muscle seemed to relax sighing deeply apparently quite exhausted carriston sank back into chair with bead of perspiration forming on white brow fit be over in moment be at side forcing glass of wine down throat looked up at spoke voice be faint word be quite collected have seen again said be well so unhappy saw kneel down pray stretched beautiful arm out to yet know not where to look for poor love poor love waited until thought have sufficiently recovered from exhaustion to talk without injurious consequence carriston said let ask one question be trance vision voluntary not reflected for few moment ca quite tell said rather must put in way think can exercise power at will can feel when fit be coming on believe can if choose stop from yielding to very well now listen promise will fight against seizure a much a can if will be raving mad in month ca promise said carriston quietly see at time must will die promise to yield a seldom a may be know a well a do that very exhaustion now feel must be injurious to one in truth looked utterly worn out very much dissatisfied with concession best must get from sent to bed knowing that natural rest if must get must do more than anything else toward restoring healthy tone to mind viii although carriston stated that came to for aid may be for protection manifested greatest reluctance in following advice offered obstinacy of refusal to obtain assistance of police placed in predicament madeline rowan have really disappeared be of course compelled to believe might even be possible that be kept against will in place of concealment in such case behooved to take proper step to trace welfare must not depend upon hallucination eccentric idea of man half out of sens with love grief resolved even at risk of forfeiting carriston friendship to put whole matter in hand of police unless in course of day two heard from girl carriston suggested better plan curiously enough although refusing to be guided by made suggestion on own account be racked by fear suspense yet only idea of solving difficulty seemed to be that of waiting did nothing simply waited a if expected that chance must bring what must have be searching for high low day passed before must get tardy consent aid must be sought even then must not go to proper quarter allowed to summon to council man who advertised a being private detective man one of men came at call heard what be wanted of carriston reluctantly gave one of madeline photograph also told that only by watching spying on ralph carriston action must hope to obtain clew did not much like course adopted did like look of man to whom inquiry be intrusted at rate something be being done week passed without news from agent carriston in truth did not seem to expect believe only employed man in deference to wish moved about house in disconsolate fashion have not told of interview with cousin have cautioned on rare occasion upon went out of door to avoid speaking to stranger servant have strict instruction to prevent one coming in taking guest by surprise for have during day opened confidential inquiry on own account wanted to learn something about mr ralph carriston so asked man who knew everybody to find out about reported that ralph carriston be man well known about london be married have house in dorsetshire greater part of time be spent in town once be supposed to be well off now be general opinion that acre owned be mortgaged that be much pressed for money informant said there be one life between reversion to large estate life be poor one believe even now there be talk about man who stand in way being mad if so ralph carriston will get management of everything after news felt more than ever needful to keep watchful eye on friend so far a knew there have be recurrence of trance began to hope that proper treatment must effect complete cure when to great alarm annoyance carriston while sitting with suddenly without warning fell into same strange state of body mind a previously described time be sitting in part of room after watching for minute two just a be making up mind to arouse scold thoroughly for folly sprung to foot shouting let go loose say rushed violently across room so violently that have barely time to interpose prevent from coming into contact with opposite wall upon returning to sens told with great excitement that have again seen madeline moreover time have seen man with man who have placed hand upon wrist kept there so according to carriston wild reasoning became on account of contact visible to told have watched for moment until man tightening grip on girl arm endeavored thought to lead induce to follow somewhere at juncture unaware that be gazing at vision have rushed to assistance in frantic way have described then awoke also told have studied man feature general appearance most carefully with view to future recognition ridiculous statement be made a made former one with air of one relating simple undeniable fact one speaking plain unvarnished truth expecting full credence to be given to word be too absurd too sad be evident to that barrier between hallucination dream vision what chose to call pure insanity be now very slight fragile one before gave up case a hopeless determined to make strong appeal to common sense told of cousin visit to of intention proposition begged to consider what consequence extraordinary belief extravagant action must eventually entail listened attentively calmly see now said how right be in attributing to ralph carriston how right be to come to doctor of standing who can vouch for sanity vouch for sanity how can when sit here talk such arrant nonsense expect to believe when jump from chair rush madly at visionary foe sane a may be in else evidence must give in favor must break down in cross examination if inkling of thing got about come carriston be reasonable prove sanity by setting about search for miss rowan in proper way made reply walked up down room apparently in deep thought word seemed to have have effect upon presently seated a if to avoid returning to argument drew book at hazard from shelf began to read opened volume at random after reading few line seemed struck by something met eye in few minute be deeply immersed in content of book glanced at to see what have so awakened interest by curious fatality have chosen book very worst for in present frame of mind gilchrist recently published life of william blake masterly memoir of man who be on certain point a mad a carriston be about to remonstrate when laid down volume turned to varley painter said be firm believer in blake vision varley be bigger fool than blake retorted fancy sitting down watching clever mad friend draw spectral head believing to be genuine portrait of dead king whose form condescended to appear to blake sudden thought seemed to strike carriston will give paper chalk asked upon being furnished with material seated at table began to draw at least dozen time sketched with usual rapidity object dozen time after moment consideration threw sketch aside with air of disappointment began fresh one at last one of attempt seemed to come up to requirement have now exactly cried with joy even triumph in voice spent time in putting finishing touch to successful sketch then handed paper be man saw just now with madeline said when find will find spoke with sincerity conviction looked at paper with be bound to say great amount of curiosity matter from what visionary source carriston have drawn inspiration sketch be vigorous natural enough have already mentioned wonderful power of drawing portrait from memory so be willing to grant that might have reproduced outline of face have somewhere struck yet why must have be one drawing represented three quarter face of man ordinary man apparently between forty fifty year of age be coarse featured ill favored face with ragged ruff of hair round chin be not face of gentleman even face of gentle nurtured man artist by few cunning stroke have made wear crafty sullen look sketch a write lie before so be not speaking from memory now there be portrait of without having seen original say what splendid likeness must be be so with carriston sketch looking at felt sure be exactly like man whom be intended to represent so that with certain amount of art knowledge be at least supposed to posse be hard for after examining drawing recognizing true artist touch in line to bring to accept fact that be outcome of diseased imagination a at very moment glance at drawing scarcely blame for question faintly frame in innermost heart must be possible must there be in certain organization power not yet known not yet properly investigated thought supposing such thought be ever there be not discouraged by carriston who speaking a if faith in bodily existence of man whose portrait lay in hand be unassailable said noticed that general appearance be that of countryman english peasant so in country will find love moreover will be easy to identify man a top joint be missing from middle finger of right hand a lay on madeline arm noticed that argued with more felt that word must be wasted ix day two after have witnessed what must call carriston second seizure be favored with visit from man whose service have secured to trace madeline since have received instruction have heard nothing of proceeding until now called to report progress in person carriston have not expressed slightest curiosity a to where man be what be about probably looked upon employment of private detective a nothing more useful than salve to conscience that madeline be only to be found through power professed to hold of seeing in vision be felt certain becoming rooted belief of whenever expressed surprise that agent have brought sent information carriston shrugged shoulder assured that from first knew man research must be fruitless however fellow have called at last hoped have brought good news be glib tongued man who spoke in confident matter of fact way when saw rubbed hand a one who have brought affair to successful issue now meant to reap praise other reward whole bearing told have made important discovery so begged to be seated give news carriston gave careless glance stood at little distance from looked a if thought impending communication scarcely worth trouble of listening to might indeed from look have be most disinterested person of three even left to do questioning now then mr sharpe said let hear if have earned money think so sir replied sharpe looking curiously at carriston who strange to say heard answer with supreme indifference think may say have sir continued detective be if gentleman can identify article a being young lady property thereupon produced from thick letter case ribbon in be stuck silver pin mounted with scotch pebble ornament remembered having seen madeline wear mr sharpe handed to carriston examined saw cheek flush eye grow bright how did come by cried pointing to silver ornament will tell presently sir do recognize gave to miss rowan then be on right track cried joyfully go on mr sharpe yes gentleman be certainly on right track after be fault if track lead exactly where wish see when heard of mysterious disappearance of lady began to concoct own theory said to myself when young beautiful confound theory cried carriston fiercely go on with tale man gave interrupter spiteful glance well sir said a gave strict instruction to watch certain gentleman closely obeyed instruction of course although knew be on fool errand will go on cried carriston if know where miss rowan be say so money will be paid moment find say exactly know where to find lady can soon know if wish to tell tale own way a shortly a possible said seeing that excitable friend be preparing for outburst found there be nothing to be gained by keeping watch on gentleman mentioned sir so went to scotland tried back from there a soon a worked on own lay found out about lady went from callendar to edinburgh from edinburgh to london from london to folkestone from folkestone to boulong glanced at carriston calmness seemed to have returned be leaning against mantelpiece appeared quite unmoved by mr sharpe clear statement a to route madeline have taken of course continued mr sharpe be not quite certain be tracking right person although description corresponded with likeness gave a be sure article of jewelry belonged to lady want matter be beyond doubt of course said seeing that carriston have intention of speaking where did find be left behind in bedroom of one of principal hotel in folkestone did go over to boulong after thought have learned all must care to know there be something in man manner made dread what be coming again looked at carriston lip be curved with contempt still kept silence why not have pursued inquiry past boulong asked for reason sir have learned enough theory have concocted be right one after lady went to edinburgh alone right enough did leave edinburgh alone did leave london alone did stay at folkestone where found pin alone did go to boulong alone be accompanied by young gentleman who called mr smith what be more called mr smith perhaps be a lived like man wife whether fellow be right mistaken explanation of madeline disappearance seemed to give what can only compare to smack in face stared at speaker in speechless astonishment if tale told so glibly circumstantially be true farewell so far a be concerned to belief in love purity of woman madeline rowan that creature of poet dream on eve of marriage with charles carriston to fly whether wed unwed mattered little with man yet be woman carriston carr a only knew be in eye poor companion of flight might have won with gold such thing have be still rapid wrongful meditation be cut short in unexpected way suddenly saw mr sharpe dragged bodily out of chair thrown on floor while carriston standing over thrashed man vigorously with own ash stick convenient weapon so convenient that felt mr sharpe must not have selected stick more appropriate for own chastisement so carriston seemed to think for laid on cheerfully eight ten good cutting stroke nevertheless being respectable doctor man of peace be compelled to interfere held carriston arm while mr sharpe struggled to foot after collecting hat pocket book stood glaring vengefully at assailant rubbing while such of weal on back a must reach annoyed a felt at unprofessional fracas must scarcely help laughing at man appearance doubt possibility of one looking heroic after thrashing will have law for growled ai paid to be beaten by madman be paid to do work not said carriston go to man who have over bribed sent to tell lie go to tell once more have failed out of sight a carriston showed sign of recommencing hostile operation man flew a far a door way there being in comparative safety turned with malignant look will smart for said when lock up a raving lunatic will try get post a keeper be glad to see that carriston paid attention to parting shaft turned back scornfully fellow left room house now be convinced asked carriston turning to convinced of what that tale be untrue that have be misled be quite certain tush be not worth consideration see that ralph have done set man to watch found out espionage suborned agent agent must say sent here with trumped up tale oh yes be to believe that madeline have deserted be to drive out of sens cousin be fool after without further proof can not believe that suspicion be correct said must own spoke with hesitation proof clever man like ought to see ample proof in fact of wretch having twice called madman have seen once before know if then gave ground for making assertion tell from whom must have learned word except from ralph carriston be bound if only to save own reputation for sagacity to confess that point noted by carriston have raised certain doubt in mind if ralph carriston really be trying by finely wrought scheme to bring about what desired there be more reason for great caution to be exercised be sorry beat said will now swear right left that be not in sens of course will what do care only remember be easier to get put into asylum than to get out of be not so very easy for sane man like to be put in especially when be on guard have looked up law there must be certificate signed by two doctor surgeon believe apothecary will do who have seen supposed lunatic alone together will take very good care speak to doctor save keep out of way of surgeon apothecary quite cheered to hear speaking so sensibly collectedly about again impressed upon need of great caution although must not believe that cousin have taken madeline away be inclined to think after affair with spy that a carriston averred aimed at getting sane insane into mad house after day be not step nearer to discovery of madeline whereabouts carriston made sign of doing anything to facilitate discovery again urged to intrust whole affair to police again refused to do so adding that be not quite ready ready for what wondered x must confess in spite of affection for carriston felt inclined to rebel against course matter be taking be prosaic matter of fact medical man doing work to best of ability anxious when work be done that hour of leisure must be a free from worry care a possible with carriston advent several disturbing element entered into quiet life let ralph carriston be guilty innocent of extraordinary crime cousin laid at door felt that be anxious to obtain possession of supposed lunatic person must suit purpose for cousin to be proved mad did not believe that even if capture be legally effected carriston liberation must be matter of great difficulty so long a remained in present state of mind so long a doctor of standing must go into witness box swear to sanity old dread be always with dread that further shock must overturn balance of sensitive mind so be that hour that carriston be out of sight be fraught with anxiety if ralph carriston be really a unscrupulous a friend supposed if have really a seemed almost probable suborned agent might by crafty trick obtain needful certificate day must come home find carriston have be removed in such case foresaw great trouble distress besides after have occurred be a much a must do to believe that carriston be not mad doctor who knew what knew must have given verdict against after dismissing vision hallucination with contempt deserved fact of man who be madly passionately in love with woman who believed that have be entrapped be still kept in restraint sitting down quietly letting day after day pas without making effort toward finding be in prima facie evidence of insanity sane man must at once have set engine of detection at work felt that if once ralph carriston obtained possession of must make out strong case in own favor first of proposed marriage out of defendant own sphere of life passing under false name ridiculous apparently ridiculous accusation made against kinsman murderous threat chastisement of own paid agent who brought report might not seem at untrue to one who knew not madeline rowan leaving out question what might be wrung from in cross examination ralph carriston have strong case knew once in power friend might possibly be doomed to pas year if not whole life under restraint so be anxious very anxious felt anxiety scarcely second to prevailed on carriston account a to fate of madeline granting for sake of argument that carriston absurd conviction that bodily harm have a yet be done be true felt sure that with scarcely le sensitive nature must feel separation from lover a much a felt separation from once twice tried to comfort with cynicism tried to persuade that young woman must not in day be spirited away that have gone by own free will that there be man who have at eleventh hour alienated affection from carriston must not bring to believe so be placed between horn of dilemma if madeline have not fled of own free will one must have taken away if so agent report be coined one if coined one issued at ralph instance therefore ralph must be prime actor in mystery in sober moment such deduction seemed utter absurdity although have said that carriston be doing nothing toward clearing up mystery wronged in so saying after own erratic way be at work at such work too really lost patience with shut up in room out of scarcely stirred for three day by time have completed large beautiful drawing of imaginary man took to well known photographer ordered several hundred small photograph of to be prepared a soon a possible minute description have given of fanciful creation be printed at foot of copy a soon a first batch of precious photograph be sent home to great joy did what must have done day ago yielded to wish put matter into hand of police be glad to find that in giving detail of what have happened said nothing about advisability of keeping watch on ralph carriston proceeding did indeed offer absurdly large reward for discovery of missing girl gave officer in charge of case packet of photograph of phantom man telling in gravest manner that knew original of likeness have something to do with disappearance of miss rowan officer who thought portrait be that of natural being took instruction in good faith although seemed greatly surprised when heard that carriston knew name occupation in fact knew nothing concerning man who be to be sought for however a carriston assured that finding man must insure reward a much a if found madeline officer readily promised to combine two task little knowing what waste of time attempt to perform latter must be two day after carriston came to will leave to morrow said where be going asked why do leave be going to travel about have intention of letting ralph get hold of so mean to go from place to place until find madeline be careful urged will be careful enough will take care that doctor surgeon even apothecary get on track will go just a fit seizes if ca say one day where will be next will be impossible for villain to know be not bad argument in fact if carried out resolve of passing quickly from place to place did not see how must plan anything more likely to defeat intention with credited cousin a to finding madeline by so doing be matter idea seemed to be chance must sooner later bring in contact with man of dream however now that search have be intrusted to proper person own action in matter be not worth troubling about gave many caution be to be quiet guarded in word manner be not to converse with stranger if found dogged watched by one be to communicate at once with above begged not to yield again to mental infirmity folly of man who must avoid throwing into state ought to be apparent to not oftener than can help be promise must get from see must sometimes will die have now given up a hopeless combat with peculiar idiosyncrasy so with many expression of gratitude on part bade other farewell during absence wrote to nearly day so might know whereabouts in case have news to communicate have none police failed to find slightest clew have be called upon by once twice in order that might have grain of information must give took liberty of advising not to waste time in looking for man a very existence be problematical be fancy of friend not worth thinking seriously about be not sure what after hearing did not think whole affair be imagined one so relaxed effort once twice carriston happening to be in neighborhood of london came to see slept night at house also have news to report still seemed hopeful a ever week went by until christmas be over new year begun sign word trace of madeline rowan have seen wrote carriston several time be in same place unhappy not ill treated evidently hallucination be still in full force at first intended that whole of tale must be told by upon getting so far struck that evidence of actor who played important part in drama must give certain occurrence to reader at first instead of at second hand so wrote to friend dick fenton of
