whose malice be more easily aroused than appeased have defied sir giles mompesson who be equally implacable in enmity a if two such enemy be not enough must need make third yet more dangerous than how so good master wolfe jocelyn cried to whom do refer to whom must refer master jocelyn wolfe rejoined to lord of buckingham whom wantonly insulted for latter indiscretion there can be excuse there may be for former be simple madness to affront nobleman of exalted rank second only in authority to king how have offended marquis demanded jocelyn surprised be possible can have spoken at random without knowledge of force of own word john wolfe rejoined looking hard at may be so for be plainly ignorant of world well then added lowering tone when said that two abominable extortioner be creature of

caution have said nothing half so strong a have just uttered master wolfe ah good young sir publicly proclaim opinion a do lord of buckingham name must more be called in question than majesty to associate marquis name with of known instrument be to give mortal offence even to hint at connection be sufficient to provoke displeasure enough of purpose be not to lecture to befriend tell frankly

continued that day from four o'clock in morning till three o'clock in afternoon day before also a host of house told without intermission besides establishing existence of renowned bell at period foregoing passage be curious in other respect chapter xiv may queen puritan daughter popular sport pastime be wisely encouraged by james first whose great consideration for enjoyment of humbler class of subject can not be too highly commended since main purpose of history be to point out of abuse prevalent during reign be fair that at least one of redeeming feature must be mentioned have ever be practice of sour spirited sectarianism to discountenance recreation of kind however harmless on sabbath several flagrant instance of sort of interference on part of puritanical preacher disciple having come before james during progress through northern county of england especially lancashire caused on return to london famous declaration concerning lawful sport on sunday holiday to be promulgated wherein severe rebuke be administered to puritan precisians cause of people espoused in term while most creditable to monarch be not altogether inapplicable to other time besides in be

people for using lawful recreation honest exercise upon sunday other holiday after afternoon sermon service now find that two sort of people wherewith country be much infested mean papist puritan have maliciously traduced just honourable proceeding therefore have thought good hereby to clear make pleasure to be manifested to good people in part sum up argument in favour of license granted a follows for when will common people have leave to exercise if not upon sunday holiday seeing must apply labour win living in working day truly unanswerable proposition at same time that provision for rational recreation be made unlawful game be prohibited conformity be strictly enjoined on part of puritan disobedience be rendered punishable by expatriation a in case of recusant generally such be tenor of royal mandate addressed to bishop of diocese to inferior clergy throughout kingdom arbitrary might be be excellent in intention for stubborn necked personage have to be dealt with with whom milder measure must have proved ineffectual a be violent opposition be raised against decree puritanical preacher wore loud in condemnation a far a be consistent with safety vehement in attack upon royal author boon however be accepted by majority of people in spirit in be offered licence afforded be little abused perfect success indeed must have attended benign measure have not be for effort of puritanical popish party who made common cause against strove by mean to counteract beneficial influence first because in austerity of faith must not have sabbath in slightest degree profaned even by innocent enjoyment second not because cared about fancied desecration of lord day because must have other religion enjoy same privilege a own thus sectarianism intolerance went for once hand in hand openly covertly a found occasion did best to make people dissatisfied with benefit accorded trying to persuade acceptance must prejudice eternal welfare such argument however have great weight with mass who must not be brought to see heinous deadly sin in lawful recreation exercise after divine service always provided service be in respect neglected so king decree prevailed over sectarian

similar fascination from quarter befel in way at open oriel window in one of ancient picturesque habitation before described a facing green stood young maiden whose beauty be of so high order so peculiar character that at once attracted fixed attention such at least be effect produced by on jocelyn shrinking from public gaze perhaps from motive connected with religious scruple scarcely deeming right to be spectator of passing scene fair maiden be so placed a to be almost screened from general view yet chanced that jocelyn from circumstance of being on horseback from position be able to command portion of room in stood watched for minute before became aware be object of regard when at length perceived that gaze be steadily fixed upon deep blush suffused cheek must have instantly retired if young man have not at once lowered look still ever anon ventured glance towards oriel window be delighted to find maiden still there nay fancied must have advanced step two for must

feeling to be true have ever inculcated opinion upon child grandchild yet confess be surprised knowing what do of father character that mistress aveline must indulge with beholding profane spectacle ought by right to be odious in eye latter part of speech be uttered with sly chuckle on part of old farmer not altogether agreeable to jocelyn growing interest felt in fair puritan rendered susceptible eye of two young person have met again more than once be not quite so quickly withdrawn on side a before perhaps because aveline be le alarmed by young man appearance more attracted by perhaps on part because have grown little bolder know not how might be do know that fair puritan have gradually advanced towards front of window be now leaning slightly out of so that charm of face

jocelyn put horse into motion slowly followed almost expecting aveline to withdraw be agreeably disappointed by finding maintain place at window must have remarked what be going forward therefore tarrying emboldened buoyed up hope arrived beneath window gillian committed tambourine to dick taverner who still hovered behind like shadow fastening bouquet to end of shepherdess crook held up towards aveline cry out in playful tone with arch look 't be love gift to mistress aveline calveley on part of young cavalier whether offering thus presented must have be accepted may be questioned be never destined to reach for whom be intended scarcely be flower laden crook uplifted than man of singularly stern aspect with gray hair cut close to head grizzled beard military habiliment of ancient make suddenly appeared behind aveline seizing nosegay cast angrily contemptuously forth so that fell at jocelyn foot chapter xv hugh calveley jocelyn at once comprehended that person who have thus dashed nosegay to ground must be no other than hugh calveley doubt on point be removed by aveline herself who exclaimed in reproachful tone o father what have done what have done puritan rejoined speaking in loud voice a if desirous that word must reach assemblage outside have done that thou shouldbet have done aveline have signified abhorrence of vain ceremonial wherefore do find here be

from again muffling face went forth while slowly followed chapter xxvi forged confession little time have elapsed since aveline departure on sorrowful errand sir thomas lake be still alone once more deeply engrossed in consideration of document will be recollected have occasioned so much disquietude feeling by mean diminished when usher entered announced lady lake severe inflexible a have described secretary of state be generally yielding enough towards lady of whom stood in great awe whom treated with utmost deference on occasion contrary to habitude received very coldly without

to fight with own weapon to meet trick with trick manoevre with manoeuvre take word for must more easily defeat by straight forward mean be ruled by in one instance abandon scheme must inevitably lead to consequence shudder to contemplate let fabricated confession be destroyed give cried snatching paper from be ever timid sir thomas if have not lacked courage expedient must not have be necessary odious dangerous a be measure be forced upon will not shrink from will not be called upon to play part in transaction alone will do alone will be responsible for may ensue will be responsible rejoined

dissuade from so may spare breath sir thomas a see have omitted charge of witchcraft have only made countess confess criminality with lord roos of have have abundant proof nay must have still if condemnatory letter of hers have come into possession have not be stolen that mischance necessitates present measure having managed to deprive of weapon lord roos think secure will find mistake when document be produced to confound tremble at thought groaned secretary of state fear be worse than womanish exclaimed lady shake off be who be to prove that confession proceeds not from countess not since one will believe not lord roos for will be equally discredited not diego for testimony must be valueless countess hand writing have be so skilfully imitated that falsification can not be detected compare with note written by to lady roos though prof nothing have so far answered purpose compare say writing of confession signature with note declare if can discern difference between a to signature of lord roos diego affixed to document be equally well simulated that forgery be skilfully executed deny replied secretary of state circumstance though doe not lessen crime may lessen chance of detection since nothing can urge will turn from design be determined to employ dangerous instrument at least be cautious in use terrify lord roos with if choose threaten to lay before earl of exeter before king in case of son in law non compliance with demand beware how proceed further part with for moment so that if need be may destroy do heed lady do sir thomas replied be assured will act with due caution be glad to find be coming round to view be disposed to countenance measure countenance exclaimed secretary of state in alarm such thing disapprove of entirely can not sufficiently

lady roos attended by maid sarah swarton proceeded to earl of exeter residence at wimbledon for purpose of having interview with countess then saw in presence of lord roos servant diego gained nothing by journey remarked husband pardon sir thomas rejoined gained confession on way back reflected upon what have occurred thought how flushed with triumph must have be if instead of meeting with discomfiture have gained point if have brought haughty countess to knee have compelled to write out sign full avowal of guilt coupled with supplication for forgiveness from injured daughter a refinement of revenge have forced lord roos servant to attest by signature truth of confession thought of incensed have not done resolved must be done ill resolve muttered husband in luke hatton apothecary have man for purpose pursued lady lake aware of marvellous talent for imitating writing pleased aware also must entirely rely upon resolved to call in aid imprudent woman have placed wholly in power groaned sir thomas suppose must betray terrible trust have reposed in will not betray replied lady lake be too deeply implicated in matter not to keep silence for own sake to proceed document such a see be drawn out by transcribed by luke hatton writing so admirably counterfeited that lady exeter herself may well doubt if be not own then a to circumstance will bear out be known to have be at wimbledon on day in question be known to have have interview with lady exeter at lord roos diego be present interview be private therefore one can tell what took place at probability be that what

act a desired provided other mean failed of accomplishing object in view have failed since have lost letter for though have one other proof left might perhaps be adduced attach much importance to what be inquired sir thomas quickly will know anon answered suffice have done must to avoid having recourse to present measure have delayed execution to last moment that proof of be speaking cried sir thomas let hear perhaps may obviate necessity of dangerous proceeding think so will judge last night daughter obtained secret admittance to lord roos chamber found countess there fainting in arm why be enough to convict want nothing more hear to end will change opinion placing inanimate countess on couch covering face with handkerchief lord roos have effrontery to assert that be mistaken
