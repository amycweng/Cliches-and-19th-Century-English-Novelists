entering hall stood still for moment a gazed around singular indefinable expression crossed countenance passed away quickly be succeeded by grave composure now habitually distinguished look however have not be unnoticed by norris who be close beside watching anxiously made old butler think be acting part be in own chamber where one must observe that chetwynd gave utterance to few word revealed secret of breast once more be in father house murmured will never quit till penetrate mystery hide at length have learned to dissemble purpose will not be thwarted by haste imprudence part be hateful to will play with care former want of caution will avert suspicion from design will not even make old norris confidant remained for time in room occupied by variety of reflection until at last be disturbed by tap at door on opening norris came in evidently from manner expected that chet wynd must make depositary of secret be disappointed may be motive in coming back think have acted most judiciously said be truly glad to find that complete reconciliation have taken place between mr calverley though own never expected yes norris replied chetwynd have become really friend at one time never supposed must be so a be well aware strange thing happen be very much changed since saw last well own be changed sir for better very much improved hope mean to reside here altogether now do

have accepted offer here will remain must have be very unwise to refuse offer sir said norris be convinced of sincerity can not doubt after such proof a have given only wonder have shown so much forgiveness will have nothing to complain of in future approve of determination sir let bygone be bygone be completely puzzled did not believe in reality of reconciliation on one side other saw plainly enough there must be suspension of hostility obviously be greatly to chetwynd interest to yield to step mother hitherto step son have proved so obstinate that arrangement seemed impracticable on other hand norris have believed that mr calverley harboured great resentment against now seemed suddenly to have forgiven be deceiving other thought so iv of two captain danvers have never before be to ouselcroft be charmed with place house be admirably kept up garden in beautiful order mr calverley have received in most flattering manner have found mildred there cousin emmeline chetwynd have promised pleasant visit felt sure must turn out so what can offer greater attraction than agreeable country house with two three lovely inmate captain danvers have not quite made up mind whether preferred wealthy young widow pretty step daughter there be reason inclined to turn thought exclusively to mr calverley mildred image must not be dismissed fancied must be able to decide during stay at ouselcroft be not easy matter a found out possibly in accordance with plan have formed captain danvers devoted on day of arrival to mr calverley next day seemed inclined to go over to mildred did not give so much encouragement a have done at brackley piqued by indifference sought by mean to regain ground have apparently lost succeeded mr calverley resented neglect treated coldly in turn seemed therefore in danger of losing grand prize though found next to impossible to go on with be unwilling to give up then put momentous question to to of two must propose clearly mr calverley must be by far most advantageous match in pecuniary point of view being greatly governed by selfish consideration inclined towards still be really in love with mildred thought of losing be more than must bear on reflection found have put question to that must not answer very morning opportunity offered for saying tender word to mildred courage failed loving a did feeling sure loved in return hesitated to commit be walking in garden animated conversation with have commenced have gradually died away be succeeded by silence be almost embarrassing clearly moment have arrived what must do what say took hand did not withdraw pressed to lip oh disgrace to manhood word be uttered heaved deep sigh be be almost relief to when mr calverley emmeline be seen approaching how provoking exclaimed captain who however be secretly pleased by interruption have thought proper might have moved on instead of doing so turned round met who be coming towards mr calverley who have very quick sight have seen what took place did not of course make slightest remark until found shortly afterwards tte tte with captain others having walked on think explained to captain danvers what intention be in regard to mildred

ought to have added that will have sum on marriage provided approve of choice ah that proviso make difference exclaimed captain money may not be given after will never withhold unless see decided objection to match rejoined think over what have told more be said caution thus given produced effect intended on captain danvers saw that mildred be completely in step mother power that latter must hing if offended now rejoiced that have not made positive proposal a must then have be compelled to take fair girl without portion be not disinterested enough to do however put best face must on matter said be obliged to for information have given have meant to propose to miss calverley must not have deterred have such intention expect to believe after what beheld just now said mr calverley

who always declares will give portion of thirty thousand pound on marriage provided approves of choice be not that condition said captain yes mean nothing pardon think mean great deal might cause match to be broken off might certainly if acted upon mr calverley be very much attached to sister will never oppose choice at least fancy not have reason to believe otherwise dear chetwynd have already given pretty strong hint have said anything to about mildred have spoken to have clearly intimated that be not man of choice be to be accepted depend upon mildred must have portion think so be sure of can help see how have influence over mr calverley be determined not to meddle in family matter besides must do good think there be real ground for apprehension a have just said be extremely

see motive for theft since instrument must be valueless to in way again how must know that be placed in escritoire have key of drawer norris must not be thief who else must have taken unable to answer question turned thought to other matter mr calverley feeling be of mingled character though pride triumph predominated anxiety have increased step took seemed fraught with difficulty shook off misgiving congratulating on splendid achievement determined at risk might be consequence to carry out important arrangement have made iii how will be found mr calverley a already intimated have sent telegraphic message from london to mr carteret desiring to come to next morning at ousel croft gave hint of business on wished to consult by mentioning that expected lord courland accordingly about ten o'clock next morning in compliance with summons have received mr carteret made appearance be conducted by norris to cabinet just described where found beautiful widow seated at desk with writing

rather gravely be obliged to treat affair a matter of business must dismiss sentiment doe lordship propose to make handsome settlement upon doubt must if be in power be unable to do so feared not replied carteret hope doe expect settlement to be made on rather think doe replied lady surely have not made promise to effect observed carteret indeed have sir rejoined look surprised really must not do otherwise have promised to settle half property upon how will fulfil promise see difficulty in way rejoined have only to give necessary instruction if be must be easy enough can scarcely conceive possible can be in ignorance of in ignorance of what hastily interrupted of clause in late husband will directs that in event of marrying again whole of property will go to mildred thus will have nothing more than settlement made upon before marriage be so asked mr calverley with astonishment be not aware of be exactly a state replied be amazed to find have not read will have read cried did not notice clause mention will show in moment if will give will said fear will have be stolen rejoined ejaculated yes wished to refer to last evening must not find have put in safe place put in one of drawer of escritoire drawer be locked will be gone have examined drawer to day asked carteret have not because consider further search completely useless must like to satisfy before making inquiry said carteret mr calverley unlocked top drawer opened have sooner done so than mr carteret sprang forward exclaiming why there be have come there by magic mr calverley must scarcely believe eye be certain examined drawer said carteret quite laura searched after how came will back can not explain replied mr calverley be clear one of servant have key fit lock scarcely like to say so suspect norris ca believe old man capable of such act said carteret however will speak of presently first let convince that statement in regard to will be correct here be clause be at very end of instrument hereby declare that if dear wife teresa will marry again without consent in writing first have obtained of dear daughter mildred then in such case whole of property hereby devised to said wife will go revert to said daughter mildred anything heretofore expressed to contrary notwithstanding ' thus see madam pursued if marry again property may be roughly estimated at five thousand pound per annum will go from will have nothing settlement can not imagine how important clause escaped can said mr calverley will now be necessary to decide whether will sacrifice present large income break off important match have just formed think can have much hesitation in opinion when lord courland learns how be circumstanced will be anxious to retire think so exclaimed mr calverley well will have excellent opportunity of testing sincerity of affection be taken quite by surprise a see mr carteret said mr calverley who be greatly agitated must have time for consideration before can decide anticipate difficulty be certainly awkward dilemma said carteret see how can get out of unless be content to remain single quite thought understood position must have ventured to give advice before wish have said mr calverley little imagined mildred held destiny in hand can not be aware of power have mean of judging replied carteret fancy not then let be kept in ignorance for short time till be able to think matter over can not will not give up lord courland love that alters case madam though can not give up know not whether be disinterested enough to take with small fortune fifteen hundred year be not small fortune said carteret have at rate if lord courland love a strongly a be persuaded doe be sure will be content with have be led to expect more said mr calverley yes be unfortunate expectation having be raised so highly disappointment may ensue anticipate rupture be to be apprehended let state did best to prevent introduction of objectionable clause into will remonstrance be ineffectual mr calverley be determined 'if marries again property will return to family ' said so be obliged to carry out instruction know not what be plan madam advice to be to delay marriage a long a can so that arrangement may be made with miss calverley will follow advice mr carteret when mildred discovers power think will prove impracticable may be so rejoined be still mistress of situation may prevent marriage can hing more evidently be in dark at present keep matter secret till have concocted plan will then be able to make better arrangement forget have enemy in house abstracted will still suspect norris be in possession of important secret will communicate be certain struck by what said mr carteret reflected for few minute under circumstance may be well to keep on good term with old norris said chetwynd mildred find be absent so that need not apprehend immediate interference from of summon if require counsel will come at once can render service just now mind make proposition to mildred without consulting left cabinet a went out found norris in hall took opportunity of speaking to well norris said be going to have great change in house before long how doe suit not at sir replied old butler who looked very gloomy 'd rather thing remained a be do really think sir marriage will take place what be to hinder remarked carteret looking at inquiringly nothing that know of replied norris perhaps mr calverley may change mind have got everything want now except husband replied carteret laughing may cost too dear said norris too dear what do mean young nobleman be not to be have for nothing replied norris well mr calverley can afford to pay high price for such luxury if chooses said carteret however be not way to look at matter norris be very great match must be conducted in befitting manner large settlement must necessarily be made dispute sir said norris can large settlement be made rascal have read will thought carteret of course can added aloud mr calverley can do what like with own well ought to know better than sir said norris fancy be mistaken always understood old master did wish wife to marry again concluded must take precaution to prevent doing so must advise to make such observation a to one norris said carteret not even to mr chetwynd miss mildred sir see what be driving at norris have better hold tongue keep quiet will do no good by meddling in what doe not concern thing be by mean settled most certainly marriage wo take place at present very likely may not take place at if doe testamentary direction will be strictly carried out

dearest teresa began though have nothing to say except to tell how supremely wretched feel now be gone however try to console by thought that will soon behold again in own house long so much to see a will be abode when be made happiest of mortal by possession of hand have to thank mr calverley for two thing first that be considerate enough to die secondly that left large property at entire

sufficiently thank for kind promise devotion will prove gratitude ouselcroft tell be charming place ought not to accept share in can refuse nothing offer not even that priceless treasure ask to write to though one word must enchant enable to endure separation adieu sweet teresa will count minute till meet perusal of letter gave mr calverley infinitely more pain than pleasure for now feared must never be able to carry out noble suitor wish saw plainly that must not be content with income derived from settlement read letter again conviction struck even more forcibly on second perusal revolved matter in mind very deliberately what must do dark thought possessed there seemed only one way of extricating from difficulty shrank from recurred again again till became ffamiliarised with idea

contrary to custom greatly to surprise of lady maid did not take her with time on going into dressing room did not neglect to lock door feeling now safe from intrusion sat down to reflect there be such turmoil in breast such confusion in brain that found impossible to do so calmly fancied loss of handkerchief with phial inside if have really occurred must have inevitably led to discovery of terrible crime have committed have completely unnerved be now quiet when dreadful catastrophe occurred suspicion must be instantly aroused slightest circumstance that bore upon dark deed must be weighed examined will have be prepared by carteret must not doubt have be read by norris supplied motive of crime inasmuch a showed that step daughter death must be extraordinarily advantageous to herself so advantageous indeed a almost to suggest mildred removal evidence sufficient to condemn must be furnished by laura whose strange curiosity have enabled to become fatal witness against when
