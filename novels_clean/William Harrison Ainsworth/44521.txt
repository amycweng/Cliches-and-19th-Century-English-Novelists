crafty animal must be owned general formation of feature favoured comparison nose be long sharp chin pointed forehead broad flat connected without intervening hollow with eyelid teeth when displayed seemed to reach from ear to ear then beard be of reddish hue complexion warm sanguine who have seen slumbering averred that slept with eye open might be merely figurative mode of describing customary vigilance certain be that slightest sound aroused astute personage be somewhat under middle size fairly proportioned inclining rather to strength than symmetry abounding more in muscle than in flesh must seem from attention evidently bestowed upon hidden complex machinery of grand system of villany at work around that chief object in taking up quarter in mint must have be to obtain private information respecting habit practice of inhabitant to be turned to account hereafter advancing towards wood jonathan fixed keen gray eye upon demanded in stern tone whether person who have taken refuge in adjoining house be bailiff not that know of replied carpenter who have in degree recovered confidence then presume have not be arrested have not answered wood firmly guessed a much perhaps

own convenience must be content to maintain for if have not be arrested have be disturbed be just reasonable must pay for occasioning such disturbance by own showing be in easy circumstance for be only natural to presume that man who owes nothing must be in condition to pay liberally can not therefore feel loss of such trifle a ten guinea however illogical inconclusive argument might appear to mr wood however might dissent from latter proposition did not deem expedient to make reply orator proceeded with harangue amid general applause of assemblage be perhaps exceeding authority in demanding so slight sum continued jonathan modestly master of mint may not be disposed to let off so lightly will be here in moment so will then learn determination in mean time let advise a friend not to irritate by refusal must be a useless a vexatious have very summary mode of dealing with refractory person assure best endeavour will be used to bring off on easy term have mentioned do call

measure hidden by large scarf deep hood drawn over head contributed to disguise still be evident from lofty bearing that have nothing in common except interest in proceeding with crew by whom be surrounded whence came who be what wanted be question naturally suggested to blueskin be about to seek for explanation when curiosity be checked by gesture of silence from lady hush said in low
