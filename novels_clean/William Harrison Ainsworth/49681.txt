porte d'aix by large force of cavalry numbering about fifteen hundred men headed by renzo da ceri then descended to escort whom have left on farther side of hill on road from aix when renzo da ceri came in sight of bourbon troop found that force be greater than own hesitated to make attack eventually galloped back to city be hotly pursued by bourbon pescara who despite cannonade directed against from tower bastion battlement followed to gate whence have issued only withdrew because drawbridge be raised v in what manner pomperant entered marseille two day afterwards marseille be invested by bourbon main body of imperial army occupied height overlooking city from east to west lanz knechts under count de hohenzollern de lodron be placed near shore division of spanish infantry under del

fixed tent from point operation be commenced against beleaguered city trench opened in direction of part of wall have be judged to be weakest pioneer laboured during night be protected by gabions mantelet suffered severely from fire of besieged frequent sortie be made by renzo da ceri many bloody conflict took place near trench engagement uniformly resulted in discomfiture of besieged consequently work advanced slowly steadily at length bourbon have drawn sufficiently near to use artillery with effect having erected battery opened tremendous fire upon portion of wall extending from porte d'aix to old franciscan convent besieged immediately replied cannon garnishing rampart bastion tower must be rendered available against assailant be brought into play even monstrous piece of ordnance appropriately enough called basilisk thundered from hill surmounted by clock tower huge cannon supposed to be largest then fabricated projected shot of hundred weight required sixty men to replace after discharge unwieldy size prevented good aim from being taken ponderous shot discharged at long interval must be easily avoided smaller gun however be better served directed caused considerable destruction among assailant ere many hour however breach have be made in wall bourbon hesitated to order immediate assault deeming aperture not wide enough must be possible to obtain exact information of state of city remarked to pomperant a entered tent with latter leave to lord said pomperant will bring information require exclaimed bourbon in surprise how will get into city task be not easy admit replied pomperant mean to swim across moat attempt to scale wall in face of arquebusiers think can manage to enter city from sea side where be le guarded to do must escape fleet elude vigilance of sentinel on wall of chateau de saint jean lastly must raise chain protects entrance to harbour can not be done be easier to penetrate city by breach made by gun difficult a task may be be ready to undertake rejoined pomperant will go alone will take hugues with can trust bourbon did not attempt to dissuade at nightfall pomperant attended by hugues started on expedition rode to part of coast where german lanz knechts be encamped night be dark favourable for enterprise a be accompanied by comte de hohenzollern guard interruption be offered by sentinel stationed at various point soon reached shore proceeded to little creek in fishing boat be moored instantly dismounting consigning horse to one of de hohenzollern soldier pomperant embarked in boat with hugues who took oar rowed cautiously along coast making for rocky headland screened entrance of harbour in few minute boat have got under cover of rock escaped notice of sentinel stationed on rampart of fort above wind be stirring only slight undulation be perceptible on surface of tideless sea while hugues kept little vessel moving pomperant who be seated in stern peered through gloom to see whether danger be at hand must just discern french fleet lying between group of island mouth of harbour concluded from sound reached that several boat be leaving ship at once determining on course to be pursued ordered hugues to move noiselessly on keep close to rock until gained entrance of harbour be done ere long boat upwards of dozen in number came up be filled with armed men doubtless sent by doria la fayette to strengthen garrison of city a soon a boat have passed hugues followed in wake speeded between rocky height guarding narrow channel boat be of course challenged by sentinel stationed on fort on side answer being satisfactory be allowed to pas hugues also passed without exciting suspicion have already be mentioned that heavy chain be drawn across mouth of harbour short delay occurred while obstacle be removed several men be standing with torch on rocky step aiding who be engaged in lowering ponderous chain while higher up stood guard of arquebusiers at length chain being dropped passage free throng of boat pushed into harbour close behind came hugues hoping in confusion to elude observation manouvre though skilfully managed did not escape detection torchlight revealed intruder authoritative voice from step called out hola who go there what boat be that stay give account of yourselves hugues paid attention to summons be reiterated by other voice hurrying on more rapidly than before contrived to place of other boat between arquebusiers so that latter must not fire in minute have disappeared in gloom luckily soldier in boat though heard shout disregarded pursued course without stopping a soon a be practicable hugues disengaged from dangerous companion while made way to wharf on left of basin struck across to opposite side where landing be effected without molestation at time harbour be entirely destitute of ship a vessel lying there must of course have be exposed to gun of hostile battery hence wharf at pomperant hugues landed be wholly deserted in fact there be very few building near spot for city have not a yet extended to side of harbour wall however surrounded basin be not far off place be gloomy attention of sentinel be elsewhere directed after securing boat to wharf pomperant hugues made way a quickly a must round head of basin a have before stated be then little better than swamp reaching city plunged into narrow street communicating with principal quay just a have entered street be only lighted by occasional lantern hung before door sound of martial footstep warned that patrol be approaching fearing might be stopped questioned withdrew into archway till guard have passed by then pursued way along street whieh gradually mounted hill until came to open space in midst of troop of cavalry be drawn up band be surrounded by crowd of citizen of whom carried torch in leader who be arrayed in complete suit of armour whose beaver be raised pomperant instantly recognised stern dark countenance of renzo da ceri be haranguing assemblage pomperant closely followed by hugues mingled with crowd to hear what said be of good cheer friend cried danger be past in few hour breach will be repaired measure have taken for defence of city be so complete that may laugh at threat of foe traitor bourbon boasted that must be master of city night be well for that did not dare to make good threat mention of bourbon name be received with perfect storm of yell execration when have subsided renzo went on have enemy who will show mercy said be to take city must be sacked by soldiery be false shouted pomperant who spoke demanded renzo fiercely let show may see who dare gainsay assertion there be moment pause during glance be turned in direction of imprudent speaker must not be discovered whoever uttered word must be friend of bourbon pursued renzo repeat that be traitor intention to deliver city to savage host therefore exhort to fight to last in defence of dear to save wife daughter from dishonour none will be spared again say be false vociferated pomperant seize traitor bring before roared renzo attempt be made to obey injunction several person be seized amid confusion prevailed pomperant hugues extricated from throng passed into side street just a dark narrow a that have recently traversed from noise shout reached be clear assemblage have just broken up presently renzo with mounted guard rode down street followed by number of men evidently part of assemblage who have be listening to harangue pomperant hugues allowed to be borne on by stream at length issued forth into wide esplanade ornamented with plane tree here intervened between city wall on left of open space within short distance of rampart stood bishop palace large monastic looking structure close beside be venerable church of saint cannat palace church be only two building near angle of wall be quite evident to pomperant that if bourbon must once obtain possession of city must fall marvel be that experienced engineer like renzo da ceri chabot de brion must allow to remain close to wall where breach have be made large body of lansquenets be collected with be band of armed citizen rampart also be thronged with arquebusiers canonniers remained standing near gun within few yard of breach battery have be reared on three large cannon be planted ready for service in case assault must be made already repair be more than half accomplished gap be filled up with huge stone piece of timber fascines other matter banked up with earth hundred men at time be engaged on operation hundred others stood by ready to relieve so there be pause officer be stationed on wall on side of breach giving order superintending work after watching proceeding for time with interest such a soldier only can feel satisfying that breach must infallibly be repaired before daybreak pomperant moved away following course of wall examined a well a must in gloom proceeding in manner made circuit of city result of scrutiny be that be in perfect state of defence remarked that gate exposed to attack be blocked up protected on inside by parapet battery also noticed that rampart be garnished with cannon that sentinel everywhere be doubled bastion indeed be thronged with armed men be evident that whole garrison be on alert officer accompanied by mounted guard be continually riding from gate to gate while others made round on battlement to see good watch be kept patrol horse foot be likewise moving about in direction enough be seen by pomperant to convince that most energetic defence must be made that must be long before place must be taken having completed examination of wall re entered city shaped course a well a must in direction of mound on summit of stood clock tower a hugues be unacquainted with marseille more than once lost way though there be plenty of people abroad did not dare to question lest must be found out that be stranger pomperant have begun to despair of reaching mound when unexpectedly came upon vi

bourbon tent be concealed from view position be marked by proud banner floating above wall of little chapel of saint lazare pescara tent be likewise hidden by sacred edifice banner be a conspicuous a of bourbon course of trench advanced in zig zag towards wall must be readily traced men be at battery waiting order to open fire from battery pomperant naturally turned to rampart faced saw that

preparation for energetic defence be made a yet not gun have be fired by besieger pomperant waited with breathless impatience for commencement of hostility there be something ominous in silence now prevailed martial sound recently saluting ear have ceased drum trumpet be stillness be undisturbed for morning be calm numerous banner on wall tower hung motionless after running eye along rampart crowded with arquebusiers pikemen pomperant once more turned gaze towards little chapel on hillside at moment came forth troop of knight sheathed in polished armour at head rode bourbon pescara distinguishable even at distance from splendour of accoutrement rich housing of steed have short battle axe at saddle bow carried bton in token of command a knightly troop rode slowly down hill towards battery movement be watched with keenest interest by thousand of soldier from rampart tower of city still not gun be fired at moment pomperant whose attention have be for time diverted by other object from battery near stood be reminded of proximity by bustle among artilleryman who have charge of monster cannon looking in direction saw be about to fire match being applied be almost stunned by tremendous detonation ensued sound be echoed from height reverberated like thunder from rock near harbour course of huge shot must be distinctly traced be watched by thousand of eye bourbon

artillery balmy air filled with cloud of sulphurous smoke be time before basilisk must be restored to place more than hundred men be required for task labour be quite thrown away for second shot be better aimed than first indeed alarmed besieger for fell into moat meantime roar of ordnance be uninterrupted pomperant looked curiously at wall though destruction be caused among defender little damage be done to rampart conflict have endured for more than hour during pomperant enchained by exciting spectacle have remained on same spot when sound of trumpet called attention to porte d'aix perceived that large troop of cavalry have be collected at point leader of troop be chabot de brion who be fully armed mounted on powerful charger pomperant at once comprehended that sortie be about to be made by commander of garrison in minute gate be thrown open drawbridge lowered brion dashed out at head of men sword in hand galloped up hill towards battery ere got half way thither be encountered by bourbon who have just be joined by detachment of horse sharp conflict ensued resulting in defeat of brion party who be driven back with considerable loss to city so hard pressed be fugitive although leader escaped several officer be captured during skirmish seemed like interlude in terrible drama cannonading went on a furiously a ever other incident occurred to relieve monotony of siege satisfied little impression must be made upon wall pompeiant quitted mound went in search of house of entertainment where might break fast be not long in discovering tavern be not without trepidation that entered vii amazon cold viand flanked by bottle of good wine be soon set before by tavernkeeper who talked about siege seemed full of uneasiness lest city must be taken be told that bourbon mean to allow three day pillage to soldier if take city remarked a to poor woman not even holy sister will be respected alarm without reason good host said pomperant city will not be sacked outrage will be committed how know demanded tavern keeper staring at in surprise because such severity must be wholly inconsistent with bourbon previous conduct returned pomperant ever since have be

like fighting ever since siege began have be able to sleep in bed so believe bourbon to be bloodthirsty monster be represented eh on contrary be persuaded must offer very advantageous term to garrison if must surrender said pomperant why surrender groaned host betray sir hastened to add renzo da ceri must hang if heard have expressed unpatriotic sentiment fear nothing good fellow said pomperant laughing be quite a unpatriotic a for concur with in opinion belong to andrew doria fleet only landed last night so know much about state of city answer frankly how long do think can hold out perhaps month perhaps longer say can hold out till king come to relieve if king must come what then remarked pomperant nay then must yield will have dreadful fighting when woman turn soldier look a if
