richard assheton entered church greatly pleased with effect of flowery garland with various pew be decorated said a much to vicar who smilingly replied that be glad to find approved of practice even though might savour of superstition a good doctor walked away being called forth young man almost unconsciously turned into chapel on north aisle here stood for few moment gazing round church wrapt in pleasing meditation in many object somewhat foreign to place time passed through mind when chancing to look down saw small funeral wreath of mingled yew cypress lying at foot slight tremor passed over frame a found be standing on ill omened grave of abbot paslew before must ask by whom sad garland have be so deposited nicholas assheton came up to with look of great uneasiness cried come away instantly dick do know where be standing on grave of last abbot of whalley replied richard smiling have forgotten common saying cried nicholas that assheton who stand on unlucky grave will die within year come away at once be too late replied richard have incurred fate if such fate be attached to tomb a moving away will not preserve so tarrying here can not injure further have fear have more courage than posse rejoined nicholas must not set foot on accursed stone for county malign influence on house have be approved too often first to experience fatal destiny be richard assheton john braddyll purchaser of abbey met here together on anniversary of abbot execution forty year after occurrence be true when be pretty well stricken in year within year namely died be buried in vault on opposite side of church not many pace from old enemy last instance be poor brother richard who being incredulous a be be resolved to brave destiny stationed upon tomb during divine service too died within appointed time be bewitched to death so at least be affirmed said richard assheton with smile believe in one evil influence just a much a in other matter not how destiny be accomplished so come to pas rejoined squire turning away heaven shield from stay said richard picking up wreath who think can have placed funeral garland on abbot grave can not guess cried nicholas staring at in amazement enemy of ours most likely be customary lawful in protestant country so to ornament graf put down dick will not displace certainly replied richard laying down again a little think have be placed here by hostile hand a do that harm will ensue to from standing here to relieve anxiety however will come forth added stepping into aisle why must enemy deposit garland on abbot tomb since be by mere chance that hath met eye mere chance cried nicholas thing be mere chance with philosopher there be more than chance in mind misgives strangely that terrible old abbot paslew be a troublesome to in death a be during life to predecessor richard assheton not content with making tombstone weapon of destruction to pay abbey occasional visit appearance always betides disaster to family have never seen trust never will other people have have be nigh scared out of sens by apparition idle tale invention of overheated brain rejoined richard trust abbot rest will not be broken till day when will rise from tomb though if ever dead supposing thing possible must be justified in injuring affrighting living might be in case since mainly owed destruction to ancestor on same principle have be held that church land be unlucky to lay possessor see how superstitious notion have be disproved in own family to whom whalley abbey domain have brought wealth power worldly happiness there be something in notion nevertheless replied nicholas though case may hope continue exception to rule most grantee of ecclesiastical house have found curse time may come when abbey may prove so to descendant without discussing point there be one instance in malignant influence of vindictive abbot have undoubtedly extended long after death have heard suppose that pronounced dreadful anathema upon child of man who have reputation of being wizard who afterwards acted a executioner know not whole particular of dark story know that paslew fixed curse upon child declaring must become witch mother of witch prediction have be verified nigh eighty year have flown by since then infant still life fearful mischievous witch family be similarly fated be witch never heard story before said richard somewhat thoughtfully guess to whom allude mother demdike of pendle forest family precisely rejoined nicholas be brood of witch in case alizon device must be witch cried richard think will hardly venture upon assertion after what have seen of to day if be witch must there be many such a fair gentle see not how easily matter be explained 'give dog ill name hang ' proverb with be familiar enough so with mother demdike whether really uttered not abbot curse upon issue have be bruited abroad hence be made witch child be supposed to inherit infamous taint so be with yon tomb be said to be dangerous to family dangerous doubt be to who believe in saying luckily prophecy work own fulfilment absurdity injustice of yielding to opinion be manifest wrong can have be done abbot by mother demdike more than by child yet be to be punished for misdeed of predecessor ay just a who be of third fourth generation may be punished for sin of father rejoined nicholas have scripture against dick only thing see in favour of argument be instance allege of alizon doe not look like witch certainly there be saying may be only more dangerous for rare beauty apparent innocence must answer for truth with life cried richard quickly be impossible to look at countenance in candour purity shine forth doubt goodness hath cast spell over dick be certain rejoined nicholas laughing to be serious alizon admit be exception to rest of family that only strengthens general rule did ever remark strange look save fair maid in question have about eye richard answered in negative be very singular wonder have not noticed pursued nicholas question of reputed witchcraft in mother demdike have chance of being speedily settled for master potts little london lawyer who go with to pendle forest to morrow be about to have arrested examined before magistrate indeed exclaimed richard must be prevented why so exclaimed nicholas in surprise because prejudice existing against be sure to convict destroy replied richard great age infirmity poverty will be proof against how can old enfeebled creature like whose decrepitude misery must move compassion rather than excite fear how can such person defend against charge easily made impossible to refute deny possibility of witchcraft even in own day though think of very unlikely occurrence must determinately resist giving credit to tale told by superstitious vulgar who naturally prone to cruelty have so many motif for revenging imaginary wrong be placing dreadful weapon in hand of have cunning enough to know use mercy justice enough to restrain from using better let one guilty person escape than many innocent perish so many undefined charge have be brought against mother demdike at last have fixed stigma on name made object of dread suspicion be endowed with mysterious power must have effect if not believed in now must be burned because be called witch be doting vain enough to accept title there be something in witch difficult nay almost impossible to describe said nicholas can not be mistaken about by general ill course of life by repeated act of mischief by threat followed by consequence menaced becomes known there be much mystery in matter not permitted human knowledge entirely to penetrate a know from scripture that sin of witchcraft did exist a have evidence that have ceased so be fair to conclude that there may be practisers of dark offence in own day such hold to be mother demdike mother chattox rival potentate in evil contend will do most mischief must be admitted former bear away bell if ill attributed to be really caused by machination might be correct replied richard only show to be more calumniated than other in word cousin nicholas look upon a two poor old creature who persuaded really posse supernatural power accorded to by vulgar strive to act up to part be mainly assisted in doing so by credulity fear of audience admitting blind credulity of multitude said nicholas proneness to discern hand of witch in most trifling accident admitting also readiness to accuse old crone unlucky enough to offend of sorcery still believe that there be actual practisers of black art who for brief term of power have entered into league with satan worship attend sabbath have familiar in shape of cat dog toad mole to obey behest transform into various shape a hound horse hare raise storm of wind hail maim cattle bewitch slay human being ride whither will on broomstick holding contrary opinion will not apprehend aid master potts in quest of witch will not rejoined richard on contrary will oppose enough of let

to be sluggard for own part have be awake for hour have passed time wholly in self reproach for folly sinfulness last night a well a in forming resolution for self amendment better governance in future hope will adhere to resolution then nicholas rejoined sir ralph sternly for change of conduct be absolutely necessary if must maintain character a gentleman can make allowance for high animal spirit can excuse licence though approve of will not permit decorum to be outraged in house suffer so ill example to be set to tenantry fortunately be not present at exhibition said dewhurst be told conducted like one possessed committed such freak a be rarely if ever acted by rational being can offer defence worthy sir respected relative returned nicholas with contrite air can reprove more strongly than deserve than upbraid myself allowed to be overcome by wine in condition be undoubtedly guilty of folly must ever regret amongst others believe stood upon head remarked dewhurst be not aware of circumstance reverend sir replied nicholas with difficulty repressing smile a certainly lost head may have stood upon unconsciously do recollect enough to make heartily ashamed of myself determine to avoid such excess in future in case sir rejoined dewhurst occurrence of last night though sufficiently discreditable to will not be without profit for have observed to infinite regret that be apt to indulge in immoderate potation when under influence to lose due command of yourself commit folly sober reason must condemn at such time scarcely recognise speak with unbecoming levity even allow oath to escape lip be too true reverend sir said nicholas zounds plague upon tongue be unruly member forgive good sir brain be little confused wonder from grievous assault made upon last night nicholas observed sir ralph perhaps be not aware that crowning act be whisking wildly round room by like frantic dervish be dancing with isole de heton said nicholas with whom inquired dewhurst

returned sir ralph that be under impression at time can easily understand that must persist in such senseless wicked notion be more than can comprehend saw with own eye a plainly a see sir ralph replied nicholas warmly that declare upon honour conscience also felt pressure of arm whether may not have be fiend in likeness will not take upon to declare indeed have misgiving on subject that beautiful creature exactly resembling votaress danced with will ever maintain if so be invisible to others for beheld not said sir ralph though can not yield credence to explanation yet granting to be correct see how mend case on contrary only prof that master nicholas yielded to snare of satan said dewhurst shaking head must recommend long fasting frequent prayer good sir will prepare lecture for special edification will propound to on return to downham if fails in effect will persevere with other godly discourse with aid trust to be set free reverend sir returned nicholas a have already passed two three hour in prayer hope may stand in lieu of present fasting induce to omit article of penance postpone to future occasion when may be better able to perform for be just now particularly hungry be always better able to resist temptation with full stomach than empty one a find displeasing to sir ralph will not insist upon visionary partner in dance at least until be better able to substantiate fact will listen to lecture worthy sir with great delight doubt not with equal benefit in meantime a carnal want must be supplied mundane matter attended to propose with excellent host permission that proceed to breakfast sir ralph made answer ascended step be followed by dewhurst heaving deep sigh turning up white of eye by nicholas who felt bosom eased of half load secretly congratulated upon getting out of scrape so easily in hall found richard assheton habited in riding dress booted spurred in respect prepared for expedition there be such evident trace of anxiety suffering about that sir ralph questioned a to cause richard replied that have passed most restless night did not add that have be made acquainted by adam whitworth with midnight visit of two girl to

place between nowell potts after latter taking care to keep out of reach of halberts thus delivered in loud voice alice nutter in order to avoid serious consequence might ensue be necessary measure taken to effect forcible entrance into habitation worshipful master nowell have thought fit to grant hour respite for reflection at expiration of time trust that seeing futility of resisting law will quietly yield prisoner otherwise further leniency will be shown who may uphold in contumacy mistress nutter laughed loudly contemptuously at same time pursued potts on suggestion from magistrate master roger nowell demand that alizon device daughter of elizabeth device whom beholds in company who be likewise suspected of witchcraft be likewised delivered up to aught more inquired mistress nutter only replied potts in taunting tone worshipful magistrate must offer friendly counsel to master nicholas assheton master richard assheton whom to infinite surprise perceives in hostile position before that in nowise interfere with injunction on contrary lend aid in furtherance of otherwise may be compelled to adopt measure towards must be source of regret to have furthermore to state on part of worship that strict watch will be kept at approach of house that one on pretence during appointed time of respite will be suffered to enter depart from in hour worship will return in hour will have answer replied mistress nutter turning away chapter ix how rough lee be defended by nicholas when sky be darkest storm be gathering thickest overhead star of love will oft shine out with greatest brilliancy so while mistress nutter be hurling defiance against foe at gate laughing menace to scorn while very foe be threatening alizon liberty life have become wholly insensible to peril environing almost unconscious of other presence save that of richard now avowed lover for impelled by irresistible violence of feeling young man have chosen that moment apparently so unpropitious so fraught with danger alarm for declaration of passion offer of life in service few low murmured word be alizon must utter in reply be enough told richard passion be requited devotion fully appreciated sweet be moment to sweet though sad like alizon lover have become insensible to around engrossed by one thought one object be lost to aught else be only at last aroused to what be passing by squire who having good naturedly removed to little distance from pair now gave utterance to low whistle to let know that mistress nutter be coming towards lady however did not stop motioning to follow entered house have heard have passed said in hour master nowell threatens to return arrest alizon that will never be cried richard with passionate look at young girl will defend with life much may be done in hour observed nicholas to mistress nutter advice to be to use time allowed in making good retreat so that when hawk come back may find dove flown have intention of quitting dovecot replied mistress nutter with bitter smile unless be forcibly taken from suppose said squire contingency not impossible if await roger nowell return time be assured will not go away empty handed may not go away at rejoined mistress nutter sternly then mean to make determined resistance said nicholas recollect that be resisting law wish must induce to resort to safer expedient of flight affair be already dark perplexed enough doe not require further complication find place of concealment matter where till arrangement can be made with roger nowell must rather urge to fly nicholas rejoined lady for be evident have strong misgiving a to justice of cause must not willingly compromise will not surrender to magistrate because by so doing life must assuredly be forfeited for innocence must never be established before iniquitous bloody tribunal to must be brought for same reason will surrender alizon who with refinement of malignity have be similarly accused will now proceed to make preparation for defence go if think fitting stay if do stay will calculate upon active service may replied squire may think admire spirit will stand by time be passing foe will return find engaged in deliberation when ought to be prepared have dozen men on premise on whom can rely half of must be placed at back of house to prevent entrance from being effected in quarter rest can remain within entrance hall be ready to rush forth when summoned by will not so summon unless be hardly put to aid be indispensable must be well armed trust will not have to use weapon be agreed to madam be replied mistress nutter will give instant direction that wish be complied with approach to back of house will be strictly guarded a direct trusty man blackadder on whose fidelity courage can entirely rely will take command of party in hall act under order prowess will not be unobserved for alizon will be in upper room commanding garden whence can see take place slight smile be exchanged between lover be evident from anxious look that alizon did not share in richard confidence opportunity however be presently afforded of again endeavouring to reassure for mistress nutter went forth to give blackadder order nicholas betook to back of house to ascertain from personal inspection chance of security be still uneasy dear alizon said richard taking hand be cast down harm will befall be not for be apprehensive replied for who be about to expose to needle risk in encounter if thing must happen to will be for ever wretched must far rather left to fate can think must allow to be borne away captive to ignominy certain destruction cried richard will shed heart best blood before such calamity will occur ala said alizon have mean of requiting devotion can offer in return be love fear will prove fatal to oh say so cried richard why must sad presentiment still haunt strove to chase away just now hoped have succeeded be dearer to than life why therefore must not risk in defence why must love prove fatal to know not replied alizon in tone of deepest anguish feel a if destiny be evil that against will will drag most love on earth into same dark gulf with have greatest affection for sister dorothy yet have be unconscious instrument of injury to too richard who be yet dearer to be now put in peril on account fear too when know whole history will think of a thing of evil shun what mean alizon cried richard can have secret from replied though be forbidden to tell what be now about to disclose will not withhold be born in house be daughter of mistress tell only what guessed alizon rejoined young man see nothing in why must shun alizon hid face for moment in hand then looking up said wildly hurriedly must have never known secret of birth knowing have never seen what beheld last night what did behold asked richard greatly agitated enough to convince that in gaining mother be lost replied alizon for oh how can survive shock of telling be bound by tie can never be dissevered to one abandoned alike of god man who have devoted to fiend pity richard pity shun there be moment dreadful pause young man be unable to break be not right in saying love must be fatal to continued alizon fly from while can richard fly from house be lost for ever never never will not stir without cried richard come with escape danger by be menaced leave sinning parent to doom so richly merit sinful though be be still mother can not leave cried alizon if stay stay be consequence what may replied young man have rendered arm powerless by what have told how can defend one whom know to be guilty therefore urge to fly rejoined can reconcile to thus said richard in defending whom know to be innocent can not avoid defending plea be not good one will suffice to allay scruple of conscience at moment mistress nutter entered hall followed by blackadder three other men armed with calivers be ready richard said want few minute of appointed time perhaps shrink from task have undertaken added regarding sharply if so say so at once will adopt own line of defence nay will be ready to go forth in moment rejoined young man glancing at alizon where be nicholas here replied squire clapping on shoulder be secure at back of house horse be coming round must mount at once richard arose without word blackadder will attend to order said mistress nutter only wait sign from to issue forth with three companion to fire through window upon aggressor if see occasion for trust will not come to pas rejoined squire few blow from weapon will convince be in earnest will hope save further trouble a spoke took down couple of stout stave gave one of to richard farewell then preux chevalier cried mistress nutter with affected gaiety demean yourselves valiantly remember bright eye will be upon now alizon to chamber richard did not hazard look at young girl a quitted hall with mother followed squire mechanically into garden where found horse scarcely be mounted than loud hubbub arising from little village proclaimed that opponent have arrived presently after large company of horse foot appeared at gate at sight of large force brought against countenance of squire lost confident jovial expression pie counted nearly forty men of whom be armed in way other began to fear affair must terminate awkwardly entail unpleasant consequence upon cousin be therefore by mean at ease a to richard did not dare to ask how thing must end neither did know how to act mind be in utter confusion breast oppressed a if by nightmare cast one look towards upper window beheld at white face of mistress nutter intently gazing at what be going forward alizon be not to be seen within last half hour sky have darkened heavy cloud hung over house threatening storm richard hoped must come on fiercely fast meanwhile roger newell have dismounted advanced to gate gentleman cried addressing two asshetons expected to find free access given to follower a gate be still barred against call upon a loyal subject of king not to resist impede course of law to throw instantly open must unbar master nowell replied nicholas will give help offer opposition hope sir said magistrate sternly be twenty to one thereabout returned squire with laugh will stand poor chance with other defensive offensive preparation have be made doubt not said nowell nay descry armed men through window of hall before coming to extremity will make last appeal to kinsman have granted mistress nutter girl with hour delay in hope that seeing futility of resistance must quietly surrender find clemency thrown away undue advantage taken of time allowed for respite therefore will show further consideration to friend must offer last warning forget not that be acting in direct opposition to law that be here armed with full authority power to carry out intention that opposition on part will be fruitless will be visited upon hereafter with severe pain penalty forget not also that character will be irrecoverably damaged from connexion with party charged with heinous offence of witchcraft meddle not therefore in matter go way if must act a best becomes aid in arrest of offender master roger nowell replied nicholas walking horse slowly towards gate a have given caution will give one in return be to put bridle on tongue when address gentleman by fay be likely to get answer little to taste have said that character be likely to suffer in transaction in humble opinion will not suffer so much a own magistrate who us arm of law for purpose of private vengeance who brings false foul charge against enemy knowing that can not be repelled be not entitled to particular respect honour thus have acted towards mistress nutter defeated by in boundary question without leaving decision to to whom have referred instantly accuse of witchcraft seek to destroy a well a innocent unoffending girl by whom be attended be such conduct worthy of likely to redound to credit think not be not aided by crafty unscrupulous ally master potts get together number of mistress nutter tenant by threat misrepresentation induce to become instrument of vengeance when misguided men come to know truth of case when learn that have proof against mistress nutter that be influenced solely by animosity to be quite a likely to desert a to stand by at event be determined to resist unjust arrest at hazard of life to oppose entrance into house nowell potts be greatly exasperated by speech be little prepared for consequence many of who have be induced to accompany a have be shown wavered in resolution of acting against mistress nutter now began to declare in favour in vain potts repeated former argument be no longer of avail of troop assembled at gate more than half marched off shaped course towards rear of house with what intention be easy to surmise while of who remained be very doubtful whether whole of must act result of oration be quite a surprising to nicholas a to opponent enchanted by effect of eloquence must not help glancing up at window where perceived mistress nutter whose smile showed that be equally well pleased seeing that if further desertion took place chance must be at end with menacing gesture at squire roger nowell ordered attack to commence immediately while of men amongst whom be baldwyn old mitton battered against gate with stone party headed by potts scaled wall though of considerable height presented very serious obstacle in way of active assailant elevated on shoulder of sparshot potts be soon on summit of wall be about to drop into garden when heard sound caused to suspend intention what be about to do cousin nicholas inquired richard a word of assault be given by magistrate let loose mistress nutter stag hound upon replied squire be kept in leash by varlet stationed behind yon yew tree hedge who only awaits signal to let slip by faith be time have a spoke applied dog whistle to lip blowing loud call be immediately answered by savage barking dozen hound rough haired of prodigious size power resembling in colour ferocity irish wolf hound bounded towards aha exclaimed nicholas clapping hand to encourage must have dispersed whole rout with assistant hyke tristam hyke hubert upon upon be savage barking of hound have caught ear of alarmed attorney made desirous to scramble back again be such easy matter sparshot broad shoulder be wanting to place foot upon while be bruising knee against roughened side of wall in vain attempt to raise to top of unaided hubert sharp teeth met in calf of leg while of tristam be fixed in skirt of doublet penetrated deeply into flesh filled terrific yell proclaimed attorney anguish alarm redoubled effort to escape if before be difficult to get up feat be now impossible must do be to cling with desperate tenacity to coping of wall for made doubt if dragged down must be torn in piece roaring lustily for help besought nicholas to have compassion upon squire appeared little moved by distress laughed heartily at yell vociferation will not come again on like errand in hurry fancy master potts said will not good master nicholas rejoined potts for pity sake call off infernal hound will rend asunder a must fox be cunning fox in good sooth to come hither rejoined nicholas in taunting tone will go hence if liberate will indeed will replied potts will no more molest mistress nutter thundered nicholas take heed what promise roared nowell from other side of wall if promise hound will pull down make meal of cried nicholas do swear desire cried terrified attorney hound be then called off by squire nerved by fright potts sprang upon wall tumbled over upon other side alighting upon head of respected singular good client whom brought to ground meanwhile unlucky person who have succeeded in scaling wall be attacked by hound unable to stand against be chased round garden to infinite amusement of squire frightened to death unable otherwise to escape for gate allowed mean of exit poor wretch fled towards terrace overlooking pendle water leaping into stream gained opposite bank there be safe for hound be not allowed to follow further in way garden be completely cleared of enemy nicholas richard be left master of field leaning out of window mistress nutter laughingly congratulated on success a further disposition be manifested on part of nowell such of troop remained to renew attack contest for present at least be supposed to be at end by time also intimation have be conveyed by deserter from nowell troop who will be remembered have made way to back of premise that be anxious to offer service to mistress nutter a soon a be told ordered to be admitted descended to give welcome thus thing wore promising aspect for besieged while assailing party be proportionately disheartened long ere baldwyn old mitton have desisted from attempt to break open gate indeed rejoiced that barrier be interposed between hound whose furious onslaught witnessed bolt be launched against four footed guardian of premise by bearer of crossbow man proved indifferent marksman for instead of hitting hound disabled one of companion who be battling with finding thing in state that nowell potts returned to charge while follower be withdrawn from before gate nicholas thought might fairly infer that victory have be obtained like prudent leader did not choose to expose till enemy have absolutely yielded therefore signed to blackadder men to come forth from hall order be obeyed not only by by seceders from hostile troop thirty men issued from principal door ranging upon lawn set up deafening triumphant shout very different from raised by same individual when under command of nowell at same moment mistress nutter alizon appeared at door at sight of shouting be renewed unexpected turn in affair have not be without effect upon richard alizon tended to revive spirit of immediate danger by be threatened have vanished time be given for consideration of new plan richard have be firmly resolved to take further part in affray than must be required for protection of alizon consequently be little satisfaction to to reflect that victory have be accomplished without by mean must not afterwards be questioned meanwhile mistress nutter have joined nicholas gate being unbarred by blackadder passed through at little distance stood roger nowell now altogether abandoned except by own immediate follower with baldwyn old mitton poor potts be lying on ground piteously bemoaning laceration skin have undergone well have got worst of master nowell said nicholas a mistress nutter approached discomfited magistrate must own fairly defeated defeated a be must rather be in place than in yours sir retorted nowell sourly have have wholesome lesson read master nowell said mistress nutter come

though may escape now day of reckoning will come chief cause of grievance against be aware replied mistress nutter calmly be have beaten in matter of land now have proposal to make to respecting can not listen to rejoined nowell sternly can have dealing with witch at moment cloak be plucked behind by potts who looked at a much a to say exasperate hear what have got to offer will be happy to act a mediator between if possible observed nicholas in case must request master nowell to abstain from offensive language what be have to propose to then madam demanded magistrate gruffly come with into house will hear replied mistress nutter nowell be about to refuse peremptorily when cloak be again plucked by potts who whispered to go be not snare laid to entrap madam said regarding lady suspiciously will answer for good faith interposed nicholas nowell still hesitated counsel of legal adviser be enforced by heavy shower of rain just then began to descend upon can take shelter beneath roof said mistress nutter before shower be over can settle matter wound can be dressed at same time said potts with groan for pain sorely blackadder have sovereign balsam with patch two of diachylon will make right replied nicholas unable to repress laugh here lift up between added to groom convey into house order be obeyed mistress nutter led way through now wide opened gate slow majestic march by mean accelerated by drenching shower what roger nowell sensation be at following in such way after previous threat boasting may be easily conceived chapter x roger nowell double magistrate be ushered by lady into small chamber opening out of entrance hall in consequence of having only one small narrow window with clipped yew tree before be extremely dark gloomy wall be covered with sombre tapestry on entering mistress nutter not only carefully closed door drew arras before so a to prevent possibility of conversation being heard outside precaution taken motioned magistrate to chair seated opposite can now deal unreservedly with other master nowell said fixing eye steadily upon a discourse can not be overheard repeated may use perfect freedom of speech be glad of replied nowell

silence be obliged to put check upon loquacity when within bowshot from water party came to halt two of men be directed by crouch to cross stream at different point then commence beating bank while other two be ordered to pursue like course to keep on near side of river hound be next uncoupled men set off to execute order have received soon afterwards crashing of branch splashing of water accompanied by deep baying of hound told be at work meanwhile nicholas others have not remained idle a varlet struck off in different direction went straight on forcing way through brushwood came to high bank overlooking ribble on top of grew three four large tree whose root laid bare on further side by swollen current of winter formed convenient resting place for fish loving creature hoped to

watching with keen gaze for appearance of anticipated victim having descended bank nicholas have so placed among huge twisted root of tree that if otter alarmed by presence of so many foe unable to escape up down river must return to couch made certain of striking at first there seemed little chance of such occurrence for fogg who have gone hundred yard higher up suddenly dashed into stream plunging spear into mud cried out that have hit beast next moment when drew weapon forth exhibited large rat have transfixed mistake excited much merriment old crouch meantime did not suffer attention to be drawn from dog now then saw come to surface to breathe a kept within short distance though rising at different point old huntsman felt certain otter have not got away having utmost reliance upon grip perseverance sagacity felt confident must bring quarry to if thing be possible varlet kept up incessant clatter beating water with stave casting large stone into while hound bayed furiously so that poor fugitive be turned on whichever side attempted retreat while be going on nicholas be cautioned by huntsman to look out scarcely have admonition reached than sleek shining body of otter emerged from water wreathed among root squire instantly dealt blow expected to prove fatal mortification be excessive when found have driven spear head so deeply into tree that must scarcely disengage
