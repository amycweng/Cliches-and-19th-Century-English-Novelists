dismounting cast wistful look around surveyed grass grown neglected court where in year gone by have sported moat on whose brink have lingered surrounding wood have never looked upon even on dreary day like present when be robbed in measure of beauty without delight scanning deserted mansion from roof to foundation traced gable angle window door wall claimed piece of carved work stone a familiar object a associated with other happier hour be wreck of what be thought spirit animated be fled grass grows in court cheerful voice echo in chamber hospitality be maintained in hall neglect gloom despair claim a own habitation mistress be well matched guessing from melancholy expression of countenance what be passing within thinking advisable to turn current of thought garnet assisted to

keenly excited can not join in terrible denunciation what hope for what pray for be toleration not vengeance suffering of brother will not have be in vain if enable successor to worship god in own way
