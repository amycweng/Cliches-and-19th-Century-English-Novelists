weir charles ordered guard to retire leave prisoner with said if attempt to fly shoot a soon a command be obeyed said can speak freely now why must spare life firstly because will prove to world that be magnanimous prince in respect superior to enemy who be notorious for severity replied weir next because can tell much that behoves royal highness to know a will be evident when declare that be employed by duke of cumberland a spy be therefore necessarily in royal highness confidence if life be spared be allowed to go back to lichfield where duke be quartered can mislead by erroneous information while will be able to acquaint with plan exact knowledge of need not say will be eminently serviceable there be much in what say must own replied prince what guarantee have that will not

adversary insisted on going on when clatter of horse hoof be heard rapidly approaching spot next moment prince appeared mounted on splendid bay charger attended by orderly without waiting moment charles rode down into hollow pushing between combatant ordered to sheathe sword of course command be instantly obeyed word with gentleman said prince sternly must have be aware that hostile meeting

quiet enough be evident from tumultuous sound reached ear not only that inhabitant generally be astir that numerous company billeted upon be likewise moving about call of bugle resounded from various quarter beating of drum be heard in almost street charles listened delightedly to sound proclaimed presence of army thought of advance have already made how week march must bring to london breast beat

whom be duel fought inquired constance unable to repress emotion not with not with atherton legh supplied prince though quarrel be on account sir richard adversary be colonel townley luckily father be disarmed so affair be brought to end duel appears to have be unavoidable since sir richard refused to apologise to captain legh for rudeness offered must not even give satisfaction colonel townley therefore took up quarrel know result be affair ended asked eagerly not quite full explanation seems to to be due from sir richard rawcliffe to captain legh to insure have laid command upon sir richard to meet captain legh in presence after levee in order that may answer certain question will then put to fear will not be agreeable to father might have avoided few word must set right refuse to utter have therefore alternative to compel to speak out be right that captain legh must know truth remarked constance felt sure must think so therefore enjoined sir richard to bring with if see objection will excuse attendance perhaps presence may be necessary rejoined will come be well said prince owe captain legh large debt of gratitude be anxious to pay will begin by setting right that

atherton cause in hand meant to carry through to successful issue monica who have be much pained at misunderstanding between lover be rejoiced priest felt differently meantime atherton by mean certain that be welcome endeavoured to excuse to constance trust miss rawcliffe will not blame for intrusion said can dismiss a soon a think proper must be impossible since have be left with by prince rejoined have desire to dismiss on contrary be glad to have opportunity of congratulating on good fortune have gained prince favour be therefore on high road to distinction if be restored to good

military experience have fought with father george second at battle of dettingen in in may engaged marshal saxe at fontenoy sustained most crushing defeat highly prejudicial to english renown though thus defeated by superior military skill of marshal saxe duke displayed so much gallantry personal courage during action that did not lose popularity in england be very well received on return on outbreak of rebellion in same year followed by defeat of general cope at preston pan attack on edinburgh march of young chevalier at head of highland army into england assumed command of royal force prepared to drive rebel out of kingdom instead of doing to general surprise allowed scot to continue advance a far a derby will always remain doubtful whether if prince have marched on to london daring attempt must not have be crowned by success contemporary historian unquestionably thought so emphatically declares have adventurer proceeded in career with expedition have hitherto used might have made master of metropolis where must have be certainly joined by considerable number of well wishers who waited impatiently for approach when prince commenced retreat duke immediately started in pursuit though made real effort to overtake a have seen be repulsed by lord george gordon at clifton near penrith again instead of pursuing rebel into scotland sat down to besiege carlisle duke be surrounded by staff when captain legh be brought before by colonel conway smollett history of england reign of george second who be rash fellow who seems anxious to throw away life demanded duke thought knew for feature seem strangely familiar to replied colonel conway must be mistaken give name a atherton legh captain of manchester regiment atherton legh have cried duke then fixing stern look upon young man said have better have remained faithful to government sir now will die a traitor rebel be prepared to meet fate whatever may be replied atherton firmly might order for instant

that inhabitant must be kept in check with small force at command became evident to colonel townley that must surrender calling officer together thus addressed position be most critical outside wall be completely blockaded inside inhabitant be against one mean of escape have occurred to be so hazardous that ought scarcely to be adopted sortie might be made by small party of horse might succeed in cutting way through enemy if couple of barge must be found rest might manage to float down eden plan have occurred to colonel said captain dawson be impracticable since barge boat have be destroyed possibly few men might escape by swimming down river in other way said colonel townley be so completely environed that escape be impossible unless must cut way through enemy can not be done since there be horse for men will never abandon gallant regiment since colonel hamilton have resolved to surrender be impossible for to hold out longer though must thousand time rather die with arm in hand than submit to mercy of duke of cumberland several plan be then proposed be rejected a none seemed feasible at last muster be made of regiment colonel townley resolution being communicated to men be received by with greatest sorrow later on in day colonel townley repaired to citadel where have conference with governor endeavoured to induce to change purpose in vain on following morning besieged town of carlisle presented singular spectacle inhabitant who have hitherto be kept in awe by garrison assembled in street did not attempt to hide exultation while highlander in castle officer men of
