reference have already be made deep dyke supplied by severn strengthened defence on east south east suburb constituted danger since habitation must afford shelter to enemy thus will be seen that city

country can be other than lord general cromwell desire to rule dighton must have country well governed wisely one must govern so wisely so well a excellency of be assured thou flatterest said cromwell not displeased be idle talk decisive battle have yet to be fought upon a already won rejoined dighton a lord instructed joshua how to take ai so will instruct greater general than joshua how to take rebellious city that great work will be perfected nothing doubt said cromwell have seen enough of yon burning house will tarry here no longer must visit outpost in case sally must be made though judging from appearance think aught will be attempted to night then made way through wood closely followed by dighton ere many minute reached sheltered spot where escort awaited mounting charger next

berkeley rejoined cromwell surprised excellency have said rejoined other be that unfortunate man have declared a much from first must have be set at liberty observed lord general be not so sure of replied sir robert think word must have be taken be that a may cared not to answer question rudely put to by soldier mistake not make complaint of ill treatment such explanation a have to offer excellency give readily habitation having be burnt down stable occupied have place of refuge except summer house where sought shelter for night there be found a hath just be stated have only to thank for detention sir robert rejoined cromwell though nephew sir rowland berkeley of cotheridge be avowed malignant be known a active partisan of charles stuart will not discredit what tell be free furthermore be free to speak of have seen heard will be conducted to nearest outpost if desire will be taken to white lady aston will rather sleep beneath tree than under mr symonds roof replied old

in comparison with host drank only single glass of wine cromwell however partook with right good appetite of plain fare set before emptied large flagon of sack while thus employed scarcely spoke word afforded guest excellent opportunity of studying remarkable countenance with cromwell coarse feature disfigured by large ill formed red nose against cavalier never ceased to direct scurril jest with stout ungainly figure utterly devoid of dignity grace reader must be familiar yet with drawback have not be in slightest degree exaggerated lord general physiognomy be very striking chiefly so on account of determined formidable expression eye possessed extraordinary power few must brook glance when be angered when suspicion be aroused habitual expression be that of bluff sternness looked like surly bull dog whom one who valued whole skin must care to offend yet must put off morose repelling look when pleased exchange for one of rough good humour even when unbent inspired fear character have be too much darkened by writer virtue have be ascribed to by others certainly did not posse courageous crafty ambitious hypocritical almost fatalist cruel unjust unrestrained by moral principle by sole force of indomitable will overcame obstacle reached goal at aimed ambition being boundless nothing le than sovereign power must satisfy though affected to disdain title of king being perfectly aware that royalist must never accept regicide a king of marvellous sagacity penetration be rarely deceived in judgment of men always used where must a instrument in furthering design profound dissembler fully capable of using religion a mask have be needful to do so can scarcely be doubted that be really religious though few entirely believed in sincerity of religious profession cromwell character be full of striking contrast abhorred by enemy have multitude of devoted friend for time memory be execrated in latter day somewhat more than justice have be done great crime committed have never be pardoned will never be pardoned stain of blood can not be washed out a to high military genius be agreed among great commander stand foremost must rank among greatest of men if crime did not overshadow virtue accoutrement of lord general differed very little from of officer of own body guard except that be somewhat more ornamented being filigrained with gold consisted of open casque very large gorget have breast plate cuisse stout buff coat with long skirt wore affording sufficient protection to lower part of person scarf be tied round waist strong buff boot be drawn far up thigh from broad embroidered shoulder belt hung large basket hilted sword be not unconscious that be object of guest covert scrutiny circumstance did not trouble perhaps rather gratified may be that designed to win over old royalist judge at least to produce favourable impression upon for a soon a have finished supper almost compelled sir robert to take more wine then began very friendly discourse with professing great regret spetchley manor house have be destroyed by scottish soldier expressing hope that might soon be rebuilt conversation however be interrupted by entrance of dighton who informed lord general that man be without who stated that have matter of utmost importance to communicate to excellency what manner of man be demanded cromwell have reason to believe be spy from city replied dighton delivered up to vedettes on red hill conjuring to bring speedily before excellency accordingly hath be sent on from first outpost be bearer of letter affirms be from colonel james somewhile commandant of garrison of worcester cromwell took missive after glancing at content said man hath spoken truly business be important will see with excellency permission will retire said old judge rising be sorry to lose company said cromwell be matter can not be postponed bed must be found for sir robert berkeley added to dighton know not where to find one unless worship be content to sleep on straw be half grumbling response if be allowed to occupy old summer house will be perfectly satisfied replied judge be so sir robert said cromwell wish sounder repose than be likely to enjoy to morrow news may surprise old judge did not venture to question bowing deeply departed with dighton cromwell be left for few moment alone what say colonel james muttered 'the bearer of may be trusted hath preserved life with heaven grace may be happy mean of preserving life in comparison with mine be a naught ' import of message be life to be preserved be mine own 'cursed be man trusteth in man ' saith prophet yet in whom can trust if not in who serve if there be plot against be better for who hath hatched that have never be born step be now heard on staircase next moment tall thin man whose aspect be that of puritan while habiliment be of cavalier be ushered into presence of lord general by dighton behind came couple of musketeer guard advanced further than head of step cromwell fixed long searching glance upon personage thus introduced who bore scrutiny firmly apparently satisfied lord general signed to dighton to withdraw bidding however wait outside now fellow thy name demanded cromwell of man a soon a be alone urso give of worcester by trade tailor be reply honest trade have naught to say against rejoined lord general men must be clothed though be better be clothed in sackcloth than in purple fine linen better still be clothed in garment of salvation enough hath thy trade aught to do with what thou hast to declare to nothing mentioned for reason will presently explain to excellency have come hither at hazard of life to bring timely intelligence of daring well conceived design if be successfully executed must snatch from victory give to charles stuart what be to claim a reward if will prove what assert go to bargain not with thy reward will be proportioned to importance of thy disclosure may not live to receive rejoined urso risk run be great when depart hence must return to rabbah may fall into hand of ammonite who will show little mercy what then becomes of recompense promised hast thou wife yea verily replied urso fair young wife whom have just espoused if perish in effort to save israel will have reward content thyself will promise to thee rejoined cromwell thou hast great faith in constancy of woman perceive be well can not with truth affirm have great faith in constancy of whom have wedded replied urso love better than life trust will honour thy memory a deserves to be honoured remarked cromwell in slightly contemptuous tone having made thy condition beforehand let hear what thou hast to tell be brief 't be not wont to waste word rejoined urso first let inquire hour hour thou shouldst know a well a 't be past eleven then in le than two hour time general middleton will sally forth from sidbury gate with fifteen hundred picked men well mounted well armed wearing shirt above breastplate for distinction malignant general have vowed to take excellency dead alive thus end war will make effort to fulfil vow expecting to find colonel lilburn wholly unprepared will pas through camp without attacking cut way through other opposing force further on aim being spetchley where hope to find excellency must arrive quarter be to be given thou art sure of remarked cromwell with forced calmness heard project discussed settled very morning at commandery between charles stuart duke of hamilton general middleton others a have said middleton have vowed to accomplish excellency destruction to perish in attempt engaged in camisade be to sally forth hour after midnight thou sayst observed cromwell calmly be hour appointed must have given excellency earlier warning have be able to quit city must not obtain order only succeeded in getting out during burning of suburb thou hast arrived in time design can be easily frustrated thy intelligence merit good reward thou shalt not be disappointed of if aught befalls thee thy wife will have reward moreover promise thee ample vengeance cromwell who did not seem at disturbed by alarming intelligence have received maintained most perfect composure put several question to give then said suppose doubt truth of thy statement can not allow thee to return to worcester till affair be over danger to will be far greater if return not before daybreak pleaded give why shouldst thou return like doting fool thou canst not suppose leave thy young wife then called out for dighton who instantly answered summons said to man will remain here till return until send order for release sit down at table friend added to give eat drink make glad thine heart thou wilt see thy wife again ere long while thus speaking have donned casque gauntlet then quitted chamber proceeded to stable yard where found colonel lindsey commander of life guard telling be about to proceed to colonel lilburn camp bade follow with three hundred men whole regiment must remain under arm throughout night added attack may be expected without word more mounted charger be ready for attended by dighton small party of musketeer rode at brisk pace through wood to colonel lilburn camp chapter xix camisade good watch be kept sentinel be at post quietude of camp proved that apprehension of attack be entertained kerioth must have be surprised taken have not received warning mentally ejaculated cromwell a rode up to commander tent lilburn have thrown on couch hearing cromwell approach sprang to foot met at entrance of tent after brief consultation between general be decided that drum must be beaten trumpet blown lest sound must be heard by enemy that slumbering soldier must be quietly roused to arm be done by lilburn in person meanwhile colonel lindsey have arrived with life guard from spetchley putting at head cromwell rode to outpost nearest city outpost be about three hundred yard from camp on slope of hill not far from london road be stationed in field bordered on north north east by high banked hedge night can scarcely be described a dark though sky be covered with lazily moving cloud through moon burst occasionally old city with tower steeple fortification must be distinguished through gloom light be visible within sound from arose so profound be stillness that might have be supposed that inhabitant defender be alike buried in slumber that attacking party must be waiting to sally forth a cromwell with life guard cautiously descended hill keeping under cover of hedge three quarter past midnight be struck by cathedral clock proclaiming that hour be close at hand outpost reached by cromwell be guarded by two hundred fifty foot two hundred horse three hundred of best trooper in army being now added deemed force quite sufficient to repel attack little time be left luckily on guard at outpost be on alert having placed troop with quickness skill peculiar to lord general stationed on small woody mound in centre of field whence commanded approach to sidbury gate awaited sortie with impatience without slightest anxiety close behind be dighton couple of cuirassier have not to wait long while single stroke of cathedral bell yet vibrated through air be echoed by clock of other church gate yawned wide troop of sheeted spectre for such seemed in gloom issued ghostly band formed three regiment first being commanded by general middleton second by sir william keith third by colonel legge troop came forth from sidbury gate formed in silence if order be given did not reach cromwell ear though be listening intently ghostly appearance of horseman be fully preserved until middleton dashed off with greatest rapidity when clatter of hoof jingling of arm proved that phantom be substantial soldier second regiment followed instantly galloping along london road a swiftly a first momentary interval occurred before colonel legge started cause of brief delay be perfectly intelligible to cromwell gave order to dighton who rode off at once to colonel lindsey meanwhile two foremost regiment came on at full speed dashed past field in outpost be stationed making evident that point of attack be lilburn camp on brow of hill showing that outpost must be dealt with by regiment followed in obedience to cromwell order not shot have be fired colonel legge came on uncertain a to how must be received by enemy easy access to field must be obtained at several point known to royalist small party of men entered at place main body led by colonel legge broke through hedge skirting london road be received by rank of pikemen three deep front rank kneeling centre stooping rear standing upright forming almost impassable barrier on flank right left be posted musketeer who poured terrible volley upon enemy a gained field several saddle be emptied nevertheless colonel legge shouting to men to follow charged pikemen with greatest intrepidity be impossible to cut through rank many horse be killed in charge others so desperately hurt that bore back rider in spite of effort to force on colonel legge charger though badly hurt have still strength enough left to sustain rider must not again face deadly pike caught a in trap seemed a if unfortunate royalist must be slaughtered turning from pikemen colonel legge charged musketeer with fury proved irresistible having gained open field with such of men a have be able to follow be joined by others who having entered at different point have hitherto taken part in conflict before must form be charged by colonel lindsey at head of life guard so shattered that must not recover fled from field in greatest disorder hurrying towards sidbury gate faster than have quitted many be shot while jumping hedge pressing through gate colonel legge be last to retreat horse carried out of reach of foe then dropped cromwell watched conflict from mound on have taken stand did not quit position during short time occupied by conflict be lord god fighteth for be that hath enabled to scatter thus quickly exclaimed a royalist fled in disorder pursue not prepare to cut off retreat of pestilent malignants who have gone on to attack camp above lest peradventure escape snare laid for happened a cromwell have foreseen instead of finding lilburn unprepared when general middleton sir william keith reached camp on hill quickly discovered that design have be betrayed duped by stratagem ought to have suspected entered camp have scarcely done so when be completely surrounded by force more than trebling own thus entrapped must seem that nothing be left to middleton to surrender brave general be undismayed by number when summoned to surrender answered by charge so fierce impetuous that rank of enemy opened ere must close again two regiment have passed safely through down hill dashed at headlong pace though hotly pursued by lilburn very few of be captured luckily for fugitive cromwell be not able to get life guard out of field in time to intercept utter destruction must have be inevitable a be escaped with very little loss considering terrible hazard have encountered on reaching nearest outpost of royal army middleton found colonel legge learnt disaster have befallen can not carry bad news to majesty said legge tell have happened king will not reproach said middleton have done best have be betrayed be certain said sir william keith lilburn be prepared for cromwell be with outpost when attacked said colonel legge knew not till too late must have known cried middleton furiously must not have lived to boast of triumph one of spy have served well on occasion will not rest till have discovered traitor lesley may help to find said legge lesley knew nothing of rejoined middleton come with to king get over word will explain have be betrayed illustration old hostelry of

detach party of men to support pitscottie when highland soldier arrived in breathless haste bringing intelligence that leader have be routed by enemy charles must scarcely credit news on ascertaining full extent of disaster felt necessity of immediately returning to city preparing against attack on south might now be expected therefore rode back with attendant crossed river at palace ferry at once proceeded to sidbury gate where found duke of hamilton from watch posted on summit of cathedral tower duke have already heard of pitscottie defeat construction of flying bridge across teme did not for moment attempt to disguise perilous position in majesty must be placed if montgomery must be worsted at powick coincided with king in opinion that general attack must not be delayed advised that visit must first be paid to lesley whom have not a yet seen that morning acting upon counsel charles attended by earl of derby lord wilmot careless small escort rode to blockhouse field where lesley be stationed with scottish horse found with whole of large force under arm apparently ready for action must not help noticing that lesley looked exceedingly grave not altogether free from uneasiness be man really traitor be generally thought mentally ejaculated charles will try colonel lesley cried a rode up be resolved to take yon battery on perry wood bid men prepare for attack will lead in person on receiving command lesley immediately drew near king said in low voice beseech not to call upon to make attack sire will not follow not follow exclaimed charles fiercely lesley be traitor have already told sire replied lesley in same low voice that men be not to be relied on will not fight with cavalier what will do then demanded charles sternly will utterly desert in hour of need will deliver to enemy sire if in obedience to command order to attack yon battery not one of will stir just then roar of artillery be heard battery have opened fire on fort royal be immediately answered a have already described by royalist engineer din be heightened by smaller ordnance of blockhouse now began to operate though with little effect against cromwell intrenchment can hear stand tamely by observed charles reproachfully to lesley can not help liege be scottish leader answer men be mutinous will not obey look at now will be convinced that speak truth entreat compel to put disloyalty to proof charles cast eye along line nearest sullen discontented aspect of men fully confirmed lesley assertion earl of derby have likewise taken rapid survey of regiment came to like conclusion mutinous spirit evidently prevails among men said to king may break out at once if attempt be made to force into action leave lesley to manage can do if will 't be confounded kirk committee have be at work with cried charles added in low significant tone to scottish leader will gain nothing by deserting much very much by standing firmly by at critical juncture liege said lesley earnestly if be in jeopardy will bring aid can not promise more obliged to be content with charles rode off with attendant escort regardless of enemy fire be now extending along height increasing in fury proceeded to visit various outpost very little impression be produced upon fort royal by heavy cannonade directed against from perry wood be immediate attempt made by enemy to storm lilburn lord grey of groby gradually drew closer to royalist outpost seemed to be awaiting lord general signal for grand attack such in reality be case from apparent inertness of enemy be erroneously supposed by royalist that most of parliamentary troop have be drawn to other side of severn cromwell however have motive for did if delayed attack be because deemed right moment for making have not arrived never be more cheerful than appeared to be throughout trying day confident of victory yet kept watchful look out upon enemy seemed surprised that attack expected king to make upon must be so long delayed for attack come when might be fully prepared a evening began to draw on movement be made by royal force grew impatient time will scarcely be allowed for work said to officer with yet will not move till have full assurance that fleetwood ingoldsby be master of st john ready to enter city at moment messenger rode up bringing intelligence so eagerly desired montgomery be utterly routed keith prisoner dalyell have surrendered fleetwood ingoldsby be preparing to cross bridge enter city lambert be marching towards bridge of boat must soon bring regiment to perry wood such be sum of despatch messenger have to

day twelvemonth at dunbar word be 'the lord of host so let be to day signal then be 'we have white about ' same signal will serve now make known throughout regiment then prepare for action while issuing order cromwell have noticed movement at sidbury gate now fixing field glass upon spot perceived that main body of royal army horse foot be coming forth from gate evidently for purpose of attacking be at loss to discover that host be commanded by king in person that charles be attended by several of most distinguished noble indeed from closer survey felt certain that duke of hamilton buckingham be with be splendid sight to see gallant host issue forth from gate familiar a be with such spectacle cromwell watched for minute with great interest noting strength of regiment making many shrewd observation to own officer charles stuart hath come forth in bravery said host will be utterly discomfited up smite spare none of malignants a to prince take not captive slay without pity many

retreated before be still in confusion disorder while hamilton derby animated by king success be driving before moreover most important result have be obtained by capture of gun fort royal have suffered considerably from ceaseless cannonade of battery be now left unmolested at critical juncture when fate hung in balance when scottish horse might have helped to victory charles looked anxiously down to spot where lesley be posted be still there with troop remained although leader must have be aware of king success must have felt how important aid must be at moment doe move be coming cried charles sire rejoined legge straining eye in direction of scottish cavalry doe not stir curse on for traitor oh montrose be alive in place ejaculated charles bitterly must not have served thus sire observed careless montrose must have secured victory may be that battle of worcester be lost by charles owing to lesley inaction treachery if king extraordinary success must have be at once followed up victory might have ensued who will say chapter xxix how battle of worcester be lost by king cromwell be somewhat disconcerted by unlooked for advantage gained by charles quickly brought disordered troop to rank prepared to bring forward reserve like charles looked down to blockhouse field to see what lesley must do be speedily reassured by finding scottish horse remain motionless men

at period of history valley be left in wild natural state have air of seclusion gave charm almost a great a possessed by present ornamental lake high bank on side be clothed with magnificent timber many tree grew so near pool a to overshadow charles first beheld exquisite scene from elevation commanding whole length of valley numerous sheet of water fringed by tree glittering in moonlight produced truly magical effect filled with rapture halted for short time to gaze at while eye wandered over pool immediately beneath fancied descried boat stealing along under shadow of tree on further side of pool pointed out object to trusty dick who be standing beside majesty be right said dick 't be fishing boat belonging to pool know well having often used there be only one person in now that person unless be very much mistaken be other than page jasper how saybet thou william added appealing to elder brother be of same opinion replied william believe to be jasper oddsfish be strange exclaimed king give signal that be here upon trusty dick descended bank approaching margin of pool gave loud whistle signal did not require to be repeated in moment boat be seen to cross pool now that

descended back staircase approached kitchen one be there trooper have only just left for heard ride out of court yard on table be remains of repast majesty will not wonder that picked up fragment must find when consider have eaten nothing since left boscobel in morning fear made very scanty meal said charles compassionately indeed liege got quite enough having satisfied appetite quitted house at back very soon gained park being totally unacquainted with place knew not way to shape course be afraid of losing have heard father huddlestone say that majesty escort must be sure to pas through part of park so determined to look out for when left chillington house be almost dark moon have now risen revealed beauty of scene wandered on insensibly till came to valley when further progress be checked by pool must have turned back have not discovered boat moored to bank immediately availed of mode of crossing have only just got into boat begun to use oar when heard sound on opposite bank that convinced person be there hoped might be majesty attendant not feeling quite sure thought best to keep in shade lest might be caught in trap majesty know rest have only to beg pardon for long tedious narration have have adventure enough to day to last life laughed charles must not stop here longer get up behind horse be somewhat rough be strong enough to carry double have carried honest humphrey mistress jane lane so think will be able to carry replied jasper assisted by trusty dick sprang up behind king robin broad back afforded very comfortable seat page held on securely by king

of park that be not without regret that charles quitted park being inclosed by high pale have to make for gate nearest place of exit being on codsall side proceeded in direction soon issued forth on

charm of own viewed indeed on moonlight night like when harsher feature be subdued beauty heightened heath presented very lovely picture night however be much too bright fine for king escort who must

enemy start up from furze bush chapter v by what device king escaped being captured by colonel ashenhurst if king escort formed very striking picture while involved in forest little band looked infinitely more picturesque a wended way across heath have begun to dismiss fear when on sudden greatest consternation be caused by appearance of detachment of trooper advancing towards detachment seemed to consist of about dozen men with officer at head be about mile off have hitherto be concealed from view by inequality of ground be now in full sight became clear from accelerated pace of enemy that be perceived what be to be done retreat be out of question for be certain to be pursued captured must prove valour in defence of king at anxious moment ready witted page called out fighting
