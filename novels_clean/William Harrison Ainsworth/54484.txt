refused to subscribe to doctrine of church grieve to hear replied pole yet trust will not be severely dealt with will be dealt with a deservethey will be burnt at stake rejoined gardiner not without time allowed for reflection trust lord said cardinal undue severity will injure cause rather than serve men will be accounted martyr held up a example to others policy therefore must dictate milder measure mild measure have be tried have proved ineffectual rejoined gardiner must now make terrible example of obstinate dangerous heretic again usher entered time to inform cardinal that majesty have

church in eminence differ in opinion in most matter must readily defer to eminence better judgment can not do so in instance be glad majesty have come a feel certain will support view whence arises difference of opinion demanded mary must have thought lordship cardinal must infallibly agree on point touching welfare of church question between gracious madam said pole be whether on score of humanity policy must not be better to deal leniently rather than severely with who profess heretical opinion allude particularly to minister of reformed church who have just be excommunicated degraded delivered over to secular power who unless mercy be shown will suffer dreadful death mary brow darkened surely eminence must not pardon if persist in heresy cried must not put to death rejoined pole must endeavour to convince of error by argument instruction failing in must resort to such measure a might be deemed best adapted to meet exigency of casebut measure must be tempered with mercy did not expect such opinion a from eminence observed mary enemy of faith must be destroyed will destroy single diseased sheep will taint whole flock if have unsound limb surgeon will tell that for safety of body must be cut off preservation therefore of catholic church requires that tare amidst corn be rooted up cast into fire false brother be seditious a well a heretical said philip sternly rebel against queen enemy to church mercy ought to be shown eminence perceives majesty be of opinion said gardiner to cardinal have not church deep wrong to avenge have not suffered stripe persecution from heretic when be in power have not be deprived of revenue imprisoned within tower with sentence of death hanging over head for year until happily released by majesty at least life be spared observed pole be spared more from fear than favour retorted gardiner have king edward lived year nay few month longer must not have be here now to protest against leniency towards such bitter enemy one of latest act of cranmer be to frame sanguinary code against professor of ancient faith have be put in force must have be fraught with fearful consequence ere that code became law king edward died weapon sharpened for destruction fell from maker hand to strike off own head cried philip fiercely eminence must scarcely extend clemency to arch offender added to cardinal must pardon if recanted replied pole what pardon cranmer apostate heretic exclaimed gardiner pardon who betrayed enslaved church of ought to have be protectorwho manifested most abject compliance with will of royal master flattering passion humouring caprice pardon who shamefully promoted pronounced divorce between king majesty royal mother casting thereby blemish on daughter must pardon whose life have be one of dissimulation who professed practised what in secret heart disbelieved abhorred must pardon reformer who subscribed terrible six article though be directed chiefly against own sect who must have subscribed other article enjoined by royal masterwho on king edward accession declared in favour of principle of zuinglius calvinwho abolished ancient worshipattacked article of churchdenied traditionsstigmatised ritesbrought over foreign sectary however anti christian tenet a martin bucer paul fagius peter martyr ochinus others procured church recommended to royal favourand who filled up measure of guilt by supporting treasonable project of northumberland helping to place usurper on throne preaching against rightful claim of sovereign mistress must spare hypocrite apostate heretic double dyed traitor crime be many indefensible must leave punishment to heaven rejoined pole must forgive injury have done except divorce pronounced against sainted mother said mary cheek flushing eye kindling a spoke in pronouncing unjust sentence uttered own condemnation fate be sealed why have punishment so richly merit be so long delayed demanded philip offence sire be of so heinous nature responded gardiner so fraught with injury to holy religion in most vital part that have be necessary to refer to supreme tribunal before such inquest can only properly be held case have be laid before pope who have appointed bishop of gloucester commission to try on report judgment will be pronounced in solemn consistory by holiness what judgment will be can not for moment be doubted cranmer will be excommunicated anathematised deprived of archbishopric of canterbury of ecclesiastical privilege furthermore will be degraded delivered to secular power majesty will be required by holiness to proceed towards a law directs for offence law prescribes death by fire by death will die said mary ala that must be so muttered pole when will true spirit of gospel inculcates toleration charity forgiveness of injury be understood principle practised must make last appeal to majesty in behalf of unfortunate added to queen before replying mary consulted king by look stern expression of countenance confirmed be in vain replied heart be steeled against illustration chapter v bishop bonner shortly afterwards bishop of london be announced by usher brief preliminary description of remarkable prelate

height stout of fresh complexion have rather jovial countenance being fond of good cheer feature except when inflamed by passion a not unfrequently be have pleasant expression be exceedingly hot tempered when excited lost control of became perfectly furious did anger though easily roused quickly subside in respect resembled royal master henry viii disposition be cruel vindictive never forgot forgave injury to reformer whom bitterly hated proved a be well known terrible scourge born towards close of th century bonner be now near upon sixty though have undergone many hardship have endured more than four year imprisonment in marshalsea spirit be unbroken health unimpaired during long captivity have be supported by conviction that ancient worship must be restored enemy be delivered into hand what have hoped for prayed for having come to pas promised ample compensation for affliction have endured learned acute bonner have early attracted attention of wolsey by whom be much employed being subsequently appointed chaplain to henry viii rose rapidly in favour a accommodated without scruple to king caprice instrumental in furthering divorce with katherine of aragon bonner co operated in religious change accomplished by royal master be also entrusted by with several mission of great delicacy fulfilled very satisfactorily rendering altogether so useful continuing so subservient that though often rebuffed by monarchas who be nothe never entirely lost good grace when edward vi mounted throne be changed opposed to reformation though did not dare openly to manifest hostility to bonner be regarded with suspicion dislike by chief of protestant party who determined upon overthrow cited before ecclesiastical commission of cranmer be head notwithstanding energetic defence appeal to king against illegality of tribunal injustice of sentence bonner at time bishop of london be deprived of see benefice imprisoned in marshalsea whence be only liberated on mary accession restored to diocese reinstated in power burned to avenge on enemy chief amongst whom reckoned cranmer ridley latimer now that be safe in prison be content to wait cup of vengeance be too sweet to be hastily drained bonners appearance at juncture be hailed with satisfaction by gardiner who must count upon support against pole therefore remarked after bishop have made obeisance to majesty associate in ecclesiastical commission concurs with that mercy must be shown to heretic mercy to heretic exclaimed bonner surprised be mistaken clemency to spare such dangerous offender rigorous measure will alone check spread of pestilence by kingdom be unhappily affected gracious madam added to queen now be time to strike terror into heart of false brethrento exterminate by fire sword lord cardinal doe not think so rejoined mary be of opinion that convicted of heretical pravity must be leniently dealt with amaze madam cried bonner object majesty have in view said pole being to bring back who have strayed from path of truth not to drive yet further off gentleness not force must be employed by severity will increase evil instead of curing fear will make hypocrite not convert matter cried bonner let sacramentarians conform outwardly care not to search heart enough for if profess catholic grieve to hear say so lord rejoined cardinal be better to have open enemy than false friend church doe not desire to encourage dissimulation put to eradicate error schism beseech majesty to pause before proceed further in course foresee be fraught with danger hitherto have gone well enemy be confounded people be loving loyal willing to make sacrifice for save of conscience faith of forefather be restored in integrity kingdom be reconciled to holy see be opportune moment for persecution must sully snowy banner of church with blood must destroy tithe of subject by fire swordby burning massacre yet must be done if persecution once commences such mean of conversion be a unwarrantable a impoliticcontrary to will of heaven likely to provoke wrath defy advocate of severity towards heretic to produce single passage from gospel must authorise christian to burn fellow men for question purely of conscience a therefore such rigour can not be sustained by appeal to holy writ can be upheld by other consideration will increase evil complained of rather than mitigate eminence forgets how much have suffered from reformer remarked bonner if have done ill ought to imitate in ill doing rejoined pole let prove to that be better christian than be majesty may trust that true way to convert protestant be to reform own clergy whose ill regulated conduct have led to heresy backsliding better remedy than stake will to pope observed gardiner in low tone to bonner eminence will be speedily recalled be high time must be recalled if entertains opinion rejoined other in same tone nothing have be urged will shake purpose said mary will free kingdom from curse have so long afflicted even
