nonjuror who treated to sermon have preached to lord dundee before battle of killiecrankie be thought that fiery sermon be given in deference to wish of brigadier mackintosh must almost seem so since

english general attack at kelso barricade town cross tweed meet lord derwentwater be decidedly of opinion that latter course must be adopted maintained that force being double that of carpenter result of engagement must not be doubtful although government general possessed three regiment of experienced dragoon advice though approved by general forster english officer be opposed by earl of wintoun a scotsman said lordship be best able to serve king cause in own country be therefore most reluctant to cross border be not so added appealing to compatriot of whom assented except mackintosh have earl of mar order to advance remarked general forster how can disobey earl of mar be not aware of exact position replied lord wintoun order must be countermanded at present communication with be difficult if enter england will be entirely cut off may be opened be plan of operation must recommend falling back to north west attacking dumfries glasgow on way will be able to join western clan combining

earl of derwentwater why not attack carpenter when can do so with advantage from report just received be greatly inferior in number troop be exhausted prestige of victory must be of immense service to cause care to cross tweed again objected lord wintoun if wo cross tweed lord general carpenter will rejoined lord derwentwater contemptuously will gain little by movement retorted lord wintoun will find kelso evacuated will not dare follow be sort of fighting be to expect cried lord derwentwater be always to retreat on appearance of foe northumbrians did not come to scotland to join western clan to meet brave ally brigadier mackintosh who be pledged to march with to london claim fulfilment of promise a to general carpenter if ally wo help will attack alone do not express sentiment general added to forster opinion decidedly be that carpenter ought to be met by whole confederate force said forster own division be not strong enough to encounter must incur certain defeat again say scot will not cross tweed remarked lord wintoun if english ally choose to sacrifice may grieve can not help restraining with difficulty earl of derwentwater turned to mackintosh who have not hitherto spoken said do mean to desert brigadier lord be reply then let lowlander join western clan if will said earl can do without lord wintoun placed hand upon sword other lowland leader must have fiercely

certainty of good pay make quite easy on score said lord derwentwater will provide money when men learn lordship generous promise said mackintosh doubt not will be very grateful 't be small subsidy to king said lord derwentwater must give whole property to set on throne truly lordship set good example ought to follow said lord kenmure now for jedburgh about hour later much to relief of inhabitant

marching order did general will seek couch fully hour before daybreak reveille be sounded be scarcely light when vanguard commanded by lord forrester marched out of wigan after short interval advanced guard be followed by preston regiment of foot known a old cameronians must boast of finest men in service then followed after pause three brigade of cavalry men horse being in excellent condition regiment looked remarkably well general will rode with brigadier honeywood at head of first brigade after long train of baggage waggon came militia numbering six hundred horse foot commanded by sir henry hoghton like regular soldier militia men looked exceedingly well be loudly cheered by inhabitant most of whom though hour be so early have assembled to witness march forth of troop spectacle be rendered infinitely more impressive by circumstance that men be about to fight battle result however of impending contest seemed scarcely doubtful general opinion be that rebellion must be effectually crushed confident in leader animated by officer who promised easy victory over insurgent with plunder of rich town of preston king soldier be in excellent spirit did anything occur in march to disquiet morning being fine road in tolerably good order infantry got on very well be very little fatigued on reaching chorley during halt at chorley word be brought to general will by scout that bridge over ribble be defended by colonel john farquharson of invercauld with hundred picked men belonging to colonel mackintosh battalion general forster have come forth to reconnoitre have be seen with party of horse about two mile south of bridge on wigan road intelligence did not seem to necessitate alteration in general will plan ordered lord forrester captain preston to halt at walton le dale till must come up after short halt march be resumed on arriving at walton le dale general learnt colonel farquharson have be strengthened by three hundred men sent to support by earl of derwentwater under impression that bridge must be stoutly defended will prepared to attack with honeywood brigade what be surprise on arriving at spot to find passage entirely unoccupied what have become of colonel farquharson highlander where be lord derwentwater three hundred men not one of be to be seen though there be nothing to impede progress will hesitated for few minute suspecting stratagem might be intended then rode boldly across bridge be followed by whole force with exception of militia remained on south bank of river took up position assigned after crossing bridge will again halted before entering deep lane led to town thinking hedge might be lined caused to be examined skirmisher must be discovered unable otherwise to account for such strange neglect of precaution came to conclusion that rebel must have abandoned town commenced retreat to scotland must prove to be case must be great disappointment to a well a to soldiery since must deprive of victory men of plunder expected to obtain however alarm be quickly dispelled prisoner have be taken be brought before man have refused to answer sergeant who first interrogated a will threatened to have shot became more compliant where be rebel demanded general in town replied man sullenly be general forster there continued will suppose so said prisoner lord derwentwater maybe replied man have not seen take care how answer fellow cried will sternly be quite sure brigadier mackintosh have not set out for scotland quite sure replied man saw not hour ago helping to make barricade barricade exclaimed will glancing at brigadier honeywood now be coming to where be barricade formed added to prisoner in churchgate replied man be that only barrier there be three others entrance to town be barricaded then rebel mean to defend said will to last need expect to surrender if will cut to piece said will sternly go back to town tell so wo deliver such message must cost life matter cried will obey recollect what have said not one of rebel will escape unless leader surrender at discretion now begone man be then set free driven towards town did not re enter general will then quitted lane be shut in a have said by high hedge led troop to field on left commanded full view of town how peaceful beautiful looked even stem will who be about to deliver up to fire sword felt certain regret at thought of destroying so pleasant place very few evidence of preparation on part of insurgent be visible barrier intrenchment being in interior of town few soldier must be descried at outskirt guard be placed at extremity of avenue will quite understood what meant judged correctly that house on side of street must be filled with troop ready to pour murderous fire upon assailant a entered town aware that cavalry must not act within town will gave order two regiment of dragoon must dismount when attack be made in order to support foot first business however be to dispose men so a to prevent rebel from sallying forth cut off retreat in case must make attempt done ordered two attack to be made simultaneously upon town one by brigadier honeywood from wigan road on south other by brigadier dormer munden from lancaster road on north direction be thus conveyed to honeywood will have with preston regiment of foot to be commanded by lord forrester likewise two hundred fifty dismounted dragoon commanded by five captain be to support preston foot will sustain whole with regiment order will be obeyed general replied honeywood will then gave similar direction to brigadier dormer munden telling must have under joint command three hundred dismounted dragoon for attack on lancaster avenue must be sustained by two mounted regiment then addressing brigadier added obtain possession of end of town a speedily a may be set fire to house in order to dislodge rebel who doubt occupy next make lodgment for own men so a to prevent sallying forth of rebel upon check escape of enemy will be done general said brigadier dormer before commencing hostility however will send summons of surrender to general forster said will think will comply with scarcely be word spoken than several shot be fired from farm yard near town by orderly near general be killed officer wounded soh cried will fiercely there will now be summons to surrender let attack commence forthwith brigadier dormer munden with regiment under command then rode off to north side of town to attack lancaster avenue while lord forrester led preston foot towards upper end of wigan avenue followed by dismounted dragoon sustained by brigadier honeywood regiment shortly afterwards sharp firing announced that attack have commenced on side of town end of book seventh book eighth defence illustration barricade rudely awakened from slumber at far earlier hour than usually allowed to be disturbed by intelligence that will be marching to attack with whole force scarcely able even then to credit unwelcome news with aching head general forster attired in haste ordering small troop of horse to attend rode forth to reconnoitre on reaching ribble bridge found party of highlander placed there be informed by colonel farquharson who commanded that king army be certainly approaching still doubting general rode on for few mile further when descried vanguard of enemy quickly turned back in interval highlander have left bridge place being taken by three hundred of lord derwentwater men under command of captain shaftoe angry that change must have be made without sanction forster ordered shaftoe to abandon bridge return to town order be very reluctantly obeyed captain shaftoe must fain have proceeded to penwortham to dislodge parson wood be not allowed immediately on return to town general forster summoned council of war be attended by english scottish leader be quite alive to danger of position evidently have very little reliance on judgment skill of commander under circumstance advice of brigadier mackintosh be urgently requested by lord derwent water others have greater military experience than of brigadier said earl what plan do suggest will follow out plan if offer said brigadier will replied earl if waste time in discussion enemy will be upon aweel then said mackintosh will be useless to defend bridge since river be fordable in many place do think must be safe to risk battle outside town because highlander have not yet learned to face cavalry nothing frightens so much a charge of horse for reason must have battle take place within town where cavalry of enemy force chiefly consists will be least serviceable where highlander will fight well barricade intrenchment can be thrown up in different part of street so a to impede advance of enemy destructive fire can be poured upon from roof window of house approved of plan except forster be overruled how many barricade will require where do propose to erect said lord widdring ton four will suffice replied brigadier in fact have time to form more first will be placed little below church a be likely to be chief object of attack will take command of why not make at extreme end of street so a to prevent entrance of enemy said forster there be so many lane avenue thereabouts must require more men than posse to defend post replied brigadier second barrier will be best placed in opinion at back of house now occupied by lord derwentwater must have commanded by lord charles murray accept post replied gallant young nobleman third barrier must be in fishergate pursued brigadier must be well served by lord strathmore men under command of captain douglas be glad have named to post of danger brigadier said captain douglas will do best to maintain last battery must be near windmill in lancaster avenue said brigadier will confide to kinsman colonel mackintosh men will take replied colonel keep a long a can now let set to work at once said brigadier have minute to lose thereupon went forth person to whom construction command of barricade have be committed called men together proceeded to appointed spot such extraordinary exertion be made so many hand employed that in incredibly short space of time intrenchment be thrown up strong barrier formed earl of derwentwater charles radclyffe assisted in person in formation of churchgate barrier stripping off coat worked like pioneer be greatly encouraged by presence of countess dorothy forster a soon a churchgate barrier be completed two of ship gun brought from lancaster be placed upon entrusted to management of tom syddall of men while defensive preparation be going on house in church street fishergate be filled with highlander dismounted trooper ready to fire upon enemy from window roof cellar in two street be best house of town here brigadier mackintosh anticipated that chief attack must be made church a already mentioned be surrounded by extensive churchyard here a most available place for purpose strong force be collected on north side of edifice be posted low lander northumbrian gentleman latter being now dismounted under command of colonel ox burgh colonel brereton who have lately joined a volunteer on south side be planted borderer likewise dismounted under command of captain douglas hunter in small street adjoining sir henry hoghton house small barrier have be formed by captain wogan regiment reserve be posted in market place here be kept horse of dismounted trooper while barrier be being formed general forster attended by small party of men rode from point to point to give direction be not always obeyed having finished survey entered town hall where great number of lady have taken refuge among whom be mr scarisbrick assured have nothing to fear enemy will never be able to penetrate centre of town said fighting will take place at barricade will soon force to retreat be glad to find be so confident said mr scarisbrick for own part confess feel very uneasy though doubt bravery of troop preparation be so well made that be quite unassailable said forster barrier will never be passed lady derwentwater sister entertain so little apprehension of result of attack that mean to quit sir henry hoghton house will station on roof to witness attack on battery begin to think must like to see commencement of attack remarked mr scarisbrick must be very curious sight since say there be danger say so interrupted forster on contrary there be very great danger stay where be be quite safe here will go cried curiosity be aroused will take to sir henry hoghton house ask cried wo do lady however being determined be obliged to comply ordering trooper to follow with horse conducted to church street be now full of soldier left at entrance to sir henry hoghton house must not allow to go further saying must easily find way to roof ii what countess dorothy beheld from summit of mansion position in town except perhaps tower of church commanded so good view of proceeding a be obtained from summit of lofty mansion part of roof be flat protected by balustrade be here that countess dorothy forster be stationed have come there after witnessing completion of barricade at earl have assisted contemplated scene with extraordinary interest from spot must clearly distinguish movement of enemy saw general will issue from wigan lane with infantry cavalry draw up in field to survey town must not help contrasting appearance of king soldier with of own undisciplined troop after time saw two brigade of horse dragoon move off towards other side of town though troop soon disappeared object of movement be clear attack be about to be made on lancaster avenue must be doubted that simultaneous attack must be made on south by force left behind conviction sent thrill of terror through breast of two looker on be reassured when perceived that street be now very strongly guarded that trench be completed cannon mounted on barricade that not only be troop thickly planted at barrier roof window of house be occupied by highlander other soldier that churchyard be almost opposite be full of troop showing that if enemy be ready to make attack friend be prepared for gallant defence be looking towards broadway at back of garden must descry barricade commanded by lord charles murray saw that be guarded by large party of highlander while advanced guard of northumbrian gentleman commanded by captain wogan must likewise be seen posted at end of narrow street at left in word approach so far a discernible seemed well protected access to market place from church street be blocked up by cavalry must entertain doubt that preparation on other side of town be equally efficient felt sure that lancaster avenue must be well guarded by colonel mackintosh clan chattan spectacle thus presented to gaze dispelled misgiving filled with ardour at juncture lord derwentwater appeared on roof attended by father norham newbiggin must quit place immediately said attack be about to commence father norham newbiggin will take to town hall where will be safe will see nothing at town hall said countess think be in least danger here can not remain said earl lower part of house be occupied by captain innes with party of highlander when attack commences of will come to roof let stay till then entreated dorothy must see commencement of attack will not stir from post at present said countess will never forgive if disaster occurs said earl ought not to have consented to remaining here so long why did not yield to entreaty have set out yesterday must now be far on road to dilston must blame more than countess lord said dorothy besought to stay yielded to request commit further error said father norham quit dangerous position immediately repair to town hall a suggested by lordship must really go said countess with appealing look to earl do let stay for few minute longer well consent replied only on condition that depart when father norham deems prudent to do so commit to care father be sure will watch over son replied priest newbiggin need not give command to said earl will attend to lady miss forster with life replied butler scarcely have earl taken departure than mr scarisbrick made appearance on roof took up station by other lady be just in time said after greeting have passed between general forster say there be danger here hope not replied dorothy will not remain here long meantime earl of derwentwater have proceeded to adjacent barrier taken up position with brigadier mackintosh who have likewise be joined by lord kenmure earl of wintoun nithsdale iii commencement of assault strange portentous quietude now prevailed like awful hush preceding storm insurgent troop be in position in momentary expectation of attack barricade be manned house occupied with soldier a have mentioned churchyard filled with troop not sound proceeded from vast collection of men never before have preston beheld such sight except in market place business be suspended throughout town here house be open mitre bull be thronged terrified to death at thought of approaching conflict almost resident in church street fishergate have quitted house repaired to centre of town be same thing in friargate in many house in lancaster avenue thus in fear trembling did inhabitant of preston await commencement of assault at length murmur arose from stationed on roof of house everywhere be heard word come then countess dorothy with hundred of others who be gazing eagerly towards wigan avenue beheld body of red coated foot soldier issue from lane march towards street be preston foot captain preston be with on occasion regiment be commanded by lord forrester who rode at head men looked very well presented very gallant appearance be supported by two hundred fifty dragoon selected from five different regiment party being commanded by captain whole being commanded by major bland major lawson then came two regiment of dragoon under command of brigadier honeywood casting rapid glance along street lord forrester instantly saw how matter stood ordered men to attack barricade presented very formidable appearance with cannon mounted upon troop collected behind assailant have not advanced far when such terrible fire be poured upon from barricade from roof window of house that halted by deadly discharge nearly fifty men be killed severely wounded loud shout arose from defender of barricade stifled groan of wounded fire of defender be instantly returned by assailant with comparatively little effect urged on by lord forrester captain preston assailant marched on be checked by second discharge quite a terrible a first while cannon being well directed by tom syddall men did great execution thus much did countess dorothy see beheld more spectacle of street filled with dying dead be too much for covered eye to shut out dreadful sight will take hence said father norham yes yes cried countess casting one look at barricade seeing that earl be safe instantly quitted roof with priest newbiggin other lady followed party did not venture into street made way through garden at back of house a be speeding along discharge of musketry took place accompanied by roar of cannon at same time distant firing be heard on north side of town showing that attack have likewise begun in quarter sergeant despatched by captain innes made way for through crowded street to market place sooner have reached town hall than countess dorothy withdrew to private room with priest spent time in earnest devotion iv altercation between forster mackintosh finding impossible to force men to attack barricade in face of incessant fire lord forrester did not attempt further advance for present retiring to end of street where be sustained by dismounted dragoon honeywood regiment directed captain preston to lead party of men through narrow passage have observed to back of street if possible get possession of sir henry hoghton house captain preston at once obeyed order on reaching thoroughfare called broadway at back of house found advance checked by small barrier commanded by captain wogan however unhesitatingly attacked be repulsed while heading second assault be struck down by shot must have instantly be cut to piece if captain wogan at hazard of own life have not dashed to assistance saved from sword raised against having succeeded in bringing off wounded foe generous wogan consigned to care of surgeon aid be unavailing preston than whom there be not better braver officer in king service be dead hitherto general forster have taken part in defence during cessation of firing rode up to churchgate battery called out to mackintosh in loud authoritative tone brigadier sally out at once with highlander upon enemy na na general replied mackintosh be to part foot from horse might be cut off see why must be rejoined forster if be of foot sally out with horse can not obey general replied brigadier for reason in sallying out a suggest cavalry have to pas through fire of ain foot to great detriment if failed in attempt must be unable to retreat thus highlander must be pent up in town see reason cried forster angrily perceive be resolved not to obey wo sacrifice men general rejoined brigadier then will take consequence sir said forster for by heaven if survive day king come to own will have tried by court martial mackintosh shrugged shoulder contemptuously just then firing recommenced forester withdrew to vent anger elsewhere learning that mackintosh have stationed captain innes with party of highlander in sir henry houghton house immediately removed without alleging reason for step ordered captain maclean with company of gentleman volunteer to take post v how two large house in church street be taken by assailant during forster altercation with brigadier lord derwentwater proceeded to churchyard have now no fear respecting countess dorothy for knew have reached town hall in safety scarcely have entered churchyard when perceived captain gordon calling said be very man want go instantly to top of church tower let know movement of enemy captain gordon obeyed a soon a reached exalted position looked carefully around have already mentioned that tower in question be singularly low from position commanded entire view of operation from post of observation captain gordon must see brigadier honeywood with regiment of dragoon stationed at end of street did not concern with attention being particularly attracted to movement of major bland with large party of dismounted dragoon attacking battery commanded by lord charles murray lord charles be defending vigorously successfully when party be seen approaching to attack in flank thereupon captain gordon gave signal to earl of derwentwater who immediately put at head of hundred of gentleman hastened to lord charles assistance suddenly appearing in back lane flanking enemy with close fire earl quickly put to confusion flight while retreating dragoon burst open door at back of sir henry hoghton garden drove out captain maclean volunteer placed there by general forster took possession of mansion almost at same time large house belonging to mr eyre on opposite side of street have served a general forster head quarter fell into hand of brigadier honeywood on observing captain gordon immediately descended from church tower sought out general forster whom found near entrance to marketplace told what have happened by possession of two house general said enemy have secured most commanding position will not only afford shelter from fire enable to do great damage must be retaken at cost must recommend a shortest way that house be demolished by cannon can not consent to destruction sir replied forster body of town be security of army must dislodge enemy not destroy house do not perceive general that by course be affording security to besieger said captain gordon reinforcement be sure to arrive then will never be able to drive out enemy at event attempt will be made before have recourse to cannon rejoined forster let house be attacked in front rear mind cannon must not be used scarcely able to control anger captain gordon went away on return found that vigorous attempt be being made by lord derwentwater to dislodge enemy from sir henry hoghton house sharp conflict be then going on in garden attempt be likewise being made to recover mr eyre house by large party of dismounted trooper headed by charles radclyffe captain shaftoe brigadier mackintosh must have quickly knocked down house on learning that general forster have positively prohibited use of cannon desisted vi house burnt by assailant with exception of loss sustained by capture of two important house have be entirely caused by forster gross mismanagement insurgent have not only held own obtained decided advantage over enemy not one of three battery on south side of town though have be repeatedly vigorously attacked have be taken on contrary in instance assailant have be repulsed with great loss neither by stratagem direct assault have portion of king force be able to penetrate into town damage have done be at outskirt church constituted most important position on south be entirely in hand of insurgent so trifling have be loss sustained by that have not be necessary a yet to call upon reserve stationed in market place of course brunt of fight have be borne by brigadier mackintosh who have planned able defence of town have stood a firm a rock beside barrier have reared most courageous defence of fishergate barrier be made by captain douglas captain hunter moss trooper borderer individual act of valour be performed by hardy fellow worthy of age not content with firing upon assailant from roof window occasionally sallied forth then most desperate encounter took place between colonel pitt dismounted dragoon captain douglas who be very powerful man killed three dragoon with own hand in sally captain hunter dozen men with advanced too far being completely surrounded must have be captured slain have not be rescued at great personal risk by captain douglas barn small habitation at end of fishergate avenue occupied by moss trooper be set fire to burnt by pitt men real damage be done at same time several much larger house be set on fire at end of church street by order of brigadier honeywood so a to drive out highlander who occupied compel to take refuge in churchyard fortunately wind being in north at time conflagration did not spread far have blown from opposite quarter wind be strong whole town must probably have be destroyed effort being made to extinguish fire house continued burning for several hour long after became dark vii windmill barricade must now repair to windmill barricade situated at end of lancaster road commanded by colonel mackintosh kinsman of brigadier brigadier dormer with three hundred dismounted dragoon attempted to approach barricade by narrow street lane called back wynd be thwarted in design by vigilant highlander who screened by garden wall hedge ditch killed nearly number forced rest to retreat direct attack be then made on barricade with better success mackintosh proved splendid marksman after third ineffectual attack by back road during again sustained considerable loss brigadier dormer ordered sergeant johnstone corporal marlow with score of stanhope dragoon to set on fife house out building while seeing order executed brigadier dormer be shot in leg sergeant corporal be killed of men wounded work of destruction proceeded house cottage be burnt close up to barricade nothing be gained valiant highland chief clansman laughed at futile attempt to drive from post having thus taken survey of defence of town will be seen that be intact able to hold out besieger be under impression that insurgent must attempt to cut way out during night accordingly lancaster avenue be very strongly guarded express have be sent by sir henry hoghton to general carpenter who have reached clitheroe to inform that hostility have commenced be therefore certain must arrive next day must news reach rebel must quicken desire to escape behoved besieger to be doubly vigilant especially on north side of town where exit be most likely to be made several hundred of king troop a have stated have be shot down in ineffectual attack on barrier among wounded be major bland major lawson a have just mentioned brigadier dormer be slightly hurt captain preston expired a be being conveyed to white bull where wounded insurgent be taken at place died colonel brereton mr clifton two three others

glass said come lad here be to master health can fight no longer wish success with mingled feeling be health drunk ala gallant officer died under operation be unskilfully performed viii how two large house be illuminated until grew dark platoon firing constantly took place from two large house captured by besieger when night came on firing of course ceased though even then occasional shot be heard at barrier men rested on arm strictest watch being kept to prevent surprise churchyard be still filled with troop strange terrible light be afforded by still burning house a fire be not confined to one quarter must be seen at different point appeared a if whole town be burning red reflection of fire in adjacent street on tower window of church produced very striking effect after awhile brigadier honeywood caused window of two large mansion just mentioned to be brilliantly lighted up illumination revealed person in street exposed to musketeer soon found told against for marksman be quickly discovered driven from position while window be broken by shower of bullet in evening council of war be held at mitre nothing be determined upon except that vigilant watch must be kept throughout night determined defence maintained on morrow general forster took very little part in discussion complained bitterly that brigadier mackintosh have disobeyed order suppose be through fault general that two large house in church street be lost remarked brigadier undoubtedly replied forster well then will repair fault said mackintosh for a be living man will demolish baith burn to ground to morrow in defiance of order cried forster in defiance of anybody order rejoined mackintosh let have dispute pray interposed lord widdrington have reason to be satisfied with result of day so confident be of success said mackintosh be about to write to earl of mar expect to gain victory over general will to morrow battle be imminent between lordship duke of argyle may possibly take place to morrow if so success must attend arm at stirling preston jacobite cause must be triumphant heaven grant may cried several voice after little further discourse council broke up proceeding to adjoining room where supper be laid out others returning to post only three person be left in room be lord derwentwater general forster captain douglas earl have told others that wished to confer with trust will go well to morrow said indeed doubt still feel greatest anxiety respecting countess wonder at lord remarked forster be just a anxious about sister must must get safely out of town fear be impossible to

fully prepared said douglas with forster joined others at supper in next room while lord derwentwater proceeded to town hall when be informed of arrangement made for flight countess dorothy seemed dissatisfied rather than pleased earl be quite resolved upon departure there be telling what morrow may bring forth said if fortune must prove adverse must bitterly reproach for allowing to remain go must arrangement having be made dorothy retired earl countess be left alone together for minute remained silent earl then spoke hope may meet again at dilston a in former day said have great misgiving tomorrow will decide will then either be victorious utterly defeated prisoner for be shut up in town in latter event well know what fate will be confess can not shake off dread presentiment that will

gained to day a might must have be have not be thwarted by forster must have be well now must trust to chance will not say that forster have betrayed have be excessively indiscreet in confiding secret to mr scarisbrick then think mr scarisbrick have given secret intelligence to enemy be almost sure of replied earl let not trouble parting with gloomy anticipation then endeavoured to talk cheerfully effort be in vain be almost relief to of when father norham entered have just heard from dorothy of proposed flight came to inquire further about have lordship instruction to give said none replied earl know will ever watch over countess during absence if aught happens console will teach how to bear affliction replied priest perchance may be last interview added looking steadily at countess have

then be rival prince replied prince exclaimed with sudden burst of rage since be capable of perfidy renounce throw off allegiance will break sword have borne for hear lord cried clinging to away exclaimed casting from how fondly have loved well know now be hateful to never let behold more hold lord interposed father norham in tone of authority earl must not resist there must be misunderstanding between countess by counsel have made confession to because secret have long weighed upon heart because may never meet again in world listen to lord love conceived by countess for
