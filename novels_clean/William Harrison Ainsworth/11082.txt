leonard holt placed foot against buttress impelled towards one of tall pointed window lighting interior of tower though reached point at aimed sway of rope dragged back before must obtain secure grasp of stone shaft after ineffectual effort fearful of exhausting strength abandoned attempt began to climb up rope with hand knee aided by inequality of roughened wall soon gained range of small saxon arch ornamenting tower immediately beneath belfry succeeded in planting right foot on moulding of one of instantly steadied with little further effort clambered through open window first act on reaching belfry be to drop on knee return thanks to heaven for deliverance then looked about for outlet though winding staircase existed in of four angle of tower door to infinite disappointment be fastened on other side be still therefore prisoner determined however not to yield to despair continued search finding small door opening upon staircase communicating with summit of tower unfastened for bolt be on own side hurried up step passing through door bolted like first within side issued upon roof be now on highest part of cathedral from hope than ever so agonizing be feeling that almost felt tempted to fling headlong downwards beneath lay body of mighty fabric vast roof crocketed pinnacle buttress battlement scarcely discernible through gloom looking like monstrous engine devised to

notwithstanding anxiety soon dropped asleep did not awake for several hour on opening eye be just getting light shaking again prepared for action event of night rushed upon mind thought with unutterable anguish of amabel situation glancing round room occurred to that might give alarm by ringing enormous bell near though set slightly in motion must not agitate immense clapper sufficiently to produce sound resolved however to free at hazard once more repaired to summit of tower leaning over balustrade gazed below be sublime spectacle in spite of distress filled with admiration astonishment have stationed on south side of tower immediately beneath lay broad roof of transept stretching out to distance of nearly two hundred foot on right surrounded by double row of cloister

have tall pointed window filled with stained glass be richly adorned with trefoil cinquefoil further on on same side be small low church dedicated to saint gregory overtopped by south western tower of mightier parent fane be not however cathedral magnificent view commanded that chiefly attracted apprentice attention from elevated point on stood eye ranged over vast tract of country bounded by surrey hill at last settled upon river in part be obscured by light haze in others tinged with ruddy beam of newly risen sun surface be spotted even at early hour with craft while innumerable vessel of shape size be moored to bank on left noted tall house covering london bridge on right traced sweeping course of stream a flowed from westminster on hand on opposite bank lay flat marsh of lambeth while nearer stood old bull baiting bear baiting establishment flag above must be discerned above top of surrounding habitation little to left be borough of southwark even then large populous district two most prominent feature in scene being winchester house saint saviour old beautiful church filled with wonder at what saw leonard looked towards east here extraordinary prospect met gaze whole of

collection of building be girded in by grey mouldering wall approached by seven gate intersected by innumerable narrow street spire tower of church shot up into clear morning air for except in few quarter smoke yet issued from chimney on side view of city be terminated by fortification keep of tower little did apprentice think when looked at magnificent scene before marvelled at countless building beheld that ere fifteen month have elapsed whole mass together with mighty fabric on stood must be swept away by tremendous conflagration unable to foresee direful event lamenting only that so fair city must be prey to exterminating pestilence turned towards north suffered gaze to wander over finsbury field hilly ground beyond over smithfield clerkenwell beautiful open country adjoining gray inn lane so smiling beautiful did district appear that must scarcely fancy be chief haunt of horrible distemper must not blind to fact that in finsbury field a well a in open country to north of

finer view than can be gained from dome of modern cathedral at sunrise on may morning when prospect be not dimmed by smoke of hundred thousand chimney when river be just beginning to stir with numerous craft when be sleeping on glistening bosom when individual house court church square theatre can be discerned when eye can range over whole city on side calculate vast extent seems scarcely possible say to suppose at previous time must be more striking yet at period under consideration be incomparably more so then house be picturesque street collection of picturesque object then that be objectionable in contributed to insalubrity of city namely extreme narrowness of street overhanging story of house be main source of beauty then huge projecting sign with fantastical iron work conduit cross where cross remained maypole be picturesque a superior to what can now be seen a attire of charles second age be to ugly disfiguring costume of own day satiated with glorious prospect leonard began to recur to own situation carefully scrutinizing available point on side of tower thought possible to effect descent by clambering down gradation of one of buttress still a experiment must be attended with utmost danger while even if reached roof must yet be far from object resolved to defer for short time in hope that ere long seine of bell ringer other person connected with cathedral might come thither set free while thus communing with heard door open below hurrying down stair at sound beheld to great surprise joy piper daughter nizza macascree have searched for everywhere cried

companion departed leaving leonard alone continued there few moment longer be about to follow when prolonged piercing cry smote ear looking in direction of sound perceived figure running with great swiftness towards pit a pursuer appeared leonard must scarcely doubt that be one of distracted person have heard of who in frenzy produced by intolerable anguish of sore must often rush to plague pit

to take back in couple of hour let remain where be there be scarcely night that crazy being doe not destroy in same way never concern about such person except to strip of apparel unfeeling wretch cried leonard unable to restrain indignation give fork will pull out instead of surrendering implement chowles flourished over head with intention of striking apprentice latter nimbly avoided blow snatching from grasp ran back to plague pit be followed by chowles burier who threatened with loud oath regardless of menace leonard fixed hook in dress of struggling man exerting strength drew out of abyss have just lodged in safety on brink when chowles companion came up keep off cried leonard brandishing fork a spoke will commit robbery murder here if will assist unfortunate gentleman have doubt

folded upon breast gaze fixed upon house leonard watched with intense curiosity have great difficulty in controlling though earl be armed while have only staff must have easily mastered by assailing unawares leonard generous nature revolted at unworthy suggestion resolved if attacked at to give time to stand upon guard moment reflection however satisfied that wisest course must be to remain concealed be now in possession of earl plan with help of doctor hodges must easily defeat whereas if appeared must be evident that have overheard what have passed other scheme to must not be privy must be necessarily adopted influenced by consideration suffered earl to depart unmolested when have got to distance followed rochester companion be waiting for in cheapside joining three proceeded towards cathedral entered great northern door leonard who be now well acquainted with approach passed through door at north side of choir to have be directed on former occasion by solomon eagle found party guided by old verger only one of former keeper who still lingered about place preparing to descend to saint faith leonard followed a near a must without exposing on gaining subterranean church easily contrived to screen behind ponderous rank of pillar by time have reached door of charnel be closed rochester knocked against chowles presently appeared seemed greatly surprised at seeing earl be latter le astonished when learnt that parravicin be within vault desired to be shown to friend chowles ushered into crypt leonard must have followed a etherege others declined entering charnel

be with difficulty kept aloof from uninfected by attendant very earnest touching address be next pronounced by archbishop calling upon hearer to look upon a already dead to world to regard present visitation a just punishment of sin to rejoice suffering must be so soon terminated when if sincerely heartily repented must at once be transported from depth of wretchedness misery to region of unfading bliss concluded by stating that around be prepared to devote without regard to own safety to preservation of fellow citizen that must leave nothing undone to stop ravage of devouring scourge chanced that leonard holt be present on occasion a listened to eloquent discourse of archbishop gazed at group around equally zealous in good cause equally regardless of must not indulge hope that exertion might be crowned with success be indeed touching sight to see melancholy congregation to whom address be delivered many nay most of whom be on verge of dissolution leonard holt be so moved by almost apostolic fervour of prelate for thought of amabel might have followed example of several of auditor devoted altogether to service of sick discourse concluded archbishop most of companion quitted cathedral hodges however three of physician remained behind to superintend necessary preparation shortly after large number of pallet be brought in ranged along nave aisle at short distance
