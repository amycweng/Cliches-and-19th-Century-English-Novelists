jailer now prisoner hear what be said be prepared to obey be about to lay hand rudely upon sir jocelyn when latter pushing aside ran nimbly up step seizing sir giles by throat dragged downward notwithstanding resistance of extortioner whose effort at liberation be seconded by grimbald young knight succeeded in forcing enemy into dungeon hurled to further end of during struggle sir jocelyn have managed to posse of other sword now pointed at breast have constituted jailer cried by soul of who perished in loathsome cell by instrumentality will send instantly to account for crime on high unless promise to assign different chamber promise replied sir giles will have best in fleet let go forth will choose one for will not trust false villain cried sir jocelyn give order to deputy warden if pledge word will be obeyed will take otherwise die bid master tunstall come to grimbald gasped extortioner be here sir giles be here replied deputy warden cautiously entering cell what must have do free from restraint cried sir giles struggling to regain foot sir jocelyn shortened sword in order to give mortal thrust purpose be prevented by grimbald with heavy bunch of key jailer struck young knight upon head stretched insensible upon ground chapter xxvi secret friend when sir jocelyn again became conscious found have be transported to different cell in comparison with stone coffin be clean comfortable wall be of stone pallet on be laid be of straw place be dry free from noisome effluvium pervading lower dungeon consideration shown originated in conviction on part of deputy warden that young man must die if left in wounded state in unwholesome vault so removal took place in spite of objection raised to by sir giles mompesson who must have willingly let perish master tunstall dreaded inquiry a prisoner have not yet be sentenced by council after glancing round cell endeavouring recal event have conducted to sir jocelyn tried to raise found limb so stiff that must not accomplish object sank back with groan at moment door opened grimbald accompanied by repulsive looking personage with face like grinning mask advanced towards pallet be wounded man master luke hatton said jailer will exert best skill to cure must use dispatch in case must be summoned before council council must come to if desire to interrogate now replied luke hatton adding after have examined injury received by young knight be badly hurt not so severely a expected will undertake to set upon leg in three day did a much for sir giles mompesson be wounded in same manner why be young knight who struck down sir giles at joust said grimbald strange must have two mortal enemy to deal with be sir jocelyn mounchensey inquired luke hatton with apparent curiosity did not tell so before perhaps ought not to have told so now returned other do take interest in not much replied apothecary have heard name often mentioned of late need not be uneasy about young man being summoned before star chamber great case of countess of exeter against lady lake come on before king lord of council to morrow next day will occupy attention will have time for aught else what think will be judgment in case inquired grimbald have own opinion returned apothecary with significant smile care not to reveal be witness in case something may depend on evidence asked just now whether took interest in young man will tell what surprised to find here sir francis mitchell have taken into head to rob of intended bride ah indeed exclaimed jailer with laugh old dotard doe not mean to marry by troth doe wedding be to be grand one will tell more about anon at moment sir jocelyn who have hitherto remained with eye closed uttered cry of anguish again vainly endeavoured to raise aveline married to sir francis cried said be to be forced into union with hoary miscreant must be prevented see not how can be sir jocelyn replied luke hatton since be in power of sir giles mompesson besides 'hoary miscreant a style will take mean to ensure acquiescence mean what mean demanded sir jocelyn writhing in agony love potion replied luke hatton calmly be about to prepare philter for will answer for effect will be old knight without opposition infernal villain must be lying here unable to give aid overcome by intensity of emotion a well a by acute bodily suffering sir jocelyn relapsed into insensibility be not however suffered to remain long in state stimulant applied by luke hatton soon restored to consciousness first object gaze fell upon be apothecary be about to vent fury upon in word when latter cautiously raising finger to lip said in whisper be friend grimbald be only at door single exclamation on part will betray then leaned down bringing lip almost close to young knight ear whispered what said before jailer be correct have be applied to by sir francis for philter to be administered to mistress aveline have promised to be secretly in service of clement lanyere will defeat old usurer villainous design sir jocelyn must not repress cry of delight grimbald entered cell chapter xxvii showing how judgment be given by king james in star chamber in great cause of countess of exeter against sir thomas lady lake five day have king james whole of privy council be sitting within star chamber great cause have occupied during whole of time be drawing to end little remaining for majesty to do in except to pronounce sentence cause to james councillor have lent hearing so long patient be other than of countess of exeter against sir thomas lake lady throughout whether prompted not a to course pursued monarch displayed great sagacity penetration prior to trial when preliminary statement have alone be laid before determined personally to investigate matter without acquainting one with design while out hunting rode over to earl of exeter residence at wimbledon place will be recollected where forged confession be alleged to have be signed by countess proceeded to examine particular chamber indicated by lady lake sarah swarton a scene of transaction be accompanied by buckingham other lord high in favour on examination be found that chamber be of such size lower part of where sarah be reported to have be concealed be so distant from large bay window that conversation held there must have be inaudible to a be proved upon experiment by king attendant crowning circumstance be discovery made by james for courtier be too discreet to claim share in that hanging did not reach within two foot of floor consequently must not have screened secret witness from view while be further ascertained that arras have be entirely undisturbed for several year on making discovery james rubbed hand with great glee exclaimed aha lady lake handmaiden may forswear if choose will not convince oath can not confound sight asseveration repeated during trial at proffered own testimony in favour of plaintiff indeed be evident from first however much might seek to disguise that be strongly biassed towards countess not content however with discovery have made at wimbledon james have secretly despatched serjeant at arm to rome where lord roos have taken up residence after leaving england obtained from from confidential servant diego statement incriminating lady lake denouncing confession a wicked forgery luke hatton moreover who have gone over a already intimated to side of countess who took care to hide own complicity in dark affair to give very different colour to conduct from what really belonged to luke hatton say became most important witness against lake be said to be owing to crafty insinuation that king conceived idea of visiting wimbledon a before mentioned notwithstanding there be many irreconcileable contradiction notoriously bad character of lord roos cruel treatment of wife passionate devotion to countess led many to suspect that after lady exeter be guilty party be represented moreover by such a have knowledge of man luke hatton be not esteemed credible witness be generally thought that testimony ought not to be received by king accepted only with greatest caution opinion favourable to lady lake husband underwent entire change in early part of trial when to surprise of to inexpressible dismay of parent lady roos who have be included in process by countess made confession wherein admitted that document produced by mother against lady exeter be fabricated that circumstance said to be connected with at time of supposed signature be groundless imaginary unfortunate lady motive for making revelation be desire of screening husband so infatuated be by love of that allowed to be persuaded by artful suggestion be whispered of luke hatton that must be mean of accomplishing reconciliation that must be rewarded for devotion by returning regard if such be belief be doomed to disappointment never beheld again lord roos died abroad soon after trial took place did ill fated lady long survive thus will be seen circumstance be adverse to lake in spite of difficulty surrounding weight of evidence true false brought against concession must be obtained from lady lake stoutly protested innocence retaliated in most forcible term upon accuser gave flat contradiction to daughter poured terrible malediction on head ceasing not until silenced by command of king fearful charge brought by ladyship against luke hatton produced effect be listened to a must only be substantiated by sarah swarton fell to ground since here again lady roos refused to be witness against husband unwilling to admit wife criminality though urged by king to do so in order to save sir thomas lake be unable to make successful defence seemed so much bowed down by affliction perplexity that sympathy be generally felt for indeed dignified deportment reserve gave claim to consideration in way be trial brought to close after three day duration now let glance be cast round room wherein lord of council be deliberating upon judgment be star chamber situated on south eastern side of westminster hall near river famous room wherein secret council of kingdom be then held have be held during many previous reign be more remarkable for beauty of ceiling than for size splendour that ceiling be of oak richly carved gilt disposed in square in midst of be rose portculises pomegranate fleurs de lys over door leading to chamber be placed star in allusion to name with date wall be covered with ancient tapestry have many window looking towards river filled with painted glass though must appear to be obvious enough much doubt have be entertained a to derivation of name of celebrated court think so called writes author of learned treatise on jurisdiction before cited of crimen stellionatus because handleth such thing case a be strange unusual of stallen confess be in point platonist in opinion that nomina natura fiunt potius quam vaga impositone so doubt not camera stellata for so find called in ancient year book be most aptly named not because star chamber where court be kept be so adorned with star gilded a must have for surely chamber be so adorned because be seal of court et denominatio being praestantiori magi dignum trahit ad se minus be so fitly called because star have light what be cast upon from sun by reflection being representative body a majesty be pleased to say when sat there in royal person representation must need cease when person be present so in presence of great majesty be sun of honour glory shining of star be put out not having power to pronounce sentence in court for judgment be king only by way of advice deliver opinion wisdom alloweth disalloweth increaseth moderateth at royal pleasure explanation seems rather given for purpose of paying fulsome compliment to james in whose reign treatise in question be written be scarcely satisfactory have little doubt that name originated in circumstance of roof of chamber being embellished with gilded star be told in strype stowe that star chamber be so called by derivation from old english word steoran signifieth to steer rule a doth pilot of ship because king council did sit here a be at stern did govern in ship of commonwealth derive in from stellio signifies that starry subtle beast so called from cometh word stellionatus signifieth cosenage because crime be chiefly punishable in court by extraordinary power a be in civil law because roof of court be garnished with gilded star a room be starry full of window light in respect of latin record name camera stellata french chambre de etoiles english starred chamber derivation of name repeat seems to sufficiently simple obvious a have be matter of controversy have thought worth while to advert to circumstance to proceed in chair of state elevated above table round lord of council be gathered having canopy over sat king calmly watching a pursued deliberation own mind being completely made up a to sentence must pronounce ever anon stealing glance at lady lake husband who be seated behind bar crossed room below council table defendant prisoner for such in effect be be under guard of pursuivant serjeant at arm little behind be sarah swarton though faint frightened scarcely

against lady lake spirit be still undiminished eyed council imperiously husband regard be fixed upon ground head rested upon breast after further time have be needlessly consumed by council in stating opinion to king prepared to deliver judgment on defendant arose profound silence reigned throughout court a james addressed sentence be to effect fine of upwards of l be imposed upon sir thomas with further censure of imprisonment in tower during king pleasure lady lake be to be imprisoned with public recognition of offence for reparation of countess injured honour be to be made by in most ample manner majesty must devise sarah swarton be adjudged to fleet thence ran sentence to be whipped at cart tail to westminster afterwards from same place to cheapside at cheapside to be branded with fa signifying false accusation one letter on cheek to do public penance in saint martin church to be detained in fleet till do weary of then to be sent to bridewell there to spend end day when poor handmaiden heard severe sentence uttered cry of despair fell down on floor in swoon thereupon delinquent be removed a lady lake withdrew look passed between countess in spite of assurance of latter made turn pale tremble in very remarkable letter subsequently addressed by lady lake to successful opponent in great case said wish submission must make innocent woman wash a white a swan must be own submission unto god many prayer tear affliction seeing have not outwardly examine heart think on time past remember what have written to heretofore same do now again for yet nothing doubt that although lord roos be sent away be dead yet truth life truth however be never fully brought to light that justice vindictive lady expected be denied chapter xxviii two warrant at conclusion of trial james be observed to smile buckingham who have drawn near chair of state ventured to inquire what be that entertained majesty fancy have be tickled by curious conceit answered king discern singular similitude between case hae just heard transgression of first parent how so majesty asked favourite a thus replied james sir thomas lake may be likened to gude father adam wha fell into sin frae listening to beguilement of eve mither eve being represented by dochter lady roos ye will own that there can not be closer resemblance to wily auld serpent than find in lady lake excellent cried buckingham joining in royal laughter before majesty quits seat must entreat to perform know delight in act of justice act of justice ye must say lord returned james in tone of slight rebuke seeing hae just delivered maist memorable judgment in case have cost five day of incessant labour anxious consideration what be ye require at hand in whose behalf be to exercise prerogative in of sir jocelyn mounchensey gracious liege replied buckingham who have be committed to fleet for contempt of high honourable court can only be released by majesty warrant a be present on occasion when intemperate expression laid to charge be used can affirm that be goaded on by enemy to utter that in calmer moment must have regretted rashness ye will have warrant lord said james with smile doe ye meikle credit to have made request punishment sir jocelyn have already endured be amply sufficient for offence hae nae fear of being repeated single visit to fleet be eneuch for man in respect to sir jocelyn be happy to say that excellency conde de gondomar have quite set right in gude opinion have satisfactorily proved to that spy suspected to be be person wha will be nameless have here come count exclaimed a spanish ambassador approached excellency will be glad to hear after handsome manner have spoken of that be intention to restore sir jocelyn to favour previously enjoyed lord of buckingham be to have warrant for release from fleet will trust to see soon at court a heretofore while majesty be in gracious mood said de gondomar bending lowly suffer to prefer request respecting person of very inferior consequence to sir jocelyn one in whom nevertheless take interest who be likewise prisoner in fleet ye require warrant for liberation ah count majesty have said replied de gondomar again bending lowly what be nature of offence demanded king trifling outrage upon returned ambassador mere nothing majesty ah know whom mean refer to rascally apprentice dick taverner cried james call ye attack upon trifling outrage mere nothing count call riot almost rebellion to assault ambassador whatever may be be content to overlook said de gondomar in knave have received provocation aweel since excellency be disposed to view in light rejoined james since ye display such generosity towards enemy far be from to oppose wish order for 'prentice release will be made out at same time a sir jocelyn lord of buckingham will give order to effect to clerk of court will attach sign manual to warrant now have ye not done continued observing that buckingham still lingered have ye mair request to prefer have request to make on part of prince liege replied marquis highness perceive be about to speak to a said prince charles who have occupied seat among council drew near stepping upon elevation on chair of
