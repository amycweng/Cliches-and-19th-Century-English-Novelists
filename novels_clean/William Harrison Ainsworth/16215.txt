only natural to presume that man who owes nothing must be in condition to pay liberally can not therefore feel loss of such trifle a ten guinea however illogical inconclusive argument might appear to mr wood however might dissent from latter proposition did not deem expedient to make reply orator proceeded with harangue amid general applause of assemblage be perhaps exceeding authority in demanding so slight sum continued jonathan modestly master of mint may not be disposed to let off so lightly will be here in moment so will then learn determination in mean time let advise a friend
