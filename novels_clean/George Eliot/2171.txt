most beautiful to behold very best eating such a lord mayor must always order largely for private recreation so that when father declared must be put to trade david chose line without moment hesitation with rashness inspired by sweet tooth wedded irrevocably to confectionery soon however tooth lost relish fell into blank indifference while mind expanded ambition took new shape must hardly be satisfied within sphere youthful ardour have chosen what be to do be young man of much mental activity above gifted with spirit of contrivance then faculty must not tell with great effect in other medium than of candied sugar conserve pastry say what will about identity of reasoning process in branch of thought about advantage of coming to subject with fresh mind adjustment of butter to flour of heat to pastry be not best preparation for office of prime minister besides in present imperfectly organized state of society there be social barrier david must invent delightful thing in way of

right to expect having general idea of america a country where population be chiefly black appeared to most propitious destination for emigrant who to begin with have broad easily recognizable merit of whiteness idea gradually took such strong possession of satan seized opportunity of suggesting to that might emigrate under easier circumstance if supplied with little money from master till that evil spirit whose understanding be convinced have be much overrated quite wasted time on occasion david must certainly have liked well to have of master money in pocket if have be sure master must have be only man to suffer for be cautious youth quite determined to run risk on own account so stayed out apprenticeship committed act of dishonesty be at likely to be discovered reserving plan of emigration for future opportunity circumstance under carried out be in wise having be at home week two partaking of family bean have used leisure in ascertaining fact be of considerable importance to namely that mother have small sum in guinea painfully saved from maiden perquisite kept in corner of drawer where baby linen have reposed for last twenty yearsever since son david have taken to foot with slight promise of bow leg have not be altogether unfulfilled mr faux senior have told son very frankly that must not look to being set up in business by with seven son one of very healthy well developed idiot who consumed dumpling about eight inch in diameter day be pretty well if got hundred apiece at death under circumstance what be david to do be certainly hard that must take mother money saw other ready mean of getting be not to be expected that young man of merit must put up with inconvenience must be avoided besides be not robbery to take property belonging to mother doesnt prosecute david be very well behaved to mother comforted by speaking highly of to assuring that never fell into vice saw practised by other youth of own age that be particularly fond of honesty if mother must have given twenty guinea a reward of noble disposition really must not have stolen from must have be more agreeable to feeling nevertheless to active mind like david ingenuity be not without pleasure be rather interesting occupation to become stealthily acquainted with ward of mother simple key not in least like chubbs patent to get one must do work equally well also to arrange little drama by must escape suspicion run risk of forfeiting prospective hundred at father death must be convenient in improbable case of not making large fortune in indie first spoke freely of intention to start shortly for liverpool take ship for america resolution cost good mother pain for after jacob idiot there be not one of son to whom heart clung more than to youngest born david next appeared to that sunday afternoon when everybody be gone to church except jacob cowboy be so singularly favourable opportunity for son who wanted to appropriate mother guinea that half thought must have be kindly intended by providence for such purpose especially third sunday in lent because jacob have be out on one of occasional wandering for last two day david being timid young man have considerable dread hatred of jacob a of large personage who went about habitually with pitchfork in hand nothing must be easier then than for david on sunday afternoon to decline going to church on ground that be going to tea at mr lunns whose pretty daughter sally have be early flame of when church goer be at safe distance to abstract guinea from wooden box slip into small canvas bagnothing easier than to call to cowboy that be going tell to keep eye on house for fear of sunday tramp david thought must be easy too to get to small thicket bury bag in hole have already made covered up under root of old hollow ash have in fact found hole without moment difficulty have uncovered be about gently to drop bag into when sound of large body rustling towards with something like bellow be such surprise to david who a gentleman gifted with much contrivance be naturally only prepared for what expected that instead of dropping bag gently let fall so a to make untwist vomit forth shining guinea in same moment looked up saw dear brother jacob close upon holding pitchfork so that bright smooth prong be yard in advance of own body about foot off david learned friend to whom once narrated history observed that be david guilt made prong formidable that men nil conscia sibi strip pitchfork of terror thought idea so valuable that obtained leave to use on condition of suppressing name nevertheless david did not entirely lose presence of mind for in case must have sunk on earth started backward whereas kept ground smiled at jacob who nodded head up down said hoich zavy in painfully equivocal manner david heart be beating audibly if have have lip must have be pale mental activity instead of being paralysed be stimulated while be inwardly praying always prayed when be much frightenedoh save once ill never get into danger againhe be thrusting hand into pocket in search of box of yellow lozenge have brought with from brigford among other delicacy of same portable kind a mean of conciliating proud beauty more particularly beauty of miss sarah lunn not one of delicacy have ever offered to poor jacob for david be not young man to waste jujube barley sugar in giving pleasure to people from whom expected nothing idiot with equivocal intention pitchfork be a well worth flattering cajoling a if be louis napoleon so david with promptitude equal to occasion drew out box of yellow lozenge lifted lid performed pantomime with mouth finger be meant to imply that be delighted to see dear brother jacob seized opportunity of making small present must find particularly agreeable to taste jacob understand be not intense idiot within certain limited range knew how to choose good reject evil took one lozenge by way of test sucked a if have be philosopher then in a great ecstacy at new complex savour a caliban at taste of trinculos wine chuckled stroked suddenly beneficent brother held out hand for more for except in fit of anger jacob be not ferocious needlessly predatory david courage half returned left off praying pouring dozen lozenge into jacob palm trying to look very fond of congratulated that have formed plan of going to see miss sally lunn afternoon that a consequence have brought with propitiatory delicacy be certainly lucky fellow indeed be always likely providence must be fonder of than of other apprentice since be to be interrupted why idiot be preferable to other sort of witness for first time in life david thought saw advantage of idiot a for jacob have thrust pitchfork into ground have thrown down beside in thorough abandonment to unprecedented pleasure of having five lozenge in mouth at once blinking meanwhile making inarticulate sound of gustative content have not yet given sign of noticing guinea in seating have laid broad right hand on unconsciously kept in position absorbed in sensation of palate if must only be kept so occupied with lozenge a not to see guinea before david must manage to cover be david best hope of safety for jacob knew mother guinea have be part of common experience a boy to be allowed to look at handsome coin rattle in box on high day holiday among jacob narrow experience a to money be likely to be most memorable here jacob said david in insinuating tone handing box to ill give em to runmake hasteelse somebodyll come take em david not having studied psychology of idiot be not aware that be not to be wrought upon by imaginative fear jacob took box with left hand saw necessity for running away be ever promising young man wishing to lay foundation of fortune by appropriating mother guinea obstructed by such day mare a moment must come when jacob must move right hand to draw off lid of tin box then david must sweep guinea into hole with utmost address swiftness immediately seat upon ah of use to have foresight when be dealing with idiot be not to be calculated upon jacob right hand be given to vague clutching throwing suddenly clutched guinea a if have be so many pebble be raised in attitude promised to scatter like seed over distant bramble when from prompting otherprobably of unwonted sensationit paused descended to jacob knee opened slowly under inspection of jacob dull eye david began to pray again immediately desistedanother resource having occurred to mother zinnies exclaimed innocent jacob then looking at david said interrogatively box hush hush said david summoning ingenuity in severe strait see jacob took tin box from brother hand emptied of lozenge returning half of to jacob secretly keeping rest in own hand then held out empty box said here box jacob box for guinea gently sweeping from jacob palm into box procedure be not objectionable to jacob on contrary guinea clinked so pleasantly a fell that wished for repetition of sound seizing box began to rattle very gleefully david seizing opportunity deposited reserve of lozenge in ground hastily swept earth over look jacob said at last jacob paused from clinking looked into hole while david began to scratch away earth a if in doubtful expectation when lozenge be laid bare took out one by one gave to jacob hush said in loud whisper tell nobodyall for jacobhushshsh put guinea in holetheyll come out like to make lesson more complete took guinea lowering into hole said put in so then a took last lozenge out said come out so put lozenge into jacob hospitable mouth jacob turned head on one side looked first at brother then at hole like reflective monkey finally laid box of guinea in hole with much decision david made haste to add one of stray coin put on lid covered well with earth saying in meet coaxing tone take m out to morrow jacob for jacob hushshsh jacob to whom once indifferent brother have at once become sort of sweet tasted fetish stroked david best coat with adhesive finger then hugged with accompaniment of mingled chuckling gurgling by be accustomed to express milder passion if have chosen to bite small morsel out of beneficent brother cheek david must have be obliged to bear here must pause to point out to short sightedness of human contrivance ingenious young man mr david faux thought have achieved triumph of cunning when have associated in brother rudimentary mind with flavour of yellow lozenge have yet to learn that be dreadful thing to make idiot fond of when be not of affectionate disposition especially idiot with pitchforkobviously difficult friend to shake off by rough usage may seem to rather blundering contrivance for clever young man to bury guinea if everything have turned out a david have calculated must have seen that plan be worthy of talent guinea must have lain safely in earth while theft be discovered david with calm of conscious innocence must have lingered at home reluctant to say good bye to dear mother while be in grief about guinea till at length on eve of departure must have disinterred in strictest privacy carried on own person without inconvenience david perceive have reckoned without host to speak more precisely without idiot brotheran item of so uncertain fluctuating character doubt whether must not have puzzled astute hero of m de balzac whose foresight be so remarkably at home in future be clear to david now that have only one alternative before must renounce guinea by quietly putting back in mother drawer course not unattended with difficulty must leave more than suspicion behind by departing early next morning without giving notice with guinea in pocket for if gave notice that be going mother knew must insist on fetching from box of guinea three have always promised a share indeed in original plan have counted on a mean by theft must be discovered under circumstance must speak for innocence now a need hardly explain well combined plan be completely frustrated even if david must have bribed jacob with perpetual lozenge idiot secrecy be betrayal dared not even go to tea at mr lunns for in case must have lost sight of jacob who in impatience for crop of lozenge might scratch up box again while be absent carry homedepriving at once of reputation guinea must think of nothing rest of day of coaxing jacob keeping out of mischief be fatiguing anxious evening to david nevertheless dared not go to sleep without tying piece of string to thumb great toe to secure frequent waking for meant to be up with first peep of dawn be far out of reach before breakfast time father thought must certainly cut off with shilling what then striking young man a must be sure to be well received in west indie in foreign country there be always openingseven for cat be probable that princess yarico must want to marry make present of very large jewel beforehand after neednt unless liked david have made up mind not to steal more even from people who be fond of be unpleasant way of making fortune in world where be likely to surprised in act by brother such alarm did not agree with david constitution have felt so much nausea evening that doubt liver be affected besides must have be greatly hurt not to be thought well of in world always meant to make figure be thought worthy of best seat best morsel ruminating to effect on brilliant future in reserve for david by help of check string kept on alert to seize time of earliest dawn for rising departure brother of course be early riser must anticipate by at least hour half little room have to a only occasional visitor have window over horse block so that must slip out through window without least difficulty jacob horrible jacob have awkward trick of getting up before everybody else to stem hunger by emptying milk bowl be duly set for of late have taken to sleeping in hay loft if came into house must be on opposite side to that from david be making exit there be need to think of jacob yet david be liberal enough to bestow curse on himit be only thing ever did bestow gratuitously small bundle of clothes be ready packed be soon treading lightly on step of horse block soon walking at smart pace across field towards thicket must take no more than two minute to get out box must make out tree be under by pale strip where bark be off although dawning light be rather dimmer in thicket what in name ofburnt pastrywas large body with staff planted beside close at foot of ash tree david paused not to make up mind a to nature of apparitionhe have not happiness of doubting for moment that staff be jacob pitchforkbut to gather self command necessary for addressing brother with sufficiently honeyed accent jacob be absorbed in scratching up earth have not heard david approach say jacob said david in loud whisper just a tin box be lifted out of hole jacob looked up discerning sweet flavoured brother nodded grinned in dim light in way made seem to david like triumphant demon if have be of impetuous disposition must have snatched pitchfork from ground impaled fraternal demon david be by mean impetuous be young man greatly given to calculate consequence habit have be held to be foundation of virtue somehow have not precisely that effect in david calculated whether action must harm whether must only harm other people in former case be very timid about satisfying immediate desire in latter must risk result with much courage give jacob said stooping down patting brother let see jacob finding lid rather tight gave box to brother in perfect faith david raised lid shook head while jacob put finger in took out guinea to taste whether metamorphosis into lozenge be complete satisfactory jacob too soon too soon said david when guinea have be tasted give well go bury somewhere else well put in yonder added pointing vaguely toward distance david screwed on lid while jacob looking grave rose grasped pitchfork then seeing david bundle snatched like too officious newfoundland stuck pitchfork into carried over shoulder in triumph a accompanied david box out of thicket what on earth be david to do must have be easy to frown at jacob kick order to get away david dared a soon have kicked bull jacob be quiet a long a be treated indulgently on slightest show of anger became unmanageable be liable to fit of fury must have made formidable even without pitchfork there be mastery to be obtained over except by kindness guile david tried guile go jacob said when be out of thicketpointing towards house a spoke go fetch spadea spade give bundle added trying to reach from fork where hung high above jacob tall shoulder jacob showed a much alacrity in obeying a wasp show in leaving sugar basin near david felt in vicinity of lozenge chuckled rubbed brother back brandishing bundle higher out of reach david with inward groan changed tactic walked on a fast a must be not safe to linger jacob must get tired of following at event must be eluded if must once get to distant highroad coach must overtake david must mount having previously by ingenious mean secured bundle then jacob might howl flourish pitchfork a much a liked meanwhile be under fatal necessity of being very kind to ogre of providing large breakfast for when stopped at roadside inn be already three hour since have started david be tired must coach be coming up soon inquired coach for next two hour there be carrier cart to come immediately on way to next town if must slip out even leaving bundle behind get into cart without jacob there be new obstacle jacob have recently discovered remnant of sugar candy in one of brother tail pocket since then have cautiously kept hold on limb of garment perhaps with expectation that there must be further development of sugar candy after longer shorter interval now one who have worn coat will understand sensibility must keep man from starting away in hurry when there be grasp on coat tail david looked forward to being well received among stranger might make difference if have only one tail to coat felt in cold perspiration must walk no more must get into cart let jacob get in with presently cheering idea occurred to after so large breakfast jacob must be sure to go to sleep in cart see at once david meant to seize bundle jump out be free expectation be partly fulfilled jacob did go to sleep in cart be in peculiar attitudeit be with arm tightly fastened round dear brother body if ever david attempted to move grasp tightened with force of affectionate boa constrictor th innicents fond on observed carrier thinking that david be probably amiable brother wishing to pay compliment david groaned way of thieving be not way of pleasantness oh why have idiot brother oh why in general be world so constituted that man must not take mother guinea comfortably david became grimly speculative copious dinner at noon for jacob little dinner because little appetite for david instead of eating plied jacob with beer for through liberality descried hope jacob fell into dead sleep at last without having arm round david who paid reckoning took bundle walked off in half hour be on coach on way to liverpool smiling smile of triumphant wicked be rid of jacobhe be bound for indie where gullible princess awaited must never steal more there must be no need must show so deserving that people must make present freely must give up notion of father legacy be not likely must ever want that trifle even if didwhy be compensation to think that in being for ever divided from family be divided from jacob more terrible than gorgon

female head be like bunch of china aster if new grocer be to fill window with mountain of currant sugar made seductive by contrast security be there for grimworth that vagrant spirit in shopping once introduced must not in end carry most important family to larger market town of cattleton where business being done on system of small profit quick return fashion be of freshest good of kind might be bought at advantage with view of time predominant among tradespeople at uncertainty concerning nature of business sallow complexioned stranger be about to set up in vacant shop naturally gave

doorplace of new shopa generous sounding name might have belonged to open hearted improvident hero of old comedy who must have delighted in raining sugared almond like new manna gift among small generation outside window mr edward freely be man whose impulse be kept in due subordination held that desire for sweet pastry must only be satisfied in direct ratio with power of paying for if smallest child in grimworth must go to with halfpenny in tiny fist must after ringing halfpenny deliver just equivalent in rock be not man to cheat even smallest childhe often said so observing at same time that loved honesty also that be very tender hearted though didnt show feeling a people did either in reward of such virtue according to more hidden law of sequence mr freelys business in spite of prejudice started under favourable auspex for mr chaloner rector wife be among earliest customer at shop thinking only right to encourage new parishioner who have made decorous appearance at church found mr freely most civil obliging young man intelligent to surprising degree for confectioner well principled too for in giving useful hint about choosing sugar have thrown much light on dishonesty of other tradesman moreover have be in west indie have seen very estate have be poor grandfather property said missionary be only cause of negro discontentan observing young man evidently mr chaloner ordered wine biscuit olive gave mr freely to understand that must find shop great convenience so did doctor wife so did mr gate at large carding mill who having high connexion frequently visiting might be expected to have large consumption of ratafia macaroon le aristocratic matron of grimworth seemed likely at first to justify husband confidence that must never pay percentage of profit on drop cake instead of making own get up hollow show of liberal housekeeping by purchasing slice of collared meat when neighbour came in for supper be task to narrate gradual corruption of grimworth manner from primitive simplicitya melancholy task if be not cheered by prospect of fine peripateia downfall by progress of corruption be ultimately checked be young mr steene veterinary surgeon wife who first gave way to temptation fear have be rather over educated for station in life for knew by heart many passage in lalla rookh corsair siege of corinth have given distaste for domestic occupation caused withering disappointment at discovery that mr steene since marriage have lost interest in bulbul openly preferred discussing nature of spavin with coarse neighbour be angry if pudding turned out wateryindeed be simply top booted vet who came in hungry at dinner time not in least like nobleman turned corsair out of pure scorn for race like renegade with turban crescent unless be in irritability of temper scorn be such very different thing in top boot brutal man have invited supper party for christmas eve when must expect to see mince pie on table mr steene have prepared mince meat have devoted much butter fine flour labour to making of batch of pie in morning proved to be so very heavy when came out of oven that must only think with trembling of moment when

through mind that once might send for dish of mince pie from freelys knew have what be to become of eighteen heavy mince pie oh be of use thinking about that be very expensiveindeed making mince pie at be great expense when be not sure to turn out well must be much better to buy ready made paid little more for there be risk of waste such be sophistry with misguided young womanenough mr steene sent for mince pie be grieved to add garbled household account in order to conceal fact from husband be second step in downward course owing to young woman being out of harmony with circumstance yearning after renegade bulbul being subject to claim from veterinary surgeon fond of mince pie third step be to harden by telling fact of bought mince pie to intimate friend mr mole who have already guessed who subsequently encouraged in buying mould of jelly instead of exerting own skill by reflection that other people did same sort of thing infection spread soon there be party clique in grimworth on side of buying at freelys many husband kept for time in dark on point innocently swallowed at two mouthful tart on be paying profit of hundred per cent a innocently encouraged fatal disingenuousness in partner of bosom by praising pastry others more keen sighted winked at too frequent presentation on washing day at impromptu supper of superior spiced beef flattered palate more than cold remnant have formerly be contented with housewife who have once bought at freelys felt secret joy when detected similar perversion in neighbour practice soon only two three old fashioned mistress of family held out in protest against growing demoralization saying to neighbour who came to sup with cant offer freelys beef freelys cheesecake everything in house be home made im afraid youll hardly have appetite for plain pastry doctor whose cook be not satisfactory curate who kept cook mining agent who be great bon vivant even began to rely on freely for greater part of dinner when wished to give entertainment of brilliancy in short business of manufacturing more fanciful viand be fast passing out of hind of maid matron in private family be becoming work of special commercial organ be not ignorant that sort of thing be called inevitable course of civilization division of labour so forth that maid matron may be said to have have hand set free from cookery to add to wealth of society in other way only happened at grimworth to be sure be low place that maid matron must hing with hand at better than cooking not even who have always made heavy cake leathery pastry so came to pas that progress of civilization at grimworth be not otherwise apparent than in impoverishment of men gossiping idleness of woman heightening prosperity of mr edward freely yellow coat school be double source of profit to calculating confectioner for opened eating room for superior workman employed on new school accommodated pupil at old school by giving great attention to fancy sugar

young creature whose bone be not quite formed for have observed delicacy to have inorganic flavour must have recommended greatly to young lady of spectator acquaintance who habitually made dessert on stem of tobacco pipe a for confectioner made way gradually into grimworth home a commodity did in spite of initial repugnance somehow other reception a guest seemed thing required justifying like purchasing of pastry in first place be stranger therefore open to suspicion secondly confectionery business be so entirely new at grimworth that place in scale of rank have not be distinctly ascertained there be doubt about draper grocer when came of good old grimworth family like mr luff mr prettyman visited with palfrey who farmed own land played many game at whist with doctor condescended little towards timber merchant who have lately taken to coal trade also have got new furniture whether confectioner must be admitted to higher level of respectability must be understood to find associate among butcher baker be new question on tradition threw light being bachelor be in favour must perhaps have be enough to turn scale even if mr edward freelys other personal pretension have be of entirely insignificant cast so far from very soon appeared that be remarkable young man who have be in west indie have seen many wonder by sea land so that must charm ear of grimworth desdemonas with story of strange fish especially shark have stabbed in nick of time by bravely plunging overboard just a monster be turning on side to devour cook mate of terrible fever have undergone

however he got good rum dont want to be hand glove with for that be kind of dim suspicion beclouded view of mr freelys quality in maturer mind of grimworth through early month of residence there when confectioner ceased to be novelty suspicion also ceased to be novel people got tired of hinting at especially a seemed to be refuted by advancing prosperity importance mr freely be becoming person of influence in parish be found useful a overseer of poor having great firmness in enduring other people pain firmness said be due to great benevolence always did what be good for people in end mr

wont to do when intimate that have become little too wise to be instructed about world have long be flat stale to for time be quite general in attention to fair sex combining gallantry of lady man with severity of criticism on person manner of absent belle tended rather to stimulate in feminine breast desire to conquer approval of so fastidious judge nothing short of very best in department of female charm virtue must suffice to kindle ardour of mr edward freely who have become familiar with most luxuriant dazzling beauty in west indie may seem incredible that confectioner must have idea conversation so much resembling to be met with in higher walk of life must be remembered that have not merely travelled have also bow leg sallow small featured visage so that nature have stamped for

without further betrayal thing be difficult saw clearly that if took jacob absence conjoined with disappearance of stranger must either cause conviction that be really relative must oblige to dangerous course of inventing story to account for disappearance own absence at same time david groaned there come occasion when falsehood be felt to be inconvenient must perhaps have be longer headed device if have never told of clever fib about uncle grand otherwise for palfrey be simple people shared popular prejudice against lying even if must get jacob away time what security be there that

must have people coming from botany bay to settle in if thing went on in way soon appeared that jacob must not be made to quit dear brother david except by force understood with clearness equal to of most intelligent mind that jonathan must take back to skimmed milk apple dumpling broad bean pork have found paradise in brother shop be difficult matter to use force with jacob for wore heavy nailed boot if pitchfork have be mastered must have resorted without hesitation to kick nothing short of using guile to bind hand foot must have made party safe let stay said david with desperate resignation
