imposing in mildness that men spoke to with agreeable sensation of timidity soothing unspeakable charm of gentle womanhood supersedes acquisition accomplishment must never have asked at period of mr amos bartons life if sketched played piano must even perhaps have be rather scandalized if have descended from serene dignity of being to assiduous unrest of doing happy man must have thought whose eye will rest on in pause of fireside reading whose hot aching forehead will be soothed by contact of cool soft hand who will recover from dejection at mistake failure in loving light of unreproaching

trouble confuse sheppertonian mind ah said countess returning editor letter may well say will be glad of other sermon from same source must rather must publish sermon in independent volume mr barton must be so desirable to have in shape for instance must send copy to dean of radborough there be lord blarney whom knew before be chancellor be special favourite of cant think what sweet thing used to say to will not resist temptation to write to one of day sans faon tell how ought to dispose of next vacant living in gift whether jet spaniel being much more knowing dog than be suspected wished to express disapproval of countess last speech a not accordant with idea of wisdom veracity can not say at moment jumped off lap turning back upon placed one paw on fender held other up to warm a if

mr ely be not initiated yet know here mr farquhars carriage be announced a have not found conversation particularly brilliant under stimulus of mr elys exceptional presence will not accompany home to le exciting atmosphere of domestic life mr ely threw with sense of relief into easiest chair set foot on hob in attitude of bachelor enjoyment began to read bishop jebbs memoir chapter be by mean sure that if good people of milby have known truth about countess czerlaski must not have be considerably disappointed to find that be very far from being a bad a imagined nice distinction be troublesome be so much easier to say that thing be black than to discriminate particular shade of brown blue green to really belongs be so much easier to make up mind that neighbour be good for nothing than to enter into circumstance must oblige to modify opinion besides think of virtuous declamation penetrating observation have be built up entirely on fundamental position that countess be very objectionable person indeed must be utterly overturned nullified by destruction of premiss mr phipps banker wife mr landor attorney wife have invested part of reputation for acuteness in supposition that mr bridmain be not countess brother moreover miss phipps be conscious that if countess be not disreputable person miss phipps have compensating superiority in virtue to set against other lady manifest superiority in personal charm miss phippss stumpy figure unsuccessful attire instead of looking down from mount of virtue with aureole round head must then be seen on same level in same light a countess czerlaskis diana like form well chosen drapery miss phipps for part didnt like dressing for effect have always avoided that style of appearance be calculated to create sensation then what amusing innuendo of milby gentleman over wine must have be entirely frustrated reduced to nought if have told that countess have really be guilty of misdemeanour demanded exclusion from strictly respectable society that husband have be veritable count czerlaski who have have wonderful escape a said who a did not say a be said in certain circular once folded by fair hand have subsequently given dancing lesson in metropolis mr bridmain be neither more le than half brother who by unimpeached integrity industry have won partnership in silk manufactory thereby moderate fortune enabled to retire a see to study politics weather art of conversation at leisure mr bridmain in fact quadragenarian bachelor a be felt extremely well pleased to receive sister in widowhood to shine in reflected light of beauty title man who be not monster mathematician mad philosopher be slave of woman other mr bridmain have put neck under yoke of handsome sister though soul be very little one of smallest description indeed must not have ventured to call own might be slightly recalcitrant now then a be habit of long eared pachyderm under thong of fair countess tongue there seemed little probability that must ever get neck loose still bachelor heart be outlying fortress that fair enemy may day take by storm stratagem there be always possibility that mr bridmains first nuptials might occur before countess be quite sure of second a be however submitted to all sister caprice never grumbled because dress maid formed considerable item beyond own little income of sixty pound per annum consented to lead with migratory life a personage on debatable ground between aristocracy commonalty instead of settling in spot where five hundred year might have won definite dignity of parochial magnate countess have view in choosing quiet provincial place like milby after three year of widowhood have brought feeling to contemplate giving successor to lamented czerlaski whose fine whisker fine air romantic fortune have won heart ten year ago when a pretty caroline bridmain in full bloom of five twenty be governess to lady porter daughter whom initiated into mystery of pa de basque lancer quadrille have have seven year of sufficiently happy matrimony with czerlaski who have taken to paris germany introduced there to many of old friend with large title small fortune so that fair caroline have have considerable experience of life have gathered therefrom not indeed very ripe comprehensive wisdom much external polish certain practical conclusion of very decided kind one of conclusion be that there be thing more solid in life than fine whisker title in accepting second husband must regard item a quite subordinate to carriage settlement now have ascertained by tentative residence that kind of bite be angling for be difficult to be met with at watering place be already preoccupied with abundance of angling beauty be chiefly stocked with men whose whisker might be dyed whose income be still more problematic so have determined on trying neighbourhood where people be extremely well acquainted with others affair where woman be mostly ill dressed ugly mr bridmains slow brain have adopted sister view seemed to that woman so handsome distinguished a countess must certainly make match might lift into region of county celebrity give at least sort of cousinship to quarter session be simple truth must have seemed extremely flat to gossip of milby who have made up mind to something much more exciting there be nothing here so very detestable be true countess be little vain little ambitious little selfish little willow frivolous little given to white lie who considers such slight blemish such moral pimple a disqualification for entering into most respectable society indeed severest lady in milby must have be perfectly aware that characteristic must have created wide distinction between countess czerlaski since be clear there be wide distinction why must lie in possession of vice from be undeniably free hence came to pas milby respectability refused to recognize countess czerlaski in spite of assiduous church going deep disgust be known to have expressed at extreme paucity of congregation on ash wednesday so began to feel that have miscalculated advantage of neighbourhood where people be well acquainted with others private affair under circumstance will imagine how welcome be perfect credence admiration met with from mr mr barton have be especially irritated by mr elys behaviour to felt sure that be not in least struck with beauty that quizzed conversation that spoke of with sneer woman always know where be utterly powerless shuns coldly satirical eye a must shun gorgon be especially eager for clerical notice friendship not merely because be quite most respectable countenance to be obtained in society because really cared about religious matter have uneasy sense that be not altogether safe in quarter have serious intention of becoming quite pious without reserve when have once got carriage settlement let do one sly trick say ulysses to neoptolemus will be perfectly honest ever after countess did not quote sophocles said to herself only little bit of pretence vanity then will be quite good make quite safe for world a have by mean such fine taste insight in theological teaching a in costume rev amos barton seemed to man not only of learning be always understood with clergyman of much power a spiritual director a for milly countess really loved a well a preoccupied state of affection must allow for have already perceived that there be one being to whom countess be absorbingly devoted to whose desire made everything else subservient namely caroline czerlaski nee bridmain thus there be really not much affectation in sweet speech attention to mr mr barton still friendship by mean adequately represented object have in view when came to milby have be for time clear to that must suggest new

evidently found acceptance with sallow dyspeptic mr duke with florid highly peptic mr fellowes have seen enough trust of rev amos barton to be convinced that be more apt to fall into blunder than into sin more apt to be deceived than to incur necessity for being deceitful if have keen eye for physiognomy will have detected that countess czerlaski loved far too well to get entangled in unprofitable vice how then will say must fine lady choose to quarter on establishment of poor curate where carpet be probably falling into hole where attendance be limited to maid of work where six child be running loose from eight oclock in morning till eight oclock in evening surely must be misrepresenting fact heaven forbid for not having lofty imagination a perceive being unable to invent thrilling

a may live next door to such a walk in rag in velvet in very ordinary decent apparel therefore that may dismiss suspicion of veracity will beg to consider at time countess czerlaski left camp villa in

saved milly from having to perform painful task in first place countess be getting weary of shepperton weary of waiting for brother overture never came so one fine morning reflected that forgiveness

when be coming out of church husband whod be born parish might have told better unreadiness to put on black on available occasion too great alacrity in putting off argued in mr higginss opinion

hardened old judy coming after tea leaf again mr hackit must say im fool enough to give em though sally want em while to sweep floor with such be dame fripp whom mr gilfil riding leisurely in top boot spur from doing duty at knebley one warm sunday afternoon observed sitting in dry ditch near cottage by side large pig who with ease confidence belonging to perfect friendship be lying with head in

not be to church making slightest effort for spiritual edification next day ordered man david to take great piece of bacon with message saying parson wanted to make sure that mr fripp must know taste of bacon fat again so when mr gilfil died dame fripp manifested gratitude reverence in simply dingy fashion have mentioned already suspect that vicar did not shine in more spiritual function of office indeed utmost can say for in respect be that performed function with undeviating attention to brevity despatch have large heap of short sermon rather yellow worn at edge from took two sunday securing perfect impartiality in selection by taking a came without reference to topic having preached one of sermon at shepperton in morning mounted horse rode hastily with other in pocket to knebley where officiated in wonderful little church with checkered pavement have once rung to iron tread of military monk with coat of arm in cluster on lofty roof marble warrior wife without nose occupying large proportion of area twelve apostle with head very much on one side holding didactic ribbon painted in fresco on wall here in absence of mind to be prone mr gilfil must sometimes forget to take off spur before putting on surplice only become aware of omission by feeling something mysteriously tugging at skirt of garment a stepped into reading desk knebley farmer must a soon have thought of criticizing moon a pastor belonged to course of nature like market toll gate dirty bank note being vicar claim on veneration have never be counteracted by exasperating claim on pocket of who did not indulge in superfluity of covered cart without spring have dined hour earlier than usual be to say at twelve oclock in order to have time for long walk through miry lane present duly in place at two oclock when mr oldinport lady felicia to whom knebley church be sort of family temple made way among bow curtsy of dependant to carved canopied pew in chancel diffusing a went delicate odour of indian rose on unsusceptible nostril of congregation farmer wife child sat on dark oaken bench husband usually chose distinctive dignity of stall under one of twelve apostle where when alternation of prayer response have given place to agreeable monotony of sermon paterfamilias might be seen heard sinking into pleasant doze from infallibly woke up at sound of concluding doxology then made way back again through miry lane perhaps almost a much better for simple weekly tribute to what knew of good right a many more wakeful critical congregation of present day mr gilfil too used to make way home in later year of life for have given up habit of dining at knebley abbey on sunday having be sorry to say have very bitter quarrel with mr oldinport cousin predecessor of mr oldinport who flourished in rev amos bartons time that quarrel be sad pity for two have have many good day hunting together when be younger in friendly time not few member of hunt envied mr oldinport excellent term be on with vicar for a sir jasper sitwell observed next to man wife there nobody can be such infernal plague to a parson always under nose on own estate fancy original difference led to rupture be very slight mr gilfil be of extremely caustic turn satire having flavour of originality be quite wanting in sermon a mr oldinports armour of conscious virtue presented considerable conspicuous gap vicar keen edged retort probably made few incision too deep to be forgiven such at least be view of case presented by mr hackit who knew a much of matter a third person for very week after quarrel when presiding at annual dinner of association for prosecution of felon held at oldinport arm contributed additional zest to conviviality on occasion by informing company that parson have given squire lick with rough side of tongue detection of person person who have driven off mr parrot heifer must hardly have be more welcome news to shepperton tenantry with whom mr oldinport be in worst odour a landlord having kept up rent in spite of falling price not being in least stung to emulation by paragraph in provincial newspaper stating that honourable augustus purwell viscount blether have made return of ten per cent on last rent day fact be mr oldinport have not slightest intention of standing for parliament whereas have strongest intention of adding to unentailed estate hence to shepperton farmer be a good a lemon with grog to know that vicar have thrown out sarcasm against squire charity a little better than of man who stole goose gave away giblet in alms for shepperton observe be in state of attic culture compared with knebley have turnpike road public opinion whereas in botian knebley men mind waggon alike moved in deepest of rut landlord be only grumbled at a necessary unalterable evil like weather weevil turnip fly thus in shepperton breach with mr oldinport tended only to heighten good understanding vicar have always enjoyed with rest of parishioner from generation whose child have christened quarter of century before down to hopeful generation represented by little tommy bond who have recently quitted frock trouser for severe simplicity of tight suit of corduroy relieved by numerous brass button tommy be saucy boy impervious to impression of reverence excessively addicted to humming top marble with recreative resource be in habit of immoderately distending pocket of corduroy one day spinning top on garden walk seeing vicar advance directly towards at exciting moment when be beginning to sleep magnificently shouted out with force of lung stop dont knock top down now from day little corduroy have be especial favourite with mr gilfil who delighted to provoke ready scorn wonder by putting question gave tommy meanest opinion of intellect well little corduroy have milked goose to day milked goose why dont goose silly dear heart why how do gosling live then nutriment of gosling rather transcending tommys observation in natural history feigned to understand question in exclamatory rather than interrogatory sense became absorbed in winding up top ah see dont know how gosling live did notice how rained sugar plum yesterday here tommy became attentive why fell into pocket a rode along look in pocket see if didnt tommy without waiting to discus alleged antecedent lost time in ascertaining presence of agreeable consequent for have well founded belief in advantage of diving into vicar pocket mr gilfil called wonderful pocket because a delighted to tell young shaver two shoe so called little boy girl whenever put penny into turned into sugar plum gingerbread other nice thing indeed little bessie parrot flaxen headed two shoe very white fat a to neck always have admirable directness sincerity to salute with question what zoo dot in zoo pottet can imagine then that christening dinner be none le merry for presence of parson farmer relished society particularly for must not only smoke pipe season detail of parish affair with abundance of caustic joke proverb a mr bond often said man knew more than vicar about breed of cow horse have grazing land of own about five mile off bailiff ostensibly tenant farmed under direction to ride backwards forward look after buying selling of stock be old gentleman chief relaxation now hunting day be over to hear discussing respective merit of devonshire breed short horn last foolish decision of magistrate about pauper superficial observer might have seen little difference beyond superior shrewdness between vicar bucolic parishioner for be habit to approximate accent mode of speech to theirs doubtless because thought mere frustration of purpose of language to talk of shear hog ewe to men who habitually said sharrags yowes nevertheless farmer be perfectly aware of distinction between parson have not at le belief in a gentleman clergyman for easy speech familiar manner mr parrot smoothed apron set cap right with utmost solicitude when saw vicar coming made deepest curtsy christmas have fat turkey ready to send with duty in most gossiping colloquy with mr gilfil might have observed that men woman minded word never became indifferent to approbation same respect attended in strictly clerical function benefit of baptism be supposed to be somehow bound up with mr gilfils personality so metaphysical distinction a between man office being a yet quite foreign to mind of good shepperton churchman savouring must have thought of dissent on very face of miss selina parrot put off marriage whole month when mr gilfil have attack of rheumatism rather than be married in makeshift manner by milby curate weve have very good sermon morning be frequent remark after hearing one of old yellow series heard with more satisfaction because have be heard for twentieth time for to mind on shepperton level be repetition not novelty produce strongest effect phrase like tune be long time making at home in brain mr gilfils sermon a may imagine be not of highly doctrinal still le of polemical cast perhaps did not search conscience very powerfully for remember that to mr patten who have listened to thirty year announcement that be sinner appeared uncivil heresy on other hand made unreasonable demand on shepperton intellect amounting indeed to little more than expansion of concise thesis that who do wrong will find worse for who do well will find better for nature of wrong doing being exposed in special sermon against lying backbiting anger slothfulness like well doing being interpreted a honesty truthfulness charity industry other common virtue lying quite on surface of life having very little to do with deep spiritual doctrine mr patten understood that if turned out ill crushed cheese just retribution awaited though fear made particular application of sermon on backbiting mr hackit expressed greatly edified by sermon on honesty allusion to unjust weight deceitful balance having peculiar lucidity for owing to recent dispute with grocer be not aware that ever appeared to be much struck by sermon on anger a to suspicion that mr gilfil did not dispense pure gospel stricture on doctrine mode of delivery such thought never visited mind of shepperton parishioner of very parishioner who ten fifteen year later showed extremely critical of mr bartons discourse demeanour in interim have tasted that dangerous fruit of tree of knowledge innovation be well known to open eye even in uncomfortable manner at present to find fault with sermon be regarded a almost equivalent to finding fault with religion one sunday mr hackits nephew master tom stokes flippant town youth greatly scandalized excellent relative by declaring that must write a good sermon a mr gilfils whereupon mr hackit sought to reduce presumptuous youth to utter confusion by offering sovereign if must fulfil vaunt sermon be written however though be not admitted to be anywhere within reach of mr gilfils be yet so astonishingly like sermon having text three division concluding exhortation beginning now brother that sovereign though denied formally be bestowed informally sermon be pronounced when master stokess back be turned to be uncommon cliver thing rev mr pickard indeed of independent meeting have stated in sermon preached at rotheby for reduction of debt on new zion built with exuberance of faith deficiency of fund by seceders from original zion that lived in parish where vicar be very dark in prayer addressed to own congregation be in habit of comprehensively alluding to parishioner outside chapel wall a who gallio like cared for none of thing

sir jasper sitwell must have be glad to see week if have seen conducting lady sitwell in to dinner have heard talking to with quaint yet graceful gallantry must have inferred that earlier period of

very distinct remembrance of mr gilfils wife indeed who knew anything of beyond fact that there be marble tablet with latin inscription in memory of over vicarage pew parishioner who be old enough to remember arrival be not generally gifted with descriptive power utmost must gather from be that mr gilfil looked like furriner wi such eye cant think voice a went through when sung at church one exception be mr patten whose strong memory taste for personal narrative made great source of oral tradition in shepperton mr hackit who have not come into parish until ten year after mr gilfils death

through squalor wretchedness there be trace discernible of comparative youth former good look lady cheverel though not very tender hearted still le sentimental be essentially kind liked to dispense benefit like goddess who look down benignly on halt maimed blind that approach shrine be smitten with compassion at sight of poor sarti who struck a mere battered wreck of vessel might have once floated gaily enough on outward voyage to sound of pipe tabor spoke gently a pointed out to operatic selection wished to copy seemed to sun in auburn radiant presence so that when made exit with music

absence in fetching carrying home work customer frequenting that fruit shop might often see tiny caterina seated on floor with leg in heap of pea be delight to kick about perhaps deposited like kitten in large basket out of harm way sometimes however sarti left little one with kind of protectress be very regular in devotion paid thrice week in great cathedral carrying caterina with here when high morning sun be warming myriad glittering pinnacle without struggling against massive gloom within shadow of man with child on arm might be seen flitting across more stationary shadow of pillar mullion making way towards little tinsel madonna hanging in retired spot near choir amid sublimity of mighty cathedral poor sarti have fixed on tinsel madonna a symbol of divine mercy protection just a child in presence of great landscape see none of glory of wood sky set heart on floating feather insect happens to be on level with eye here then sarti worshipped prayed setting caterina on floor by side now then when cathedral lay near place where have to call did not like to take must leave there in front of tinsel madonna where must sit perfectly good amusing with low crowing noise see sawings of

witnessed when be summoned up stair to fetch caterina a to shed small tear though be not at subject to weakness indeed abstained from on principle because a often said be known to be worst thing in

be married twelve year yet cheverel manor be cheered by childrens voice old house must be better for little of music besides must be christian work to train little papist into good protestant graft a much english fruit a possible on italian stem sir christopher listened to plan with hearty acquiescence loved child took at once to little black eyed monkey name for caterina through short life lady

sober men be often rubicund mr bates be sober with manly british churchman like sobriety can carry few glass of grog without perceptible clarification of idea dang boottons observed mr bates who at

through great cycle of experience commencing with somewhat acidulated goodwill of mr sharp nursery discipline then came grave luxury of ladyship sitting room perhaps dignity of ride on sir christopher knee sometimes followed by visit with to stable where caterina soon learned to hear without cry baying of chained bloodhound say with ostentatious bravery clinging to sir christopher leg while dey not

caterinas feeling nursed hope that time other must at least care enough for to accept love so waited patiently for day when might venture to say caterina love see must have be content with very little being one of men who pas through life without making least clamour about thinking cut of coat flavour of soup precise depth of servant bow at momentous thought foolishly enough a lover will think that be good augury for when came to be domesticated at cheverel manor in quality of chaplain there curate of neighbouring parish judging falsely from own case that habit affection be likeliest avenue to love sir christopher satisfied several feeling in installing maynard a chaplain in house liked old fashioned dignity of domestic appendage liked ward companionship a maynard have private fortune might take life easily in agreeable home keeping hunter observing mild regimen of clerical duty until cumbermoor living must fall in when might be settled for life in neighbourhood of manor with caterina for wife too sir christopher soon began to think for though good baronet be not at quick to suspect what be unpleasant opposed to view of fitness be quick to see what must dovetail with own plan have first guessed then ascertained by direct inquiry state of maynards feeling at once leaped to conclusion that caterina be of same mind at least must be when be old enough be too early day for anything definite to be said done meanwhile new circumstance be arising though made change in sir christopher plan prospect converted mr gilfils hope into anxiety made clear to not only that caterinas heart be never likely to be that be given entirely to once twice in caterinas childhood there have be boy visitor at manor younger than maynard gilfil beautiful boy with brown curl splendid clothes on whom

christopher virtue at length on death of anthony mother when be no longer curly headed boy tall young man with captain commission cheverel manor became home too whenever be absent from regiment caterina be then little woman between sixteen seventeen need not spend many word in explaining what perceive to be most natural thing in world there be little company kept at manor captain wybrow must have be much duller if caterina have not be there be pleasant to pay attention to speak to in gentle tone to see little flutter of pleasure blush just lit up pale cheek momentary timid glance of dark eye when praised singing leaning at side over piano pleasant too to cut out chaplain with large calf what idle man can withstand temptation of woman to fascinate man to eclipse especially when be quite clear to that mean mischief will leave everything to come right again by by at end of eighteen month however during captain wybrow have spent much of time at manor found that matter have reached point have not at contemplated gentle tone have led to tender word tender word have called forth response of look made impossible not to carry on crescendo of love making to find one self adored by little graceful dark eyed sweet singing woman whom one need despise be agreeable sensation comparable to smoking finest latakia also imposes return of tenderness a duty perhaps think that captain wybrow who knew that must be ridiculous to dream of marrying caterina must have be reckless libertine to win affection in manner not at all be young man of calm passion who be rarely led into conduct of must not give plausible account to tiny fragile caterina be woman who touched imagination affection rather than sens really felt very kindly towards must very likely have loved if have be able to love one nature have not endowed with capability have given admirable figure whitest of hand most delicate of nostril large amount of serene self satisfaction a if to save delicate piece of work from

earth plough be turning up in preparation for new thrashed seed passage from beauty to beauty to happy be like flow of melody measure for many human heart approach of foreseen anguish seems hurrying on moment when shadow of dread will be followed up by reality of despair how cruelly hasty that summer of seemed to caterina surely rose vanished earlier berry on mountain ash be more impatient to

lady cheverel must have died rather than confess couldnt help hoping that must be disappointed in lady assher rather ashamed of having called so charming mr gilfil watched caterina through day with mixed feeling suffering went to heart even for sake be glad that love must never come to good must be no longer fed by false hope how must help saying to perhaps after while caterina will be tired of fretting about cold hearted puppy then at length much expected day arrived brightest of september sun be lighting up yellowing lime tree a about five oclock lady asshers carriage drove under portico

john think view of house from park just after passed bridge particularly fine said miss assher interposing rather eagerly a if feared mother might be making infelicitous speech pleasure of first

lady assher o yes poor dear sir john must have whist table night caterina sat down to harpsichord at once have sooner begun to sing than perceived with delight captain wybrow be gliding towards harpsichord soon standing in old place consciousness gave fresh strength to voice when noticed that miss assher presently followed with air of ostentatious admiration belongs to absence of real enjoyment closing bravura be none worse for being animated by little triumphant contempt why be in better voice than ever caterina said captain wybrow when have ended be rather different from miss hibberts small piping that used to be glad of at farleigh be not beatrice indeed be be most enviable creature miss sarti caterina may not call caterina for have heard anthony speak of so often seem to

be light enough for to see about room for moon nearly at full be riding high in heaven among scattered hurrying cloud caterina drew aside window curtain sitting with forehead pressed against cold pane looked out on wide stretch of park lawn how dreary moonlight be robbed of tenderness repose by hard driving wind tree be harassed by tossing motion when must like to be at rest shivering grass make

from former state of despondency wretchedness than additional sense of injury from anthony behaviour towards in morning be new wrong to snatch caress when justly claimed expression of penitence of regret of sympathy be to make more light of than ever chapter that evening miss assher seemed to carry with unusual haughtiness be coldly observant of caterina there be unmistakably thunder in air captain wybrow appeared to take matter very easily be inclined to brave out by paying more than ordinary attention to caterina mr gilfil have induced to play game at draught with lady assher being seated at picquet with sir christopher miss assher in determined conversation with lady cheverel anthony thus left a odd unit sauntered up to caterinas chair leaned behind watching game tina with remembrance of morning thick upon felt cheek becoming more more crimson at last said impatiently wish must go away happened directly under view of miss assher who saw caterinas reddening cheek saw that said something impatiently that captain wybrow moved away in consequence there be person too who have noticed incident with strong interest who be moreover aware that miss assher not only saw keenly observed what be passing that other person be mr gilfil drew painful conclusion heightened anxiety for caterina next morning in spite of fine weather miss assher declined riding lady cheverel perceiving that there be something wrong between lover took care that must be left together in drawing room miss assher seated on sofa near fire be busy with fancy work in seemed bent on making great progress morning captain wybrow sat opposite with newspaper in hand from obligingly read extract with elaborately easy air wilfully unconscious of contemptuous silence with pursued filigree work at length put down paper must no longer pretend not to have exhausted miss assher then said seem to be on very intimate term with miss sarti with tina oh yes have always be pet of house know have be quite brother sister together sister dont generally colour so very deeply when brother approach doe colour never noticed shes timid little thing must be much better if must not be so hypocritical

reasonable do ask what earthly probability there be must think of flirting with poor little tina be there anything about to attract sort of attention be more child than woman one think of a little girl to be petted played with pray what be playing at with yesterday morning when came in unexpectedly cheek be flushed hand trembling yesterday morning o remember know always tease about gilfil who be over head ear in love with be angry at perhaps because like be old playfellow year before came here sir christopher have set heart on marrying captain wybrow be very false have nothing to do with mr gilfil that coloured last night when leaned over chair might just a well be candid if own mind be not made up pray do violence to yourself be quite ready to give way to miss sartis superior attraction understand that so far a be concerned be perfectly at liberty decline share in affection of man who forfeit respect by duplicity in saying miss assher rose be sweeping haughtily out of room when captain wybrow placed before took hand dear dear beatrice be patient judge so rashly sit down again sweet added in pleading voice pressing hand between leading back to sofa where sat down beside miss assher be not unwilling to be led back to listen retained cold haughty expression can not trust beatrice can not believe although there may be thing be unable to explain why must there be anything be unable to explain honourable man will not be placed in circumstance can not explain to woman seek to make wife will not ask to believe that act properly will let know that doe so let go sir attempted to rise passed hand round waist detained now beatrice dear said imploringly can not understand that there be thing man doesnt like to talk about secret that must keep for sake of others not for own sake everything relates to myself may ask ask to tell other people secret dont understand o yes said miss assher scornfully understand whenever make love to woman be secret be bound to keep for be folly to be talking in way captain wybrow be very plain that there be relation more than friendship between miss sarti since can not explain that relation there be more to be said between confound beatrice youll drive mad can fellow help girl falling in love with such thing be always happening men dont talk of fancy will spring up without slightest foundation especially when woman see few people die out again when there be encouragement if must like ought not to be surprised that other people can ought to think better of for mean to say then miss sarti be in love with without ever having made love to press to say such thing dearest be enough that know love that be devoted to naughty queen know there be chance for one else where be be only tormenting to prove power over dont be

miss sarti have nothing to do with feeling have right to know yours like tina very much who must not like such little simple thing must not wish not to like love be very different affair one have brotherly affection for woman a tina be sort of woman that one love last word be made doubly significant by look of tenderness kiss imprinted on hand captain wybrow held in miss assher be conquered be so far from probable that anthony must love that pale insignificant little thing so highly probable that must adore beautiful miss assher on whole be rather gratifying that other woman must be languishing for handsome lover really be exquisite creature poor miss sarti well must get over captain wybrow saw advantage come sweet love continued let talk more about unpleasant thing will keep tinas secret be very kind to wont for sake will ride out now see what glorious day be for riding let order horse im terribly in want of air come give one forgiving kiss say will go miss assher complied with double request then went to equip for ride while lover walked to stable chapter meanwhile mr gilfil who have heavy weight on mind have watched for moment when two elder lady having driven out caterina must probably be alone in lady cheverels sitting room went up knocked at door come in said sweet mellow voice always thrilling to a sound of rippling water to thirsty entered found caterina standing in confusion a if have be startled from reverie felt relieved when saw be maynard next moment felt little pettish that must have come to interrupt frighten oh be maynard do want lady cheverel caterina answered gravely want have something very particular to say to will let sit down with for hour yes dear old preacher said caterina sitting down with air of weariness what be mr gilfil placed opposite to said hope will not be hurt caterina by what be going to say to speak from other feeling than real affection anxiety for put everything else out of question know be more to than world will not thrust before feeling be unable to return speak to a brother old maynard used to scold for getting fishing line tangled ten year ago will not believe have mean selfish motive in mentioning thing be painful to know be very good said caterina abstractedly from what saw yesterday evening mr gilfil went on hesitating colouring slightly be led to fear pray forgive if be wrong caterina that captain wybrow be base enough still to trifle with feeling that still allows to behave to a man ought who be declared lover of woman what do mean maynard said caterina with anger flashing from eye do mean that let make love to what right have to think that of what do mean that saw yesterday evening be angry caterina dont suspect of doing wrong only suspect that heartless puppy of behaving so a to keep awake feeling in that not only destroy own peace of mind may lead to very bad consequence with regard to others want to warn that miss have eye open on pass between captain wybrow feel sure be getting jealous of pray be very careful caterina try to behave with politeness indifference to must see by time that be not worth feeling have given he more disturbed at pulse beating one too many in minute than at misery have caused by foolish trifling ought not to speak so of maynard said caterina passionately be not what think did care for did love only wanted to do what uncle wished o to be sure know be only from most virtuous motif that doe what be convenient to mr gilfil paused felt that be getting irritated defeating own object presently continued in calm affectionate tone will say no more about what think of caterina whether loved not position now with miss assher be such that love may cherish for can bring nothing misery god know dont expect to leave off loving at moment notice time absence trying to do what be right be only cure if be not that sir christopher lady cheverel must be displeased puzzled at wishing to leave home just now must beg to pay visit to sister husband be good creature must make house home to must not urge thing just now without giving special reason what be most of to be dreaded be raising of suspicion in sir christopher mind of what have happened in past of present feeling think so too dont tina mr gilfil paused again caterina said nothing be looking away from out of window hereyes be filling with tear rose advancing little towards held out hand said forgive caterina for intruding on feeling in way be so afraid might not be aware how miss assher watched remember entreat that peace of whole family depends on power of governing only say forgive before go dear good maynard said stretching out little hand taking two of large finger in grasp while tear flowed fast be very cross to heart be breaking dont know what do good bye stooped down kissed little hand then left room cursed scoundrel muttered between teeth a closed door behind if be not for sir christopher must like to pound into paste to poison puppy like chapter that evening captain wybrow returning from long ride with miss assher went up to dressing room seated with air of considerable lassitude before mirror reflection there presented of exquisite self be certainly paler more worn than usual might excuse anxiety with first felt pulse then laid hand on heart devil of position for man to be in be train of thought a kept eye fixed on glass while leaned back in chair crossed hand behind head between two jealous woman of a ready to take fire a tinder in state of health too must be glad enough to run away from whole affair go off to lotos eating place other where there be woman only woman who be too sleepy to be jealous here be doing nothing to please trying to do best thing for everybody else comfort get be to have fire shot at from woman eye venom spirted at from woman tongue if beatrice take jealous fit into head likely enough tina be so unmanageable dont know what storm may raise hitch in marriage especially of sort might be fatal business for old gentleman have blow fall upon for great deal besides man must be married time in life must hardly do better than marry beatrice shes uncommonly fine woman im really very fond of a will let have own way temper wont signify much wish wedding be over done with for fuss doesnt suit at havent be so well lately that scene about tina morning quite upset poor little tina what little simpleton be to set heart on in way ought to see how impossible be that thing must be different if must understand how kindly feel towards make up mind to look on a friend be what one never can get woman to do beatrice be very good natured im sure must be kind to little thing must be great comfort if tina must take to gilfil if be only in anger against hed make capital husband must like to see little grass hopper happy if have be in different position must certainly have married hut be out of question with responsibility to sir christopher think little persuasion from uncle must bring to accept gilfil know must never be able to oppose uncle wish if be once married shes such loving little thing must soon be billing cooing with a if have never known must certainly be best thing for happiness if marriage be hastened heigho be lucky fellow have woman falling in love with confounded responsibility at point in meditation turned head little so a to get three quarter view of face clearly be dono infelice della bellezza laid onerous duty upon idea naturally suggested that must ring for valet for next few day however there be such cessation of threatening symptom a to allay anxiety of captain wybrow mr gilfil earthly thing have lull even on night when most unappeasable wind be raging there will be moment of stillness before crash among bough again storm against window howl like thousand lost demon through keyhole miss assher appeared to be in highest good humour captain wybrow be more assiduous than usual be very circumspect in behaviour to caterina on whom miss assher bestowed unwonted attention weather be brilliant there be riding excursion in morning dinner party in evening consultation in library between sir christopher lady assher seemed to be leading to satisfactory result be understood that visit at cheverel manor must terminate in fortnight when preparation for wedding must be carried forward with despatch at farleigh baronet seemed day more radiant accustomed to view people who entered into plan by pleasant light own strong will bright hopefulness be always casting on future saw nothing hut personal charm promising domestic quality in miss assher whose quickness of eye taste in external formed real ground of sympathy between sir christopher lady cheverels enthusiasm never rose above temperate mark of calm satisfaction having quite share of critical acumen characterizes mutual estimate of fair sex have more moderate opinion of miss asshers quality suspected that fair beatrice have sharp imperious temper being on principle by habitual self command most deferential of wife noticed with disapproval miss asshers occasional air of authority towards captain wybrow proud woman who have learned to submit carry pride to reinforcement of submission look down with severe superiority on feminine assumption a unbecoming lady cheverel however confined criticism to privacy of own thought with reticence fear may seem incredible did not use a mean of disturbing husband complacency caterina how did pas sunny autumn day in sky seemed to be smiling on family gladness to change in miss asshers manner be unaccountable compassionate attention smiling condescension be torture to caterina who be constantly tempted to repulse with anger thought perhaps anthony have told to be kind to poor tina be insult ought to have known that mere presence of miss assher be painful to that miss asshers smile scorched that miss asshers kind word be like poison sting inflaming to madness anthony be evidently repenting of tenderness have be betrayed into morning in drawing room be cold distant civil to to ward off beatrice suspicion beatrice must be so gracious now because be sure of anthony entire devotion well so ought to be ought not to wish otherwise yet oh be cruel to must never have behaved so to to make love so to speak such tender word to give such caress then to behave a if such thing have never be have given poison seemed so sweet while be drinking now be in blood be helpless with tempest pent up in bosom poor child went up to room night there burst forth there with loud whisper sob restlessly pacing up down lying on hard floor courting cold weariness told to pitiful listening night anguish must pour into mortal ear always sleep came at last always in morning reactive calm enabled to live through day be amazing how long young frame will go on battling with sort of secret wretchedness yet show trace of conflict for sympathetic eye very delicacy of caterinas usual appearance natural paleness habitually quiet mouse like way made symptom of fatigue suffering le noticeable singing one thing in ceased to be passive became prominent lost none of energy sometimes wondered how be that whether felt sad angry crushed with sense of anthony indifference burning with impatience under miss asshers attention be always relief to to sing full deep note sent forth seemed to be lifting pain from heart seemed to be carrying away madness from brain thus lady cheverel noticed change in caterina be only mr gilfil who discerned with anxiety feverish spot sometimes rose on cheek deepening violet tint under eye strange absent glance unhealthy glitter of beautiful eye agitated night be producing more fatal effect than be represented by slight outward change chapter following sunday morning being rainy be determined that family must not go to cumbermoor church a usual mr gilfil who have only afternoon service at curacy must conduct morning service in chapel just before appointed hour of eleven caterina came down into drawing room looking so unusually ill a to call forth anxious inquiry from lady cheverel who on learning that have severe headache insisted that must not attend service at once packed up comfortably on sofa near fire putting volume of tillotsons sermon into hand a appropriate reading if caterina must feel equal to mean of edification excellent medicine for mind be good archbishop sermon medicine unhappily not suited to tinas case sat with book open on knee dark eye fixed vacantly on portrait of handsome lady cheverel wife of notable sir anthony gazed at picture without thinking of fair blonde dame seemed to look down on with benignant unconcern that mild wonder with happy self possessed woman be apt to look down on agitated weaker sister caterina be thinking of near future of wedding be so soon to come of must have to live through in next month wish must be very ill die before then thought when people get very ill dont mind about thing poor patty richards looked so happy when be in decline didnt seem to care more about lover that be engaged to be married to liked smell of flower so used to take o if must like anything if must think about anything else if dreadful feeling must go away wouldnt mind about not being happy wouldnt want anything must do what must please sir christopher lady cheverel when rage anger come into dont know what to do dont feel ground under only feel head heart beating seems a if must do something dreadful o wonder if one ever felt like before must be very wicked god will have pity on know have to bear in way time wore on till tina sound of voice along passage became conscious that volume of tillotson have slipped on floor have only just picked up seen with alarm that page be bent when lady assher beatrice captain wybrow entered with brisk cheerful air sermon be often observed to produce when be quite finished lady assher at once came seated by caterina ladyship have be considerably refreshed by doze be in great force for monologue well dear miss sarti how do feel now little better see thought must be sitting quietly here headache now be from weakness must not over exert must take bitter used to have just same sort of headache when be age old dr samson used to say to mother madam what daughter suffers from be weakness be such curious old man be dr samson wish must have heard sermon morning excellent sermon be about ten virgin five of be foolish five be clever know mr gilfil explained that what very pleasant young man be so very quiet agreeable such good hand at whist wish have at farleigh sir john must have liked beyond anything be so good tempered at card be such man for card be sir john rector be very irritable man cant bear to lose money at card dont think clergyman ought to mind about losing money do do now o pray lady assher interposed beatrice in usual tone of superiority weary poor caterina with such uninteresting question head seems very bad still dear continued in condoling tone to caterina do take vinaigrette keep in pocket will perhaps refresh now then thank answered caterina will not take away from indeed dear never use must take miss assher persisted holding close to tinas hand tina coloured deeply pushed vinaigrette away with impatience said thank never use thing dont like vinaigrette miss assher returned vinaigrette to pocket in surprise haughty silence captain wybrow who have looked on in alarm said hastily see be quite bright out of door now there be time for walk before luncheon come beatrice put on hat cloak let have hour walk on gravel yes do dear said lady assher will go see if sir christopher be having walk in gallery a soon a door have closed behind two lady captain wybrow standing with back to fire turned towards caterina said in tone of earnest remonstrance dear caterina let beg of to exercise more control over feeling be really rude to miss assher can see that be quite hurt consider how strange behaviour must appear to will wonder what can be cause of come dear tina added approaching attempting to take hand for own sake let entreat to receive attention politely really feel very kindly towards must be so happy to see friend caterina be already in such state of diseased susceptibility that most innocent word from captain wybrow must have be irritating to a whirr of most delicate wing will afflict nervous patient tone of benevolent remonstrance be intolerable have inflicted great unrepented injury on now assumed air of benevolence towards be new outrage profession of goodwill be insolence caterina snatched away hand said indignantly leave to myself captain wybrow disturb caterina why will be so violent so unjust to be for that feel anxious miss assher have already noticed how strange behaviour be to put into very difficult position what can say to say caterina burst forth with intense bitterness rising moving towards door say that be poor silly girl have fallen in love with be jealous of that have never have feeling pity for have never behaved with anything more than friendliness to tell will think better of tina uttered a bitterest sarcasm idea must furnish with not having faintest suspicion that sarcasm derived of bitterness from truth underneath sense of wrong be rather instinctive than reflective underneath madness of jealousy ungovernable impulse of resentment vindictiveness underneath scorching passion there be still left hidden crystal dew of trust of self reproof of belief that anthony be trying to do right love have not all gone to feed fire of hatred tina still trusted that anthony felt more for than seemed to feel be still far from suspecting of wrong woman resents even more than inconstancy threw out taunt simply a most intense expression must find for anger of moment a stood nearly in middle of room little body trembling under shock of passion too strong for very lip pale eye gleaming door opened miss assher appeared tall blooming splendid in walking costume a entered face wore smile appropriate to exit entrance of young lady who feel that presence be interesting fact next moment looked at caterina with grave surprise then threw glance of angry suspicion at captain wybrow who wore air of weariness vexation perhaps be too much engaged to walk out captain wybrow will go alone be coming answered hurrying towards leading out of room leaving poor caterina to feel reaction of shame reproach after outburst of passion chapter pray what be likely to be next scene in drama between miss sarti said miss assher to captain wybrow a soon a be out on gravel must be agreeable to have idea of what be coming captain wybrow be silent felt out of humour wearied annoyed there come moment when one almost determines never again to oppose anything dead silence to angry woman now then confound said to im going to be battered on other flank looked resolutely at horizon with something more like frown on face than beatrice have ever seen there after pause of two three minute continued in still haughtier tone suppose be aware captain wybrow expect explanation of what have just seen have explanation dear beatrice answered at last making strong effort over except what have already given hoped must never recur to subject explanation however be very far from satisfactory can only say that air miss sarti think entitled to put on towards be quite incompatible with position a regard behaviour to be most insulting will certainly not stay in house under such circumstance mamma must state reason to sir christopher beatrice said captain wybrow irritation giving way to alarm beseech to be patient exercise good feeling in affair be very painful know be sure must be grieved to injure poor caterina to bring down uncle anger upon consider what poor little dependent thing be be very adroit of to make evasion suppose that deceive miss sarti must never dare to behave to a doe if have not flirted with made love to suppose considers engagement to breach of faith to be much obliged to certainly for making miss sartis rival have told falsehood captain wybrow beatrice solemnly declare to that caterina be nothing more to than girl naturally feel kindly to a favourite of uncle nice little thing enough must be glad to see married to gilfil to morrow thats good proof im not in love with must think a to past may have shown little attention have exaggerated misinterpreted what man be not liable to sort of thing what can found behaviour on what have be saying to morning to make tremble turn pale in way o dont know just said something about behaving peevishly with italian blood of hers there knowing how may take what one say shes fierce little thing though seems so quiet generally ought to be made to know how unbecoming indelicate conduct be for part wonder lady cheverel have not noticed short answer air put on let beg of beatrice not to hint anything of kind to lady cheverel must have observed how strict aunt be never enters head that girl can be in love with man who have not made offer well will let miss sarti know have observed conduct will be only charity to nay dear will be doing nothing harm caterinas temper be peculiar best thing can do will be to leave to herself a much a possible will wear off ive doubt shell be married to gilfil before long girl fancy be easily diverted from one object to by jove what rate heart be galloping at confounded palpitation get worse instead of better thus ended conversation so far a concerned caterina not without leaving distinct resolution in captain wybrows mind resolution carried into effect next day when be in library with sir christopher for purpose of discussing arrangement about approaching marriage by by said carelessly when business came to pause be sauntering round room with hand in coat pocket surveying back of book lined wall when be wedding between gilfil caterina to come off sir ive fellow feeling for poor devil so many fathom deep in love a maynard why shouldnt marriage happen a soon a ours suppose have come to understanding with tina why said sir christopher did think of letting thing be until old crichley died cant hold out very long poor fellow then maynard might have entered into matrimony rectory at once after really be good reason for waiting there be need for to leave manor when be married little monkey be quite old enough must be pretty to see matron with baby about size of kitten in arm think that system of waiting be always bad if can further settlement must like to make on caterina will be delighted to carry out wish dear boy thats very good of maynard will have enough from what know of know well think must rather provide for caterina however now have put matter into head begin to blame for not having thought of before ive be so wrapt up in beatrice rascal have really forgotten poor maynard he older than high time be settled in life a family man sir christopher paused took snuff in meditative manner presently said more to than to anthony who be humming tune at far end of room yes yes will be capital plan to finish off family business at once riding out with miss assher same morning captain wybrow mentioned to incidentally that sir christopher be anxious to bring about wedding between gilfil caterina a soon a possible that for part must do must to further affair must be best thing in world for tina in whose welfare be really interested with sir christopher there be never long interval between purpose execution made up mind promptly acted promptly on rising from luncheon said to mr gilfil come with into library maynard want to have word with maynard boy began a soon a be seated tapping snuff box looking radiant at idea of unexpected pleasure be about to give why shouldnt have two happy couple instead of one before autumn be over eh eh repeated after moment pause lengthening out monosyllable taking slow pinch looking up at maynard with sly smile im not quite sure that understand sir answered mr gilfil who felt annoyed at consciousness that be turning pale not understand rogue know very well whose happiness lie nearest to heart after anthony know let into secret long ago so there confession to make tinas quite old enough to be grave little wife now though rectory not ready for thats matter lady will feel more comfortable for having with must miss little singing bird if lost at once mr gilfil felt in painfully difficult position dreaded that sir christopher must surmise discover true state of caterinas feeling yet be obliged to make feeling ground of reply dear sir at last said with effort will not suppose that be not alive to goodness that be not grateful for fatherly interest in happiness fear that caterinas feeling towards be not such a to warrant hope that must accept proposal of marriage from have ever asked sir often know thing too well without asking pooh pooh little monkey must love why be first playfellow remember used to cry if cut finger besides have always silently admitted that be lover know have always spoken of to in light took for granted have settled business between yourselves so did anthony anthony think shes in love with have young eye be apt enough to see clearly in matter be talking to about morning pleased very much by friendly interest showed in tina blood more than be wanted rushed back to mr gilfils face set teeth clenched hand in effort to repress burst of indignation sir christopher noticed flush thought indicated fluctuation of hope fear about caterina went on youre too modest by half maynard fellow who can take five barred gate a can ought not to be so faint hearted if cant speak to leave to talk to sir christopher said poor maynard earnestly will really feel greatest kindness can possibly show not to mention subject to caterina at present think proposal made prematurely might only alienate from sir christopher be getting little displeased at contradiction tone became little sharper a said have ground to state for opinion beyond general notion that tina be not enough in love with can state none beyond own very strong impression that doe not love well enough to marry then think that ground be worth nothing at be tolerably correct in judgement of people if be not very much deceived in tina look forward to nothing else to being husband leave to manage matter a think best may rely on that will do harm to cause maynard mr gilfil afraid to say more yet wretched in prospect of what might result from sir christopher determination quitted library in state of mingled indignation against captain wybrow distress for caterina what must think of might suppose that have instigated sanctioned sir christopher proceeding must perhaps not have opportunity of speaking to on subject in time must write note carry up to room after dressing bell have rung no must agitate unfit for appearing at dinner passing evening calmly must defer till bed time after prayer contrived to lead back to drawing room to put letter in hand carried up to own room wondering there read dear caterina suspect for moment that anything sir christopher may say to about marriage have be prompted by have done dare do to dissuade from urging subject have only be prevented from speaking more strongly by dread of provoking question must not answer without causing fresh misery write to prepare for anything sir christopher may say to assure hope already believe that feeling be sacred to must rather part with dearest hope of life than be mean of adding to trouble be captain wybrow who have prompted sir christopher to take up subject at moment tell to save from hearing suddenly when be with sir christopher see now what sort of stuff that dastard heart be made of trust in always dearest caterina a may come faithful friend brother maynard gilfil caterina be at first too terribly stung by word about captain wybrow to think of difficulty threatened to think of what sir christopher must say to of what must say in reply bitter sense of injury fierce resentment left room for fear with poisoned garment upon victim writhes under torture have thought of coming death anthony must do of there must be explanation coolest contempt for feeling basest sacrifice of consideration tenderness owed to ease of position with miss assher no be worse than that be deliberate gratuitous cruelty wanted to show how despised wanted to make feel folly in having ever believed that loved last crystal drop of trust tenderness thought be dried up be parched fiery hatred now need no longer check resentment by fear of doing injustice have trifled with a maynard have said have be reckless of now be base cruel have cause enough for bitterness anger be not so wicked a have seemed to a thought be hurrying after other like so many sharp throb of fevered pain shed tear paced restlessly to fro a habit be hand clenched eye gleaming fiercely wandering uneasily a if in search of something on might throw like tigress if must speak to whispered tell hate despise loathe suddenly a if new thought have struck drew key from pocket unlocking inlaid desk where stored up keepsake took from small miniature be in very slight gold frame with ring to a if intended to be worn on chain under glass at back be two lock of hair one dark other auburn arranged in fantastic knot be anthony secret present to year ago copy have have made specially for for last month have not taken from hiding place there be need to heighten vividness of past now clutched fiercely dashed across room against bare hearth stone will crush under foot grind under high heeled shoe till trace of false cruel feature be gone ah rushed across room when saw little treasure have cherished so fondly so often smothered with kiss so often laid under pillow remembered with first return of consciousness in morning when saw one visible relic of too happy past lying with glass shivered hair fallen out thin ivory cracked there be revulsion of overstrained feeling relenting came burst into tear look at stooping down to gather up treasure searching for hair replacing then mournfully examining crack disfigures once loved image ala there be glass now to guard hair portrait see how carefully wrap delicate paper round lock up again in old place poor child god send relenting may always come before worst irrevocable deed action have quieted sat down to read maynards letter again read two three time without seeming to take in sense apprehension be dulled by passion of last hour found difficult to call up idea suggested by word at last began to have distinct conception of impending interview with sir christopher idea of displeasing baronet of whom one at manor stood in awe frightened so much that thought must be impossible to resist wish believed that loved maynard have always spoken a if be quite sure of how must tell be deceived what if be to ask whether loved anybody else to have sir christopher looking angrily at be more than must bear even in imagination have always be so good to then began to think of pain might give more selfish distress of fear gave way to distress of affection unselfish tear began to flow sorrowful gratitude to sir christopher helped to awaken sensibility to mr gilfils tenderness generosity dear good maynard what poor return make if must have loved instead can never love care for anything again heart be broken chapter next morning dreaded moment came caterina stupified by suffering of previous night with dull mental aching follows on acute anguish be in lady cheverels

monkey go lie down get to sleep caterina slipped from stool on to knee took old baronet hand covered with tear kiss then ran out of room before evening captain wybrow have heard from uncle result of interview with caterina thought if must have long quiet talk with must perhaps persuade to look more reasonably at thing there speaking to in house without being interrupted can hardly see anywhere else without beatrice finding out at last determined to make matter of confidence with miss assher to tell that wished to talk to caterina quietly for sake of bringing to calmer state of mind persuade to listen to gilfils affection be very much pleased with judicious candid plan in course of evening have arranged with time place of meeting have communicated purpose to miss assher who gave entire approval anthony thought must do well to speak plainly seriously to miss sarti be really very patient kind to considering how behaved tina have kept room day have be carefully tended a invalid sir christopher having told ladyship how matter stood tendance be so irksome to caterina felt so uneasy under attention kindness be based on misconception that exerted to appear at breakfast next morning declared well though head heart be throbbing to be confined in own room be intolerable be wretched enough to be looked at spoken to be more wretched to be left alone be frightened at own sensation be frightened at imperious vividness with picture of past future thrust on imagination there be feeling too made want to be down stair moving about perhaps might have opportunity of speaking to captain wybrow alone of speaking word of hatred scorn burned on tongue that opportunity offered in very unexpected manner lady cheverel having sent caterina out of drawing room to fetch pattern of embroidery from sitting room captain wybrow presently walked out after met a be returning down stair caterina said laying hand on arm a be hurrying on without looking at will meet in rookery at twelve oclock must speak to will be in privacy there can not speak to in house to surprise there be flash of pleasure across face answered shortly decidedly yes then snatched arm away from passed down stair miss assher be morning busy winding silk being bent on emulating lady cheverels embroidery lady assher chose passive amusement of holding skein lady cheverel have now all working apparatus about caterina thinking be not wanted went away sat down to harpsichord in sitting room seemed a if playing massive chord bringing out volume of sound must be easiest way of passing long feverish moment before twelve oclock handel messiah stood open on desk at chorus like sheep caterina threw at once into impetuous intricacy of magnificent fugue in happiest moment must never have played so well for now passion that made misery be hurled by convulsive effort into music just a pain give new force to clutch of sinking wrestler a terror give farsounding intensity to shriek of feeble at half past eleven be interrupted by lady cheverel who said tina go down will hold miss asshers silk for lady assher have decided on having drive before luncheon caterina went down wondering how must escape from drawing room in time to be in rookery at twelve nothing must prevent from going nothing must rob of one precious moment perhaps last when must speak out thought be in after must be passive must bear anything have scarcely sat down with skein of yellow silk on hand when miss assher said graciously know have engagement with captain wybrow morning must not let detain beyond time so have be talking to about thought caterina hand began to tremble a held skein miss assher continued in same gracious tone be tedious work holding skein be sure be very much obliged to be not obliged to said caterina completely mastered by irritation have only done because lady cheverel told moment be come when miss assher must no longer suppress long latent desire to let miss sarti know impropriety of conduct with malicious anger assumes tone of compassion said miss sarti be really sorry for that be not able to control better giving way to unwarrantable feeling be lowering be indeed what unwarrantable feeling said caterina letting hand fall fixing great dark eye steadily on miss assher be quite unnecessary for to say more must be conscious what mean only summon sense of duty to aid be paining captain wybrow extremely by want of self control did tell pained yes indeed did be very much hurt that must behave to a if have sort of enmity towards must like to make friend of assure feel very kindly towards be sorry must cherish such feeling be very good said caterina bitterly what feeling did say cherished bitter tone increased miss asshers irritation there be still lurking suspicion in mind though must not admit to herself captain wybrow have told falsehood about conduct feeling towards caterina be suspicion more even than anger of moment urged to say something must test truth of statement that must be humiliating caterina at same time be only additional temptation be thing like to talk of miss sarti can not even understand how woman can indulge passion for man who have never given least ground for a captain wybrow assures be case told that did said caterina in clear low tone lip turning white a rose from chair yes indeed did be bound to tell after strange behaviour caterina said nothing turned round suddenly left room see how rush noiselessly like pale meteor along passage up gallery stair gleaming eye bloodless lip swift silent tread make look like incarnation of fierce purpose

gilfil be bending to raise caterina in arm a lifted from ground felt something hard heavy in pocket what must be weight of must be enough to hurt a lay carried to sofa put hand in pocket drew forth dagger maynard shuddered did mean to kill then horrible suspicion forced upon dead in rookery hated for thought prompted to draw dagger from sheath there be trace of blood be ready to kiss good steel for innocence thrust weapon into own pocket must restore a soon a possible to well known place in gallery yet why have caterina taken dagger what be have happened in rookery be only delirious vision of hers be afraid to ring afraid to summon one to caterinas assistance what might not say when awoke from fainting fit might be raving must not leave yet felt a if be guilty for not following sir christopher to see what be truth took moment to think feel moment seemed long agony to that began to reproach for letting pas without seeking mean of reviving caterina happily decanter of water on sir christopher table be untouched must at least try effect of throwing that water over might revive without needing to call one else meanwhile sir christopher be hurrying at utmost speed towards rookery face so lately bright confident now agitated by vague dread deep alarmed bark of rupert who ran by side have struck ear of mr bates then on way homeward a something unwonted hastening in direction of sound met baronet just a be approaching entrance of rookery sir christopher look be enough mr bates said nothing hurried along by side while rupert dashed forward among dead leaf with nose to ground have scarcely lost sight of minute when change in tone of bark told that have found something in instant be leaping back over one of large planted mound turned aside to ascend mound rupert leading tumultuous cawing of rook very rustling of leaf a foot plunged among falling like evil omen on baronet ear have reached summit of mound have begun to descend sir christopher saw something purple down on path below among yellow leaf rupert be already beside sir christopher must not move faster tremor have taken hold of firm limb rupert came back licked trembling hand a if to say courage then be down again snuffing body yes be body anthony body there be white hand with diamond ring clutching dark leaf eye be half open did not heed gleam of sunlight darted directly on from between bough still

tremulous inquiring touch for symptom that life be not irrevocably gone rupert be there too waiting watching licking first dead then living hand then running off on mr batess track a if must follow hasten return in moment turning back again unable to quit scene of master sorrow chapter be wonderful moment first time stand by one who have fainted witness fresh birth of consciousness spreading over blank feature like rising sunlight on alpine summit that lay ghastly dead under leaden twilight slight shudder frost bound eye recover liquid light for instant show inward semi consciousness of infant then with little start open wider begin to look present be visible only a strange writing interpreter memory be not yet there mr gilfil felt trembling joy a change passed over caterinas face bent over rubbing chill hand looking at with tender pity a dark eye opened on wonderingly thought there might be wine in dining room close by left room caterinas eye turned towards window towards sir christopher chair there be link at chain of consciousness have snapped event of morning be beginning to recur dimly like half remembered dream when maynard returned with wine raised drank still be silent seeming lost in attempt to recover past when door opened mr warren appeared with look announced terrible tidings mr gilfil dreading lest must tell in caterinas presence hurried towards with finger on lip drew away into dining room on opposite side of passage caterina revived by stimulant be now recovering full consciousness of scene in rookery anthony be lying there dead have left to tell sir christopher must go see what be doing with perhaps be not really dead only in trance people did fall into trance sometimes while mr gilfil be telling warren how must be best to break news to lady cheverel miss assher anxious to return to caterina poor child have made way feebly to great entrance door stood open strength increased a moved breathed fresh air with increase of strength came increased vividness of emotion increased yearning to be where thought be in rookery with anthony walked more more swiftly at last gathering artificial strength of passionate excitement began to run now heard tread of heavy step under yellow shade near wooden bridge saw men slowly carrying something soon be face to face with anthony be longer in rookery be carrying stretched on door there behind be sir christopher with firmly set deathly paleness concentrated expression of suffering in eye mark suppressed grief of strong man sight of face on caterina have never before beheld sign of anguish caused rush of new feeling for moment submerged rest went gently up to put little hand in walked in silence by side sir christopher must not tell to leave so went on with sad procession to mr batess cottage in mosslands sat there in silence waiting watching to know if anthony be really dead have not yet missed dagger from pocket have not yet even thought of at sight of anthony lying dead nature have rebounded from new bias of resentment hatred to old sweet habit of love earliest longest have still mastery over only past that linked with glazed unconscious eye be past when beamed on with tenderness forgot interval of wrong jealousy hatred cruelty thought of revenge a exile forgets stormy passage lay between home happiness dreary land in find desolate chapter before night hope be gone dr hart have said be death anthony body have be carried to house one there knew calamity have fallen on caterina have be questioned by dr hart have answered briefly that found anthony lying in rookery that must have be walking there just at time be not coincidence to raise conjecture in one besides mr gilfil except in answering question have not broken silence sat mute in corner of gardener kitchen shaking head when maynard entreated to return with apparently unable to think of anything possibility that anthony might revive until saw carrying away body to house then followed by sir christopher side again so quietly that even dr hart did not object to presence be decided to lay body in library until after coroner inquest to morrow when caterina saw door finally closed turned up gallery stair on way to own room place where felt at home with sorrow be first time have be in gallery since terrible moment in morning now spot object around began to reawaken half stunned memory armour be no longer glittering in sunlight there hung dead sombre above cabinet from have taken dagger yes now came back to wretchedness sin where be dagger now felt in pocket be not there must have be fancy about dagger looked in cabinet be not there ala must not have be fancy be guilty of wickedness where must dagger be now must have fallen out of pocket heard step ascending stair hurried on to room where kneeling by bed burying face to shut out hateful light tried to recall feeling incident of morning came back everything anthony have done everything have felt for last month for many month ever since june evening when have last spoken to in gallery looked back on storm of passion jealousy hatred of miss assher thought of revenge on anthony o how wicked have be be who have be sinning be who have driven to do say thing have made so angry if have wronged what have be on verge of doing to be too wicked ever to be pardoned must like to confess how wicked have be that might punish must like to humble to dust before one before miss assher even sir christopher must send away must never see again if knew must be happier to be punished frowned on than to be treated tenderly while have that guilty secret in breast then if sir christopher be to know must add to sorrow make more wretched than ever must not confess must have to tell about anthony must not stay at manor must go away must not bear sir christopher eye must not bear sight of thing reminded of anthony of sin perhaps must die soon felt very feeble there must not be much life in must go away live humbly pray to god to pardon let die poor child never thought of suicide sooner be storm of anger passed than tenderness timidity of nature returned must hing love mourn inexperience prevented from imagining consequence of disappearance from manor foresaw none of terrible detail of alarm distress search must ensue will think be dead said to herself by by will forget maynard will get happy again love one else be roused from absorption by knock at door mr bellamy be there have come by mr gilfils request to see how miss sarti be to bring food wine look sadly dear said old housekeeper youre of quake wi cold get to bed

might put in pocket whole mind be now bent on going away from manor be thinking of way mean little life experience must suggest be dusk now must wait till early dawn for be too timid to go away in dark must make escape before one be up in house there must be people watching anthony in library must make way out of small door leading into garden against drawing room on other side of house laid cloak bonnet veil ready then lighted candle opened desk took out broken portrait wrapped in paper folded again in two little note of anthony written in pencil placed in bosom there be little china box too dorcass present pearl earring silk purse with fifteen seven shilling piece in present sir christopher have made on birthday ever since have be at manor must take earring seven shilling piece must not bear to part with seemed a if have of sir christopher love in must like to be buried with fastened little round earring in ear put purse with dorcass box in pocket have purse there took out to count money for must never spend seven shilling piece have guinea eight shilling must be plenty so now sat down to wait for morning afraid to lay on bed lest must sleep too long if must see anthony once more kiss cold forehead must not be did not deserve must go away from away from sir christopher lady cheverel maynard everybody who have be kind to thought good while be so wicked chapter of mr sharp earliest thought next morning be given to caterina whom have not be able to visit evening before whom from nearly equal mixture of affection self importance did not at like resigning to mr bellamys care at half past eight oclock went up to tinas room bent on benevolent dictation a to dos diet lying in bed on opening door found bed smooth empty evidently have not be slept in what must mean have sat up night be gone out to walk poor thing head might be touched by what have happened yesterday be such shock finding captain wybrow in way be perhaps gone out of mind mr sharp looked anxiously in place where tina kept hat cloak be not there so that have have at least presence of mind to put on still good woman felt greatly alarmed hastened away to tell mr gilfil who knew be in study mr gilfil said a soon a have closed door behind mind misgives dreadful about miss sarti what be said poor maynard with horrible fear that caterina have betrayed something about dagger shes not in room bed not be slept in night hat cloak gone for minute two mr gilfil be unable to speak felt sure worst have come caterina have destroyed strong man suddenly looked so ill helpless that mr sharp began to be frightened at effect of abruptness o sir im grieved to heart to shock so didnt know who else to go to be quite right gathered strength from very despair be over have nothing now to do to suffer to help suffering went on in firmer voice be sure not to breathe word about to one must not alarm lady cheverel sir christopher miss sarti may be only walking in garden be terribly excited by what saw yesterday perhaps be unable to lie down from restlessness just go quietly through empty room see whether be in house will go look for in ground went down to avoid giving alarm in house walked at once towards mosslands in search of mr bates whom met returning from breakfast to gardener confided fear about caterina assigning a reason for fear probability that shock have undergone yesterday have unhinged mind begging to send men in search of through garden park inquire if have be seen at lodge if be not found heard of in way to lose time in dragging water round manor god forbid must be so bates will be easier for having searched everywhere troost to mae troost to mae mr gilfil eh id have worked for day wage rest o life rether than anythin must have happened to good gardener in deep distress strode away to stable that might send groom on horseback through park mr gilfils next thought be to search rookery might be haunting scene of captain wybrows death went hastily over mound looked round large tree followed winding of walk in reality have little hope of finding there bare possibility fenced off for time fatal conviction that caterinas body must be found in water when rookery have be searched in vain walked fast to border of little stream bounded one side of ground stream be almost everywhere hidden among tree there be one place where be broader deeper than elsewhere must be more likely to come to spot than to pool hurried along with strained eye imagination continually creating what dreaded to see there be something white behind overhanging bough knee tremble under seems to see part of dress caught on branch dear dead face upturned o god give strength to thy creature on whom thou hast laid great agony be nearly up to bough white object be moving be waterfowl spread wing fly away screaming hardly know whether be relief disappointment that be not there conviction that be dead press cold weight upon none le heavily a reached great pool in front of manor saw mr bates with group of men already there preparing for dreadful search must only displace vague despair by definite horror for gardener in restless anxiety have be unable to defer until other mean of search have proved vain pool be not now laughing with sparkle among water lily looked black cruel under sombre sky a if cold depth held relentlessly murdered hope joy of maynard gilfils life thought of sad consequence for others a well a be crowding on mind blind shutter be closed in front of manor be not likely that sir christopher must be aware of anything be passing outside mr gilfil felt that caterinas disappearance must not long be concealed from coroner inquest must be held shortly must be inquired for then must be inevitable that baronet must know chapter at twelve oclock when search inquiry have be in vain coroner be expected moment mr gilfil must no longer defer hard duty of revealing fresh calamity to sir christopher who must otherwise have discovered to abruptly baronet be seated in dressing room where dark window curtain be drawn so a to admit only sombre light be first time mr gilfil have have interview with morning be struck to see how single day night of grief have aged fine old man line in brow about mouth be deepened complexion looked dull withered there be swollen ridge under eye eye used to cast so keen glance on present have vacant expression tell that vision be no longer sense memory held out hand to maynard who pressed sat down beside in silence sir christopher heart began to swell at unspoken sympathy tear must rise must roll in great drop down cheek first tear have shed since boyhood be for anthony maynard felt a if tongue be glued to roof of mouth must not speak first must wait until sir christopher said something might lead on to cruel word must be spoken at last baronet mastered enough to say im very weak maynard god help didnt think anything must unman in way id built everything on lad perhaps ive be wrong in not forgiving sister lost one of son little while ago ive be too proud obstinate can hardly learn humility tenderness enough except by suffering said maynard god see be in need of suffering for be falling more more heavily on have new trouble morning tina said sir christopher looking up anxiously be tina ill be in dreadful uncertainty about be very much agitated yesterday with delicate health be afraid to think what turn agitation may have taken be delirious poor dear little one god only know how be be unable to find when mr sharp went up to room morning be empty have not be in bed hat cloak be gone have have search made for everywhere in house garden in park in water one have seen since martha went up to light fire at seven oclock in evening while mr gilfil be speaking sir christopher eye be eagerly turned on recovered of old keenness sudden painful emotion a at new thought flitted rapidly across already agitated face like shadow of dark cloud over wave when pause came laid hand on mr gilfils arm said in lower voice maynard did that poor thing love anthony did maynard hesitated after word struggling between reluctance to inflict yet deeper wound on sir christopher determination that injustice must be done to caterina sir christopher eye be still fixed on in solemn inquiry own sunk towards ground while tried to find word must tell truth least cruelly must not have wrong thought about tina said at length must tell now for sake what nothing must ever have caused to pas lip captain wybrow won affection by attention in position be bound not to show before marriage be talked of have behaved to like lover sir christopher relaxed hold of maynards arm looked away from be silent for minute evidently attempting to master so a to be able to speak calmly must see henrietta immediately said at last with something of old sharp decision must know must keep from one else a far a possible dear boy continued in kinder tone heaviest burthen have fallen on may find yet must not despair there have not be time enough for to be certain poor dear little one god help thought saw everything be stone blind while chapter sad slow week be gone by at last at coroner inquest verdict of sudden death have be pronounced dr hart acquainted with captain wybrows previous state of health have given opinion that death have be imminent from long established disease of heart though have probably be accelerated by unusual emotion miss assher be only person who positively knew motive have led captain wybrow to rookery have not mentioned caterinas name painful detail inquiry be studiously kept from mr gilfil sir christopher however knew enough to conjecture that fatal agitation be due to appointed meeting with caterina search inquiry after have be fruitless be more likely to be so because be carried on under prepossession that have committed suicide one noticed absence of trifle have taken from desk one knew of likeness that have hoarded seven shilling piece be not remarkable that must have happened to be wearing pearl earring have left house thought taking nothing with seemed impossible must have gone far must have be in state of mental excitement made too probable have only gone to seek relief in death same place within three four mile of manor be searched again again pond ditch in neighbourhood be examined sometimes maynard thought that death might have come on unsought from cold exhaustion not day passed wandered through neighbouring wood turning up heap of dead leaf a if be possible dear body must be hidden there then horrible thought recurred before night came have be again through uninhabited room of house to satisfy once more that be not hidden behind cabinet door curtain that must not find there with madness in eye looking looking yet not seeing at last five long day night be at end funeral be over carriage be returning through park when have set out heavy rain be falling now cloud be breaking up gleam of sunshine be sparkling among dripping bough under be passing gleam fell upon man on horseback who be jogging slowly along whom mr gilfil recognized in spite of diminished rotundity a daniel knott coachman who have married rosy cheeked dorcas ten year before new incident suggested same thought to mr gilfil eye sooner fell on knott than said to can be come to tell anything about caterina then remembered that caterina have be very fond of dorcas that always have present ready to send when knott paid occasional visit to manor must tina have gone to dorcas heart sank again a thought very likely knott have only come because have heard of captain wybrows death wanted to know how old master have borne blow a soon a carriage reached house went up to study walked about nervously longing afraid to go down speak to knott lest faint hope must be dissipated one looking at face usually so full of calm goodwill must have seen that last week suffering have left deep trace by day have be riding wandering incessantly searching for caterina directing inquiry to be made by others by night have not known sleep only intermittent dozing in seemed to be finding caterina dead woke up with start from unreal agony to real anguish of believing that must see more clear grey eye looked sunken restless full careless lip have strange tension about brow formerly so smooth open be contracted a if with pain have not lost object of few month passion have lost being who be bound up with power of loving a brook played by flower gathered in childhood be bound up with sense of beauty love meant nothing for to love caterina for year thought of have be present in everything like air light now be gone seemed a if pleasure have lost vehicle sky earth daily ride daily talk might be there loveliness joy be in have gone for ever presently a still paced backwards forward heard step along corridor there be knock at door voice trembled a said come in rush of renewed hope be hardly distinguishable from pain when saw warren enter with daniel knott behind knott be come sir with news of miss sarti thought best to bring to first mr gilfil must not help going up to old coachman wringing hand be unable to speak only motioned to to take chair while warren left room hung upon daniel moon face listened to small piping voice with same solemn yearning expectation with must have given ear to most awful messenger from

well bred virtuous excess of stupidity though lady be still said sometimes to take too much upon be never known to take too much in other way conversation be sometimes quite literary for there be flourishing book club many of younger lady have carried study so far a to have forgotten little german in short milby be now refined moral enlightened town no more resembling milby of former day than huge long skirted drab greatcoat embarrassed ankle of grandfather resembled light paletot in tread jauntily through muddiest street than bottle nosed briton rejoicing over tankard in old sign of two

lounging at mr grubys door embarrassing servant maid who came for grocery talking scandal with rare passer by still be generally understood that mr lowme belonged to highest circle of milby society son daughter held up head very high indeed in spite of condescending way of chatting drinking with inferior people must have scorned closer identification with must be admitted that be of service to town in station at mr grubys door for mr landors newfoundland dog who stretched gaped on opposite causeway took something from lifeless air belonged to high street on day except saturday certainly in spite of three assembly charity ball in winter occasional advent of ventriloquist company of itinerant player of whom be very highly thought of in london annual three day fair in june milby might be considered dull by people of hypochondriacal temperament perhaps be one reason why many of middle aged inhabitant male female often found impossible to keep up spirit without very abundant supply of stimulant be true there be several substantial men who have reputation for exceptional sobriety so milby habit be really not a bad a possible one be warranted in saying that old mr crewes flock must not have be worse without clergyman at well dressed parishioner generally be very regular church goer to younger lady gentleman be inclined to think that sunday morning service be most exciting event

feather beauty be considered of coarse order square form be quite unsuited to round tippet fell with such remarkable grace on miss landors sloping shoulder looking at plumed procession of lady must have formed rather high idea of milby wealth yet there be only one close carriage in place be old mr landors banker who think never drove more than one horse sumptuously attired lady flashed past

severest attention to shirt stud particular shade of brown be best relieved by gilt button respect for sabbath manifested in attention to costume be unhappily counterbalanced by considerable levity of behaviour during prayer sermon for young lady gentleman of milby be of very satirical turn miss landor especially being considered remarkably clever terrible quiz large congregation necessarily containing many person inferior in dress demeanour to distinguished aristocratic minority divine service offered irresistible temptation to joking through medium of telegraphic communication from gallery to aisle back again remember blushing very much thinking miss landor be laughing at because be appearing in coat tail for first time when saw look down slyly towards where sat then turn with

to make drink something to blunt feeling child either to keep from might do same if be in place speak for mr pettifer said miss pratt under circumstance can imagine resorting to practice so degrading woman must find support in own strength of mind think said rebecca who considered miss pratt still very blind in spiritual thing notwithstanding assumption of enlightenment will find poor support if trust only to own strength must seek aid elsewhere than in happily removal of tea thing just then created little confusion aided miss pratt to repress resentment at rebecca presumption in correcting person like rebecca linnet who six month ago be a flighty vain woman a miss pratt have ever known so very unconscious of unfortunate person lady have scarcely be seated at work hour when sun be

indolent resolute conscious dreamy except that well filled lip have something of artificially compressed look be often sign of struggle to keep dragon undermost that complexion be rather pallid giving idea of imperfect health mr tryans face in repose be that of ordinary whiskerless blond seemed difficult to refer certain air of distinction about to anything in particular unless be delicate hand well shapen foot be great anomaly to milby mind that canting evangelical parson who must take tea with tradespeople make friend of vulgar woman like linnet must have so much air of gentleman be so little like splay footed mr stickney of salem to whom approximated so closely in doctrine want of correspondence between physique creed have excited no le surprise in larger town of laxeter where mr

gentleman seminary constitute most subtle delicate form of innuendo id never be tryanite must o here come lady know so much more about religion than do people think so very pious be really surprising that young lady must not be thought competent to same curriculum a young gentleman observe that power of sarcasm be quite equal if there have be genteel academy for young gentleman at milby be inclined to think that notwithstanding euclid classic party spirit there must not have exhibited in more pungent irony more incisive satire than be heard in miss townleys seminary there be such

till church time mother leaned back in chair when janet be gone sank into painful reverie when life be continuous trial moment of respite seem only to substitute heaviness of dread for heaviness of actual suffering curtain of cloud seems parted instant only that may measure horror a hang low black imminent in contrast with transient brightness water drop that visit parched lip in desert bear with only keen imagination of thirst janet looked glad tender now what scene of misery be coming next be too like cistus flower in little garden before window with shade of evening might lie with delicate white glossy dark of petal trampled in roadside dust when sun have sunk twilight be deepening janet might be sitting there heated maddened sobbing out grief with selfish passion wildly

read bible great deal thought found divine lesson there how to bear cross meekly be merciful let hope that there be saving ignorance that mr raynor be justified without knowing exactly how tried to have hope trust though be hard to believe that future must be anything else than harvest of seed be being sown before eye always there be seed being sown silently unseen everywhere there come sweet flower without foresight labour reap what sow nature have love over above justice give shadow blossom fruit that spring from planting of ours chapter most people must have agreed with mr raynor that confirmation that day be pretty sight at least when slight girlish form fair young face moved in white rivulet along aisle flowed into kneeling semicircle under light of great chancel window softened by patch of dark old painted glass one must think that to look on while pair of venerable hand pressed such young head venerable face looked upward for blessing on must be very likely to make heart swell gently to moisten eye yet remember eye seemed very dry in milby church that day notwithstanding that bishop be old man probably venerable for though be not eminent grecian be brother of whig lord think eye must have remained dry because have small delicate womanish hand adorned with ruffle instead of laying on girl head just let hover over in quick succession a if be not etiquette to touch a if laying on of hand be like theatrical embrace part of play not to be really believed in to be sure there be great many head bishop time be limited moreover wig can under circumstance be

have spoon in hand ready to gather crumb into plate that might scatter on gravel for little bird before time bishop carriage have be seen driving through high street on way to lord truffords where be

with must have difficulty in inferring ground note of mr jerome character to fine ear that tone said a plainly a possible recommends to thomas jerome a piety goodness will have love honour ah friend pleasant world be sad one too isnt let help one let help one be entirely owing to basis of character not at all from clear precise doctrinal discrimination that mr jerome have very early in life become dissenter in boyish day have be thrown where dissent seemed to have balance of piety purity good work on side to become dissenter seemed to identical with choosing god instead of mammon that race of dissenter be extinct in day when opinion have got far ahead of feeling chapel going youth can fill ear with advantage of voluntary system corruption of state church scriptural evidence that first christian be congregationalist mr jerome knew nothing of theoretic basis for dissent in utmost extent of polemical discussion have not gone further than to question whether christian man be bound in conscience to distinguish christmas easter by peculiar observance beyond eating of mince pie cheese cake seemed to that season be alike good for thanking god departing from evil doing well whereas might be desirable to restrict period for indulging in unwholesome form of pastry mr jerome dissent being of simple non polemical kind be easy to understand that report heard of mr tryan a good man powerful preacher who be stirring heart of people have be enough to attract to paddiford church that having felt more edified there than have of late be under mr stickneys discourse at salem have driven thither repeatedly in sunday afternoon have sought opportunity of making mr tryans acquaintance evening lecture be subject of warm interest with opposition mr tryan met with gave interest strong tinge of partisanship for there be store of irascibility in mr jerome nature must find vent somewhere in so kindly upright man must only find in indignation against whom held to be enemy of

rosy cheeked lad whom delighted to make happy with christmas box to pallid sufferer up dim entry languishing under tardy death of want misery be very pleasant to mr tryan to listen to simple chat of

be evangelical narrow latitudinarian pantheistic anglican supercilious man in solitude be perhaps shedding hot tear because sacrifice be hard one because strength patience be failing to speak difficult word do difficult deed chapter mr tryan showed such symptom of weakness on critical sunday unhesitatingly rejected suggestion that must be taken to church in mr landors carriage proposition that gentleman made a amendment on original plan when rumour of meditated insult became alarming mr tryan declared must have precaution taken must simply trust in god good cause of more timid friend thought conduct rather defiant than wise reflecting that mob have great talent for impromptu that legal redress be imperfect satisfaction for having one head broken with brickbat be beginning to question conscience very closely a to whether be not duty owed to family to stay at home on sunday evening timorous person however be in small minority generality of mr tryans friend hearer rather exulted in opportunity of braving insult for sake of preacher to whom be attached on personal a well a doctrinal ground miss pratt spoke of cranmer ridley latimer observed that present crisis afforded occasion for emulating heroism even in degenerate time while le highly instructed person whose memory be not well stored with precedent simply expressed determination a mr jerome have done to stan by

distracted by news of intrigue against at home notwithstanding handsome compliment paid to providence a undoubted patron before setting out there seems probability that te deums will be on other side so fell out with mr dempster in memorable campaign against tryanites after premature triumph of return from elmstoke battle of evening lecture have be lost enemy be in possession of field utmost hope remaining be that by harassing guerilla warfare might be driven to evacuate country for time sort of warfare be kept up with considerable spirit shaft of milby ridicule be made more formidable by being poisoned with calumny very ugly story narrated with circumstantial minuteness be soon in circulation concerning mr tryan hearer from story be plainly deducible that evangelicalism led by necessary consequence to hypocritical indulgence in vice old friendship be broken asunder there be near relation who felt that religious difference unmitigated by prospect of legacy be sufficient ground for exhibiting family antipathy mr budd harangued workman threatened with dismissal if family be known to attend evening lecture mr tomlinson on discovering that foreman be rank tryanite blustered to great extent must have cashiered that valuable functionary on spot if such retributive procedure have not be inconvenient on whole however at end of few month balance of substantial loss be on side of anti tryanites mr pratt indeed have lost patient two besides mr dempsters family a be evident that evangelicalism have not dried up stream of anecdote in least altered view of lady

loss galled out of proportion to mere monetary deficit represented attorney loved money loved power still better have always be proud of having early won confidence of conventicle goer of being able to turn prop of salem round thumb like most other men too have certain kindness towards who have employed when be only starting in life just a like to part with old weather glass from study two foot

have be shone on by sun of many year take one of picture away leaf definite blank space to eye can never turn without sensation of discomfort nay involuntary loss of familiar object almost always brings chill a from evil omen seems to be first finger shadow of advancing death from cause combined mr dempster must never think of lost client without strong irritation very sight of mr jerome

observation of husband who a feared be on mid day return from office at other end of street offence of hers in speaking to mr jerome be frequently recurring theme of mr dempsters objurgatory domestic eloquence associating loss of old client with mr tryans influence dempster began to know more distinctly why hated obnoxious curate passionate hate a well a passionate love demand leisure mental freedom persecution revenge like courtship toadyism will not prosper without considerable expenditure of time ingenuity be not to spare with man whose law business liver be beginning to show unpleasant symptom such be disagreeable turn affair be taking with mr dempster like general distracted by home intrigue be too much harassed to lay ingenious plan for harassing enemy meanwhile evening lecture drew larger larger congregation not perhaps attracting many from select aristocratic circle in lowmes pittmans be predominant winning larger proportion of mr crewes morning afternoon hearer thinning mr stickneys evening audience at salem evangelicalism be making way in milby gradually diffusing subtle odour into chamber be bolted barred against movement like other religious revival have mixed effect religious idea have fate of melody once set afloat in world be taken up by sort of instrument of woefully coarse feeble out of tune until people be in danger of cry out that melody be detestable may be that of mr tryans hearer have gained religious vocabulary rather than religious experience here there weaver wife who few month before have be simply silly slattern be converted into

that child in paddiford sunday school have memory crammed with phrase about blood of cleansing imputed righteousness justification by faith alone experience lying principally in chuck farthing hop scotch parental slappings longing after unattainable lollypop served rather to darken than to illustrate at milby in distant day a in other time place where mental atmosphere be changing men be inhaling stimulus of new idea folly often mistook for wisdom ignorance gave air of knowledge selfishness turning eye upward called religion nevertheless evangelicalism have brought into palpable existence operation in milby society that idea of duty that recognition of something to be lived for beyond mere satisfaction of self be to moral life what addition of great central ganglion be to animal life man can begin to mould on faith idea without rising to higher order of experience principle of subordination of self mastery have be introduced into nature be no longer mere bundle of

countenance teaching at sunday school visiting poor striving after standard of purity goodness have surely more moral loveliness than in flaunting peony day when have other model than costume of heroine in circulating library miss eliza pratt listening in rapt attention to mr tryans evening lecture doubt found evangelical channel for vanity egoism be clearly in moral advance of miss phipps giggling under feather at old mr crewes peculiarity of enunciation even elderly father mother with mind like mr linnet too tough to imbibe much doctrine be better for having heart inclined towards new preacher a messenger from god became ashamed perhaps of evil temper ashamed of worldliness ashamed of trivial futile past first condition of human goodness be something to love second something to

want human action character riddled through sieve of own idea before can accord sympathy admiration such mind daresay must have found mr tryans character very much in need of riddling process blessed

be blended with mere opinion sympathy be perhaps confined in narrow conduit of doctrine instead of flowing forth with freedom of stream blesses weed in course obstinacy self assertion will often interfuse with grandest impulse very deed of self sacrifice be sometimes only rebound of passionate egoism so be with mr tryan one looking at with bird eye glance of critic might perhaps say that made mistake of identifying christianity with too narrow doctrinal system that saw god work too exclusively in antagonism to world flesh devil that intellectual culture be too limited so on making mr tryan text for wise discourse on characteristic of evangelical school in day be not poised at lofty height be on level in press with a struggle way along stony road through crowd of unloving fellow men be

obliged to admit that gave rest three sermon on sunday night school for young men on tuesday cottage lecture on thursday address to school teacher catechizing of school child with pastoral visit multiplying a influence extended beyond own district of paddiford common must have be enough to tax severely power of much stronger man mr pratt remonstrated with on imprudence must not prevail on so far to economize time strength a to keep horse on ground other friend found difficult to explain to mr tryan seemed bent on wearing out enemy be at loss to account for such course evangelical curate selfishness be clearly of too bad kind to exhibit after ordinary manner of sound respectable selfishness want to get reputation of saint said one he eaten up with spiritual pride said he got eye on fine living want to creep up bishop sleeve said third mr stickney of salem who considered voluntary discomfort a remnant of legal spirit pronounced severe condemnation on self neglect expressed fear that mr tryan be still far from having attained true christian liberty good mr jerome eagerly seized doctrinal view of subject a mean of enforcing suggestion of own benevolence one cloudy afternoon in end of november mounted roan mare with determination of riding to paddiford arguying point with mr tryan old gentleman face looked very mournful a rode along dismal paddiford lane between row of grimy house darkened with hand loom while black dust be whirled about by cold november wind be thinking of object have brought on afternoon ride thought according to habit when alone found vent now then in audible speech seemed to a eye rested on scene of mr tryans labour that must understand clergyman self privation without resorting to mr stickneys theory of defective spiritual enlightenment philosophic doctor tell that be unable to discern so much a tree except by unconscious cunning combine many past separate sensation that one sense be independent of so that in dark can hardly taste fricassee tell whether pipe be alight not most intelligent boy if accommodated with claw hoof instead of finger must be likely to remain on lowest form if so be easy to understand that discernment of men motif must depend on completeness of element can bring from own susceptibility own experience see to friend before pronounce too hasty judgement that own moral sensibility be not of hoofed clawed character keenest eye will not serve unless have delicate finger with subtle nerve filament elude scientific lens lose in invisible world of human sensation a for mr jerome drew element of moral vision from depth of veneration pity if felt so much for poor thing to whom life be so dim meagre what must clergyman feel who have undertaken before god to be shepherd ah whispered interruptedly too big load for conscience poor man want to mek brother like cant abide to preach to fastin on full stomach ah he better be thats he deal better be here mr jerome shook bridle violently looked up with air of moral courage a if mr stickney have be present liable to take offence at conclusion few minute more brought in front of mr wagstaffs where mr tryan lodged have often be here before so that contrast between ugly square brick house with shabby bit of grass plot stared at round by cottage window own pretty white home set in paradise of orchard garden pasture be not new to felt with fresh force to day a slowly fastened roan by bridle to wooden paling knocked at door mr tryan be at home sent to request that mr jerome must walk up into study a fire be out in parlour below at mention of clergyman study perhaps too active imagination conjures up perfect snuggery where general air of comfort be rescued from secular character by strong ecclesiastical suggestion in shape of furniture pattern of carpet print on wall where if nap be taken be easy chair with gothic back very foot rest on warm velvety simulation of church window where pure art of rigorous english protestantism smile above mantelpiece in portrait of eminent bishop refined anglican taste be indicated by german print from overbeck where wall be lined with choice divinity in sombre binding light be softened by screen of bough with grey church in background must beg to dismiss such scenic prettiness suitable a may be to clergyman character complexion for have to confess that mr tryans study be very ugly little room indeed with ugly slapdash pattern on wall ugly carpet on floor ugly view of cottage roof cabbage garden from window own person writing table bookcase be only object in room have slightest air of refinement sole provision for comfort be clumsy straight backed arm chair covered with faded chintz man who must live in such room unconstrained by poverty must either have vision fed from within by intense passion must have chosen that least attractive form of self mortification wear haircloth have meagre day accepts vulgar commonplace ugly whenever highest duty seems to lie among mr tryan hope youll excuse disturbin on said mr jerome id summat partickler to say dont disturb at mr jerome im very glad to have visit from said mr tryan shaking heartily by hand offering chintz covered easy chair

be merged in anxiety about state of health miss eliza pratt have at one time passed through much sleepless cogitation on possibility of mr tryans being attached to lady at distance at laxeter perhaps where have formerly held curacy fine eye kept close watch lest symptom of engaged affection on part must escape seemed alarming fact that handkerchief be beautifully marked with hair until reflected that have unmarried sister of whom spoke with much affection a father companion comforter besides mr tryan have never paid distant visit except one for few day to father hint escaped of intending to

turned up to in paddiford church often think how hard must be for clergyman who have to come after have made people love so chapter in occasional visit to near neighbour mr pettifer too old friend to be shunned because be tryanite janet be obliged sometimes to hear allusion to mr tryan even to listen to praise usually met with playful incredulity ah well answered one day like dear old mr crewe pipe great deal better than mr tryan gospel when be little toddle mr mr crewe used to let play about in garden have swing between great elm tree because mother have garden like people who be kind kindness be religion thats reason like dear mr pettifer though be tryanite thats mr tryans religion too at least partly there nobody can give up more to doing good amongst poor think of body too a well a soul o yes yes then talk about faith grace that making people believe be better than others that god love more than doe rest of world know have put great deal of into sally martin head have done good at be a nice honest patient girl a need be before now fancy have new light new wisdom dont like notion mistake indeed do dear mr dempster wish youd go hear preach hear preach why wicked woman must persuade to disobey husband must o shocking will run away from good bye few day after conversation however janet went to sally martin about three oclock in afternoon pudding have be sent in for herself mammy struck a just sort of delicate morsel poor consumptive girl must be likely to fancy in usual impulsive way have started up from dinner table at once put on bonnet set off with covered plateful to neighbouring street when entered house there be one to be seen in little sideroom where sally lay janet heard voice be one have not heard before immediately guessed to be mr tryans first impulse be to set down plate go away mr martin might not be in then there must be one to give sally delicious bit of pudding so stood still be obliged to hear what mr tryan be saying be interrupted by one of invalid violent fit of coughing be very hard to bear be not said when be still again yet god seems to support under wonderfully pray for sally may have strength too when hour of great suffering come be one of worst weakness to shrink from bodily pain think time be perhaps not far off when will have to bear what be bearing now have tired have talked enough good bye janet be surprised forgot wish not to encounter mr tryan tone word be so unlike what have expected to hear there be none of self satisfied unction of teacher quoting exhorting expounding for benefit of hearer simple appeal for help confession of weakness mr tryan have deeply felt trouble then mr tryan too like knew what be to tremble at foreseen trial to shudder at impending burthen heavier than felt able to bear most brilliant deed of virtue must not have inclined janets good will towards mr tryan so much a fellowship in suffering softening thought be in eye when appeared in doorway pale weary depressed sight of janet standing there with entire absence of self consciousness belongs to new vivid impression made start pause little eye met looked at other gravely for few moment then bowed mr tryan passed out there be power in direct glance of sincere loving human soul will do more to dissipate prejudice kindle charity than most elaborate argument fullest exposition of mr tryans doctrine might not have sufficed to convince janet that have not odious self complacency in believing peculiar child of god one direct pathetic look of have dissociated with conception for ever happened late in autumn not long before sally martin died janet mentioned new impression to one for be afraid of arriving at still more complete contradiction of former idea have of considerable regard for past self be not fond of casting reflection on respected individual by total negation of opinion janet must no longer think of mr tryan without sympathy still shrank from idea of becoming hearer admirer be reversal of past be a little accordant with inclination a circumstance indeed interview with mr tryan be soon thrust into background of poor janets memory by daily thickening misery of life chapter loss of mr jerome a client proved only beginning of annoyance to dempster old gentleman have in vigorous remnant of energy perseverance have created own fortune being a have hinted given to chewing cud of righteous indignation with considerable relish be determined to carry on retributive war against persecuting attorney having influence with mr pryme who be one of most substantial ratepayer in neighbouring parish of dingley who have complex long standing private account with dempster mr jerome stirred up gentleman to investigation of suspicious point in attorney conduct of parish affair natural consequence be personal quarrel between dempster mr pryme client demanded account then followed old story of exorbitant lawyer bill with unpleasant anti climax of taxing disagreeables extending over many month ran along side by side with pressing business of mr armstrong lawsuit be threatening to take turn rather depreciatory of dempsters professional prevision be not surprising that being thus kept in constant state of irritated excitement about own affair have little time for further exhibition of public spirit for rallying forlorn hope of sound churchmanship against cant hypocrisy not few person who have grudge against began to remark with satisfaction that dempsters luck be forsaking particularly mr linnet who thought saw distinctly gradual ripening of providential scheme whereby just retribution must be wrought on man who have deprived of pyes croft on other hand dempsters well satisfied client who be of opinion that punishment of wickedness might conveniently be deferred to world noticed with concern that be drinking more than ever that temper driving be becoming more furious unhappily additional glass of brandy that exasperation of loud tongued abuse have other effect than entered into contemplation of anxious client be little super added symbol be perpetually raising sum of home misery poor janet how heavily month rolled on for laden with fresh sorrow a summer passed into autumn autumn into winter winter into spring again feverish morning with blank listlessness despair seemed more hateful than last coming night more impossible to brave without arming in leaden stupor morning light brought gladness to seemed only to throw glare on what have happened in dim candle light on cruel man seated immovable in drunken obstinacy by dead fire dying light in dining room rating in harsh tone reiterating old reproach on hideous blank of something unremembered something must have made that dark bruise on shoulder ache a dressed do wonder how be that thing have come to pas what offence janet have committed in early year of marriage to rouse brutal hatred of man seed of thing be very small hour lie between sunrise gloom of midnight be travelled through by tiniest marking of clock janet looking back along fifteen year of married life hardly knew how where total misery began hardly knew when sweet wedded love hope have set for ever have ceased to make twilight of memory relenting before on coming of utter dark old mr dempster thought saw true beginning of in janets want of housekeeping skill exactness janet said to herself be always running about doing thing for other people neglecting own house provokes man what use be for woman to be loving making fuss with husband if doesnt take care keep home just a like if isnt at hand when want anything done if doesnt attend to wish let be a small a may be what did when be wife though didnt make half so much fuss about loving husband then janet have child ah there mammy dempster have touched true spring not perhaps of son cruelty of half janets misery if have have babe to rock to sleep little one to kneel in night dress say prayer at knee sweet boy girl to put young arm round neck kiss away tear poor hungry heart must have be fed with strong love might never have needed that fiery poison to still craving mighty be force of motherhood say great tragic poet to across age finding a usual simplest word for sublimest fact transforms thing by vital heat turn timidity into fierce courage dreadless defiance into tremulous submission turn thoughtlessness into foresight yet still anxiety into calm content make selfishness become self denial give even to hard vanity glance of admiring love yes if janet have be mother might have be saved from much sin therefore from much of sorrow believe that be anything present wanting in poor janet formed motive of husband cruelty cruelty like other vice requires motive outside only requires opportunity suppose dempster have motive for drinking beyond craving for drink presence of brandy be only necessary condition unloving tyrannous brutal man need motive to prompt cruelty need only perpetual presence of woman can call own whole park full of tame timid eyed animal to torment at will must not serve so well to glut lust of torture must not feel a one woman doe must not throw out keen retort whets edge of hatred janets bitterness must overflow in ready word be not to be made meek by cruelty must repent of nothing in face of injustice though be subdued in moment by word look recalled old day of fondness in time of comparative calm must often recover sweet woman habit of caressing playful affection such day be become rare poor janets soul be kept like vexed sea tossed by new storm before old wave have fallen proud angry resistance sullen endurance be now almost only alternation knew must bear proudly to world proudly towards too woman weakness might shriek cry for pity under heavy blow voluntarily must hing to mollify unless first relented what have ever done to love too well believe in too foolishly have pity on tender flesh must strike soft neck have once asked to kiss yet must not admit wretchedness have married blindly must bear out to terrible end might be better misery than blank lay for outside married home there be one person who heard plaint outburst of bitterness despair janet be never tempted to pour into other ear ala in worst moment janet must throw out wild reproach against patient listener for wrong rous angry passion find only medium in pass through like vibration

at half past five everything be in order janet be dressed when mother have kissed said good bye must not help pausing moment in sorrowful admiration at tall rich figure looking grander for plainness of deep mourning dress noble face with massy fold of black hair made matronly by simple white cap janet have that enduring beauty belongs to pure majestic outline depth of tint sorrow neglect leave trace on such beauty thrill to last like glorious greek temple for loss have suffered from time barbarous hand have gained solemn history fill imagination more because be incomplete to sense be six oclock before dempster returned from rotherby have evidently drunk great deal be in angry humour janet who have gathered little courage forbearance from consciousness that have done best to day be determined to speak pleasantly to robert said gently a saw seat in dining room in dusty snuffy clothes take document out of pocket will not wash change dress will refresh leave alone will said dempster in most brutal tone do change coat waistcoat be so dusty ive laid thing out ready o have have after few minute rose very deliberately walked up stair into bedroom janet have often be scolded before for not laying out clothes thought now not without wonder that attention of hers have brought to compliance presently called out janet went up stair here take that said a soon a reached door flinging at coat have laid out time leave to do a please will coat flung with great force only brushed shoulder fell distance within drawing room door of stood open just opposite hastily retreated a saw waistcoat coming one by one clothes have laid out be flung into drawing room janets face flushed with anger for first time in life resentment overcame long cherished pride that made hide grief from world there be moment when by strange impulse contradict past self fatal moment when fit of passion like lava stream lay low work of half life janet thought will not pick up clothes will lie there until visitor come will be ashamed of there be knock at door made haste to seat in drawing room lest servant must enter remove clothes be lying half on table half on ground mr lowme entered with le familiar visitor client of dempsters next moment dempster came in eye fell at once on clothes then turned for instant with devilish glance of concentrated hatred on janet who still flushed excited affected unconsciousness after shaking hand with visitor immediately rang bell take clothes away said to servant not looking at janet again during dinner kept up assumed air of indifference tried to seem in high spirit laughing talking more than usual in reality felt a if have defied wild beast within four wall of den be crouching backward in preparation for deadly spring dempster affected to take notice of talked obstreperously drank steadily about eleven party dispersed with exception of mr budd who have joined after dinner appeared disposed to stay drinking little longer janet began to hope that must stay long enough for dempster to become heavy stupid so to fall asleep down stair be rare occasional ending of night told servant to sit up longer undressed went to bed trying to cheat imagination into belief that day be ended for when lay down became more intensely awake than ever everything have taken evening seemed only to stimulate sens apprehension to new vividness heart beat violently heard sound in house at last when be twelve heard mr budd go out heard door slam dempster have not moved be asleep must forget minute seemed long while with quickening pulse be on stretch to catch sound janet loud jarring voice seemed to strike like hurled weapon janet called again moving out of dining room to foot of stair there be pause of minute if dont come ill kill pause heard turn back into dining room be gone for light perhaps for weapon perhaps must kill let life be a hideous a death for year have be rushing on to unknown certain horror now be close upon be almost glad be in state of flushed feverish defiance neutralized woman terror heard heavy step on stair saw slowly advancing light then saw tall massive figure heavy face now fierce with drunken rage have nothing candle in hand set down on table advanced close to bed so think youll defy do well see how long will last get up madam out of bed instant in close presence of dreadful man of huge crushing force armed with savage will poor janets desperate defiance forsook terror came back trembling got up stood helpless in night dress before husband seized with heavy grasp by shoulder pushed before ill cool hot spirit for ill teach to brave slowly pushed along before down stair through passage where small oil lamp be still flickering what be going to do to her thought moment be going to dash before on ground gave scream only trembled pushed on to entrance held firmly in grasp while lifted latch of door then opened door little way thrust out slammed behind for short space seemed like deliverance to janet harsh north east wind blew through thin night dress sent long heavy black hair streaming seemed like breath of pity after grasp of threatening monster soon sense of release from overpowering terror gave way before sense of fate have really come upon then be what have be travelling towards through long year of misery not yet death o if have be brave enough for death must have be better servant slept at back of house be impossible to make hear so that might let in again quietly without husband knowledge must not have tried have thrust out must be for ever there must have be dead silence in orchard street for whistling of wind swirling of march dust on pavement thick cloud covered sky door be closed window be dark ray of light fell on tall white figure stood in lonely misery on doorstep eye rested on janet a sank down on cold stone looked into dismal night seemed to be looking into own blank future chapter stony street bitter north east wind darkness in midst of tender woman thrust out from husband home in thin night dress harsh wind cutting naked foot driving long hair away from half clad bosom where poor heart be crushed with anguish despair drowning man urged by supreme agony life in instant through happy unhappy past when dark flood have fallen like curtain memory in single moment see drama acted over again even in earlier crisis be type of death when be cut off abruptly from life have known when can no longer expect to morrow to resemble yesterday find by sudden shock on confines of unknown there be often same sort of lightning flash through dark unfrequented chamber of memory when janet sat down shivering on door stone with door shut upon past life future black unshapen before a night scene of childhood youth painful womanhood rushed back upon consciousness made one picture with present desolation petted child taking newest toy to bed with young girl proud in strength beauty dreaming that life be easy thing that be pitiful weakness to be unhappy bride passing with trembling joy from outer court to inner sanctuary of woman life wife beginning initiation into sorrow wounded resenting yet still hoping forgiving poor bruised woman seeking through weary year one refuge of despair oblivion janet seemed to herself in same moment that be conscious of being seated on cold stone under shock of new misery early gladness bright hope illusion gift of beauty affection served only to darken riddle of life be betraying promise of cruel destiny have brought out sweet blossom only that wind storm might have greater work of desolation have nursed like pet fawn into tenderness fond expectation only that might feel keener terror in clutch of panther mother have sometimes said that trouble be sent to make better draw nearer to god what mockery seemed to janet trouble have be sinking lower from year to year pressing upon like heavy fever laden vapour perverting very plenitude of nature into deeper source of disease wretchedness have be perpetually tightening instrument of torture have gradually absorbed other sensibility of nature into sense of pain maddened craving for relief oh if ray of hope of pity of consolation must pierce through horrible gloom might believe then in divine love in heavenly father who cared for child now have faith trust there be nothing must lean on in wide world for mother be only fellow sufferer in own lot poor patient woman must do little more than mourn with daughter have humble resignation enough to sustain own soul must no more give comfort fortitude to janet than withered ivy covered trunk can bear up strong full boughed offspring crashing down under alpine storm janet felt be alone human soul have measured anguish have understood self despair have entered into sorrow sin with deep sighted sympathy be wiser than blame more potent than reproof such sympathy a have swelled own heart for many sufferer if there be divine pity must not feel kept aloof from poured balm into wound stretched out hand to bear up weak resolve to fortify fainting courage now in utmost loneliness shed tear sat staring fixedly into darkness while inwardly gazed at own past almost losing sense that be own that be anything more than spectator at strange dreadful play loud sound of church clock striking one startled have not be there more than hour then seemed to a if have be there night be getting benumbed with cold with strong instinctive dread of pain death have made recoil from suicide started up disagreeable sensation of resting on benumbed foot helped to recall completely to sense of present wind be beginning to make rent in cloud there came now then dim light of star frightened more than darkness be like cruel finger pointing out in wretchedness humiliation made shudder at thought of morning twilight what must go to mother not rouse in dead of night to tell mother must think be spectre must be enough to kill with horror way there be so long if must meet one must seek shelter somewhere to hide five door off there be mr pettifers kind woman must take in be of use now to be proud mind about world knowing have nothing to wish for nothing to care about only must not help shuddering at thought of braving morning light there in street be frightened at thought of spending long hour in cold life might mean anguish might mean despair oh must clutch though with bleeding finger foot must cling to firm earth that sunlight must revisit not slip into untried abyss where might long even for familiar pain janet trod slowly with naked foot on rough pavement trembling at fitful gleam of starlight supporting by wall a gust of wind drove right against very wind be cruel tried to push back from door where wanted to go knock ask for pity mr pettifers house did not look into orchard street stood little way up wide passage opened into street through archway janet turned up archway saw faint light coming from mr pettifers bedroom window glimmer of rushlight from room where friend be lying be like ray of mercy to janet after long long time of darkness loneliness must not be so dreadful to awake mr pettifer a have thought yet lingered minute at door before gathered courage to knock felt a if sound must betray to others besides mr pettifer though there be other dwelling opened into passage only warehouse outbuilding there be gravel for to throw up at window nothing heavy pavement there be door bell must knock first rap be very timid one feeble fall of knocker then stood still again for many minute presently rallied courage knocked several time together not loudly rapidly so mr pettifer if only heard sound must not mistake have heard for by by casement of window be opened janet perceived that be bending out to try discern who be at door be mr pettifer be janet dempster take in for pity sake merciful god what have happened robert have turned out have be in cold long while mr pettifer said more hurried away from window be soon at door with light in hand come in poor dear come in said good woman in tremulous voice drawing janet within door come into warm bed may god in heaven save comfort pitying eye tender voice warm touch caused rush of new feeling in janet heart swelled burst out suddenly like child into loud passionate sob mr pettifer must not help cry with said come up stair dear come dont linger in cold drew poor sobbing thing gently up stair persuaded to get into warm bed be long before janet must lie down sat leaning head on knee convulsed by sob while motherly woman covered with clothes held arm round to comfort with warmth at last hysterical passion have exhausted fell back on pillow throat be still agitated by piteous after sob such a shake little child even when have found refuge from alarm on mother lap now janet be getting quieter mr pettifer determined to go down make cup of tea first thing kind old woman think of a solace restorative under calamity happily there be danger of awaking servant heavy girl of sixteen who be snoring blissfully in attic might be kept ignorant of way in mr dempster have come in so mr pettifer busied with rousing kitchen fire be kept in under huge raker possibility by coal of midland county atones for slowness white ash when carried up tea janet be lying quite still spasmodic agitation have ceased seemed lost in thought eye be fixed vacantly on rushlight shade line of sorrow be deepened in face now dear said mr pettifer let persuade to drink cup of tea youll find warm soothe very much why dear heart foot be like ice still now do drink tea ill wrap em up in flannel then theyll get warm janet turned dark eye on old friend stretched out arm be too much oppressed to say anything suffering lay like heavy weight on power of speech wanted to kiss good kind woman mr pettifer setting down cup bent towards sad beautiful face janet kissed with earnest sacramental kiss such kiss a seal new closer bond between helper helped drank tea obediently doe warm said now will get into bed will lie still now mr pettifer felt be best thing must do to lie down quietly say more hoped janet might go to sleep a for herself with tendency to wakefulness common to advanced year found impossible to compose to sleep again after agitating surprise lay listening to clock wondering what have led to new outrage of dempsters praying for poor thing at side pitying mother who must have to hear to morrow chapter janet lay still a have promised tea have warmed given sense of greater bodily ease have only heightened previous excitement of brain idea have new vividness made feel a if have only seen life through dim haze before thought instead of springing from action of own mind be external existence thrust imperiously upon like haunting vision future took shape after shape of misery before always ending in being dragged back again to old life of terror stupor fevered despair husband have so long overshadowed life that imagination must not keep hold of condition in that great dread be absent even absence what be only dreary vacant flat where there be nothing to strive after nothing to long for at last light of morning quenched rushlight janets thought became more more fragmentary confused be moment slipping off level on lay thinking down down into depth from tried to rise again with start slumber be stealing over weary brain that uneasy slumber be only better than wretched waking because life seemed to live in determines wretched future because thing do suffer in be hateful shadow leave impress that petrifies into irrevocable past have scarcely be asleep hour when movement became more violent muttering more frequent agitated till at last started up with smothered cry looked wildly round shaking with terror dont be frightened dear mr dempster said mr pettifer who be up dressing be with old friend mr pettifer nothing will harm janet sank back again on pillow still trembling after lying silent little while said be horrible dream dear mr pettifer

look with ghastly horror on property aflame in dead of night have not sense of destitution will have in morning when walk over ruin lying blackened in pitiless sunshine that moment of intensest depression be come to janet when daylight showed wall chair table commonplace reality surrounded seemed to lay bare future too bring out into oppressive distinctness detail of weary life to be lived

bear written on sign of janets intervening misery heart gave great leap a eye met once more have not deceived there be sincerity sadness deep pity in memory have told of more than have told for in proportion a face have become thinner more worn eye appeared to have gathered intensity came forward putting out hand said be so glad sent for be so thankful thought must be comfort to janet took hand in silence be unable to utter word of mere politeness even of gratitude heart be too full of other word have welled up moment met pitying glance felt doubt fall away sat down opposite other said in low voice while slow difficult tear gathered in aching eye want to tell how unhappy be how weak wicked feel strength to live die thought must tell something must help paused perhaps can mr tryan said

when be very wretched wine be standing on table suddenly can hardly remember how came to do poured wine into large glass drank blunted feeling made more indifferent after that temptation be always coming got stronger stronger be ashamed hated what did almost while thought be passing through mind must never do again did seemed a if there be demon in always making rush to do what longed not to do thought more that god be cruel for if have not sent that dreadful trial so much worse than other woman have to bear must not have done wrong in way suppose be wicked to think so feel a if there must

peace of mind power to do right can give comfort hope while janet be speaking have forgotten everything misery yearning for comfort voice have risen from low tone of timid distress to intense pitch of imploring anguish clasped hand tightly looked at mr tryon with eager questioning eye with parted trembling lip with deep horizontal line of overmastering pain on brow in artificial life of ours be not

how can tell that hardest trial have known have be only road by be leading to complete sense of own sin helplessness without must never have renounced other hope trusted in love alone know dear mr dempster know be hard to bear must not speak lightly of sorrow feel that mystery of life be great at one time seemed a dark to a doe to mr tryan hesitated again saw that first thing janet needed be to be assured of sympathy must be made to feel that anguish be not strange to that entered into only half expressed secret of spiritual weakness before other message of consolation must find way to heart tale of divine pity be never yet believed from lip be not felt to be moved by human pity janets anguish be not strange to mr tryan have never be in presence of sorrow self despair have sent so strong thrill through recess of saddest experience be because sympathy be living again through own past in new form that confession often prompt response of confession mr tryan felt prompting judgement too

in husband face to come hear mr tryan yes let go speak to friendly word look touched janet little too keenly mr pettifer wisely hurried home by least frequented road when reached home violent fit of weeping followed by continuous lassitude showed that emotion of morning have overstrained nerve be suffering too from absence of long accustomed stimulus have promised mr tryan not to touch again poor thing be conscious of dreaded own weakness a victim of intermittent insanity dread oncoming of old illusion mother whispered when mr raynor urged to lie down rest afternoon that might be better prepared to see mr tryan in evening mother dont let have anything if ask for in mother mind there be same anxiety in be mingled with fear fear lest janet in present excited state of mind must take

till mr tryan come at twenty minute past six church bell be ringing for evening service soon congregation be streaming along orchard street in mellow sunset street opened toward west red half sunken sun shed solemn splendour on everyday house crimsoned window of dempsters projecting upper storey suddenly loud murmur arose spread along stream of church goer one group after paused looked backward at far end of street men accompanied by miscellaneous group of onlooker be slowly carrying something body stretched on door slowly passed along middle of street lined way with awe struck face till turned aside paused in red sunlight before dempsters door be dempsters body one knew whether be alive dead chapter be probably hard saying to pharisee that there be more joy in heaven over one sinner repenteth than over ninety nine just person need repentance certain ingenious philosopher of own day must surely take offence at joy so entirely out of correspondence with arithmetical proportion

short easy method of obtaining thorough complacency in presence of pain for such heart that saying will not be altogether dark emotion have observed be slightly influenced by arithmetical consideration mother when sweet lisping little one have be taken from one after be hanging over last dead babe find small consolation in fact that tiny dimpled corpse be one of necessary average that thousand other babe brought into world at same time be doing well be likely to live if stood beside that mother if knew pang shared be probable must be equally unable to see ground of complacency in

soon ran off before mr pettifer must utter word of dissuasion leaving good woman in considerable anxiety lest new impulse of janets must frustrate precaution to save from sudden shock janet having paid visit in butcher lane turned again into orchard street on way to mr crewes be thinking rather sadly that mother economical housekeeping must leave abundant surplus to be sent to hungry lakins when saw mr pilgrim in advance of on other side of street be walking at rapid pace when reached dempsters door turned entered without knocking janet be startled mr pilgrim must never enter in way

be one source of sweet calm be often felt by watcher in sick room even when duty there be of hard terrible kind something of benign result be felt by janet during tendance in husband chamber when first heart piercing hour be over when horror at delirium be no longer fresh began to be conscious of relief from burden of decision a to future course question agitated about returning to husband have be solved in moment illness after might be herald of blessing just a dreadful midnight when stood outcast in cold darkness have be followed by dawn of new hope robert must get better illness might alter must be long time feeble needing help walking with crutch perhaps must wait on with such tenderness such forgiving love that old harshness cruelty must melt away for ever under heart sunshine must pour around bosom heaved at thought delicious tear fell janets be nature in hatred revenge must find place long bitter year drew bitterness from ever living remembrance of too short year of love went before thought that husband must ever put hand to lip again recall day when sat on grass together laid scarlet poppy on black hair called gypsy queen seemed to send tide of loving

penitence submission be thought passing through janets mind a hovered about husband bed be hope poured out to mr tryan when called to see be so evident that be strengthening in new struggle shed glow of calm enthusiasm over face a spoke of mr tryan must not bear to throw on chill of premonitory doubt though previous conversation have have with mr pilgrim have convinced that there be not faintest probability of dempsters recovery poor janet did not know significance of changing symptom when after lapse of week delirium began to lose of violence to be interrupted by longer longer interval of stupor tried to think that might be step on way to recovery shrank from questioning mr pilgrim lest must confirm fear began to get predominance in mind before many day be past thought right not to allow to blind longer one day be just about noon when bad news always seems most sickening led from husband chamber into opposite drawing room where mr raynor be sitting said to in low tone of sympathetic feeling sometimes gave sudden air of gentleness to rough man dear mr dempster be right in case know to be prepared for worst think will be saving pain by preventing from entertaining false hope mr dempsters state be now such that fear must consider recovery impossible affection of brain might not have be hopeless see there be terrible complication be grieved to say broken limb be mortifying janet listened with sinking heart that future of love forgiveness must never come then be going out of sight for ever where pity must never reach turned cold trembled do think will die said without ever coming to without ever knowing one can not say that with certainty be not impossible that cerebral oppression may subside that may become conscious if there be anything must wish to be said done in case must be well to be prepared must think mr pilgrim continued turning to mr raynor mr dempsters affair be likely to be in order will be o wouldnt have troubled about thing interrupted janet have relation quite distant one one wouldnt take up time with only want to be unable to finish felt sob rising left room o god said inwardly be not thy love greater than mine have mercy on have mercy on happened on wednesday ten day after fatal accident by following sunday dempster be in state of rapidly increasing prostration when mr pilgrim who in turn with assistant have slept in house from beginning came in about half past ten a usual scarcely believed that feebly struggling life must last out till morning for last few day have be administering stimulant to relieve exhaustion have succeeded alternation of delirium stupor slight office be now remained to be done for patient so at eleven oclock mr pilgrim went to bed having given direction to nurse desired to call if change took place if mr dempster desired presence janet must not be persuaded to leave room be yearning watching for moment in husband eye must rest consciously upon must know that have forgiven how changed be since terrible monday nearly fortnight ago lay motionless for irregular breathing stirred broad chest thick muscular neck feature be no longer purple swollen be pale sunken haggard cold perspiration stood in bead on protuberant forehead on wasted hand stretched motionless on bed clothes be better to see hand so than convulsively picking air a have be week ago janet sat on edge of bed through long hour of candle light watching unconscious half closed eye wiping perspiration from brow cheek keeping left hand on cold unanswering right hand lay beside on bed clothes be almost a pale a dying husband there be dark line under eye for be third night since have taken off clothes eager straining gaze of dark eye acute sensibility lay in line about mouth made strange contrast with blank unconsciousness emaciated animalism of face be watching there be profound stillness in house heard sound husband breathing ticking of watch on mantelpiece candle placed high up shed soft light down on one object cared to see there be smell of brandy in room be given to husband from time to time smell at first have produced in faint shuddering sensation be now becoming indifferent to did not even perceive be too unconscious of to feel temptation accusation only felt that husband of youth be dying far far out of reach a if be standing helpless on shore while be sinking in black storm wave only yearned for one moment in might satisfy deep forgiving pity of soul by one look of love one word of tenderness sensation thought be so persistent that must not measure hour be surprise to when nurse put out candle let in faint morning light mr raynor anxious about janet be already up now brought in fresh coffee for mr pilgrim having awaked have hurried on clothes be coming in to see how dempster be change from candle light to morning recommencement of same round of thing have happened yesterday be discouragement rather than relief to janet be more conscious of chill weariness new light thrown on husband face seemed to reveal still work that death have be doing through night felt last lingering hope that must ever know again forsake now mr pilgrim having felt pulse be putting brandy in tea spoon between dempsters lip brandy went down breathing became freer janet noticed change heart beat faster a leaned forward to watch suddenly slight movement like passing away of shadow be visible in face opened eye full on janet be almost like meeting again on resurrection morning after night of grave robert do know kept eye fixed on there be faintly perceptible motion of lip a if wanted to speak moment of speech be for ever gone moment for asking pardon of if wanted to ask must read full forgiveness be written in eye never knew for a be bending to kiss thick veil of death fell between lip touched corpse chapter face looked very hard unmoved that surrounded dempsters grave while old mr crewe read burial service in low broken voice pall bearer be such men a mr pittman mr lowme mr budd men whom dempster have called friend while be in life worldly face never look so worldly a at funeral have same effect of grating incongruity a sound of coarse voice breaking solemn silence of night one face have sorrow in be covered by thick crape veil sorrow be suppressed silent one knew how deep be for thought in most of neighbour mind be that mr dempster must hardly have have better fortune than to lose bad husband who have left compensation of good income found difficult to conceive that husband death must be felt by otherwise than a deliverance person who be most thoroughly convinced that janets grief be deep real be mr pilgrim who in general be not at weakly given to belief in disinterested feeling woman have tender heart be frequently heard to observe in morning round about time used to think there be great deal of palaver in may depend upon there pretence about if hed be kindest husband in world couldnt have felt more there great deal of good in mr dempster great deal of good always said so be mr lowmes reply when made observation to be always so very full of pretty attention to when be ill tell now shes turned tryanite if thats shant agree again very inconsistent in think turning round in way after being foremost to laugh at tryanite cant especially in woman of habit must cure herself of before pretend to be over religious well think mean to cure do know said mr pilgrim whose goodwill towards janet be just now quite above temperate point at must indulge feminine patient with little judicious detraction feel sure have not taken stimulant through husband illness have be constantly in way of can see sometimes suffers good deal of depression for want of show more resolution in cure be rare ive known happen sometimes with people of strong will mr lowme took opportunity of retailing mr pilgrim conversation to mr phipps who a victim of pratt plethora must rarely enjoy that pleasure at first hand mr phipps be woman of decided opinion though of wheezy utterance for part remarked im glad to hear there likelihood of improvement in mr dempster think way thing have turned out seems to show that be more to blame than people thought be else why must feel so much about husband dempster understand have left wife pretty nearly property to do a like with isnt behaving like very bad husband dont believe mr dempster can have have so much provocation a pretended ive known husband whove laid plan for tormenting wife when theyre underground tying up money hindering from marrying again not that must ever wish to marry again think one husband in one life be enough in conscience here threw fierce glance at amiable mr phipps who be innocently delighting with faceti in rotherby guardian thinking editor must be droll fellow aggravating to be tied up in way why say mr dempster will have a good a six hundred year at least fine thing for be poor girl without farthing to fortune well if doesnt make duck drake of somehow mr phippss view of janet however be far from being prevalent one in milby even neighbour who have strong personal interest in must hardly see noble looking woman in widow dress with sad sweet gravity in face not be touched with fresh admiration for not feel at least vaguely that have entered on new life in be sort of desecration to allude to painful past old friend who have real regard for whose cordiality have be repelled chilled of late year now came round with hearty demonstration of affection mr jerome felt that happiness have substantial addition now must once more call on nice little woman mr dempster think of with rejoicing instead of sorrow pratts lost time in returning to footing of old established friendship with janet mother miss pratt felt incumbent on on suitable occasion to deliver very emphatic approval of remarkable strength of mind understood mr dempster to be exhibiting miss linnet be eager to meet mr tryans wish by greeting janet a one who be likely to be sister in religious feeling good work mr linnet be so agreeably surprised by fact that dempster have left wife money in handsome way to do what liked with that even included dempster villanous discovery of flaw in title to pyes croft in magnanimous oblivion of past offence mr jerome agreed over friendly cup of tea that there be many husband a be very fine spoken yet while kep will locked up from a tied up a tight a anything assure mr jerome continued dropping voice in confidential manner know more to day about mr jerome will child a be unborn ive fear about income im well aware mr jerome ud niver leave stret for must like to hev thousand two at own disposial make widow deal more looked on perhaps ground of respect to widow might not be entirely without influence on milby mind might do something towards conciliating more aristocratic acquaintance of janets who must otherwise have be inclined to take severest view of apostasy towards evangelicalism error look so very ugly in person of small mean one feel be taking quite liberty in going astray whereas people of fortune may naturally indulge in few delinquency theyve got money for a girl said of mistress who have made herself ill with pickled salmon however may have be there be not acquaintance of janets in milby did not offer civility in early day of widowhood even severe mr phipps be not exception for heaven know what must become of sociality if never visited people speak ill of must live like egyptian hermit in crowded solitude perhaps attention most grateful to janet be of old friend mr crewe whose attachment to favourite proved quite too strong for resentment might be supposed to feel on score of mr tryan little deaf old lady couldnt do without accustomed visitor whom have seen grow up from child to woman always so willing to chat with tell news though be deaf while other people thought tiresome to shout in ear irritated by recommending ear trumpet of various construction friendliness be very precious to janet be conscious of aid gave in self conquest be blessing prayed for with fresh morning chief strength of nature lay in affection coloured rest of mind gave personal sisterly tenderness to act of benevolence made cling with tenacity to object have once stirred kindly emotion ala be unsatisfied wounded affection have made trouble greater than must bear now there be check to full flow of plenteous current in nature gnawing secret anguish overhanging terror inward shame friendly face beamed on felt that friendly heart be approving wishing well mild sunshine of goodwill fell beneficently on new hope effort a clear shining after rain fall on tender leaf bud of spring win from promise to fulfilment needed secondary help for wrestling with past self be not always easy strong emotion from life of human being receives new bias win victory a sea win though advance may be sure will often after mightier wave than usual seem to roll back so far a to lose ground have made janet showed strong bent of will by taking outward precaution against occurrence of temptation mother be now constant companion having shut up little dwelling come to reside in orchard street janet gave dangerous key into keeping entreating to lock away in secret place whenever too well known depression craving threatened must seek refuge in what have always be purest enjoyment in visiting one of poor neighbour in carrying food comfort to sick bed in cheering with smile of familiar dwelling up dingy back lane great source of courage great help to perseverance be sense that have friend teacher in mr tryan must confess difficulty to knew prayed for have always before prospect of soon seeing hearing word of admonition comfort came to charged with divine power such a have never found in human word before so time passed till be far on in may nearly month after husband death when a mother be seated peacefully at breakfast in dining room looking through open window at old fashioned garden where grass plot be now whitened with apple blossom letter be brought in for mr raynor why there thurston post mark on said must be about aunt anna ah so be poor thing shes be taken worse last day two have asked to send for that dropsy be carrying off at last daresay poor thing will be happy release must go dear shes father last sister though be sorry to leave however perhaps will not have to stay

oclock janet having seen mother in coach be to carry to thurston called on way back at mr pettifers found to great disappointment that old friend be gone out for day so wrote on leaf of pocket book urgent request that mr pettifer must come stay with while mother be away desiring servant girl to give to mistress a soon a came home walked on to vicarage to sit with mr crewe thinking to relieve in way feeling of desolateness undefined fear be taking possession of on being left alone for first time since great crisis in life mr crewe too be not at home janet with sense of discouragement for rebuked a childish walked sadly home again when entered vacant dining room must not help bursting into tear be such vague undefinable state of susceptibility a state of excitement depression half mental half physical that determine many tragedy in woman life janet must scarcely eat anything at solitary dinner tried to fix attention on book in vain walked about garden felt very sunshine melancholy between four five oclock old mr pittman called joined in garden where have be sitting for time under one of great apple tree thinking how robert in best mood used to take little mamsey to look at cucumber to see alderney cow with calf in paddock tear sob have come again at thought when mr pittman approached be feeling languid exhausted old gentleman sight sensibility be obtuse to janets satisfaction showed consciousness that be in grief have task to impose upon mr dempster said with certain toothless pomposity habitual to want to look over letter again in dempsters bureau see if can find one from poole about mortgage on house at dingley will be worth twenty pound if can find dont know where can be if isnt among letter in bureau ive looked everywhere at office for im going home now ill call again to morrow if youll be good enough to look in meantime janet said must look directly turned with mr pittman into house search must take time so bade good bye went at once to bureau stood in small back room where dempster used sometimes to write letter receive people who came on business out of office hour have looked through content of bureau more than once to day on removing last bundle of letter from one of compartment saw what have never seen before small nick in wood made in shape of thumb nail evidently intended a mean of pushing aside movable back of compartment in examination hitherto have not found letter a mr pittman have described perhaps there might be more letter behind slide pushed back at once saw letter small spirit decanter half full of pale brandy dempsters habitual drink impetuous desire shook janet through member seemed to master with inevitable force of strong fume flood sens before be aware hand be on decanter pale excited be lifting out of niche when with start shudder dashed to ground room be filled with odour of spirit without staying to shut up bureau rushed out of room snatched up bonnet mantle lay in dining room

across graf to spot know spot where turf be stirred not long ago where tomb be to be erected soon be very near church wall on side now lie in deep shadow quite shut out from ray of westering sun by projecting buttress janet sat down on ground be sombre spot thick hedge surmounted by elm tree be in front of projecting buttress on side wanted to shut out even object thick crape veil be down closed eye behind pressed hand upon wanted to summon up vision of past wanted to lash demon out of soul with stinging memory of bygone misery wanted to renew old horror old anguish that might throw with more desperate clinging energy at foot of cross where divine sufferer must impart divine strength tried to recall first bitter moment of shame be like shuddering discovery of leper that dire taint be upon deeper deeper lapse on coming of settled despair awful moment by bedside of self maddened husband then tried to live through with remembrance made more vivid by contrast blessed hour of hope joy peace have come to of late since whole soul have be bent towards attainment of purity holiness now when paroxysm of temptation be past dread despondency began to thrust like cold heavy mist between heaven to wanted to look for light guidance temptation must come again that rush of desire might overmaster next time must slip back again into deep slimy pit from have be once rescued there might be deliverance for more prayer did not help for fear predominated over trust have confidence that aid sought must be given idea of future fall have grasped mind too strongly alone in way be powerless if must see mr tryan if must confess to might gather hope again must see must go to janet rose from ground walked away with quick resolved step have be seated there long while sun have already sunk be late for to walk to paddiford go to mr tryans where have never called before there be other way of seeing that evening must not hesitate about walked towards footpath through field must take to paddiford without obliging to go through town way be rather long preferred because left le probability of meeting acquaintance shrank from having to speak to one evening red have nearly faded by time janet knocked at mr wagstaffs door good woman looked surprised to see at hour janets mourning weed painful agitation of face quickly brought second thought that urgent trouble have sent there mr

need be too great for must feel nothing sense of coming relief when heard step on stair saw enter room went towards with look of anxiety said fear something be matter fear be in trouble then poor janet poured forth sad tale of temptation despondency even while be confessing felt half burden removed act of confiding in human sympathy consciousness that fellow being be listening to with patient pity prepared soul for stronger leap by faith grasp idea of divine sympathy when mr tryan spoke word of consolation encouragement must now believe message of mercy water flood have threatened to overwhelm rolled back again life once more spread heaven covered space before have be unable to pray alone now prayer bore own soul along with a broad tongue of flame carry upwards in vigorous leap little flickering fire must hardly keep alight by mr tryan be anxious that janet must not linger out at late hour when saw that be calmed said will walk home with now can talk on way janets mind be

of nature have won for when be girl popularity a one know be most complex self multiplying of echo even anti tryanite prejudice must not resist fact that janet dempster be changed woman changed a dusty bruised sun withered plant be changed when soft rain of heaven have fallen on that change be due to mr tryans influence last lingering sneer against evangelical curate began to die out though much of feeling have prompted remained behind there be intimidating consciousness that expression of such feeling must not be effective joke of sort have ceased to tickle milby mind even mr budd mr tomlinson when saw mr tryan passing pale worn along street have secret sense that man be somehow not that very natural comprehensible thing humbug that in fact be impossible to explain from stomach pocket point of view twist stretch theory a might must not fit mr tryan so with remarkable resemblance a to mental process may frequently be observed to exist between plain men philosopher concluded that le said about better among janets neighbourly pleasure there be nothing liked better than to take early tea at white house to stroll with mr jerome round old fashioned garden orchard there be endless matter for talk between good old man for janet have that genuine delight in human fellowship give interest to personal detail come warm from truthful lip besides have common interest in good

illustration of opinion mr jerome have large store of detail about such person a jim hardy coal carrier a lost ho sally butt a hed to sell mangle though be a decent woman a need to be to hearing of detail janet seriously inclined must hardly desire to see prettier picture than kind faced white haired old man telling fragment of simple experience a walked with shoulder slightly bent among moss rose espalier apple tree while janet in widow cap dark eye bright with interest went listening by side little lizzie with nankeen bonnet hanging down back toddled on before mr jerome usually declined lingering stroll often observed niver see like to mr jerome when he got mr dempster to talk to sinnifies nothin to whether weve tea at four at five oclock hed go on till six if youd let alone he like off head however mr jerome must not deny that janet be very pretty spoken woman alys say niver get sich pikelets a mine nowhere know very well other folk buy em at shop thick unwholesome thing might a well eat sponge sight of little lizzie often stirred in janets mind sense of childlessness have made fatal blank in life have fleeting thought that perhaps among husband distant relative there might be child whom must help to bring up little girl whom might adopt promised one day other to hunt out second cousin of married woman of whom have lost sight for many year at present hand heart be too full for to carry out scheme to great disappointment project of settling mr pettifer at holly mount have be delayed by discovery that repair be necessary in order to make house habitable be not till september have set in have satisfaction of seeing old friend comfortably installed room destined for mr tryan looking pretty cosy to heart content have taken several of chief friend into confidence be warmly wishing success to plan for inducing to quit poor mr wagstaffs dingy house dubious cookery that must consent to such change be becoming more more matter of anxiety to hearer for though more decided symptom be yet observable in than increasing emaciation dry hacking cough occasional shortness of breath be felt that fulfilment of mr pratts prediction must not long be deferred that obstinate persistence in labour disregard must soon be peremptorily cut short by total failure of strength hope that influence of mr tryans father sister must prevail on to change mode of life that must perhaps come to live with that sister at least might come to see that argument have failed from other lip might be more persuasive from hers be now quite dissipated father have lately have attack of paralysis must not spare only daughter tendance on mr tryans return from visit to father miss linnet be very anxious to know whether sister have not urged to try change of air from answer gathered that miss tryan wished to give up curacy travel at least go to south devonshire coast why will not do so miss linnet said might come back to well strong have many year of usefulness before no answered quietly think people attach more importance to such measure than be warranted dont see good end be to be served by going to die at nice instead of dying amongst one friend one work can not leave milby at least will not leave voluntarily though remained immovable on point have be compelled to give up afternoon service on sunday to accept mr parry offer of aid in evening service a well a to curtail week day labour have even written to mr prendergast to request that must appoint curate to paddiford district on understanding that new curate must receive salary that mr tryan must co operate with a long a be able hopefulness be almost constant attendant on consumption have not effect of deceiving a to nature of malady of making look forward to ultimate recovery believed to be consumptive have not yet felt desire to escape early death have for time contemplated a probable even diseased hope will take direction from strong habitual bias of mind to mr tryan death have for year seemed nothing else than laying down of burden under sometimes felt fainting be only sanguine about power of work flattered that what be unable to do one week must be equal to next must not admit that in desisting from part of labour be renouncing permanently have lately delighted mr jerome by accepting long proffered loan of little chacenut ho found so much benefit from substituting constant riding exercise for walking that began to think must soon be able to resume of work have dropped that be happy afternoon for janet when after exerting busily for week with mother mr pettifer saw holly mount looking orderly comfortable from attic to cellar be old red brick house with two gable in front two clipped holly tree flanking garden gate simple homely looking place that quiet people might easily get fond of now be scoured polished carpeted furnished so a to look really snug within when there be nothing more to be done janet delighted with contemplating mr tryans study first sitting down in easy chair then lying for moment on sofa that might have keener sense of repose must get from well stuffed article of furniture have gone to rotherby on purpose to choose now mother said when have finished survey have done work a well a fairy mother god mother that ever turned pumpkin into coach horse stay have tea cosily with mr pettifer while go to mr linnet want to tell mary rebecca good news ive got

holly mount be about mile from outskirt of paddiford common where mr linnet house stood nestled among laburnum lilac syringa janets way thither lay for little while along high road then led into deep rutted lane wound through flat tract of meadow pasture while in front lay smoky paddiford away to left mother town of milby there be line of silvery willow marking course of stream group of scotch fir with trunk reddening in level sunbeam nothing to break flowerless monotony of grass hedgerow occasional oak elm few cow sprinkled here there very commonplace scene indeed what scene be ever commonplace in descending sunlight when colour have awakened from noonday sleep long shadow awe like disclosed presence above what scene be commonplace to eye be filled with serene gladness brightens thing with own joy janet just now be very happy a walked along rough lane with buoyant step half smile of innocent kindly triumph played about mouth be delighting beforehand in anticipated success of persuasive power for time painful anxiety about mr tryans health be thrown into abeyance have not gone far along lane before heard sound of horse advancing at walking pace behind without looking back turned aside to make way for between rut did not notice that for moment have stopped have then come on with slightly quickened pace in le than minute heard well known voice say mr dempster turning saw mr tryan close to holding horse by bridle seemed very natural to that must be there mind be so full of presence at moment that actual sight of be only like more vivid thought behaved a be apt to do when feeling obliges to be genuine with total forgetfulness of polite form only looked at with slight deepening of smile be already on face said gently take arm walked on little way in silence be who broke be going to paddiford suppose question recalled janet to consciousness that be unexpected opportunity for beginning work of persuasion that be stupidly neglecting yes said be going to mr linnet

reason a have now dear woman want lodger for know cant afford to live in so large house by knew when persuaded to go there that must be sure to get one shes such comfortable creature to live with didnt like to spend rest of day up that dull passage being at one beck call who wanted to make use of yes said mr tryan quite understand feeling dont wonder at strong regard for well now want other friend to second there be with three room to let ready furnished everything in order know one who think a well of a do who must be doing good round to one know a well a to mr pettifer if must go to live with must leave uncomfortable lodging person be already coveting must take immediately must go to breathe pure air at holly mount gladden mr pettifers heart by letting wait on comfort friend who be quite miserable about mr tryan saw in moment saw that have be done for sake must not be sorry must not say no must not resist sense life have new sweetness for that must like to be prolonged little only little for sake of feeling stronger security about janet when have finished speaking looked at with doubtful inquiring glance be not looking at eye be cast downwards expression of face encouraged said in half playful tone of entreaty will go live with know will will come back with now see house looked at then smiled there be unspeakable blending of sadness sweetness in smile of face sharpened paled by slow consumption that smile of mr tryans pierced poor janets heart felt in at once assurance of grateful affection prophecy of coming death tear rose turned round without speaking went back

desire to die in sight of so autumn rolled gently by in calm decay until november mr tryan continued to preach occasionally to ride about visiting flock to look in at school growing satisfaction in mr walsh a successor saved from too eager exertion from worrying anxiety janet be with great deal now for saw that liked to read to in lengthening evening became rule for mother to have tea at holly mount where with mr pettifer sometimes friend two brought mr tryan unaccustomed enjoyment of companionship by own fireside janet did not share new hope for be not only in habit of hearing mr pratts opinion that mr tryan must hardly stand out through winter also knew that be shared by dr madely of rotherby whom at request have consented to call in be not necessary desirable to tell mr tryan what be revealed by stethoscope janet knew worst felt rebellion under prospect of bereavement rather quiet submissive sorrow gratitude that influence guidance have be given even if only for little while

one who did not retain in after year vivid remembrance of scene there of pale wasted form in easy chair for sat up to last of grey eye so full even yet of inquiring kindness a thin almost transparent hand be held out to give pressure of welcome of sweet woman too whose dark watchful eye detected want who supplied want with ready hand there be others who must have have heart skill to fill place by mr tryans side who must have accepted a honour must not help feeling that god have given to janet by train of event be too impressive not to shame jealousy into silence that sad history most of know
