correspondence between politian be human foible at period incredible a may seem to recite quarrel favour scholarly visitor with communication of entire lengthy correspondence be first second time scala have asked candid opinion of friend a to balance of right wrong in half score latin letter between politian springing out of certain epigram written in most playful tone in world be story of very typical pretty quarrel in be interested because supplied precisely that thistle of hatred necessary according to nello a stimulus to sluggish pace of cautious steed friendship politian having be rejected pretender to love hand of scalas daughter kept very sharp learned tooth in readiness against too prosperous presumptuous secretary who have declined greatest scholar of age for son in law

sitting in gouty slipper penned poetical trifle entirely for own amusement without view to audience consequently sent to friend in letter be literary periodical of fifteenth century now scala have abundance of friend who be ready to praise writing friend like ficino landinoamiable browser in medicean park along with himselfwho found latin prose style elegant masculine terrible joseph scaliger who be to pronounce totally ignorant of latinity be at comfortable distance in next century when be fatal coquetry inherent in superfluous authorship ever quite contented with ready praise of friend critical supercilious politiana fellow browser who be far from amiablemust be made aware that solid secretary showed in leisure hour pleasant fertility in verse indicated pretty clearly how much might do in way if be not man of affair ineffable moment when man secretly hate sends latin epigram with false genderhendecasyllables with questionable elision at least toe too muchattempts at poetic figure be manifest solecism moment have come to politian secretary have put forth soft head from official shell terrible lurking crab be down upon politian have used freedom of friend pleasantly in form of latin epigram corrected mistake of scala in making culex insect too well known on bank of arno of inferior feminine gender scala replied by bad joke in suitable latin verse referring to politians unsuccessful suit better better politian found verse very pretty highly facetious more be pity that be seriously incorrect inasmuch a scala have alleged that have written in imitation of greek epigram politian being on such friendly term must enclose greek epigram of own on same interesting insectnot may presume out of wish to humble scala rather to instruct said epigram containing lively conceit about venus cupid culex of kind much tasted at period founded partly on zoological fact that gnat like venus be born from water scala in reply begged to say that verse be never intended for scholar with such delicate olfactories a politian nearest of living men to perfection of ancient of taste so fastidious that sturgeon must seem insipid to defended own verse nevertheless though indeed be written hastily without correction intended a agreeable distraction during summer heat to such friend a be satisfied with mediocrity scala not being like other people who courted publicity through bookseller for rest have barely enough greek to make out sense of epigram so graciously sent to say nothing of tasting elegance butthe epigram be politians what more need be said still by way of postscript feared that incomparable friend comparison of gnat to venus on account of origin from water be in many way ticklish on one hand venus might be offended on other unless poet intended allusion to doctrine of thales cold damp origin seemed doubtful to scala in case of creature so fond of warmth fish be perhaps better comparison when power of flying be in question eagle indeed when darkness be taken into consideration bat owl be le obscure more apposite parallel etcetera etcetera here be great opportunity for politian be not aware wrote that when have scalas verse placed before there be question of sturgeon rather of frog gudgeon made short work with scalas defence of own latin mangled terribly on score of stupid criticism have ventured on greek epigram kindly forwarded to a model wretched cavil indeed for a to damp origin of gnat there be authority of virgil who have called alumnus of water a to what dear dull friend have to say about fish eagle rest be nihil ad rem for because eagle must fly higher by mean followed that gnat must not fly at etcetera etcetera be ashamed however to dwell on such triviality thus to swell gnat into elephant for own part must only add that have nothing deceitful double about be to be caught when present by false blandishment of who slandered in absence agreeing rather with homeric sentiment on headwhich furnished greek quotation to serve a powder to bullet quarrel must not end there logic must hardly get worse secretary got more pompously self asserting scholarly poet temper more more venomous politian have be generously willing to hold up mirror by too inflated secretary beholding own likeness might be induced to cease setting up ignorant defence of bad latin against ancient authority whom consent of century have placed beyond questionunless indeed have designed to sink in literature in proportion a rose in honour by sort of compensation men of letter might feel equal in return politian be begged to examine scalas writing nowhere must find more devout admiration of antiquity secretary be ashamed of age in lived blushed for indeed there be who wanted to have own work praised exalted to level with divine monument of antiquity scala must not oblige a to honour be offensive to envious have be well earned witness whole life since came in penury to florence elegant scholar in reply be not surprised that scala found age distasteful to since be so distasteful to age nay be with perfect accuracy that elegant scholar have called scala branny monster inasmuch a be formed from off scouring of monster born amidst

containing correspondence be brought out to day here be new greek scholar whose accomplishment be to be tested on nothing did scala more desire dispassionate opinion from person of superior knowledge than on greek epigram of politians after sufficient introductory talk concerning tito travel after survey discussion of gem easy passage from mention of lamented lorenzos eagerness in collecting such specimen of ancient art to subject of classical taste study in general present condition in florence be inevitable to mention politian man of eminent ability indeed little too arrogantassuming to be hercules whose office be to destroy literary monstrosity of age writing letter to elder without signing a if be miraculous revelation must only have one source after be not own criticism often questionable taste perverse be fond of saying pungent thing about men who thought wrote like cicero because ended sentence with esse videtur while be boasting of freedom from servile imitation did not fall into other extreme running after strange word affected phrase even in much belauded miscellanea be point tenable tito who have just be looking into miscellanea found so much to say be agreeable to secretaryhe must have done so from mere disposition to please without further motivethat showed quite worthy to be made judge in notable correspondence concerning culex here be greek epigram politian have doubtless thought finest in world though have pretended to believe that transmarini greek must make light of have not be unintentionally speaking truth in false modesty tito be ready scarified epigram to scalas content o wise young judge must doubtless appreciate satire even in vulgar tongue scalawho excellent man not seeking publicity through bookseller be never unprovided with

intolerable must be if be not well supplied with ring of rare virtue with amulet worn close under right breast tito be assured that be more interesting than gem have won way to scala palace by recommendation of bardo de bardi who to be sure be scalas old acquaintance worthy scholar in spite of overvaluing little frequent foible in secretary friend must come again on ground of own manifest

up at said timidly will let answered only by smile by leading forward in front of cerretano who seeing excellent jest in tessas evident delusion assumed surpassing sacerdotal solemnity went through mimic ceremony with liberal expenditure of lingua furbesca thief latin symptom of new movement in crowd urged to bring to speedy conclusion dismiss with hand outstretched in benedictory attitude over kneeling figure tito disposed always to cultivate goodwill though might be least select put piece of four grossi into hand a moved away be thanked by look conjuror felt sure conveyed perfect

rising high pale on frescoed wall pale face of sorrow looking out from below next moment eye met fra lucas a looked up at from crucifix be absorbed in pang of recognition identified monkish emaciated form with image of fair young brother dino said in voice like low cry of pain did not bend towards held erect paused at two yard distance from there be unconquerable repulsion for in monkish aspect seemed to brand of dastardly undutifulness have left father desolateof grovelling superstition must give such undutifulness name of piety father whose proud sincerity simplicity of life have made one of few frank pagan of time have brought up with silent ignoring of claim church must have to regulate belief action of being with cultivated reason church in mind belonged to actual life of mixed multitude from have always lived apart have idea must render brother course object of other feeling than incurious indignant contempt yet lovingness of romolas soul have clung to image in past while stood rigidly aloof there be yearning search in eye for something too faintly discernible there be corresponding emotion in face of monk looked at little sister returned to in full womanly beauty with far off gaze of revisiting spirit sister said with feeble interrupted yet distinct utterance be well thou hast not longer delayed to come for have message to deliver to thee time be short romola took step nearer message thought must be one of affectionate penitence to father heart began to open nothing must wipe out long year of desertion culprit looking back on year with sense of irremediable wrong committed must call forth pity now at last there must be understanding forgiveness dino must pour out natural filial feeling must ask question about father blindnesshow rapidly have come on how long dark day have be filled what life be now in home where have be nourishedand last message from dying lip must be one of tenderness regret romola fra luca began have have vision concerning thee

before natural duty deep sunken hazel eye turned slowly towards rested upon in silence for moment a if be meditating whether must answer no said at last speaking a before in low passionless tone a of spirit not human speaking through dying human organ have never repented fleeing from stifling poison breath of sin be hot thick around threatened to steal over sens like besotting wine father must not hear voice called night day knew nothing of demon tempter tried to drag back from following father have lived amidst human sin misery without believing in have be like one busy picking shining stone in mine while there be world dying of plague above spoke listened with scorn told study wished to live for be childish triflingdead toysor else must be made warm living by pulse beat to worldly ambition fleshly lust for worldly ambition fleshly lust made substance of poetry history wanted to bend eye on continually have not father led pure noble life then romola burst forth unable to hear in

of man to die to mortal need live in life of god a unseen perfectness to attain must forsake world must have affection hope wedding to passeth away must live with fellow being only a human soul related to eternal unseen life that need be urging continually came over in vision when mind fell away weary from vain word record passion of dead men came over after have be tempted into sin have turned away with loathing from scent of emptied cup in vision saw meaning of crucifix paused breathing hard for minute two romola be not prompted to speak again be useless for mind to attempt contact with mind of unearthly brother a useless a for hand to try grasp shadow when spoke again heaving chest be quieter felt whom must follow saw that even among servant of cross who professed to have renounced world soul must be stifled with fume of hypocrisy lust pride god have not chosen a chose saint dominic saint francis to wrestle with evil in church in world called upon to flee took sacred vow fledfled to land where danger scorn want bore continually like angel to repose on bosom of god have lived life of hermit have ministered to pilgrim task have be short veil have worn very thin that divide from everlasting rest came back to florence that dino did want to know if father be alive interrupted romola picture of suffering life touching again with desire for union forgiveness that before died might urge others of brother to study eastern tongue a have not done go out to greater end than did find already bent on work since came romola have felt be sent partly to theenot to renew bond of earthly affection to deliver heavenly warning conveyed in vision for have have that vision thrice through year since first divine voice called while be yet in world have be taught guided by vision for in painful linking together of waking thought can never be sure that have not mingled own error with light have prayed for in vision dream be passive soul be a instrument in divine hand therefore listen speak not againfor time be short romolas mind recoiled strongly from listening to vision indignation have subsided be only because have felt distance between brother widening while fra luca be speaking figure of monk have entered again stood on other side of bed with cowl drawn over head kneel daughter for angel of death be present wait while message of heaven be delivered bend thy pride before be bent for thee by yoke of iron said strong rich voice startlingly in contrast with fra lucas tone be not that of imperious command of quiet self possession assurance of right blended with benignity romola vibrating to sound looked round at figure on opposite side of bed face be hardly discernible under shadow of cowl eye fell at once on hand be folded across breast lay in relief on edge of black mantle have marked physiognomy enforced influence of voice be very beautiful almost of transparent delicacy romolas disposition to rebel against command doubly active in presence of monk whom have be taught to despise must have fixed on repulsive detail a point of support face be hidden hand seemed to have appeal in against hardness next moment right hand took crucifix to relieve fatigued grasp of fra luca left touched lip with wet sponge lay near in act of bending cowl be pushed back feature of monk have full light of taper on be very marked feature such a lend to popular description there be high arched nose prominent under lip coronet of thick dark hair above brow seeming to tell of energy passion there be blue grey eye shining mildly under auburn eyelash seeming like hand to tell of acute sensitiveness romola felt certain be feature of fra girolamo savonarola prior of san marco whom have chiefly thought of a more offensive than other monk because be more noisy rebellion be rising against first impression have almost forced to bend knee kneel daughter penetrating voice said again pride of body be barrier against gift purify soul be looking at with mild fixedness while spoke again felt that subtle mysterious influence of personality by have be given to rare men to move fellow slowly romola fell on knee in very act tremor came over in renunciation of proud erectness mental attitude seemed changed found in new state of passiveness brother began to speak again romola in deep night a lay awake saw father roomthe librarywith book marble leggio where used to stand read saw youyou be revealed to a see now with fair long hair sitting before father chair at leggio stood man whose face must not see looked looked be blank to

become longer more frequent be now compelled to cease by severe fit of gasping in eye be turned on crucifix a on light be vanishing presently found strength to speak again in feebler scarcely audible tone to renounce vain philosophy corrupt thought of heathen for in hour of sorrow death pride will turn to mockery unclean god will word died away in spite of thought be at work in romola telling that vision be more than dream fed by youthful memory ideal conviction strange awe have come over mind be not apt to be assailed by sickly fancy have vivid intellect healthy human passion be too keenly alive to constant relation of thing to have morbid craving after exceptional still image of vision despised jarred distressed like painful cruel cry be first time have witnessed struggle with

clear voice do really care for enough then to banish chill fancy will always be suspecting a great tempter said tito with bright smile how must not care for more than for everything else everything

armour be characteristic fact in tito experience at crisis that direct measure for ridding of baldassarre ever occurred to other possibility passed through mind even to own flight from florence never thought of scheme for removing enemy dread generated active malignity must still have be glad not to give pain to mortal have simply chosen to make life easy to himselfto carry human lot if possible

emotion there be plenty among who have very moderate faith in frates prophetic mission who in cooler moment loved little nevertheless too be carried along by great wave of feeling gathered force from sympathy lay deeper than theory loud responding sob rose at once from wide multitude while savonarola have fallen on knee buried face in mantle felt in moment rapture glory of martyrdom without agony in great sob of multitude baldassarres have mingled among human being present there be perhaps not one whose frame vibrated more strongly than to tone word of preacher have vibrated like harp of

stood not far off observing be piero di cosimo who took heed of preaching having come solely to look at escaped prisoner during pause in preacher audience have given up to inarticulate emotion new comer advanced touched baldassarre on arm looked round with tear still slowly rolling down face with vigorous sigh a if have done with outburst painter spoke to in low tone will cut cord for have heard how be made prisoner baldassarre did not reply immediately glanced suspiciously at officious stranger at last said if will better come outside said piero baldassarre again looked at suspiciously piero partly guessing thought smiled took out knife cut cord began to think that idea of prisoner madness be not improbable there be something so peculiar in expression of face well thought if doe mischief hell soon get tied up again poor devil will have chance at least be afraid of said again in undertone dont want to tell anything about baldassarre be folding arm in enjoyment of long absent muscular sensation answered piero with le suspicious look tone have quiet decision in have nothing to tell a please said piero perhaps want shelter may not know how hospitable florentine be to visitor with torn doublet empty stomach there hospital for poor traveller outside gate if liked must put in way to one there danger from french soldier have be sent off baldassarre nodded turned in silent acceptance of offer piero left church together wouldnt like to sit to for portrait must said piero a went along via dell oriuolo on way to gate of santa croce be painter must give money to get

facesfaces such a masaccio have painted more than fifty year before such a domenico ghirlandajo have not yet quite left off painting morning be peculiar occasion frates audience always multifarious have represented even more completely than usual various class political party of florence there be men of high birth accustomed to public charge at home abroad who have become newly conspicuous not only a enemy of medici friend of popular government a thorough piagnoni espousing to utmost doctrine practical teaching of frate frequenting san marco a seat of samuel of men of authoritative handsome presence like francesco valori perhaps also of hot arrogant temper very much gratified by immediate divine authority for bringing about freedom in own way others like soderini with le of ardent piagnone more of wise politician there be men also of family like piero capponi simply brave undoctrinal lover of sober republican liberty who preferred fighting to arguing have particular reason for thinking idea false that kept out medici made room for public spirit at elbow be doctor of law whose study of accursius brother have not so entirely consumed ardour a to prevent from becoming enthusiastic piagnoni messer luca corsini for example who on memorable occasion yet to come be to raise learned arm in street stone throwing for cause of religion freedom frate among dignity who carried black lucco furred mantle with air of habitual authority there be abundant sprinkling of men with more contemplative sensitive face scholar inheriting such high name a strozzi acciajoli who be already minded to take cowl join community of san marco artist wrought to new higher ambition by teaching of savonarola like young painter who have lately surpassed in fresco of divine child on wall of frates bare cellunconscious yet that must one day wear tonsure cowl be called fra bartolommeo there be mystic poet girolamo benevieni hastening perhaps to carry tidings of beloved frates speedy

class of frates disciple there be long stream of poorer tradesman artisan whose faith hope in divine message varied from rude undiscriminating trust in a friend of poor enemy of luxurious oppressive rich to eager tasting of subtlety of biblical interpretation take peculiarly strong hold on sedentary artisan illuminating long dim space beyond board where stitch with pale flame seems to light of divine science among various disciple of frate be scattered many who be not in least disciple be mediceans who have already from motif of fear policy begun to show presiding spirit of popular party

important social fact there be even of bitter enemy member of old aristocratic anti medicean partydetermined to try get rein once more tight in hand of certain chief family else licentious young men who detested a killjoy of florence for sermon in duomo have already become political incident attracting ear of curiosity malice a well a of faith men of idea like young niccol macchiavelli went to observe write report to friend away in country villa men of appetite like dolfo spini bent on hunting down frate a public nuisance who made game scarce went to feed hatred lie in wait for ground of accusation perhaps while preacher ever have more massive influence than savonarola preacher ever have more heterogeneous material to work upon one secret of massive influence lay in highly mixed character of preaching baldassarre wrought into ecstasy of self martyring revenge be only extreme case among partial narrow sympathy of audience in savonarola preaching there be strain appealed to very finest susceptibility of men nature there be element gratified low egoism tickled gossiping curiosity fascinated timorous superstition need of personal predominance labyrinthine allegorical interpretation of scripture enigmatic vision false certitude about divine intention never ceased in own large soul to be ennobled by fervid piety passionate sense of infinite active sympathy that clear sighted demand for subjection of selfish interest to general good have in common with greatest of mankind for mass of audience pregnancy of preaching lay in strong assertion of supernatural claim in denunciatory vision in false certitude gave sermon interest of political bulletin having once held audience in mastery be necessary to natureit be necessary for welfarethat must keep mastery

of florence in next few day have sold sapphire have added to clothing have bought bright dagger have still pair of gold florin left meant to hoard treasure carefully lodging be outhouse with heap of straw in in thinly inhabited part of oltrarno thought of looking about for work a porter have bought dagger at brattis paying meditated visit there one evening at dusk have found that singular rag merchant just returned from one of round emptying out basketful of broken glass old iron amongst handsome show of miscellaneous second hand good a baldassarre entered shop looked towards smart piece of apparel musical instrument weapon be displayed in broadest light of window eye at once singled out dagger hanging up high against red scarf by buying dagger must not only satisfy strong desire must open original errand in more indirect manner than by speaking of onyx ring in course of bargaining for weapon let drop with cautious carelessness that came from genoa have be directed to brattis shop by acquaintance in city who have bought very valuable ring here have respectable trader more such ring whereupon bratti have much to say a to unlikelihood of such ring being within reach of many people with much vaunting of own rare connection due to known wisdom honesty might be true that be pedlarhe chose to be pedlar though be rich enough to kick heel in shop day who thought have said there be to be said about bratti when have called pedlar be good deal further off truth than other side of pisa how be that must put ring in stranger way be because have very particular knowledge of handsome young signor who did not look quite so fine feathered bird when bratti first set eye on a did at present time by question two baldassarre extracted without trouble such rough rambling account of tito life a pedlar must give since time when have found sleeping under loggia de cerchi never occurred to bratti that decent man who be rather deaf apparently asking to say many thing twice over have curiosity about curiosity be doubtless about a truly remarkable pedlar baldassarre left brattis shop not only with dagger at side also with general knowledge of tito conduct positionof early sale of jewel immediate quiet settlement of at florence marriage great prosperity what story have told about previous lifeabout father must be difficult for baldassarre to discover answer to question meanwhile wanted to learn must about florence found to acute distress that of new detail learned must only retain few only by continual repetition began to be afraid of listening to new discourse lest must obliterate what be already striving to remember day be discerned by tito in piazza del duomo have fresh anguish of consciousness in mind tito ready speech fell upon like mockery of glib defying

striving get firm grasp somewhere lift above water flowed over be tempted bought cheapest greek book must see carried home sat on heap of straw looking at character by light of small window inward light arose on soon evening darkness came made little difference to baldassarre strained eye seemed still to see white page with unintelligible black mark upon chapter xxxi fruit be seed romola said

adherence to bardos wish about library have become under existing difficulty piece of sentimental folly deprived romola of substantial advantage might perhaps never have wrought into action for event of past week have brought at once pressure of new motive outlet of rare opportunity nay be not till dread have be aggravated by sight of baldassarre looking more like sane not until have begun to feel that might be compelled to flee from florence that have brought to resolve on using legal right to sell library before great opportunity offered by french milanese bidder slipped through finger for if

when be old father have great deal of fire in eye when be young be what must never understand that with fiery spirit seemed much more impatient than mine must hang over book live with shadow life however have put heart into bernardo gave slight shrug a spoke last word romola discerned in voice feeling accorded with own be disappointed to last said involuntarily immediately fearing lest word must be taken to imply accusation against tito went on almost hurriedly if must only see longest dearest wish fulfilled just to mind well so may said bernardo kindly rising putting on cap time be cloudy now fish be caught by waiting who know when wheel have turned often enough may be gonfaloniere yet before die creditor can touch thing looked round a spoke then turning to patting cheek said need not be afraid of dying ghost will claim nothing ive taken care of in will romola seized hand be against cheek put to lip in silence havent be scolding husband for keeping away from home so much

contented then madonna orgogliosa said bernardo smiling a moved to door assuredly poor romola there be one thing must have made pang of disappointment in husband harder to bear be that one must know gave cause for disappointment might be woman weakness be closely allied to woman nobleness who willingly lift up veil of married life have profaned from sanctuary into vulgar place chapter xxxii revelation next day romola like other florentine be excited about departure of french besides other reason for gladness have dim hope be conscious be half superstitious that new anxiety about tito having come with burdensome guest might perhaps vanish with french have be in florence hardly eleven day in space have felt more acute unhappiness than have known in life before tito have adopted hateful armour on day of arrival though must frame distinct notion why departure must remove cause of fearthough when thought of cause image of prisoner grasping a have seen in pieros sketch urged before excluded otherstill when french be gone must be rid of something be strongly associated with pain wrapped in mantle waited under loggia at top of house watched for glimpse of troop royal retinue passing bridge on way to porta san piero look towards siena rome even returned to station when gate have be closed that might feel vibrating with great peal of bell be dusk then when at last descended into library lit lamp with resolution that must overcome agitation have made idle day sit down to work at copying of catalogue tito have left home early in morning did not expect yet before came intended to leave library sit in pretty saloon with dancing nymph bird have done so evening since have objected to library a chill gloomy to great surprise have not be at work long before tito entered first thought be how cheerless must feel in wide darkness of great room with one little oil lamp burning at further end fire nearly out almost ran towards tito dearest did not know must come so soon said nervously putting up white arm to unwind becchetto be not welcome then said with one of brightest smile clasping playfully holding head back from tito uttered word in tone of pretty loving reproach then kissed fondly stroked hair a manner be seemed not to mind about taking off mantle yet romola quivered with delight emotion of day have be preparing in keener sensitiveness to return of habitual manner will come back be saying to herself old happiness will perhaps come back be like again tito be taking great pain to be like heart be palpitating with anxiety if have expected so soon said romola a at last helped to take off wrapping must have have little festival prepared to joyful ringing of bell did not mean to be here in library when came home never mind sweet said carelessly think about fire comecome sit down there be low stool against tito chair be romolas habitual seat when be talking together rested arm on knee a used to do on father looked up at while spoke have never yet noticed presence of portrait have not mentioned itthinking of more have be enjoying clang of bell for first time tito began liked being shaken deafened by fancied be something like bacchante possessed by divine rage be not people looking very joyful to night joyful after sour pious fashion said tito with shrug in truth who be left behind in florence have little cause to be joyful seems to most reasonable ground of gladness must be to have got out of florence tito have sounded desired key note without trouble appearance of premeditation spoke with emphasis looked grave enough to make romola ask rather anxiously why tito be there fresh trouble need of fresh one romola there be three strong party in city ready to fly at others throat if frates party be strong enough to frighten other two into silence a seems most likely life will be a pleasant amusing a funeral have plan of great council simmering already if get man who sings sacred lauds loudest will be most eligible for office besides that city will be so drained by payment of great subsidy to french king by war to get back pisa that prospect must be dismal enough without rule of fanatic on whole florence will be delightful place for worthy who entertain in evening by going into crypt lashing for everything else exile have best of for own part have be thinking seriously that must be wise to quit florence romola started tito how must leave florence surely think must leave itat least not yetnot for long while have turned cold trembling did not find quite easy to speak tito must know reason have in mind be fabric of own imagination sweet one secluded life have made lay such false stress on few thing know used to tell before be married that wished be somewhere else than in florence if have seen more place more people must know what mean when say that there be something in florentine reminds of cutting spring wind like people who take life le eagerly must be good for romola too to see new life must like to dip little in soft water of forgetfulness leaned forward kissed brow laid hand on fair hair again felt caress no more than if have kissed mask be too much agitated by sense of distance between mind to be conscious that lip touched tito be not because suppose florence be pleasantest place in world desire not to quit be because ibecause have to see father wish fulfilled godfather be old be seventy one must not leave to be precisely superstition hang about mind like bedimming cloud romola make one great reason why must wish be two hundred league from florence be obliged to take care of in opposition to own will if dear eye look so tender see falsely must see for save wife from wasting life in disappointing by impracticable dream romola sat silent motionless must not blind to direction in tito word pointed wanted to persuade that might get library deposited in monastery take other ready mean to rid of task of tie to florence be determined never to submit mind to judgment on question of duty to father be inwardly prepared to encounter sort of pain in resistance determination be kept latent in first moment by heart crushing sense now at last tito must be confessedly divided in wish be glad of silence for much a have feared strength of feeling be impossible for shut up in narrowness hedge in merely clever unimpassioned men not to over estimate persuasiveness of own argument conduct did not look ugly to imagination did not suffice to show exactly how must look to romola went on in same gentle remonstrating tone know dearestyour own clear judgment always showed youthat notion of isolating collection of book antiquity attaching single name to for ever be one have valid substantial good for object yet more one be liable to be defeated in thousand way see what have become of medici collection for part consider even blameworthy to entertain petty view of appropriation why must one be reasonably glad that florence must posse benefit of learned research taste more than other city understand feeling about wish of dead wisdom put limit to sentiment else life might be continually wasted in sort of futile devotionlike praising deaf god for ever gave life to father while lived why must demand more of because be trust said romola in low distinct voice trusted trusted tito did not expect to feel anything else about itto feel a dobut did expect to feel that yes dearest of course must feel on point where father real welfare happiness be concerned there be question of now if believed in purgatory must be a anxious a to have mass said if believed must now pain father to see library preserved used in rather different way from what have set mind on must share strictness of view little philosophy must teach to rid ourselves of air woven fetter mortal hang round spending life in misery under mere imagination of weight mind seizes idea so readily romola be able to discriminate between substantial good brain wrought fantasy ask dearest what possible good can book antiquity do stowed together under father name in florence more than must do if be divided carried elsewhere nay be not very dispersion of such thing in hand

pressure of new revelation tito be making of for resistance to find strong vent a fluent talk fell on ear there be rising contempt within only made more conscious of bruised despairing love love for tito have married believed in nature possessed with energy of strong emotion recoiled from hopelessly willow readiness professed to appropriate widest sympathy have pulse for nearest still spoke like one who be restrained from showing felt have only drawn away arm from knee sat with hand clasped before cold motionless a locked water talk of substantial good tito be faithfulness love sweet grateful memory good be no good that must keep silent promise on others build because believe in love truth be no good that just life must be justly honoured be good that must harden heart against want hope of who have depended on what good can belong to men who have such soul to talk cleverly perhaps find soft couch for live die with base self a best companion voice have gradually risen till there be ring of scorn in last word made slight pause saw there be other word quivering on lip chose to let come know of good for city world if be to be made up of such being be not thinking of other italian city

there be nothing harder to come than struggle against tito suggestion a against meaner part of herself have begun to see clearly that must not persuade into assent must take course show that time for resistance be past at least must put end to further struggle if disclosure be not made by to night to morrow must be made in way necessity nerved courage experience of affectionateness unexpected submissiveness ever since marriage until now encouraged to hope at last must accommodate to what have be will be sorry to hear speak in spirit of blind persistence romola said quietly because obliges to give pain partly foresaw opposition a prompt decision be necessary avoided that obstacle decided without consulting very care of husband for wife interest compels to separate action sometimeseven

industrious in prospect of more dialogue of pleasure must give poor old stranger by showing baby before must get ready to take baldassarre breakfast found that monna lisa have be employing a drawer of water deferred paternoster hurried down to insist that baldassarre must sit on straw so that might come sit by again while ate breakfast that attitude made new companionship more delightful to tessa

in by blank look taught to say never mind be stranger be matter about having name good bye now because want breakfast will come here rest when like monna lisa say may dont be unhappy for well be good to poor thing said baldassarre again chapter xxxiv place for repentance messer naldo came again sooner than be expected came on evening of twenty eighth of november only eleven day after previous visit proving that have not gone far beyond mountain scene have witnessed a took place that evening in via de bardi may help to explain impulse turned step towards hill of san giorgio when tito have first found home for tessa on return from rome more than year half ago have acted persuaded simply under constraint imposed on by own kindliness after unlucky incident have made foolish little tessa imagine to be husband be true that kindness be manifested towards pretty trusting thing whom be impossible to be near without feeling inclined to caress pet be not le true that tito have movement of kindness towards apart from contemplated gain to otherwise charming a prettiness prattle be in lazy moment might have preferred to be free from for be not in love with tessahe be in love for first time in life with entirely different woman whom be not simply inclined to shower caress on whose presence possessed so that simple sweep of long tress across cheek seemed to vibrate through hour young ideal passion have in have be stirred by romola fibre be too fine intellect too bright for to be tempted into habit of gross pleasure seeker have spun web about tessa felt incapable of breaking in first moment after mimic marriage have be prompted to leave under illusion by distinct calculation of own possible need since critical moment seemed to that web have gone on spinning in spite of like growth over have power element of kindness self indulgence be hard to distinguish in soft nature like tito annoyance have felt under tessas pursuit of on day of betrothal thorough intention of revealing truth to with set out to fulfil promise of seeing again be sufficiently strong argument to that in ultimately leaving tessa under illusion providing home for have be overcome by own kindness in day of first devotion to romola needed self justifying argument have learned to be glad that be deceived about thing strong feeling make to conscience of ownhas own piety just a much a feeling of son towards mother will sometimes survive amid worst fume of depravation tito must not yet be easy in committing secret offence against wedded love be more careful in taking precaution to preserve secrecy of offence monna lisa who like many of class never left habitation except to go to one two particular shop to confession once year knew nothing of real name whereabout only know that paid so a to make very comfortable minded little about rest save that got fond of tessa found pleasure in care for be paid there be mystery behind clearly since tessa be contadina messer naldo be signor for aught monna lisa knew might be real husband for tito have thoroughly frightened tessa into silence about circumstance of marriage by telling that if broke that silence must never see again monna lisas deafness made impossible to say anything to without premeditation have saved tessa from incautious revelation to such a have run off tongue in talking with baldassarre for long while tito visit be so rare that seemed likely enough took journey between be prompted chiefly by desire to see that thing be going on well with tessa though always found visit pleasanter than prospect of italways felt anew charm of pretty ignorant lovingness trusthe have not yet real need of be determined if possible to preserve simplicity on charm depended to keep tessa genuine contadina not place small field flower among condition must rob of grace must have be shocked to see in dress of other rank than own piquancy of talk must be gone if thing began to have new relation for if world became wider pleasure le childish squirrel like enjoyment of nut at discretion marked standard of luxury have provided for by mean tito saved tessas charm from being sullied also by convenient coincidence saved from aggravating expense be already rather importunate to man whose money be required for avowed habit of life in brief have be history of tito relation to tessa up to very recent date be true that once twice before bardos death sense that there be tessa up hill with whom be possible to pas hour agreeably have be inducement to to escape from little weariness of old man when for lack of positive engagement might otherwise have borne weariness patiently shared romolas burden moment when have first felt real hunger for tessas ignorant lovingness belief in have not come till quite lately be distinctly marked out by circumstance a little to be forgotten a oncoming of malady have permanently vitiated sight hearing be day when have first seen baldassarre have bought armour returning across bridge night with coat of mail in hand have felt unconquerable shrinking from immediate encounter with romola too knew little of actual world too trusted have uneasy consciousness behind frank eye there be nature must judge that ill founded trust of hers sprang not from pretty brute like incapacity from nobleness might prove alarming touchstone wanted little ease little repose from self control after agitation exertion of day wanted to be where must adjust mind to morrow without caring how behaved at present moment there be sweet adoring creature within reach whose presence be a safe unconstraining a of own kidswho must believe fable remain quite unimpressed by public opinion so on evening when romola be waiting listening for turned step up hill wonder then that step took same course on evening eleven day later when have have to recoil under romolas first outburst of scorn must not wish tessa in wife place refrain from wishing that wife must be thoroughly reconciled to for be romola not tessa belonged to world where larger desire of man who have ambition effective faculty must necessarily lie wanted refuge from standard disagreeably rigorous of must not make independent simply by thinking folly tessas little soul be that inviting refuge be not much more than eight oclock when went up stone step to door of tessas room usually heard entrance into house ran to meet not to night when opened door saw reason single dim light be burning above dying fire showed tessa in kneeling attitude by head of bed where baby lay head have fallen aside on pillow brown rosary usually hung above pillow over picture of madonna golden palm branch lay in loose grasp of right hand have gone fast asleep over bead tito stepped lightly across little room sat down close to have probably heard opening of door a part of dream for have not be looking at two moment before opened eye opened without start remained quite motionless looking at a if sense that be there smiling at shut out impulse must disturb that happy passiveness when put hand under chin stooped to kiss said dreamed then said be dreamingand then awoke be true little sinner said tito pinching chin have not said half prayer will punish by not looking at baby be ugly tessa did not like word even though tito be smiling have pouting distress in face a said bending anxiously over baby ah be not true be prettier than anything think be ugly will look at be even prettier than when saw beforeonly he asleep cant see eye tongue cant show hairand growsisnt that wonderful look at true face be very much alike when he asleep there be not so much to see a when he awake if kiss very gently wont wake want to kiss be not true satisfied by giving small mummy butterfly kiss then putting hand on shoulder turning face towards said like looking at baby better than looking at husband false one be still kneeling now rested hand on knee looking up at like one of fra lippo lippi round cheeked adoring angel said shaking head love always best only want to look at bambino love used only to want to love did expect to come again so soon said tito inclined to make prattle still felt effect of agitation have undergonestill felt like man who have be violently jarred be easiest relief from silence solitude ah said tessa have counted daysto day began at right thumb againsince put on beautiful chain coat that messer san michele gave to take care of on journey have got on now said peeping through opening in breast of tunic perhaps made come back sooner perhaps did tessa said dont mind coat now tell have happened since

tessa said tito rather anxiously make haste tell yes will let sit on knee because then think will not be so frightened took on knee put arm round looked grave seemed that something unpleasant must pursue even here at first didnt mean to tell said tessa speaking almost in whisper a if must mitigate offence because thought old man must be gone away before came again must be a if have not be now be there be come never did anything told not to do before want to tell then will perhaps forgive for be long while before go to confession yes tell everything tessa began to hope be after trivial matter oh will be sorry for im afraid cry about something when dont see be not reason went to first be because wanted to talk to show baby be stranger lived nowhere thought wouldnt care so much about talking to think be not bad old man wanted to come sleep on straw next to goat made monna lisa say yes might he away day almost when come back talk to take something to eat beggar suppose be naughty

sometimes think be not in right mind lupo at peretola be not in right mind look little like lupo sometimes a if didnt know where be what sort of face have said tito heart beginning to beat strangely be so haunted by thought of baldassarre that be already whom saw in imagination sitting on straw not many yard from fetch stool tessa sit on will not forgive said timidly moving from knee yes will not be angryonly sit down tell what sort of old man be cant think how to tell be not like stepfather nofri anybody face be yellow have deep mark in hair be white there be none on top of head eyebrow be

seeing object word suggested be absent glance frightened must not help going to kneel at side again did not heed dared not touch speak to knelt trembling wondering state of mind suggesting bead to took from floor began to tell again pretty lip moving silently blue eye wide with anxiety struggling tear tito be quite unconscious of movementsunconscious of own attitude be in wrapt state in man will grasp painful roughness press press closer never feel new possibility have risen before might dissolve at once wretched condition of fear suppression be marring life destiny have brought within reach opportunity of retrieving moment on step of duomo when past have grasped with living quivering hand have disowned few step might be face to face with father with witness by might seek forgiveness reconciliation there be money now from sale of library to enable to leave florence without disclosure go into southern italy where under probable french rule have already laid foundation for patronage romola need never know whole truth for must have certain mean of identifying prisoner in duomo with baldassarre of learning what have taken place on step except from baldassarre if father forgave must also consent to bury offence with possibility of relief by easy spring from present evil there rose other possibility that fierce hearted man might refuse to be propitiated welland if did thing must only be a have be before for there must be witness by be not repentance with white sheet round taper in hand confessing hated sin in eye of men that tito be preparing for be repentance must make thing pleasant again keep past unpleasant thing secret tito soft heartedness indisposition to feel in harsh relation with creature be in strong activity towards father now father be brought near to must be state of ease that nature must not desire if poisonous hatred in baldassarres glance must be replaced by something of old affection complacency tito longed to have world once again completely cushioned with goodwill longed for more eagerly because of what have just suffered from collision with romola be not difficult to to smile pleadingly on whom have injured offer to do much kindness quickness of intellect must tell exactly taste of honey on lip of injured opportunity be there raised inclination hemmed in calculating activity of thought started up stepped towards door tessas cry a dropped bead roused from absorption turned said tessa get lantern dont cry little pigeon be not angry went down stair tessa be going to shout need of lantern in monna lisas ear when tito who have opened door said stay tessano want lantern go upstairs again keep quiet say nothing to monna lisa in minute stood before closed door of outhouse where moon be shining white on old paintless wood in last decisive moment tito felt tremor upon hima sudden instinctive shrinking from possible tiger glance possible tiger leap yet why must young man be afraid of old one young man with armour on of old man without weapon be moment hesitation tito laid hand on door be father asleep be there nothing else door screened from voice glance magic must turn into ease baldassarre be not asleep there be square opening high in wall of hovel through moonbeam sent in stream of pale light if tito must have looked through opening must have seen father seated on straw with something shone like white star in hand baldassarre be feeling edge of poniard taking refuge in sensation from hopeless blank of thought seemed to lie like great gulf between passion aim be in one of most wretched moment of conscious helplessness have be poring while be light over book lay open beside then have be trying to recall name of jewel symbol engraved on though at certain other time have recovered of name symbol to night be gone into darkness effort at inward seeing have seemed to end in utter paralysis of memory be reduced to sort of mad consciousness that be solitary pulse of just rage in world filled with defiant baseness have clutched unsheathed dagger for long while have be feeling edge mind narrowed to one image dream of one sensationthe sensation of plunging that dagger into base heart be unable to pierce in other way tito have hand on door be pulling dragged against ground a such old door often do baldassarre startled out of dreamlike state rose from sitting posture in vague amazement not knowing where be have not yet risen to foot be still kneeling on one knee when door came wide open saw dark against moonlight with ray falling on one bright mass of curl one rounded olive cheek image of reverienot shadowyclose real like water at lip after thirsty dream of thought must come athwart that eager thirst in one moment before tito must start back old man with preternatural force of rage in limb have sprung forward dagger have flashed out in next moment dagger have snapped in two baldassarre under parrying force of tito arm have fallen back on straw clutching hilt with bit of broken blade pointed end lay shining against tito foot tito have felt one great heart leap of terror a have staggered under weight of thrust felt now triumph of deliverance safety armour have be proved vengeance lay helpless before triumph raised devilish impulse on contrary sight of father close to unable to injure made effort at reconciliation easier be free from fear have only more unmixed direct want to be free from sense that be hated after have looked at other little while baldassarre lying motionless in despairing rage tito said in soft tone just a have sounded before last parting on shore of greece padre mio there be pause after word movement sound till said came to ask forgiveness again paused that healing balm of word might have time to work there be sign of change in baldassarre lay a have fallen leaning on one arm be trembling be from shock have thrown down be taken by surprise that morning wish now to be son to again wish to make rest of life happy that may forget what have suffered paused again have used clearest strongest word must think of be useless to say more until have sign that baldassarre understood perhaps mind be too distempered too imbecile even for perhaps shock of fall disappointed rage might have quite suspended use of faculty presently baldassarre began to move threw away broken dagger slowly gradually still trembling began to raise from ground tito put out hand to help so strangely quick be men soul that in moment when began to feel atonement be accepted have darting thought of irksome effort entailed baldassarre clutched hand be held out raised clutched still going close up to tito till face be not foot off other then began to speak in deep trembling voice saved youi nurtured youi loved forsook meyou robbed meyou denied what can give have made world bitterness to there be one draught of sweetness leftthat will know agony let fall tito hand going backwards little first rested arm on projecting stone in wall then sank again in sitting posture on straw outleap of fury in dagger thrust have evidently exhausted tito stood silent if have be deep yearning emotion have brought to ask father forgiveness denial of might have caused pang must have excluded rushing train of thought followed decisive word a be though sentence of unchangeable hatred grated on jarred terribly mind glanced round with self preserving instinct to see how far word must have force of substantial threat when have come down to speak to baldassarre have said to that if effort at reconciliation failed thing must only be a have be before first glance of mind be backward to thought again future possibility of danger be conjured up along with brought perception that thing be not a have be before perception came a triumphant relief there be not only broken dagger there be certainty from what tessa have told that baldassarres mind be broken too have edge must reach tito felt have choice now must defy baldassarre a mad imbecile old man chance be so strongly on side that there be hardly room for fear except fear of having to do many unpleasant thing in order to save from what be yet more unpleasant one of unpleasant thing must be done immediately be very difficult do mean to stay here said said baldassarre bitterly mean to turn out not so said tito only ask tell have turned out if be straw turned off three year ago then mean to leave place said tito more anxious about certainty than ground of have spoken said baldassarre tito turned re entered house monna lisa be nodding went up to tessa found cry by side of baby tessa said sitting down taking head between hand leave off cry little goose listen to lifted chin upward that might look at while spoke very distinctly emphatically must never speak to old man again be mad old man want to kill never speak to listen to again tessas tear have ceased lip be pale with fright be gone away whispered will go away remember what have said to yes will never speak to stranger more said tessa with sense of guilt told to comfort that must come again to morrow then went down to monna lisa to rebuke severely for letting dangerous man come about house tito felt that be odious task be very evil tasted morsel be forced upon heard monna lisa fasten door behind turned away without looking towards open door of hovel felt secure that baldassarre must go must not wait to see go even young frame elastic spirit be shattered by agitation have be crowded into single evening baldassarre be still sitting on straw when shadow of tito passed by before lay fragment of broken dagger beside lay open book over have pored in vain looked like mocking symbol of utter helplessness body be still too trembling for to rise walk away next morning very early when tessa peeped anxiously through hole in shutter door of hovel be open strange old man be gone chapter xxxv what florence be thinking of for several day tito saw little of romola told gently next morning that must be better for to remove small article of own from library a there must be agent coming to pack up antiquity then leaning to kiss on brow suggested that must keep in own room where little painted tabernacle be where be then sitting so that might be away from noise of strange footstep romola assented quietly making sign of emotion night have be one long waking to

that sweet clinging instinct stronger than judgment began to see now made great charm of wife still petrified coldness be better than passionate futile opposition pride capability of seeing where resistance be useless have convenience when door have closed on tito romola lost look of cold immobility came over like inevitable frost whenever approached inwardly be very far from being in state of quiet endurance day have passed since scene have divided from tito have be day of active planning preparation for fulfilment of purpose first thing did now be to call old maso to maso said in decided

again into time of perfect trust felt again presence of husband whose love made world a fresh wonderful to a to little child that sits in stillness among sunny flower heard gentle tone saw soft eye without lie in breathed again that large freedom of soul come from faith that being who be nearest to be greater than ourselves in brief moment tear always rose woman lovingness felt something akin to what bereaved mother feel when tiny finger seem to lie warm on bosom yet be marble to lip a bend over silent bed there be something else lying in chest besides wedding clothes be something dark coarse rolled up in close bundle turned away eye from white gold to dark bundle a hand touched serge tear began to be checked that coarse roughness recalled fully to present from love delight be gone unfastened thick white cord spread bundle out on table be grey serge dress of sister belonging to third order of saint francis living in world especially devoted to deed of pietya personage whom florentine be accustomed to call pinzochera romola be going to put on dress a disguise determined to put on at once so that if needed sleep before morning might wake up in perfect readiness to be gone put off black garment a thrust soft white arm into harsh sleeve of serge mantle felt hard girdle of rope hurt finger a tied courted rude sensation be in keeping with new scorn of thing called pleasure made men basethat dexterous contrivance for selfish ease shrinking from endurance strain when others be bowing beneath burden too heavy for now made one image with husband then gathered long hair together drew away tight from face bound in great hard knot at back of head taking square piece of black silk tied in fashion of kerchief close across head under chin over drew cowl lifted candle to mirror surely disguise must be complete to one who have not lived very near to to herself looked strangely like brother dino full oval of cheek have only to be wasted eye already sad have only to become little sunken be getting more like in anything else only in that understood now how men must be prompted to rush away for ever from earthly delight how must be prompted to dwell on image of sorrow rather than of beauty joy did not linger at mirror set about collecting packing relic of father mother be too large to be carried in small travelling wallet be to be put in chest along with wedding clothes chest be to be committed to godfather when be safely gone first laid in portrait then one by one little thing have sacred memory clinging to be put into wallet into chest paused there

by active life be knit together so a to make inexorable external identity for not to be shaken by wavering consciousness gave strange effect to simple movement towards taking off ringa movement be small sequence of energetic resolution brought vague arresting sense that be somehow violently rending life in two presentiment that strong impulse have seemed to exclude doubt make path clear might after be blindness that there be something in human bond must prevent from being broken with breaking of illusion if beloved tito who have placed betrothal ring on finger be not in valid sense same tito whom have ceased to love why must return to sign of union not rather retain a memorial act came a palpable demonstration of own identity have power unexplained to herself of shaking romola be way

to write hand fell bitter tear came now at delusion have blighted young year tear very different from sob of remembered happiness with have looked at circlet of pearl pink hailstone now felt tingling shame at word of ignominy have cast at titohave robbed one else who be not dead to have have such word wrung from herto have uttered to husband seemed degradation of whole life hard speech between who have loved be hideous in memory like sight of greatness beauty sunk into vice rag heart cutting comparison of present with past urged upon romola till even transformed into wretched sensation seemed benumbed to everything inward throbbing began to feel need of hard contact drew hand tight along harsh knotted cord that hung from waist started to foot seized rough lid of chest there be nothing else to go in closed lid pressing hand upon rough carving locked then remembered that have still to complete equipment a pinzochera large leather purse scarsella with small coin in have to be hung on cord at waist florin small jewel present from godfather cousin brigida be safely fastened within serge mantleand on other side must hang rosary did not occur to romola a hung that rosary by side that something else besides mere garb must perhaps be necessary to enable to pas a pinzochera that whole air expression be a little a possible like of sister whose eyelid be used to be bent whose lip be used to move in silent iteration inexperience prevented from picturing distant detail helped proud courage in shutting out foreboding of danger insult did not know that florentine woman have ever done exactly what be going to do unhappy wife often took refuge with friend in cloister knew course be impossible to have invented lot for herselfto go to most learned woman in world cassandra fedele at venice ask how instructed woman must support in lonely life there be not daunted by practical difficulty in way dark uncertainty at end life must never be happy more must not must not be ignoble by pathetic mixture of childish romance with woman trial philosophy have nothing to do with great decisive deed of hers have place in imagination of future so far a conceived solitary loveless life at saw animated by proud stoical heroism by indistinct strong purpose of labour that might be wise enough to write something must rescue father name from oblivion after be only young girlthis poor romola who have found at end of joy there be other thing yet to be done there be small key in casket on tablebut now romola perceived that taper be dying out have forgotten to provide with other light in few moment room be in total darkness feeling way to nearest chair sat down to wait for morning purpose in seeking key have called up certain memory have come back upon during past week with new vividness remembered word always have for when have learned to give new meaning since shock of revelation have seemed to divide for ever from tito that last interview with dino have never be for many hour together out of mind solicited more because while remembered image pressed upon almost with imperious force of sensation raised struggling thought resisted influence must not prevent from hearing inwardly dying prophetic voice saying again againthe man whose face be blank loosed thy hand departed a went must see face be face of great tempter thou romola didst wring thy hand seek for water there be none plain be bare stony again thou wast alone in midst of then seemed that night fell saw more must not prevent from dwelling with sort of agonised fascination on wasted face on straining gaze at crucifix on awe have compelled to kneel on last broken word then unbroken silenceon detail of death scene have seemed like sudden opening into world apart from of lifelong knowledge mind be roused to resistance of impression that from being obvious phantom seemed to be getting solid in daylight a strong body struggle against fume with more violence when begin to be stifling strong soul struggle against phantasy with more alarmed energy when threaten to govern in place of thought have word of vision to do with real sorrow that fitting of certain word be mere chance rest be vaguenay word be vague be determined by nothing brother memory belief believed there be something fatal in pagan learning believed that celibacy be more holy than marriage remembered home object in library of thread vision be woven what reasonable warrant must have have for believing in such vision acting on none true a voice of foreboding have proved romola saw with unshaken conviction that to have renounced tito in obedience to warning like must have be meagre hearted folly trust have be delusive must have chosen over again to have acted on rather than be creature led by phantom disjointed whisper in world where there be large music of reasonable speech warm grasp of living hand persistent presence of memory linking in imagination with actual lot gave glimpse of understanding into life have before lain utterly aloof from sympathythe life of men woman who be led by such inward image voice if be only little stronger in said to herself must lose sense of what vision really be take for prophetic light might in time get to be seer of vision like suora maddalena camilla rucellai rest romola shuddered at possibility instruction main influence of life have gone to fortify scorn of sickly superstition led men woman with eye too weak for daylight to sit in dark swamp try to read human destiny by chance flame of wandering vapour yet be conscious of something deeper than coincidence of word made parting contact with dying brother live anew in mind gave new sisterhood to wasted face if there be much more of such experience a in world must like to understand itwould even like to learn thought of men who sank in ecstasy before pictured agony of martyrdom there seemed to be something more than madness in supreme fellowship with suffering spring be dried up around wondered what other water there be at men drank found strength in desert moment in duomo when have sobbed with mysterious mingling of rapture pain while fra girolamo offered willing sacrifice for people came back to a if have be transient taste of such far off fountain again shrank from impression be alluring within sphere of vision narrow fear compelled men to outrage natural affection a dino have done be tangled web romola have in mind a sat weary in darkness radiant angel came across gloom with clear message for in time a now there be human being who never saw angel heard perfectly clear message such truth a came to be brought confusedly in voice deed of men not at like seraph of unfailing wing piercing visionmen who believed falsity a well a truth did wrong a well a right helping hand stretched out to be hand of men who stumbled often saw dimly so that being unvisited by angel have other choice than to grasp that stumbling guidance along path of reliance action be path of life else to pause in loneliness disbelief be path arrest of inaction death so romola seeing ray across darkness heavy with conflict changed nothing sank at last to sleep chapter xxxvii tabernacle unlocked romola be waked by tap at door cold light of early morning be in room maso be come for travelling wallet old man must not help starting when opened door showed instead of graceful outline have be used to crowned with brightness of hair thick fold of grey mantle pale face shadowed by dark cowl be well maso said romola trying to speak in calmest voice make old man easy here be wallet quite ready will go on quietly will not be far behind when get out of gate may go more slowly for will perhaps join before get to trespiano closed door behind then put hand on key have taken from casket last thing in night be original key of little painted tabernacle tito have forgotten to drown in arno have lodged a such small thing will in corner of embroidered scarsella wore with purple tunic one day long after marriage romola have found there have put by without using with sense of satisfaction that key be within reach cabinet on tabernacle stood have be moved to side of room close to one of window where pale morning light fell upon so a to make painted form discernible enough to romola who knew wellthe triumphant bacchus with cluster vine clad spear clasping crowned ariadne love showering rose wreathed vessel cunning eyed dolphin rippled sea encircled by flowery border like bower of paradise romola looked at familiar image with new bitterness repulsion seemed more pitiable mockery than ever on chill morning when have waked up to wander in loneliness have be tomb of sorrow lying screen foolish ariadne with gaze of love a if bright face with hyacinthine curl like tendril among vine held deep secret of life ariadne be wonderfully transformed thought romola must look strange among vine rose now took up mirror looked at once more sight be so startling in morning light that laid down again with sense of shrinking almost a strong a with have turned from joyous ariadne recognition of own face with cowl about brought back dread lest must be drawn at last into fellowship with wretched superstitioninto company of howling fanatic weeping nun who have be contempt from childhood till now thrust key into tabernacle hurriedly hurriedly opened took out crucifix without looking at then with trembling finger passed cord through little ring hung crucifix round neck hid in bosom of mantle for dinos sake said to herself still there be letter to be written maso be to carry back from bologna be very brief first said tito love for be dead therefore so far a be yours too be dead try to put in force law for sake of fetching back must bring happiness romola married can never return

word of parting to farewell second father best thing have in life be still to remember goodness be grateful to romola romola put letter along with crucifix within bosom of mantle then felt that everything be done be ready now to depart one be stirring in house went almost a quietly a grey phantom down stair into silent street heart be palpitating violently yet enjoyed sense of firm tread on broad flagsof swift movement be like chained up resolution set free at last anxiety to carry out act dread of obstacle averted sorrow a reached ponte rubaconte felt le that santa croce be in sight

porta san gallo from must leave city road carried by piazza di santa croce walked a steadily rapidly a ever through piazza not trusting to look towards church thought that eye might be turned on with look of curiosity recognition indifferent mind might be set speculating on private sorrow made romola shrink physically a from imagination of torture felt degraded even by act of husband from be helplessly suffering there be sign that eye looked forth from window to notice tall grey sister with firm step proud attitude of cowled head road lay aloof from stir of early traffic when reached porta san gallo be easy to pas while dispute be going forward about toll for pannier of egg market produce be just entering out once past house of borgo must be beyond last fringe of florence sky must be broad above must have entered on new lifea life of loneliness endurance of freedom have be strong enough to snap asunder bond have accepted in blind faith befell must no more feel breath of soft

worship have forsaken for ever presently light burst forth with sudden strength shadow be thrown across road seemed that sun be going to chase away greyness light be perhaps never felt more strongly a divine presence stirring inarticulate sensibility be deepest life than in moment when instantaneously awakens shadow certain awe inevitably accompanied most momentous act of life became more conscious element in romolas feeling a found in sudden presence of impalpable golden glory long shadow of herself be not to be escaped hitherto have met no one occasional contadino with mule many turning of road on level prevented from seeing that maso be not very far ahead of when have passed pietra be on rising ground lifted up hanging roof of cowl looked eagerly before cowl be dropped again immediately have seen not maso buttwo monk who be approaching within few yard of edge of cowl making pent house on brow have shut out object above level of eye for last few moment have be looking at nothing brightness on path at own shadow tall shrouded like dread spectre wished now that have not looked up disguise made especially dislike to encounter monk might expect pious password of knew nothing walked along with careful appearance of unconsciousness till have seen skirt of black mantle pas by encounter have made heart beat disagreeably for romola have uneasiness in religious disguise shame at studied concealment be made more distinct by special effort to appear unconscious under actual glance black skirt must be gone faster because be going down hill seeing great flat stone against cypress rose from projecting green bank yielded to desire slight shock have given to sit down rest turned back on florence not meaning to look at till monk be quite out of sight raising edge of cowl again when have seated discerned maso mule at distance where be not hopeless for to overtake a old man must probably linger in expectation of meanwhile might pause little be free alone chapter

conjecture that object of gathering be political though perhaps nothing more distinct than strengthening of party come from good fellowship good dish good wine be at time believed to heighten consciousness of political preference in inspired ease of after supper talk be supposed that people ascertained own opinion with clearness quite inaccessible to uninvited florentine be sober frugal people wherever men have gathered wealth madonna della gozzoviglia san buonvino have have worshipper rucellai be among few florentine family who kept great table lived splendidly be not probable that on evening there must be attempt to apply high philosophic theory there must be objection to bust of plato looking on even to modest presence of cardinal virtue in fresco on wall bust of plato have be

presence conscious of amazingly pure latinity say erasmus not to be caught speaking latinno word of latin to be sheared off by sharpest of teuton welcomed tito with more marked favour than usual gave place between lorenzo tornabuoni giannozzo pucci of accomplished young member of medicean party of course talk be lightest in world while brass bowl filled with scented water be passing round that company might wash hand ring flashed on white finger under wax light there be pleasant fragrance of fresh white damask newly come from france tone of remark be very common one in time one asked what dante pattern old florentine must think if life must come into again under leathern belt bone clasp must see silver fork on table be agreed on hand that habit of posterity must be very surprising to ancestor if ancestor must only know while silver fork be just dallying with appetising delicacy introduced more serious business of suppersuch a morsel of liver cooked to exquisite point that must melt in mouththere be time to admire design on enamelled silver centre of brass service to say something a usual about silver dish for confetti masterpiece of antonio pollajuolo whom patronising pope have seduced from native florence to more gorgeous rome ah remember said niccol ridolfi middle aged man with negligent ease of manner seeming to claim nothing be really based on lifelong consciousness of commanding ranki remember antonio getting bitter about chiselling enamelling of metal thing taking in fury to painting because said artist who put work into gold silver put brain into melting pot be not unlikely to be true foreboding of antonios said giannozzo pucci if pretty war with pisa go on revolt only spread little to other town be not only silver dish be likely to go doubt whether antonios silver saint round altar of san giovanni will not day vanish from eye of faithful to be worshipped more devoutly in form of coin frate be preparing for already said tornabuoni be telling people that god will not have silver crucifix starving stomach that church be best adorned with gem of holiness fine gold of brotherly love very useful doctrine of war finance a many condottiere have found said bernardo rucellai drily politics come on after confetti lorenzo when can drink wine enough to wash down be too solid to be taken with roast boiled yes indeed said niccol ridolfi luigi pulci must have said delicate boiled kid must be eaten with impartial mind remember one day at careggi when luigi be in rattling vein be maintaining that nothing perverted palate like opinion opinion said corrupts salivathats why men took to pepper scepticism be only philosophy that doesnt bring taste in mouth nay say poor lorenzo de medici must be out there luigi here be untainted sceptic matteo franco who want hotter sauce than of because have strong opinion of flash out luigi be original egg of other opinion sceptic belief in immortality of own verse be such logician a preaching friar who described pavement of bottomless pit poor luigi mind be like sharpest steel can touch nothing without cutting yet very gentle hearted creature said giannozzo pucci seemed to talk be mere blowing of soap bubble what dithyramb went into about eating drinking yet be a temperate a butterfly light talk solid eatable be not soon at end for after roast boiled meat came indispensable capon game crowning glory of well spread table peacock cooked according to receipt of apicius for cooking partridge namely with feather on not plucked afterwards a great authority ordered concerning partridge on contrary so disposed on dish that might look a much a possible like live peacock taking unboiled repose great be skill required in confidential servant who be official carver respectfully to turn classical though insipid bird on back expose plucked breast from be to dispense delicate slice to of honourable company unless one must be of so independent mind a to decline that expensive toughness prefer vulgar digestibility of capon hardly one be so bold tito quoted horace dispersed slice in small particle over plate bernardo rucellai made learned observation about ancient price of peacock egg did not pretend to eat slice niccol ridolfi held mouthful on fork while told favourite story of luigi pulcis about man of siena who wanting to give splendid entertainment at moderate expense bought wild goose cut off beak webbed foot boiled in feather to pas for pea hen in fact very little peacock be eaten there be satisfaction of sitting at table where peacock be served up in remarkable manner of knowing that such caprice be not within reach of who supped with very wealthiest men must have be rashness to speak slightingly of peacock flesh other venerable institution at time when fra girolamo be teaching disturbing doctrine that be not duty of rich to be luxurious for sake of poor meanwhile in chill obscurity surrounded centre of warmth light savoury odour lonely disowned man be walking in gradually narrowing circuit paused among tree looked in at window made brilliant picture against gloom must hear laughter must see tito gesticulating with careless grace hear voice now alone now mingling in merry confusion of interlacing speech baldassarres mind be highly strung be preparing for moment when must win entrance into brilliant company have savage satisfaction in sight of tito easy gaiety seemed to be preparing unconscious victim for more effective torture men seated among branching taper flashing cup must know nothing of pale fierce face watched from without light can be curtain a well a darkness talk went on with more eagerness a became le disconnected trivial sense of citizenship be just then strongly forced even on most indifferent mind what overmastering fra girolamo be saying prompting be really uppermost in thought of one at table before stewed fish be removed while favourite sweet be yet to come name rose to surface of conversation in spite of rucellais previous prohibition talk again became political at first while servant remained present be mere gossip what have be done in palazzo on first day voting for great council how hot tempered domineering francesco valori be a if be to have everything own way by right of austere virtue how be clear to everybody who heard soderinis speech in favour of great council also heard frates sermon that be kneaded in same trough opinion be said niccol ridolfi that frate have longer head for public matter than soderini piagnone among may depend on that soderini be mouthpiece more than be soderinis niccol there differ from said bernardo ruccellai frate have acute mind readily see what will serve own end be not likely that pagolantonio soderini who have have long experience of affair have specially studied venetian council must be much indebted to monk for idea on subject soderini load cannon though grant fra girolamo brings powder light match be master of people people be getting master of ecco well said lorenzo tornabuoni presently when room be clear of servant nothing wine be passing round whether soderini be indebted not be indebted to frate for general amnesty have gone along with scheme of council might have done without fear of god reform of moral being passed by majority of black bean excellent proposition that medicean head must be allowed to remain comfortably on shoulder that must not be obliged to hand over property in fine have warm approval be belief that nothing frates predominance must have procured that for may rely on that fra girolamo be a firm a rock on point of promoting peace have have interview with there be murmur of surprise curiosity at farther end of table bernardo rucellai simply nodded a if knew what tornabuoni have to say wished to go on yes proceeded tornabuoni have be favoured with interview in frates own cell let tell be not common favour for have reason to believe that even francesco valori very seldom see in private however think saw more willingly because be not ready made follower have to be converted for part see clearly enough that only safe wise policy for mediceans to pursue be to throw strength into scale of frates party be not strong enough to make head on own behalf if frate popular party be upset one who hears know perfectly well what other party must be uppermost just now nerli alberti pazzi restarrabbiati a somebody christened other daywho instead of giving amnesty must be inclined to fly at throat like mad dog not be satisfied till have banished half of there be strong interjection of assent to last sentence of tornabuonis a paused looked round moment wise dissimulation went on be only course for moderate rational men in time of violent party feeling need hardly tell company be real political attachment be not only man here who have strong personal tie to banished family apart from such tie agree with more experienced friend who be allowing to speak for in presence that only lasting peaceful state of thing for florence be predominance of single family interest theory of frates that be to have popular government in man be to strive only for general good know party name be theory may do for isle of cristoforo colombo finding will never do for fine old quarrelsome florence change must come before long with patience caution have chance of determining change in favour meanwhile best thing can do will be to keep frates flag flying for if other be to be hoisted just now must be black flag for true said niccol ridolfi in curt decisive way what say be true lorenzo for own part be too old for anybody to believe that ive changed feather there be certain of usour old bernardo del nero for onewhom must never persuade to borrow man shield can lie still like sleepy old dog clear enough that barking must be of use just now a for psalm singing party who vote for nothing glory of god want to make believe can love other talk a if vice must be swept out with besom by magnificent eight day will not be long one after talk of scholar there be two sort of government one where men show teeth at other one where men show tongue lick foot of strongest theyll get great council finally voted to morrowthats certain enoughand theyll think theyve found out new plan of government a sure a there human skin under lucco in council new plan will end like other in snarling in licking thats view of thing a plain man not that consider becoming in men of family following who have got others depending on constancy on sticking to colour to go hunting with fine net to catch reason in air like doctor of law say frankly that a head of family will be true to old alliance have never yet seen chalk mark on political reason to tell be true be false friend bernardo rucellai here be man of reason know have objection to anybodys finding fine spun reason for so that dont interfere with action a man of family who have faith to keep with connection if be appeal to niccol said bernardo rucellai with formal dignity in amusing contrast with ridolfis curt pithy ease may take opportunity of saying that while wish be partly determined by long standing personal relation can not enter into positive scheme with person over whose action have control might be content with restoration of old order of thing with modificationswith important modification one point on wish to declare concurrence with lorenzo tornabuoni be that best policy to be pursued by friend be to throw weight of interest into scale of popular party for condescend to dissimulation do at present see party scheme that command full assent in alike there be crudity confusion of idea of twenty men who be colleague in present crisis there be not one with whom find in wide disagreement niccol ridolfi shrugged shoulder left to one else to take up ball a wine went round talk became more more frank lively desire of several at once to be chief speaker a usual caused company to break up into small knot of two three be result have be foreseen by lorenzo tornabuoni giannozzo pucci be among first to turn aside from highroad of general talk enter into special conversation with tito who sat between gradually pushing away seat turning back on table wine in truth melema tornabuoni be saying at stage laying one hose clad leg across knee of other caressing ankle know of man in florence who can serve party better than see what most of friend be men who can more hide prejudice than dog can hide natural tone of bark else men whose political tie be so notorious that must always be object of suspicion giannozzo here flatter be able to overcome suspicion have power of concealment finesse without rational cultivated man instead of having prerogative be really at disadvantage compared with wild bull savage except know of one else on whom must rely for necessary discretion yes said giannozzo pucci laying hand on tito shoulder fact be tito mio can help better than if be ulysses for be convinced that ulysses often made disagreeable to manage men one ought to have sharp mind in velvet sheath there be not soul in florence who must undertake business like journey to rome for example with same safety that can there be scholarship may always be pretext for such journey what be better there be talent must be harder to match than scholarship niccol macchiavelli might have done for if have be on side hardly so well be too much bitten with notion have not power of fascination worse for have lost great chance in life have got yes said tornabuoni lowering voice in significant manner have only to play game well melema future belongs to for medici may rely upon will keep foot in rome a well a in florence time may not be far off when will be able to make finer career for adherent even than did in old day why shouldnt take order day there cardinal at end of road must not be first greek who have worn that ornament tito laughed gaily be too acute not to measure tornabuonis exaggerated flattery still flattery have pleasant flavour joint be not so stiff yet said that cant be induced to run without high prize a think income of abbey two held in commendam without trouble of getting head shaved must satisfy at present be not joking said tornabuoni with grave suavity think scholar must always be better off for taking order well talk of time one of object to be first borne in mind be that must win confidence of men who hang about san marco be what giannozzo will do may carry farther than can because be le observed in way can get thorough knowledge of doings will make broader screen for agency on side nothing of course can be done before start for rome because bit of business between piero de medici french noble must be effected at once mean when come back of course need say more believe must make pet votary of san marco if liked be wise enough to know effective dissimulation be never immoderate if be not that adhesion to popular side be necessary to safety a agent of party tito mio said giannozzo pucci who be more fraternal le patronising in manner than tornabuoni must have wished skill to have be employed in way for be still better fitted now must look out for other man among who will manage to get into confidence of sworn enemy arrabbiati need to know movement more than of frates party who be strong enough to play above board still must have be difficult thing for from known relation with medici little while back that sort of kinship wife have with bernardo del nero must find man who have distinguished connection who have not yet taken side tito be pushing hair backward automatically a manner be looking straight at pucci with scarcely perceptible smile on lip need to look out for one else said promptly can manage whole business with perfect ease will engage to make special confidant of thick headed dolfo spini know project before know tito seldom spoke so confidently of own power be in state of exaltation at sudden opening of new path before where fortune seemed to have hung higher prize than have thought of hitherto hitherto have seen success only in form of favour now flashed on in shape of powerof such power a be possible to talent without traditional tie without belief party thought of a tool might become dependent on position a alien indifference to idea prejudice of men amongst whom moved be suddenly transformed into advantage became newly conscious of own adroitness in presence of game that be called on to play motif might have made tito shrink from triple deceit came before a tempting game have be slowly strangled in by successive falsity of life life make moral tradition for individual self a life of mankind at large make moral tradition for race to have once acted nobly seems reason why must always be noble tito be feeling effect of opposite tradition have won memory of self conquest perfect faithfulness from must have sense of falling triple colloquy went on with growing spirit till be interrupted by call from table probably movement came from listener in party who be afraid lest talker must tire at event be agreed that there have be enough of gravity rucellai have just ordered new flask of montepulciano how many minstrel be there among said when there have be general rallying round table melema think be chief matteo will give lute ah yes said giannozzo pucci lead last chorus from polizianos orfeo that have found excellent measure for will fall in ciascum segua o bacco te bacco bacco evoe evoe servant put lute into tito hand then said something in undertone to master little subdued questioning answering went on between while tito touched lute in preluding way to strain of chorus there be confusion of speech musical humming round table bernardo rucellai have said wait moment melema word have be unheard by tito who be leaning towards pucci singing low to phrase of maenad chorus noticed nothing until buzz round table suddenly ceased note of own voice with soft low toned triumph evoe evoe fell in startling isolation be strange moment baldassarre have moved round table till be opposite tito a hum ceased there might be seen for instant baldassarres fierce dark eye bent on tito bright smiling unconsciousness while low note of triumph dropped from lip into silence tito looked up with slight start lip turned pale seemed hardly more moved than giannozzo pucci who have looked up at same momentor even than several others round table for sallow deep lined face with hatred in eye seemed terrible apparition across wax lit ease gaiety tito quickly recovered self command mad old manhe look like ithe be mad be instantaneous thought brought courage with for must conjecture inward change in baldassarre since have met before just let eye fall laid lute on table with apparent ease finger pinched neck of lute hard while governed head glance sufficiently to look with air of quiet appeal towards bernardo rucellai who said at once good man what be business what be important declaration that have to make messer bernardo rucellai wish honourable friend to know in what sort of company be sitting there be traitor among there be general movement of alarm one present except tito thought of political danger not of private injury baldassarre began to speak a if be thoroughly assured of what have to say in spite of long preparation for moment there be tremor of overmastering excitement in voice passion shook went on did not say what have meant to say a fixed eye on tito again passionate word be like blowsthey defied premeditation there be man among who be scoundrel liar robber be father to took from beggary when be child reared cherished taught made scholar head have lain hard that might have pillow left in slavery sold gem be mine when came again denied last word have be uttered with almost convulsed agitation baldassarre paused trembling glance be turned on tito who be now looking straight at baldassarre be moment of desperation annihilated feeling in except determination to risk anything for chance of escape gathered confidence from agitation by baldassarre be evidently shaken have ceased to pinch neck of lute have thrust thumb into belt while lip have begun to assume slight curl have never yet done act of murderous cruelty even to smallest animal must utter cry at moment must have be capable of treading breath from smiling child for sake of own safety what doe mean melema said bernardo rucellai in tone of cautious surprise a well a rest of company felt relieved that tenor of accusation be not political messer bernardo said tito believe man be mad did not recognise first time encountered in florence know now that be servant who year ago accompanied adoptive father to greece be dismissed on account of misdemeanour name be jacopo di nola even at time believe mind be unhinged for without reason have conceived strange hatred towards now be convinced that be labouring under mania cause to mistake identity have already attempted life since have be in florence be in constant danger from be object of pity rather than of indignation be too certain that father be dead have only word for must leave to judgment how far be probable that man of intellect learning must have be lurking about in dark corner for last month with purpose of assassinating how far be probable that if man be second father must have motive for denying that story about being rescued from beggary be vision of diseased brain will be satisfaction to at least if will demand from proof of identity lest malignant person must choose to make mad impeachment reproach to tito have felt more more confidence a went on lie be not so difficult when be once begun a word fell easily from lip gave sense of power such a men feel when have begun muscular feat successfully in way acquired boldness enough to end with challenge for proof baldassarre while have be walking in garden afterwards waiting in outer room of pavilion with servant have be making anew digest of evidence must bring to prove identity tito baseness recalling description history of gem assuring by rapid mental glance that must attest learning travel might be partly owing to nervous strain that new shock of rage felt a tito lie fell on ear brought strange bodily effect with cold stream seemed to rush over last word of speech seemed to be drowned by ringing chime thought gave way to dizzy horror a if earth be slipping away from under one in room be looking at a tito ended saw that eye have have such fierce intensity only few minute before have now vague fear in clutched back of seat be silent hardly evidence must have be more in favour of tito assertion surely have seen man before somewhere said tornabuoni certainly have said tito readily in low tone be escaped prisoner who clutched on step of duomo did not recognise then look now more a used to do except have more unmistakable air of mad imbecility cast doubt on word melema said bernardo rucellai with cautious gravity be right to desire positive test of fact then turning to baldassarre said if be person claim to be can doubtless give description of gem be property myself be purchaser of more than one gem from messer titothe chief ring believe in collection one of be fine sard engraved with subject from homer if a allege be scholar rightful owner of ring can doubtless turn to noted passage in homer from subject be taken do accept test melema have anything to allege against validity jacopo speak of be scholar be fearful crisis for tito if said yes quick mind told that must shake credibility of story if said no risked everything on uncertain extent of baldassarres imbecility there be noticeable pause before said accept test there be dead silence while rucellai moved towards recess where book be came back with fine florentine homer in hand baldassarre when be addressed have turned head towards speaker rucellai believed that have understood chose to repeat what have said that there might be no mistake a to test ring posse said be fine sard engraved with subject from homer there be other at resembling in messer tito collection will turn to passage in homer from subject be taken seat here added laying book on table pointing to own seat while stood beside baldassarre have so far recovered from first confused horror produced by sensation of rushing coldness chiming din in ear a to be partly aware of what be said to be aware that something be being demanded from to prove identity formed distinct idea of detail sight of book recalled habitual longing faint hope that must read understand moved towards chair immediately book be open before bent head little towards while everybody watched eagerly turned leaf eye wandered over page lay before then fixed on straining gaze lasted for two three minute in dead silence then lifted hand to side of head said in low tone of despair lost lost there be something so piteous in wandering look low cry while confirmed belief in madness raised compassion nay so distinct sometimes be working of double consciousness within that tito while triumphed in apparent verification of lie wished that have never made lie necessary to himselfwished have recognised father on stepswished have gone to seek himwished everything have be different have borrowed from terrible usurer falsehood loan have mounted mounted with year till belonged to usurer body soul compassion excited in witness be not without danger to tito for conjecture be constantly guided by feeling more than one person suddenly conceived that man might have be scholar have lost faculty on other hand have not present to mind motif must have led tito to denial of benefactor having ill will towards must have be difficult to to believe that have be uttering basest of lie originally common type of baldassarres person coarsened by year of hardship told a confirmation of tito lie if baldassarre to begin with must have uttered precisely word have premeditated there might have be something in form of accusation must have given stamp not only of true experience of mental refinement there have be no such testimony in impulsive agitated word there seemed very opposite testimony in rugged face coarse hand trembled beside standing out in strong contrast in midst of velvet clad fair handed company next movement while be being watched in silence told against too took hand from head felt for something under tunic one guessed what that movement meantguessed that there be weapon at side glance be interchanged bernardo rucellai said in quiet tone touching baldassarres shoulder friend be important business of yours will have justice follow into private room baldassarre be still in half stunned state in be susceptible to prompting in same way a insect form conception of what prompting lead to rose from seat followed rucellai out of room in two three minute rucellai came back again said be safe under lock key piero pitti be one of magnificent eight what do think of sending matteo to palace for couple of sbirri who may escort to stinche largest prison in florence if there be danger in a think there be will be safe there can inquire about to morrow pitti assented order be given be certainly ill looking fellow said tornabuoni say have attempted life already melema talk turned on various form of madness fierceness of southern blood if seed of conjecture unfavourable to tito have be planted in mind of one present be hardly strong enough to grow without aid of much daylight ill will common looking wild eyed old man clad in serge might have won belief without very strong evidence if have accused man who be envied disliked a be only congruous probable view of case seemed to be one sent unpleasant accuser safely out of sight left pleasant serviceable tito just where be before subject gradually floated away gave place to others till heavy tramp something like struggling of man who be being dragged away be heard outside sound soon died out interruption seemed to make last hour conviviality more resolute vigorous one be willing to forget disagreeable incident tito heart be palpitating wine tasted better to than if have be

towards doing what be painful rather than what be easy bowed reverently to fra salvestro before looking directly at when raised head saw fully reluctance became palpitating doubt there be men whose presence infuses trust reverence there be others to whom have need to carry trust reverence ready made difference flashed on romola a ceased to have savonarola before saw in stead fra salvestro maruffi be not that there be anything manifestly repulsive in fra salvestros face manner air of hypocrisy tinge of coarseness face be handsomer than fra girolamos person little taller be long accepted confessor of many among chief personage in florence have therefore have large experience a spiritual director face have vacillating expression of mind unable to concentrate strongly in channel of one great emotion beliefan expression be fatal to influence over ardent nature like romolas such expression be not stamp of insincerity be stamp simply of willow soul will often be found sincerely striving to fill high vocation sincerely composing countenance to utterance of sublime formula finding muscle twitch relax in spite of belief a prose insists on coming instead of poetry to man who have not divine frenzy fra salvestro have peculiar liability to vision dependent apparently on constitution given to somnambulism savonarola believed in supernatural character of vision while fra salvestro have originally resisted interpretation of have even rebuked savonarola for prophetic preaching proof if one be wanted that relative greatness of men be not to be gauged by tendency to disbelieve superstition of age for of two there can be question be great man small difference between be measured very accurately by change in romolas feeling a fra salvestro began to address in word

strongest element be not allowed to pas without criticism disaffected be plentiful saw clearly that government took worst course for public welfare florence ought to join league make common cause with

rather silly backed thrusting elbow into neighbour rib with air of moral rebuke backing be general one wishing to imply that have be pushed forward against will young man in fine cloth tunic have disappeared at moment armed servitor of signoria who have begun to patrol line of street through procession be to pas came up to disperse group be obstructing narrow street man addressed a cecco

hell be on leg a well a best of by by thank for offering to take care of friend said romola rather penitent for doubting glance then leaning to baldassarre said pray wait for till come again assented with slight movement of head hand romola went on way towards hospital of san matteo in piazza di san marco chapter xliii unseen madonna in returning from hospital more than hour later romola took different road making wider circuit towards river reached at distance from ponte vecchio turned step towards that bridge intending to hasten to san stefano in search of baldassarre dreaded to know more about yet felt a if in forsaking must be forsaking near claim upon when approached meeting of road where por santa maria must be on right hand ponte vecchio on left found involved in crowd who suddenly fell on knee immediately knelt with cross be passingthe great cross of duomowhich headed procession romola be later than have expected to be now must wait till procession have passed a rose from knee when cross have disappeared return to standing posture with nothing to do gaze made more conscious of fatigue than have be while have be walking occupied shopkeeper by side said madonna romola will be weary of standing gian fantoni will be glad to give seat in house here be door close at hand let open for what love god frate a do house be yours romola be accustomed now to be addressed in fraternal way by ordinary citizen whose face be familiar to from having seen constantly in duomo idea of home have come to be identified for le with house in via de bardi where sat in frequent loneliness than with towered circuit of florence where there be hardly turn of street at be not greeted with look of appeal of friendliness be glad enough to pas through open door on right hand be led by fraternal hose vendor to upstairs window where stout woman with three child in plain garb of piagnoni made place for with much reverence above bright hanging drapery from corner station must see not only procession pouring in solemn slowness between line of house on ponte vecchio also river lung arno on towards bridge of santa trinita in sadness in stillness came slow procession not even wailing chant broke silent appeal for mercy there be only tramp of footstep faint sweep of woollen garment be young footstep be passing when romola first looked from windowa long train of florentine youth bearing high in midst of white image of youthful jesus with golden glory above head standing by tall cross where thorn nail lay ready after train of fresh beardless face came mysterious looking company of discipline bound by secret rule to self chastisement devout praise special act of piety wearing garb concealed whole head face except eye one knew that mysterious form be florentine citizen of various rank who might be seen at ordinary time going about business of shop counting house state member now be discernible a son husband father have dropped personality walked a symbol of common vow company have colour badge garb of be complete shroud left expression that of fellowship in comparison with multitude of monk seemed to be strongly distinguished individual in spite of common tonsure common frock first came white stream of reformed benedictine then much longer stream of frati minori franciscan in age clad in grey with knotted cord round waist of with zoccoli wooden sandal below bare feetperhaps most numerous order in florence owning many zealous member who loved mankind hated dominican after grey came black of augustinian of san spirito with more cultured human face above itmen who have inherited library of boccaccio have made most learned company in florence when learning be rarer then white over dark of carmelite then again unmixed black of servites that famous florentine order founded by seven merchant who forsook gain to adore divine mother now heart of onlooker began to beat little faster either with hatred with love for there be stream of black white coming over bridgeof black mantle over white scapulary one knew that dominican be coming of fiesole passed first one black mantle parted by white after one tonsured head after still expectation be suspended be very coarse mantle of many be threadbare if not ragged for prior of san marco have reduced fraternity under rule to strictest poverty discipline in long line of black white there be at last singled out mantle only little more worn than rest with tonsured head above might not have appeared supremely remarkable to stranger who have not seen on bronze medal with sword of god a obverse surrounded by armed guard on way to duomo transfigured by inward flame of orator a looked round on rapt multitude a approach of savonarola be discerned none dared conspicuously to break stillness by sound must rise above solemn tramp of footstep faint sweep of garment nevertheless ear a well a other ear caught mingled sound of slow hissing longed to be curse murmur longed to be blessing perhaps be sense that hissing predominated made two three of disciple in foreground of crowd at meeting of road fall on knee a if something divine be passing movement of silent homage spread went along side of street like subtle shock leaving unmoved while made most bend knee bow head hatred too gathered more intense expression a savonarola passed up por santa maria romola must see that one at upper window spat upon monk againfrati umiliati humbled brother from ognissanti with glorious tradition of being earliest worker in wool trade again more monksvallombrosan other variety of benedictine reminding instructed eye by nicety of form colour that in age of abuse long ago reformer have arisen who have marked change of spirit by change of garb till at last shaven crown be at end there came train of untonsured secular priest then followed twenty one incorporated art of florence in long array with banner floating above in proud declaration that bearer have distinct function from baker of bread to judge notary then secondary officer of state beginning with le going on to greater till line of secularities be broken by canon of duomo carrying sacred relicthe very head enclosed in silver of san zenobio immortal bishop of florence whose virtue be held to have saved city perhaps thousand year before here be nucleus of procession behind relic came archbishop in gorgeous cope with canopy held above after mysterious hidden imagehidden first by rich curtain of brocade enclosing outer painted tabernacle within by more ancient tabernacle have never be opened in memory of living men father of living men in inner shrine be image of pitying mother found age ago in soil of limpruneta uttering cry a spade struck hitherto unseen image have hardly ever be carried to duomo without having rich gift borne before there be reciting list of precious offering made by emulous men community especially of veil curtain mantle richest of be said have be given by poor abbess nun who having money to buy material wove mantle of gold brocade with prayer embroidered adorned with prayer finally saw work presented to blessed virgin in great piazza by two beautiful youth who spread out white wing vanished in blue to day there be gift carried before tabernacle donation be to be given to day except to poor have be advice of fra girolamo whose preaching never insisted on gift to invisible power only on help to visible need altar have be raised at various point in front of church on oblation for poor be deposited not even torch be carried surely hidden mother cared le for torch brocade than for wail of hungry people florence be in extremity have done utmost must only wait for something divine be not in own power frate in torn mantle have said that help must certainly come many of faint hearted be clinging more to faith in frates word than to faith in virtue of unseen image there be not few of fierce hearted who thought with secret rejoicing that frates word might be proved false slowly tabernacle moved forward knee be bent there be profound stillness for train of priest chaplain from limpruneta stirred passion in onlooker procession be about to close with prior gonfaloniere long train of company symbol have silent music stir mind a chorus stir be passing out of sight now faint yearning hope be struggled with accustomed despondency romola whose heart have be swelling half with foreboding half with enthusiasm of fellowship life of last two year have made a habitual to a consciousness of costume to vain idle woman gave deep sigh a at end of long mental tension remained on knee for very languor when suddenly there flashed from between house on to distant bridge something bright coloured in instant romola started up stretched out arm leaning from window while black drapery fell from head golden gleam of hair flush in face seemed effect of one illumination shout arose in same instant last troop of procession paused face be turned towards distant bridge bridge be passed now horseman be pressing at full gallop along by arno side of bay horse just streaked with foam looked white from swiftness cap be flying loose by red becchetto waved olive branch in hand be messengera messenger of good tidings blessed olive branch spoke afar off impatient people must not wait rushed to meet on comer seized horse rein pushing trampling now romola must see that horseman be husband who have be sent to pisa few day before on private embassy recognition brought new flash of joy into eye have checked first impulsive attitude of expectation governing anxiety be still to know what news of relief have come for florence good news best news news to be paid with hose novella da calze be vague answer with tito met importunity of crowd until have succeeded in pushing on horse to spot at meeting of way where gonfaloniere prior be awaiting there paused bowing low said magnificent signior have to deliver to joyful news that galley from france laden with corn men have arrived safely in port of leghorn by favour of strong wind kept enemy fleet at distance word have sooner left tito lip than seemed to vibrate up street great shout rang through air rushed along river then shout be heard spreading along line of procession towards duomo then there be fainter answering shout like intermediate plash of distant wave in great lake whose water obey one impulse for minute there be attempt to speak further signoria lifted up cap stood bare headed in presence of rescue have come from outside limit of own powerfrom that region of trust resignation have be in age called divine at last a signal be given to move forward tito said with smile ought to say that hose to be bestowed by magnificent signoria in reward of tidings be due not to to man who have ridden hard to bring must have be here in place if horse have not broken down just before reached signa meo di sasso will doubtless be here in hour two may all more justly claim glory of messenger because have have chief labour have lost chief delight be graceful way of putting necessary statement after word of reply from proposto spokesman of signoria dignified extremity of procession passed on tito turned horse head to follow in train while great bell of palazzo vecchio be already beginning to swing give louder voice to people joy in moment when tito attention have ceased to be imperatively directed might have be expected that must look round recognise romola be apparently engaged with cap now eager people be leading horse be able to seize place on head while right hand be still encumbered by olive branch have becoming air of lassitude after exertion romola instead of making effort to be recognised by threw black drapery over head again remained perfectly quiet yet felt almost sure that tito have seen have power of seeing everything without seeming to see chapter xliv visible madonna crowd have sooner passed onward than romola descended to street hastened to step of san stefano cecco have be attracted with rest towards piazza found baldassarre standing alone against church door with horn cup in hand waiting for there be striking change in blank dreamy glance of half returned consciousness have given place to fierceness a advanced spoke to flashed upon a if have be object be glance of caged fury see prey passing safe beyond bar romola started a glance be turned on immediate thought be that have seen tito a felt look of hatred grating on something like hope arose that man might be criminal that husband might not have be guilty towards if must learn that now by bringing tito face to face with have mind set at rest if will come with said can give shelter food until be quite rested strong will come yes said baldassarre will be glad to get strength want to get strength repeated a if be muttering to rather than speaking to come said inviting to walk by side taking way by arno towards ponte rubaconte a more private road think be not florentine said presently a turned on to bridge looked round at without speaking suspicious caution be more strongly upon than usual just now that fog of confusion oblivion be made denser by bodily feebleness be looking at too there be something in gentle eye at last compelled to answer answered cautiously be florentine be lonely man observed reluctance to speak to dared not question further lest must desire to quit a glanced at from time to time mind be busy with thought quenched faint hope that there be nothing painful to be revealed about husband if old man have be in wrong where be cause for dread secrecy walked on in silence till reached entrance into via de bardi romola noticed that turned looked at with sudden movement a if shock have passed through few moment after paused at half open door of court turned towards ah said not waiting for to speak be wife whose wife said romola must have be impossible for baldassarre to recall name at moment very force with image of tito pressed upon seemed to expel verbal sign made answer looked at with strange fixedness opened door wide showed court covered with straw on lay four five sick people while little child crawled sat on at easetiny pale creature biting straw gurgling if will come in said romola tremulously will find comfortable place bring more food will not come in said baldassarre stood still arrested by burden of impression under mind be too confused to choose course can hing for said romola let give money that may buy food will be more plentiful soon have put hand into scarsella a spoke held out palm with several grossi in purposely offered more than must have given to other man in same circumstance looked at coin little while then said yes will take poured coin into palm grasped tightly tell said romola almost beseechingly what will baldassarre have turned away from be walking again towards bridge passing from straight on up via del fosso came upon shop of niccol caparra turned towards without pause a if have be very object of search niccol be at moment in procession with armourer of florence there be only one apprentice in shop there be sort of weapon in abundance hanging there baldassarres eye discerned what be more hungry for than for bread niccol must probably have refused to sell anything might serve a weapon to man with sign of prison on apprentice observant scrupulous took three grossi for sharp hunting knife without hesitation be conveniently small weapon baldassarre must easily thrust within breast of tunic walked on feeling stronger sharp edge might give deadliness to thrust of aged arm at least be companion be power in league with even if failed must break against armour be armour sure to be always there in long month while vengeance have lain in prison baseness have perhaps become forgetful secure knife have be bought with traitor own money be just before took money have felt what must do with itbuy weapon yes if possible food too food to nourish arm must grasp weapon food to nourish body be temple of vengeance when have have enough bread must be able to think actto think first how must hide lest tito must have dragged away again with idea of hiding in mind baldassarre turned up narrowest street bought meat bread sat down under first loggia to eat bell swung out louder louder peal of joy laying hold of making vibrate along with air seemed to simply part of strong world be against romola have watched baldassarre until have disappeared round turning into piazza de mozzi half feeling that departure be relief half reproaching for not seeking with more decision to know truth about for not assuring whether there be guiltless misery in lot be not helpless to relieve yet what must have done if truth have proved to be burden of painful secret about husband in addition to anxiety already weighed upon surely wife be permitted to desire ignorance of husband wrong doing since alone must not protest warn men against that thought

tito have detected by glimmer of lamp that leader of advancing group wore red feather glittering sword hiltin fact be almost last person in world must have chosen to meet at hour with romola by side have already during day have one momentous interview with dolfo spini business have spoken of to romola a yet to be done be second interview with personage sequence of visit have paid at san marco tito by long preconcerted plan have be bearer of letter to savonarolacarefully forged letter one of by stratagem bearing very signature seal of cardinal of naples who of sacred college have most exerted influence at rome in favour of frate purport of letter be to state that cardinal be on progress from pisa unwilling for strong reason to enter florence yet desirous of taking counsel with savonarola at difficult juncture intended to pause very day at san casciano about ten mile from city whence must ride out next morning in plain garb of priest meet savonarola a if casually five mile on florence road two hour after sunrise plot of forged letter be initial step be that dolfo spini with band of compagnacci be to be posted in ambush on road at lonely spot about five mile from gate that be to seize savonarola with dominican brother who must accompany according to rule deliver over to small detachment of milanese horse in readiness near san casciano by whom be to be carried into roman territory there be strong chance that penetrating frate must suspect trap decline to incur risk have for time avoided of going beyond city wall even when preached friend held necessary that must be attended by armed guard here be called on to commit to solitary road with other attendant than fellow monk on ground minimum of time have be given for decision chance in favour of acting on letter be that eagerness with mind be set on combining of interest within without church towards procuring of general council also expectation of immediate service from cardinal in actual juncture of contest with pope must triumph over shrewdness caution in brief space allowed for deliberation tito have have audience of savonarola having declined to put letter into hand with consummate art have admitted that incidentally by inference be able so far to conjecture purport a to believe referred to rendezvous outside gate in case urged that frate must seek armed guard from signoria offered service in carrying request with utmost privacy savonarola have replied briefly that be impossible armed guard be incompatible with privacy spoke with flashing eye tito felt convinced that meant to incur risk tito did not much care for result managed affair so cleverly that result considered must turn to advantage whichever party came uppermost be secure of favour money be indecorously naked statement fact clothed a tito habitually clothed be that acute mind discerning equal hollowness of party took only rational course in making subservient to own interest if savonarola fell into snare there be diamond in question papal patronage if not tito adroit agency have strengthened position with savonarola with spini while confidence obtained from made more valuable a agent of mediceans spini be inconvenient

must have felt against bull faced accomplice unfit either for leader tool lip turned white excitement came from pressing difficulty of choosing safe device if attempted to hush spini must only deepen romolas suspicion knew well enough to know that if strong alarm be roused in be to be silenced hoodwinked on other hand if repelled spini angrily wine breathing compagnaccio might become savage being more ready at resentment than at divination of motif adopted third course proved that romola retained one sort of power over himthe power of dread pressed hand a if intending hint to said in good humoured tone of comradeship yes dolfo may prepare in security take trumpet with dont be afraid said spini little piqued need to play ser saccente with know where devil keep tail a well a do what

tell truth said romola in low quivering voice will be safer for why must desire to tell anything else angry saint said tito with slight touch of contempt be vent of annoyance since truth be precisely that over have most reason to rejoicenamely that knowing plot of spinis enables to secure frate from falling victim to what be plot decline to tell said tito be enough that frates safety will be secured be plot for drawing outside gate that spini may murder there have be intention of murder be simply plot for compelling to obey pope summons to rome a serve popular government think frates presence here be necessary mean of maintaining at present choose to prevent departure may go to sleep with entire ease of mind to night for moment romola be silent then said in voice of anguish tito be of use have belief in must just discern action a shrugged shoulder spread out palm in silence that cold dislike be anger of unimpassioned being be hardening within if frate leaf cityif harm happens

united be that part of will save from crime others will not be betrayed be quite aware of what must be likely to do anima mia said tito in coolest of liquid tone therefore if have small amount of reasoning at disposal just now consider that if believe in nothing else may believe when say will take care of myself not put in power to ruin then assure that frate be warnedhe will not go beyond gate will not go beyond gate there be moment pause distrust be not to be expelled will go back to san marco now find out romola said making movement forward will not said tito in bitter whisper seizing wrist with masculine force be master of will not set in opposition to there be passer by approaching tito have heard be why spoke in whisper romola be too conscious of being mastered to have struggled even if have remained unconscious that witness be at hand be aware now of footstep voice habitual sense of personal dignity made at once yield to tito movement towards leading from loggia

reserve discipline have left unmodified began to emerge from flood of passion grasp of wrist asserted husband physical predominance instead of arousing new fierceness in a might have done if impetuosity have be of more vulgar kind have given momentary shuddering horror at form of contest with be first time have be in declared hostility to other since flight return check given to ardent resolution then retained power to arrest now in altered condition mind began to dwell on probability must save from desperate course tito must not risk betrayal by have be original intention must be determined now by fact that knew of plot be not bound now to do anything else than to hang over certainty that if deceived lip must not be closed then be possibleyes must cling to possibility till be disprovedthat tito have never meant to aid in betrayal of frate tito on side be busy with thought did not speak again till be near home then said well romola have now have time to recover calmness if so can supply want of belief in by little rational inference can see presume that if have have intention of furthering spinis plot must now be aware that possession of fair piagnone for wife who know secret of plot must be serious obstacle in way tito assumed tone be just then easiest to conjecturing that in romolas present mood persuasive deprecation must be lost upon yes tito said in low voice think believe must guard republic from further treachery be right to believe if frate be betrayed will denounce paused moment then said with effort be not so have perhaps spoken too hastilyyou never meant only why will seem to be man comrade such relation be inevitable to practical men romola said tito gratified by discerning struggle within fair creature live in cloud pray go to rest with easy heart added opening door for chapter xlvii check tito clever arrangement have be unpleasantly frustrated by trivial incident must not enter into clever man calculation be very seldom that walked with romola in evening yet have happened to be walking with precisely on evening when presence be supremely inconvenient life be so complicated game that device of skill be liable to be defeated at turn by air blown chance incalculable a descent of thistle down be not that minded about failure of spinis plot felt awkward difficulty in so adjusting warning to savonarola on one hand to spini on other a not to incur suspicion suspicion roused in popular party might be fatal to reputation ostensible position in florence suspicion roused in dolfo spini might be a disagreeable in effect a hatred of fierce dog not to be chained if tito went forthwith to monastery to warn savonarola before monk went to rest warning must follow so closely on delivery of forged letter that must not escape unfavourable surmise must not warn spini at once without telling true reason since must not immediately allege discovery that savonarola have changed purpose knew spini well enough to know that understanding must discern nothing that tito have turned round frustrated plot on other hand by deferring warning to savonarola until morning must be almost sure to lose opportunity of warning spini that frate have changed mind band of compagnacci must come back in rage of disappointment last however be risk chose trusting to power of soothing spini by assuring that failure be due only to frates caution tito be annoyed if have have to smile must have be unusual effort to be determined not to encounter romola again did not go home night watched through night never took off clothes heard rain

seated cabinet in narrow room copying document be about to desist from work because light be getting dim when husband entered have come straight to room to seek with thoroughly defined intention there be something new to romola in manner expression a looked at silently on entering without taking off cap mantle leaned one elbow on cabinet stood directly in front of romola fully assured during day of frates safety be feeling reaction of penitence for access of distrust indignation have impelled to address husband publicly on matter that knew wished to be private told that have probably be wrong scheming duplicity have heard even godfather allude to a inseparable from party tactic might be sufficient to account for connection with spini without supposition that tito have ever meant to further plot wanted to atone for impetuosity by confessing that have be too hasty for hour mind have be dwelling on possibility that confession of hers might lead to other frank word breaking two year silence of heart silence have be so complete that tito be ignorant of having fled from come back again have never approached avowal of past in young love in shock shattered love lay locked away from like banquet room where death have once broken feast looked up at with submission in glance belonged to state of self reproof subtle change in face manner arrested speech for few moment remained silent looking at other tito felt that crisis be come in married life husband determination to mastery lay deep below blandness beseechingness have risen permanently to surface now seemed to alter face a face be altered by hidden muscular tension with man be secretly throttling stamping out life from something feeble yet dangerous romola began in cool liquid tone made shiver be time that must understand other paused be what most desire tito said faintly sweet pale face with anger gone nothing timidity of self doubt in seemed to give marked predominance to husband dark strength took step morning tito went on must now perceive to have be uselesswhich exposed to remark may involve in serious practical difficulty acknowledge be too hasty be sorry for injustice may have done romola spoke word in fuller firmer tone tito hoped must look le hard when have expressed regret then must say other thing wish once for to understand said without change of voice that such collision be incompatible with position a husband wife wish to reflect on mode in be led to step that process may not be repeated that depends chiefly on tito said romola taking fire slightly be not at what have thought of saying see very little way before in mutual speech must say suppose answered tito that nothing be to occur in future can excite unreasonable suspicion be frank enough to say last night that have belief in be not surprised at exaggerated conclusion may draw from slight premise wish to point out to what be likely to be fruit of making such exaggerated conclusion ground for interfering in affair of be ignorant attention be thoroughly awake to what be saying paused for reply yes said romola flushing in irrepressible resentment at cold tone of superiority well then may possibly not be very long before other chance word incident set imagination at work devising crime for may perhaps rush to palazzo vecchio to alarm signoria set city in uproar will tell may be result not simply disgrace of husband to look forward with so much courage arrest ruin of many among chief men in florence including messer bernardo del nero tito have meditated decisive move have made flush died out of romolas face very lip be palean unusual effect with for be little subject to fear tito perceived success must perhaps flatter went on that be performing heroic deed of deliverance might a well try to turn lock with fine word a apply such notion to politics of florence question now be not whether can have belief in whether now have be warned will dare to rush like blind man with torch in hand amongst intricate affair of know nothing romola felt a if mind be held in vice by tito possibility have indicated be rising before with terrible clearness be too rash said will try not to be rash remember said tito with unsparing insistence that act of distrust towards morning might for aught knew have have more fatal effect than sacrifice of husband have learned to contemplate without flinching tito be not so romola burst forth in pleading tone rising going nearer to with desperate resolution to speak out be false must willingly sacrifice have be greatest effort of life to cling to went away in anger two year ago came back again because be more bound to than to anything else on earth be useless shut out from mind affect to think of a being too unreasonable to share in knowledge of affair will be open with about nothing looked like good angel pleading with a bent face towards with dilated eye laid hand upon arm romolas touch glance no longer stirred fibre of tenderness in husband good humoured tolerant tito incapable of hatred incapable almost of impatience disposed always to be gentle towards rest of world felt becoming strangely hard towards wife whose presence have once be strongest influence have known with softness of disposition have masculine effectiveness of intellect purpose like sharpness of edge be energy working way without strong momentum romola have energy of own thwarted man who be not exceptionally feeble will endure being thwarted by wife marriage must be relation of sympathy of conquest emotion darted across face a heard romola for first time speak of having gone away from lip only looked little harder a smiled slightly said romola when certain condition be ascertained must make up mind to amount of wishing will fill arno a people say turn plum into orange have not observed even that prayer have much efficacy that way be so constituted a to have certain strong impression inaccessible to reason can not share impression have withdrawn trust from in consequence have changed towards have followed have changed towards be useless to take retrospect have simply to adapt to altered condition tito must not be useless for to speak openly said romola with sort of exasperation come from using living muscle against lifeless insurmountable resistance be sense of deception in that changed have kept apart be not true that changed first changed towards night first wore that chain armour have secret from meit be about old manand saw again yesterday tito went on in tone of agonised entreaty if must once tell everything let be what mayi must not mind painthat there might be wall between be not possible that must begin new life time there be flash of emotion across tito face stood perfectly still flash seemed to have whitened took notice of romolas appeal after moment pause said quietly impetuosity about trifle romola have freezing influence must cool bath of nero at cutting word romola shrank drew up into usual self sustained attitude tito went on if by old man mean mad jacopo di nola who attempted life made strange accusation against of told nothing because must have alarmed to purpose poor wretch have died in prison saw name in list of dead know nothing about accusation said romola know be man whom saw with rope round neck in duomothe man whose portrait piero di cosimo painted grasping arm a saw grasp day french entered day first wore armour where be now pray said tito still pale governing be lying lifeless in street from starvation said romola revived with bread wine brought to door refused to come in then gave money went away without telling anything have found out be wife who be man half mad half imbecile who be once father servant in greece who have rancorous hatred towards because got dismissed for theft now have whole mystery further satisfaction of knowing that be again in danger of assassination fact of wearing armour about seem to have thought so much must have led to infer be in danger from man be that reason chose to cultivate acquaintance invite into house romola be mute to speak be only like rushing with bare breast against shield tito moved from leaning posture slowly took off cap mantle pushed back hair be collecting for final word romola stood upright looking at a might have looked at on coming deadly force to be met only by silent endurance need not refer to matter again romola said precisely in same tone a in have spoken at first be enough if will remember that next time generous ardour lead to interfere in political affair be likely not to save one from danger to be raising scaffold setting house on fire be not yet sufficiently ardent piagnone to believe that messer bernardo del nero be prince of darkness messer francesco valori archangel michael think need demand promise from have understood too well tito be enough said leaving room romola turned round with despair in face sank into seat o god have triedi can not help will always be divided word passed silently through mind unless said aloud a if sudden vision have startled into speechunless misery must come join tito too have new thought in mind after have closed door behind with project of leaving florence a soon a life there have become high enough stepping stone to life elsewhere perhaps at rome milan there be now for first time associated desire to be free from romola to leave behind have ceased to belong to desirable furniture of life there be possibility of easy relation between without genuineness on part genuineness implied confession of past confession involved change of purpose tito have a little bent way a leopard have to lap milk when teeth be grown from relation be not easy agreeable know that tito shrank why must cling to romola have made relation difficult with others besides have have troublesome interview with dolfo spini who have come back in rage after ineffectual soaking with rain long waiting in ambush that scene between romola at nellos door once reported in spinis ear might be seed of something more unmanageable than suspicion now at least believed that have mastered romola by terror appealed to strongest force of nature have alarmed affection conscience by shadowy image of consequence have arrested intellect by hanging before idea of hopeless complexity in affair defied moral judgment yet tito be not at ease world be not yet quite cushioned with velvet if have be must not have abandoned to softness with thorough enjoyment for before went out again evening put on coat of chain armour chapter xlix pyramid of vanity wintry day passed for romola a white ship pas one who be standing lonely on shorepassing in silence sameness yet bearing hidden burden of coming change tito hint have mingled so much dread with interest in progress of public affair that have begun to court ignorance rather than knowledge threatening german emperor be gone again in other way besides position of florence be alleviated so much distress remained that romolas active duty be hardly diminished in a usual mind found refuge from doubt dared not rejoice that relief have come in extremity have appeared to justify policy of frates party be making that party so triumphant that francesco valori hot tempered chieftain of piagnoni have be elected gonfaloniere at beginning of year be making haste to have a much of own liberal way a possible during two month of power seemed for moment like strengthening of party most attached to freedom reinforcement of protection to savonarola romola be now alive to suggestion likely to deepen foreboding that whatever present might be be only unconscious brooding over mixed germ of change might day become tragic already by carnival time little after mid february presentiment be confirmed by sign of very decided change mediceans have ceased to be passive be openly exerting to procure election of bernardo del nero a new gonfaloniere on last day of carnival between ten eleven in morning romola walked out according to promise towards corso degli albizzi to fetch cousin brigida that might be ready to start from via de bardi early in afternoon take place at window tito have have reserved for in piazza della signoria where there be to be scene of so new striking sort that florentine eye must desire to see for piagnoni be having own way thoroughly about mode of keeping carnival in vain dolfo spini companion have struggled to get up dear old masque practical joke well spiced with indecency such thing be not to be in city where christ have be declared king romola set out in languid state of mind with one enters on long day of sight seeing purely for sake of gratifying child dear childish friend day be certainly epoch in carnival keeping phase of reform have not touched enthusiasm did not know that be epoch in own life when lot must begin to be no longer secretly visibly entwined with own chose to go through great piazza that might take first survey of unparalleled sight there while be still alone entering from south saw something monstrous many coloured in shape of pyramid rather like huge fir tree sixty foot high with shelf on branch widening widening towards base till reached circumference of eighty yard piazza be full of life slight young figure in white garment with olive wreath on head be moving to fro about base of pyramidal tree carrying basket full of bright coloured thing maturer form in monastic frock in loose tunic dark red cap of artist be helping examining else retreating to various point in distance to survey wondrous whole while considerable group amongst whom romola recognised piero di cosimo standing on marble step of orgagnas loggia seemed to be keeping aloof in discontent scorn approaching nearer paused to look at multifarious object ranged in gradation from base to summit of pyramid there be tapestry brocade of immodest design picture sculpture held too likely to incite to vice there be board table for sort of game playing card along with block for printing dice other apparatus for gambling there be worldly music book musical instrument in pretty variety of lute drum cymbal trumpet there be mask masquerading dress used in old carnival show there be handsome copy of ovid boccaccio petrarca pulci other book of vain impure sort there be implement of feminine vanityrouge pot false hair mirror perfume powder transparent veil intended to provoke inquisitive glance lastly at very summit there be unflattering effigy of probably mythical venetian merchant who be understood to have offered heavy sum for collection of marketable abomination soaring above in surpassing ugliness symbolic figure of old debauched carnival be preparation for new sort of bonfirethe burning of vanity hidden in interior of pyramid be plentiful store of dry fuel gunpowder on last day of festival at evening pile of vanity be to be set ablaze to sound of trumpet ugly old carnival be to tumble into flame amid song of reforming triumph crowning act of new festivity must hardly have be prepared for peculiar organisation have be started by savonarola two year before mass of florentine boyhood youth be no longer left to own genial prompting towards street mischief crude dissoluteness under training of fra domenico sort of lieutenant to savonarola lad stripling hope of florence be to have none pure word on lip be to have zeal for unseen good must put to shame lukewarmness of elder be to know pleasure save of angelic sortsinging divine praise walking in white robe be for that range of seat have be raised high against wall of duomo have be used to hear savonarola appeal to a future glory of city specially appointed to do work of god fresh cheeked troop be chief agent in regenerated merriment of new carnival be sort of sacred parody of old have there be bonfire in old time there be to be bonfire now consuming impurity from off earth have there be symbolic procession there be to be procession now symbol be to be white robe red cross olive wreathsemblems of peace innocent gladnessand banner image held aloft be to tell triumph of goodness have there be dancing in ring under open sky of piazza to sound of choral voice chanting loose song there be to be dancing in ring now dancing of monk laity in fraternal love divine joy music be to be music of hymn a for collection from street passenger be to be greater than evernot for gross superfluous supper for benefit of hungry needy besides there be collecting of anathema vanity to be laid on great pyramidal bonfire troop of young inquisitor went from house to house on exciting business of asking that anathema must be given up to perhaps after more avowed vanity have be surrendered madonna at head of household have still certain little reddened ball brought from levant intended to produce on sallow cheek sudden bloom of most ingenuous falsity if so let bring down cast into basket of doom perhaps have ringlet coil of dead hairif so let bring to streetdoor not on head in hand publicly renounce anathema hid respectable sign of age under ghastly mockery of youth in reward must hear fresh young voice pronounce blessing on house beardless inquisitor organised into little regiment doubtless took to work very willingly to coerce people by shame other spiritual pelting into giving up of thing will probably vex to part with be form of piety to boyish mind be most readily converted if obstinately wicked men got enraged threatened whip cudgel also be exciting savonarola evidently felt about training of boy difficulty weighing on mind with noble yearning towards great end yet with imperfect perception of mean force resort to supernatural constraining influence a only sure hope florentine youth have have very evil habit foul tongue seemed at first unmixed blessing when be got to shout viva ge savonarola be forced at last to say from pulpit there be little too much shouting of viva ge constant utterance of sacred word brings into contempt let have more of shouting till next festa nevertheless a long stream of white robed youthfulness with little red cross olive wreath have gone to duomo at dawn morning to receive communion from hand of savonarola be sight of beauty doubtless many of young soul be laying up memory of hope awe might save from ever resting in merely vulgar view of work a men citizen there be kind of conscious obedience be not advance on lawlessness boy became generation of men who fought greatly endured greatly in last struggle of republic now in intermediate hour between early communion dinner time be making last perambulation to collect alms vanity be why romola saw slim white figure moving to fro about base of great pyramid what think of folly madonna romola said brusque voice close to ear piagnoni will make linferno pleasant prospect to if be to carry thing own way on earth enough to fetch cudgel over mountain to see painter like lorenzo di credi young baccio there helping to burn colour out of life in fashion good piero said romola looking up smiling at grim man even must be glad to see of thing burnt look at gewgaw wig rouge pot have heard talk a indignantly against thing a fra girolamo what then said piero turning round on sharply never said woman must make black patch of herself against background va madonna antigone shame for woman with hair shoulder to run into such nonsenseleave to woman who be not worth painting what most holy virgin have always be dressed well thats doctrine of churchtalk of heresy indeed must like to know what excellent messer bardo must have said to burning of divine poet by frati who be better imitation of men than if be onion with bulb uppermost look at petrarca sticking up beside rouge pot do idiot pretend that heavenly laura be painted harridan boccaccio now do mean to say madonna romolayou who be fit to be model for wise saint catherine of egyptdo mean to say have never read story of immortal messer giovanni be true have read piero said romola of great many time over when be little girl used to get book down when father be asleep so must read to ebbene said piero in fiercely challenging tone there be thing in want ever to forget said romola must confess piero that great many of story be only about low deceit for lowest end men want book to make think lightly of vice a if life be vulgar joke can not blame fra girolamo for teaching that owe time to something better yes yes very well to say so now youve read said piero bitterly turning on heel walking away from romola too walked on smiling at pieros innuendo with sort of tenderness towards old painter anger because knew that father must have felt something like for be conscious of inward collision with strict sombre view of pleasure tended to repress poetry in attempt to repress vice sorrow joy have peculiar narrowness religious enthusiasm like savonarola ultimately blesses mankind by giving soul strong propulsion towards sympathy with pain indignation against wrong subjugation of sensual desire must always incur reproach of great negation romolas life have given affinity for sadness inevitably made unjust towards merriment that subtle result of culture call taste be subdued by need for deeper motive just a nicer demand of palate be annihilated by urgent hunger moving habitually amongst scene of suffering carrying woman heaviest disappointment in heart severity allied with renouncing beneficent strength have dissonance for chapter l tessa abroad at home figure easily recognised by usa figure not clad in black in old red green whitewas approaching piazza morning to see carnival came from opposite point for tessa no longer lived on hill of san giorgio after what have happened there with baldassarre tito have thought best for other

naldo yet have little of own way must read nothing else have learned to read good deal in husband face certainly charm of bright gentle humoured tito who woke up under loggia de cerchi on lenten morning five year before not having yet given hostage to deceit never returned so nearly a in person of naldo seated in straight backed carved arm chair have provided for comfort when came to see tessa child tito be surprised at growing sense of relief felt in moment guile be needed towards tessa be too ignorant too innocent to suspect of anything little voice calling babbo be very sweet in ear for short while that heard when thought of leaving florence never thought of leaving tessa little one behind be very fond of round cheeked wide eyed human thing clung about knew evil of wherever affection can spring be like green leaf blossompure breathing purity soil may grow in poor romola with self sacrificing effort be really helping to harden tito nature by chilling with positive dislike

crane must not expect rose glittering king queen tessa however suppose string of people to be called procession will please blue eye there thing have raised in piazza de signior for bonfire may like to see come home early look like grave little old woman if see men with feather sword keep out of way be very fierce like to cut old woman head off santa madonna where do come from ah be laughing be not so bad will keep away from only tessa went on in whisper putting lip near naldos ear if might take lillo with be very sensible who will thump monna lisa then if doesnt hear said tito finding difficult not to laugh thinking necessary to look serious tessa must not take care of lillo if got into crowd he too heavy for to carry be true said tessa rather sadly like to run away forgot that

went to snatch up when babbo be paying due attention to recent teeth other marvel said in whisper will buy confetti for child tito drew small coin from scarsella poured into palm will buy end said tessa delighted at abundance will not mind going without lillo so much if bring something so tessa set out in morning towards great piazza where bonfire be to be did not think february breeze cold enough to demand further covering than green woollen dress mantle must have be oppressive for must have hidden new necklace new clasp mounted with silver only ornamental present tito have ever made tessa did not think at of showing figure for one have ever told be pretty be quite sure that necklace clasp be of prettiest sort ever worn by richest contadina arranged white hood over head so that front of necklace might be well displayed ornament considered must inspire respect for a wife of one who must afford to buy tripped along very cheerily in february sunshine thinking much of purchase for little one with be to fill small basket not thinking at of one who might be observing yet descent from upper storey into street have be watched be being kept in sight a walked by person who have often waited in vain to see if be not tessa who lived in house to have more than once dogged tito baldassarre be carrying package of yarn be constantly employed in way a mean of earning scanty bread keeping sacred fire of vengeance alive have come out of way morning a have often done before might pas by house to have followed tito in evening long imprisonment have so intensified timid suspicion belief in diabolic fortune favouring tito that have not dared to pursue except under cover of crowd of darkness felt with instinctive horror that if tito eye fell upon must again be held up to obloquy again be dragged away weapon must be taken from must be cast helpless into prison cell fierce purpose have become a stealthy a serpent depends for prey on one dart of fang justice be weak unfriended must not hear again voice pealed promise of vengeance in duomo have be there again again that voice too have apparently be stifled by cunning strong armed wickedness for long while baldassarres ruling thought be to ascertain whether tito still wore armour for now at last fainting hope must have be contented with successful stab on side grave must never risk precious knife again be weary time have have to wait for chance of answering question by touching tito back in press of street since then knowledge that sharp steel be useless that have hope in new device have fallen with leaden weight on enfeebled mind dim vision of winning one of two wife to aid came before continually continually slid away wife who have lived on hill be no longer there if must find again might grasp thread of project work way to more clearness morning have succeeded be quite certain now where wife lived a walked bent little under burden of yarn yet keeping green white figure in sight mind be dwelling upon circumstance a feeble eye dwell on line colour trying to interpret into consistent significance tessa have to pas through various long street without seeing other sign of carnival than unusual group of country people in best garment disposition in everybody to chat loiter mark early hour of holiday before spectacle have begun presently in disappointed search for remarkable object eye fell on man with pedlar basket before who seemed to be selling nothing little red cross to passenger little red cross must be pretty to hang up over bed must also help to keep off harm must perhaps make ninna stronger tessa went to other side of street that might ask pedlar price of cross fearing that must cost little too much for to spare from purchase of sweet pedlar back have be turned towards hitherto when came near recognised old acquaintance of mercato bratti ferravecchi accustomed to feel that be to avoid old acquaintance turned away again passed to other side of street brattis eye be too well practised in looking out at corner after possible customer for movement to have escaped be presently arrested by tap on arm from one of red cross young woman said bratti a unwillingly turned head come from castello good way off seems to else youd never think of walking about blessed carnival without red cross in hand santa madonna four white quattrini be small price to pay for soulprices rise in purgatory let tell must like one said tessa hastily couldnt spare four white quattrini bratti have at first regarded tessa too abstractedly a mere customer to look at with scrutiny when began to speak exclaimed by head of san giovanni must be little tessa looking a fresh a ripe apple what youve done none worse then for running away from father nofri be in right of for go on crutch now crabbed fellow with crutch be dangerous can reach across house beat woman a sits im married said tessa rather demurely remembering naldos command that must behave with gravity husband take great care of ah then youve fallen on foot nofri said be good for nothing vermin what then as may bray good while before shake star down always said did well to run away isnt often brattis in wrong well so youve got husband plenty of money then youll never think much of giving four white quattrini for red cross get profit what with famine new religion other merchandise be gone down live in country where chestnut

cross god guard think what devil tooth be youve seen biting man in san giovanni must hope tessa felt much teased frightened oh bratti said with discomposed face want to buy great many confetti ive got little lillo ninna at home nice coloured sweet thing cost great deal will not like cross so well though know must be good to have come then said bratti fond of laying up store of merit by imagining possible extortion then heroically renouncing since youre old acquaintance will have for two quattrini making present of cross to say nothing of blessing tessa be reaching out two quattrini with trembling hesitation when bratti said abruptly stop bit where do live oh long way off answered almost automatically being preoccupied with quattrini beyond san ambrogio in via piccola at top of house where wood be stacked below very good said bratti in patronising tone then ill let have cross on trust call for money so live inside gate well well will be passing said tessa frightened lest naldo must be angry at revival of old acquaintance can spare money take now said bratti resolutely im not hard hearted pedlar ill call see if youve got rag will make bargain see here cross there pippos shop not far behind can go fill basket must go get mine empty addio piccina bratti went on way tessa stimulated to change money into confetti before further accident went into pippos shop little fluttered by thought that have let bratti know more about than husband must approve there be certainly more danger in coming to see carnival than in staying at home must have felt more strongly if have known that wicked old man who have wanted to kill husband on hill be still keeping in sight have not noticed man with burden on back consciousness of having small basketful of thing to make child glad dispersed anxiety a entered via de libraj face have visual expression of childlike content now thought there be really procession coming for saw white robe banner heart began to palpitate with

voice a if holy madonna be speaking said be afraid one will harm tessa looked up saw lady in black with young heavenly face loving hazel eye have never seen one like lady before under other circumstance might have have awestruck thought about now everything else be overcome by sense that loving protection be near tear only fell faster relieving swelling heart a looked up at heavenly face putting hand to necklace said sobbingly cant give to be burnt husbandhe bought for meand be so prettyand ninnaoh wish id never come ask for said romola speaking to white robed boy in tone of mild authority answer good end for people to give up such thing against will be not what fra girolamo approves must have such thing given up freely madonna romolas word be not to be resisted white train

glimpse only saw tall gliding figure vanish round projecting stonework so went on way in wonder longing to be once more safely housed with monna lisa undesirous of carnival for evermore baldassarre

music stirred in duomo be not without jarring note since first day of glowing hope when frate seeing near triumph of good in reform of republic coming of french deliverer have preached peace charity oblivion of political difference there have be marked change of condition political intrigue have be too obstinate to allow of desired oblivion belief in french deliverer who have turned back on high

conspicuously in sermon that be urged to meet popular demand not only by increased insistence detail concerning vision private revelation by tone of defiant confidence against objector from having

rapid transition of excited feeling a vision of triumphant good receded behind actual predominance of evil threat of coming vengeance against vicious tyrant corrupt priest gathered impetus from personal exasperation a well a from indignant zeal in career of great public orator who yield to inspiration of moment that conflict of selfish unselfish emotion in most men be hidden in chamber of

revelation might be yet to come about old man be subordinate fear now referred thought only to past anxiety be almost absorbed by present yet stirring lent passed by april second final month of godfather supreme authority be near close nothing have occurred to fulfil presentiment in public mind too there have be fear rumour have spread from rome of menacing activity on part of piero de medici in few day suspected bernardo must go out of power romola be trying to gather courage from review of futile fear when on twenty seventh a be walking out on usual errand of mercy in afternoon be met by messenger from camilla rucellai chief among feminine seer of florence desiring presence forthwith on matter of highest moment romola who shrank with unconquerable repulsion from shrill volubility of illuminated woman have just now special repugnance towards camilla because of report that have announced revelation hostile to bernardo del nero be at first inclined to send back flat refusal camillas message might refer to public affair romolas immediate prompting be to close ear against knowledge might only make mental burden heavier have become so thoroughly habit to reject impulsive choice to obey passively guidance of outward claim that reproving for allowing presentiment to make cowardly selfish ended by compliance went straight to camilla found nervous grey haired woman in chamber arranged a much a possible like convent cell thin finger clutching romola a sat eager voice addressing at first in loud whisper caused physical shrinking made difficult for to keep seat camilla have vision to communicatea vision in have be revealed to by romolas angel romola knew certain secret concerning godfather bernardo del nero if disclosed might save republic from peril camillas voice rose louder higher a narrated vision ended by exhorting romola to obey command of angel separate from enemy of god romolas impetuosity be that of massive nature except in moment when be deeply stirred manner be calm self controlled have constitutional disgust for willow excitability of woman like camilla whose faculty seemed wrought up into fantasy leaving nothing for emotion thought exhortation be not yet ended when started up attempted to wrench arm from camillas tightening grasp be of use prophetess kept hold like crab only incited to more eager exhortation by romolas resistance be carried beyond own intention into shrill statement of other vision be to corroborate christ have appeared to ordered to send command to certain citizen in office that must throw bernardo del nero from window of palazzo vecchio fra girolamo knew of have not dared time to say that vision be not of divine authority since then said camilla in excited treble straining upward with wild eye towards romolas face blessed infant have come to laid wafer of sweetness on tongue in token of pleasure have done will let go said romola in deep voice of anger god grant be mad else be detestably wicked violence of effort to be free be too strong for camilla now wrenched away arm rushed out of room not pausing till have hurriedly gone far along street found close to church of badia have to pas behind curtain under old stone arch must find sanctuary shut in from noise hurry of street where object us suggested thought of eternal peace subsisting in midst of turmoil turned in sinking down on step of altar in front of filippino lippi serene virgin appearing to saint bernard waited in hope that inward tumult agitated must by by subside thought pressed on most acutely be that camilla must allege savonarola countenance of wicked folly romola did not for moment believe that have sanctioned throwing of bernardo del nero from window a divine suggestion felt certain that there be falsehood mistake in allegation savonarola have become more more severe in view of resistance to malcontent idea of strict law order be fundamental to political teaching still since knew possibly fatal effect of vision like camillas since have marked distrust of such spirit seeing woman kept aloof from a much a possible why with readiness to denounce wrong from pulpit did not publicly denounce pretended revelation brought new darkness instead of light across conception of supreme will why answer came with painful clearness be fettered inwardly by consciousness that such revelation be not in basis distinctly separable from own vision be fettered outwardly by foreseen consequence of raising cry against even among member of own party a one who must suppress divine inspiration of be not vehiclehe confidential supplementary seer of vision fra salvestro romola kneeling with buried face on altar step be enduring one of sickening moment when enthusiasm have come to a only energy strong enough to make life worthy seemed to be inevitably bound up with vain dream wilful eye shutting mind rushed back with new attraction towards strong worldly sense dignified prudence untheoretic virtue of godfather who be to be treated a sort of agag because held that more restricted form of government be better than great council because must not pretend to forget old tie to banished family with last thought rose presentiment of plot to restore medici then again felt that popular party be half justified in fierce suspicion again felt that to keep government of florence pure to keep out vicious rule be sacred cause frate be right there have carried understanding irrevocably with at moment assent of understanding went alone be given unwillingly heart be recoiling from right allied to so much

memory of father be in same opposition to division of men into sheep goat by easy mark of political religious symbol after have be said that can be said about widening influence of idea remains true that must hardly be such strong agent unless be taken in solvent of feeling great world struggle of developing thought be continually foreshadowed in struggle of affection seeking justification for love hope if romolas intellect have be le capable of discerning complexity in human thing early loving association of life must have forbidden to accept implicitly denunciatory exclusiveness of savonarola have simply felt that mind have suggested deeper more efficacious truth to than other large breathing room found in grand view of human duty have made patient towards that part of teaching must not absorb so long a practical effect came into collision with strong force in now sudden insurrection of feeling have brought about collision indignation once roused by camillas vision must not pause there ran like illuminating fire over kindred fact in savonarola teaching for moment felt what be true in scornful sarcasm heard continually flung against more keenly than felt what be false be illumination made life look ghastly to where be being to whom must cling with whom must work endure with belief that be working for right on side from moral energy came lay fanaticism from be shrinking with newly startled repulsion on side to be drawn by affection memory there be presentiment of secret plotting judgment told must not be unfairly called crime still surmounting other thought be dread inspired by tito hint lest that presentiment must be converted into knowledge in such way that must be torn by irreconcilable claim calmness must not come even on altar step must not come from looking at serene picture where saint writing in rocky solitude be being visited by face with celestial peace in romola be in hard press of human difficulty rocky solitude be too far off rose

baldassarre turning glancing behind timidly outin airaway from street sometimes go to san miniato at hour said romola if like will go now can follow be far can be solitary there nodded assent romola set out to woman might have seemed alarming risk to go to comparatively solitary spot with man who have of outward sign of madness tito attributed to romola be not given to personal fear be glad of

used now to be very near to such people to think great deal about trouble gradually glance gathered more definite expression at last said with abrupt emphasis ah must have be daughter swift flush came

answered with air of exhaustion go will rest here hastened away turning at last spot whence be likely to be in sight saw seated still chapter liv evening morning romola have purpose in mind a be hastening away purpose have be growing through afternoon hour like side stream rising higher higher along with main current be le resolve than necessity of feeling heedless of darkening street not caring to call for masos slow escort hurried across bridge where river showed black before distant dying red took most direct way to old palace might encounter husband there matter must not weigh probability must discharge heart did not know what passed in pillared court up wide stair only knew that asked usher for gonfaloniere giving name begging to be shown into private room be not left long alone with frescoed figure newly lit taper soon door opened bernardo del nero entered still carrying white head erect above silk lucco romola child what be said in tone of anxious surprise a closed door have uncovered head went towards without speaking laid hand on shoulder held little way from that might see better face be haggard from fatigue long agitation hair have rolled down in disorder

little harmless even traitor must see interest in betraying rat will run where smell cheese there be knowing yet way scent will come paused turned away eye from with air of abstraction till with slow

left to out of young filial life now looked so happy to even in trouble for be trouble untainted by anything hateful be silence best romola said old man yes now can not tell whether always will be answered hesitatingly raising head with appealing look well have father ear while be above groundhe lifted black drapery folded round head addingand father home remember that then opening door said there hasten away be like black ghost will be safe enough when romola fell asleep that night slept deep agitation have reached limit must gather strength before must suffer more in spite of rigid habit slept on far beyond sunrise when awoke be to sound of gun piero de medici with thirteen hundred men at back be before gate look towards rome so much romola learned from maso with many circumstantial addition of dubious quality countryman have come in alarmed signoria before be light else city must have be taken by surprise master be not in house having be summoned to palazzo long ago sent out old man again that might gather news while went up to loggia from time to time to try discern sign of dreaded entrance having be made of having be effectively repelled maso brought word that great piazza be full of armed men many of chief citizen suspected a friend of medici have be summoned to palace detained there of people seemed not to mind whether piero got in not said signoria have invited however might be be giving ugly welcome soldier from pisa be coming against in memory of morning hour there be not many thing romola must distinguish a actual external experience standing markedly out above tumultuous wave of retrospect anticipation knew that have really walked to badia by appointed time in spite of street alarm knew that have waited there in vain scene have witnessed when came out of church stood watching on step while door be being closed behind for afternoon interval always came back to like remembered waking there be change in face tone of people armed unarmed who be pausing hurrying along street gun be firing again sound only provoked laughter soon knew cause of change piero de medici horseman have turned back on florence be galloping a fast a must along siena road learned from substantial shop keeping piagnone who have not yet laid down pike be true ended with certain bitterness in emphasis piero be gone there be left behind who be in secret of comingwe know that if new signoria doe duty will soon know who be word darted through romola like sharp spasm evil foreshadowed be not yet close upon a entered home again most pressing anxiety be possibility that have lost sight for long while of baldassarre chapter lv waiting lengthening sunny day went on without bringing what romola most desired what most dreaded brought sign from baldassarre in spite of special watch on part of government revelation of suspected conspiracy brought other thing touched closely bridged phantom crowded space of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial brought spreading plague excommunication of savonarola event tended to arrest incipient alienation from frate to rivet again attachment to man who have opened to new life of duty who seemed now to be worsted in fight for principle against profligacy for romola must not carry from day to day into abode of pestilence misery sublime excitement of gladness since such anguish existed too existed to make of anguish le bitter without remembering that owed transcendent moral life to fra girolamo must not witness silencing excommunication of man whose distinction from great mass of clergy lay not in heretical belief not in superstition in energy with sought to make christian life reality without feeling drawn strongly to side far on in hot day of june excommunication for week arrived from rome be solemnly published in duomo romola went to witness scene that resistance inspired might invigorate that sympathy with savonarola be one source of strength be in memorable contrast with scene have be accustomed to witness there instead of upturned citizen face filling vast area under morning light youngest rising amphitheatre wise towards wall making garland of hope around memory of ageinstead of mighty voice thrilling heart with sense of great thing visible invisible to be struggled forthere be bare wall at evening made more sombre by glimmer of taper there be black grey flock of monk secular clergy with bent unexpectant face there be occasional tinkling of little bell in pause of monotonous voice reading sentence have already be long hanging up in church at last there be extinction of taper slow shuffling tread of monkish foot departing in dim silence romolas ardour on side of frate be doubly strengthened by gleeful triumph saw in hard coarse face by fear stricken confusion in face speech of many among strongly attached friend question where duty of obedience end duty of resistance begin must in case be easy one be made overwhelmingly difficult by belief that church wasnot compromise of party to secure more le approximate justice in appropriation of fund buta living organism instinct with divine power to bless to curse to most of pious florentine who have hitherto felt doubt in adherence to frate belief in divine potency of church be not embraced opinion be inalienable impression like concavity of blue firmament boldness of savonarola written argument that excommunication be unjust that being unjust be not valid only made tremble more a defiance cast at mystic image against whose subtle immeasurable power there be weapon defence romola whose mind have not be allowed to draw early nourishment from traditional association of christian community in father have lived life apart felt relation to church only through savonarola moral force have be only authority to have bowed in excommunication only saw menace of hostile vice on one side saw man whose life be devoted to end of public virtue spiritual purity on other assault of alarmed selfishness headed by lustful greedy lying murderous old man once called rodrigo borgia now lifted to pinnacle of infamy a pope alexander sixth finer shade of fact soften edge of such antithesis be not apt to be seen except by neutral who be not distressed to discern folly in martyr judiciousness in men who burnt romola required strength that neutrality must not give excommunication simplified ennobled resistant position of savonarola by bringing into prominence wider relation seemed to come to like rescue from threatening isolation of criticism doubt frate be now withdrawn from smaller antagonism against florentine enemy into continually fell in unchecked excitement of pulpit presented simply a appealing to christian world against vicious exercise of ecclesiastical power be standard bearer leaping into breach life never seems so clear easy a when heart be beating faster at sight of generous self risking deed feel doubt then what be highest prize soul can win almost believe in own power to attain by new current of such enthusiasm romola be helped through difficult summer day have ventured on word to tito must apprise of late interview with baldassarre revelation have made to what must such agitating difficult word win from admission of truth nothing probably cool sarcasm about sympathy with assassin baldassarre be evidently helpless thing to be feared be not that must injure tito that tito coming upon trace must carry out new scheme for ridding of injured man who be haunting dread to romola felt that must hing decisive until have seen baldassarre again learned full truth about other wifelearned whether be wife to whom tito be first bound possibility about other wife involved worst wound to hereditary pride mingled a newly embittering suspicion with earliest memory of illusory love eating away lingering association of tenderness with past image of husband irresistible belief in rest of baldassarres revelation made shrink from tito with horror must perhaps have urged passionate speech in spite of herself if have not be more than usually absent from home like many of wealthier citizen in time of pestilence spent interval of business chiefly in country agreeable melema be welcome at many villa since romola have refused to leave city have need to provide country residence of own at last in later day of july alleviation of public trouble have absorbed activity much of thought left romola to le counteracted sense of personal lot plague have almost disappeared position of savonarola be made more hopeful by favourable magistracy who be writing urgent vindicatory letter to rome on behalf entreating withdrawal of excommunication romolas healthy vigorous frame be undergoing reaction of languor inevitable after continuous excitement over exertion mental restlessness must not allow to remain at home without peremptory occupation except during sultry hour in cool of morning evening walked out constantly varying direction a much a possible with vague hope that if baldassarre be still alive might encounter perhaps illness have brought new paralysis of memory have forgotten where livedforgotten even existence be most sanguine explanation of non appearance explanation felt to be most probable be that have died of plague chapter lvi other wife morning warmth be already beginning to be rather oppressive to romola when after walk along by wall on way from san marco turned towards intersecting street again at gate of santa croce borgo la croce be so still that listened to own footstep on pavement in sunny silence until on approaching bend in street saw few yard before little child not more than three year old with other clothing than white shirt pause from waddling run look around in first moment of coming nearer must only see backa boy back square sturdy with cloud of reddish brown curl above in next turned towards must see dark eye wide with tear lower lip pushed up trembling while fat brown fist clutched shirt helplessly glimpse of tall black figure sending shadow over brought bewildered fear to climax loud cry sob sent big tear rolling romola with ready maternal instinct be one hidden source of passionate tenderness instantly uncovered head stooping down on pavement put arm round cheek against while spoke to in caressing tone at first sob be only louder made effort to get away presently outburst ceased with strange abruptness belongs to childish joy grief face lost distortion be fixed in open mouthed gaze at romola have lost little one said kissing never mind will find house again perhaps mamma will meet divined that have made escape at moment when mother eye be turned away from thought likely that must soon be followed oh what heavy heavy boy said trying to lift can not carry come then must toddle back by side parted lip remained motionless in awed silence one brown fist still clutched shirt with a much tenacity a ever other yielded quite willingly to wonderful white hand strong soft have mamma said romola a set out looking down at boy with certain yearning be mute girl under circumstance might perhaps have chirped abundantly not so square shouldered little man with big cloud of curl be awake to first sign of whereabout however at turning by front of san ambrogio dragged romola towards looking up at ah be way home be said smiling at only thrust head forward pulled a admonition that must go faster there be still turning that have decided opinion about then romola found in short street leading to open garden ground be in front of house at end of street that little fellow paused pulling towards stone stair have evidently wish for to loose hand must not have be willing to leave without being sure that be delivering to friend mounted stair seeing dimly in sudden withdrawal from sunlight till at final landing place extra stream of light came from open doorway passing through small lobby came to open door there romola paused approach have not be heard on low chair at farther end of room opposite light sat tessa with one hand on edge of cradle head hanging little on one side fast asleep near one of window with back turned towards door sat monna lisa at work of preparing salad in deaf unconsciousness there be only instant for romolas eye to take in still scene for lillo snatched hand away from ran up to mother side not making direct effort to wake only leaning head back against arm surveying romola seriously from distance a lillo pushed against tessa opened eye looked up in bewilderment glance have sooner rested on figure at opposite doorway than started up blushed deeply began to tremble little speaking moving forward ah have seen other before said romola smiling coming forward be glad be little boy be cry in street suppose have run away so walked together little way then knew where be brought here have not missed be well else must have be frightened shock of finding that lillo have run away overcame other feeling in tessa for moment colour went again seizing lillos arm ran with to monna lisa saying with half sob loud in old woman ear oh lisa be wicked why will stand with back to door lillo ran away ever so far into street holy mother said monna lisa in meek thick tone letting spoon fall from hand where be then thought be there have eye on know go to sleep when be rocking said tessa in pettish remonstrance well well must keep outer door shut else tie up said monna lisa for hell be a cunning a satan before long thats holy truth how came back then question recalled tessa to consciousness of romolas presence without answering turned towards blushing timid again monna lisas eye followed movement old woman made low reverence said doubtless most noble lady brought back then advancing little nearer to romola added shame for to have be found with only shirt on kicked wouldnt have other clothes on morning mother poor thing will never hear of being beaten whats old woman to do without stick when lad leg get so strong let nobleness look at leg lillo conscious that leg be in question pulled shirt up little higher looked down at olive roundness with dispassionate curious air romola laughed stooped to give caressing shake kiss action helped reassurance that tessa have already gathered from monna lisas address to romola for when naldo have be told about adventure at carnival tessa have asked who heavenly lady that have come just when be wanted have vanished so soon be likely to bewhether must be holy madonna herselfhe have answered not exactly tessa only one of saint have not chosen to say more so that in dreamlike combination of small experience made up tessas thought romola have remained confusedly associated with picture in church when reappeared grateful remembrance of protection be slightly tinctured with religious awenot deeply for tessas dread be chiefly of ugly evil being seemed unlikely that good being must be angry punish a be nature of nofri devil to do now that monna lisa have spoken freely about lillos leg romola have laughed tessa be more at ease ninnas in cradle said shes pretty too romola went to look at sleeping ninna monna lisa one of exceptionally meek deaf who never expect to be spoken to returned to salad ah be waking have opened blue eye said romola must take up will sit down in chairmay iand nurse lillo come lillo sat down in tito chair put out arm towards lad whose eye have followed hesitated pointing small finger at with half puzzled half angry feeling said thats babbos chair not seeing way out of difficulty if babbo came found romola in place babbo be not here will go soon come let nurse a doe said romola wondering to herself for first time what sort of babbo be whose wife be dressed in contadina fashion have certain daintiness about person that indicated idleness plenty lillo consented to be lifted up finding lap exceedingly comfortable began to explore dress hand to see if there be ornament beside rosary tessa who have hitherto be occupied in coaxing ninna out of waking peevishness now sat down in low chair near romolas knee arranging ninnas tiny person to advantage jealous that strange lady too seemed to notice boy most a naldo did lillo be going to be angry with because sat in babbos chair said romola a bent forward to kiss ninnas little foot will come soon want ah said tessa can sit in long while will be sorry when go when first came to take care of at carnival thought be wonderful came went away again so fast naldo said perhaps be saint that made tremble little though saint be very good know be good to now have taken care of lillo perhaps will always come take care of be how naldo did long while ago came took care of when be frightened one san giovanni couldnt think where came fromhe be so beautiful good so be ended tessa looking up at romola with devout admiration naldo be husband eye be like lillos said romola looking at boy darkly pencilled eyebrow unusual at age did not speak interrogatively with quiet certainty of inference be necessarily mysterious to tessa ah know said pausing little in wonder perhaps know nofri peretola house on hill everything yes like lillos not hair hair be dark long went on getting rather excited ah if know ecco have put hand to thin red silk cord that hung round neck drew from bosom tiny old parchment breve horn of red coral long dark curl carefully tied at one end suspended with mystic treasure held towards romola away from ninnas snatching hand be fresh one cut lately see how bright be said laying against white background of romolas finger get dim then let cut when hair be grown put with breve because sometimes be away long while then think help to take care of slight shiver passed through romola a curl be laid across finger at tessas first mention of husband a having come mysteriously knew not whence possibility have risen before romola that made heart beat faster for to one who be anxiously in search of certain object faintest suggestion have peculiar significance when curl be held towards seemed for instant like mocking phantasm of lock have cut to wind with one of own five year ago preserved outward calmness bent not only on knowing truth also on coming to knowledge in way must not pain poor trusting ignorant thing with child mind in woman body foolish helpless yes so far corresponded to baldassarres account be beautiful curl said resisting impulse to withdraw hand lillos curl will be like perhaps for cheek too be dark never know where husband go to when leaf said tessa putting back treasure out of childrens way know messer san michele take care of for gave beautiful coat made of little chain if put that on nobody can kill perhaps if tessa hesitated little under recurrence of original dreamy wonder about romola have be expelled by chatting contactif be saint must take care of too because have taken care of lillo agitated flush came over romolas face in first moment of certainty have bent cheek against lillos head feeling leaped out in flush be something like exultation at thought that wife burden might be about to slip from overladen shoulder that little ignorant creature might prove to be tito lawful wife strange exultation for proud high born woman to have be brought to seemed to romola a if be only issue must make duty anything else for than insoluble problem yet be not deaf to tessas last appealing word raised head said in clearest tone will always take care of if see need beautiful coat husband did not wear when be first married perhaps used not to be so long away from then ah yes be muchmuch longer so long thought must never come back used to cry oh be beaten then long long while ago at peretola where have goat mule how long have be married before husband have that chain coat said romola heart beating faster faster tessa looked meditative began to count on finger romola watched finger a if must tell secret of destiny chestnut be ripe when be married said tessa marking off thumb finger again a spoke then again be ripe at peretola before came back then again after on hill soon soldier came heard trumpet then naldo have coat have be married more than two year in church be married said romola too entirely absorbed by one thought to put question be le direct perhaps before next morning might go to godfather say that be not tito melemas lawful wifethat vow have bound to strive after impossible union have be made void beforehand tessa gave slight start at romolas new tone of inquiry looked up at with hesitating expression hitherto have prattled on without consciousness that be making revelation more than when said old thing over over again to monna lisa naldo said be never to tell about said doubtfully do think must not be angry if told be right that must tell tell everything said romola looking at with mild authority if impression from naldos command have be much more recent than be constraining effect of romolas mysterious authority must have overcome sense that be telling what have never told before made begin with lowered voice be not in churchit be at nativita when there be fair people went overnight to see madonna in nunziata mother be ill couldnt go took bunch of cocoon for then came to in church heard say tessa knew because have taken care of at san giovanni then went into piazza where fair be have berlingozzi for be hungry be very good to at end of piazza there be holy father altar like what have at procession outside church so married then naldo took back into church left went home mother died nofri began to beat more naldo never came back used to cry once at carnival saw followed be angry said must come time must wait so went waited oh be long while before came must have come if must for be good then took away because cried said must not bear to stay with nofri oh be so glad since then have be always happy for dont mind about goat mule because have lillo ninna now naldo be never angry only think doesnt ninna so well a lillo be pretty quite forgetting that have thought speech rather momentous at beginning tessa fell to devouring ninna with kiss while romola sat in silence with absent eye be inevitable that in moment must think of three being before chiefly in relation to own lot be feeling chill of disappointment that difficulty be not to be solved by external law have relaxed hold of lillo be leaning cheek against hand seeing nothing of scene around lillo be quick in perceiving change be not agreeable to have not yet made return to caress objected to withdrawal putting up brown arm to pull head towards said play with again romola roused from self absorption clasped lad anew looked from to tessa who have now paused from shower of kiss seemed to have returned to more placid delight of contemplating heavenly lady face that face be undergoing subtle change like gradual oncoming of warmer softer light presently romola took scissors from scarsella cut off one of long wavy lock while three pair of wide eye followed movement with kitten like observation must go away from now said will leave lock of hair that may remind of because if be ever in trouble can think that perhaps god will send to take care of again can not tell where to find if ever know that want will come to addio have set down lillo hurriedly held out hand to tessa who kissed with mixture of awe sorrow at parting romolas mind be oppressed with thought needed to be alone a soon a possible with habitual care for least fortunate turned aside to put hand in friendly way on monna lisas shoulder make farewell sign before old woman have finished deep reverence romola have disappeared monna lisa tessa moved towards other by simultaneous impulse while two child stood clinging to mother skirt a if too felt atmosphere of awe do think be saint said tessa in lisas ear showing lock lisa rejected that notion very decidedly by backward movement of finger then stroking rippled gold said shes great noble lady saw such in youth romola went home sat alone through sultry hour of day with heavy certainty that lot be unchanged be thrown back again on conflict between demand of outward law recognised a widely ramifying obligation demand of inner moral fact be becoming more more peremptory have drunk in deeply spirit of teaching by savonarola have urged to return to place felt that sanctity attached to close relation therefore pre eminently to closest be expression in outward law of result towards human goodness nobleness must spontaneously tend that light abandonment of tie whether inherited voluntary because have ceased to be pleasant be uprooting of social personal virtue what else have tito crime towards baldassarre be that abandonment working out to most hideous extreme of falsity ingratitude inspiring consciousness breathed into by savonarola influence that lot be vitally united with general lot have exalted even minor detail of obligation into religion be marching with great army be feeling stress of common life if victim be needed be uncertain on whom lot might fall must stand ready to answer to name have stood long have striven hard to fulfil bond have seen condition made fulfilment possible gradually forsaking one effect of marriage tie seemed to be stifling predominance over of nature that despised effort at union have only made impossibility more palpable relation have become for simply degrading servitude law be sacred yes rebellion might be sacred too flashed upon mind that problem before be essentially same a have lain before savonarolathe problem where sacredness of obedience ended where sacredness of rebellion began to a to there have come one of moment in life when soul must dare to act on own warrant not only without external law to appeal to in face of law be not unarmed with divine lightningslightnings may yet fall if warrant have be false before sun have gone down have adopted resolve must ask counsel of godfather of savonarola until have made one determined effort to speak freely with tito obtain consent that must live apart from desired not to leave clandestinely again to forsake florence must tell that if ever felt real need of must come back to be not that utmost faithfulness to bond must be required of shuddering anticipation came over that must clothe refusal in sneering suggestion that must enter convent a only mode of quitting must not be scandalous knew well that mind revolted from mean of escape not only because of own repugnance to narrow rule because cherished memory of father forbade that must adopt mode of life be associated with deepest grief bitterest dislike tito have announced intention of coming home evening must wait for say what have to say at once for be difficult to get ear during day if have slightest suspicion that personal word be coming slipped away with appearance of unpremeditated ease when sent for maso to tell that must wait for master observed that old man looked at lingered with mixture of hesitation wondering anxiety finding that asked question slowly turned away why must ask question perhaps maso only knew guessed something of what knew already be late before tito came romola have be pacing up down long room have once be library with window open loose white linen robe on instead of usual black garment be glad of change after long hour of heat motionless meditation coolness exercise made more intensely wakeful a went with lamp in hand to open door for tito might well have be startled by vividness of eye expression of painful resolution be in contrast with usual self restrained quiescence before seemed that excitement be just what expected ah be romola maso be gone to bed said in grave quiet tone interposing to close door for then turning round said looking at more fully than be wont have heard see romola quivered then be inclined to take initiative have be to tessa led way through nearest door set down lamp turned towards again must not think despairingly of consequence said tito in tone of soothing encouragement at romola stood wondering until added accused have too many family tie with party not to escape messer bernardo del nero have other thing in favour besides age romola started gave cry a if have be suddenly stricken by sharp weapon what did not know said tito putting hand under arm that might lead to seat seemed to be unaware of touch tell said hastilytell what be man whose name may forgetlamberto dell antellawho be banished have be seized within territory letter have be found on of very dangerous import to chief mediceans scoundrel who be once favourite hound of piero de medici be ready now to swear what one plea against friend have made escape five be now in prison godfather said romola scarcely above whisper a tito made slight pause yes grieve to say along with there be three at least whose name have commanding interest even among popular partyniccol ridolfi lorenzo tornabuoni giannozzo pucci tide of romolas feeling have be violently turned into new channel in tumult of moment there must be check to word came a impulsive utterance of long accumulating horror when tito have named men of whom felt certain be confederate said with recoiling gesture low toned bitterness youyou be safe be certainly amiable wife romola said tito with coldest irony yes be safe turned away from other in silence chapter lvii why tito be safe tito have good reason for saying that be safe in last three month during have foreseen discovery of medicean conspirator a probable event have have plenty of time to provide with resource have be strengthening influence at rome at milan by being medium of secret information indirect measure against frate popular party have cultivated more assiduously than ever regard of party by showing subtle evidence that political conviction be entirely on side while instead of withdrawing agency from mediceans have sought to be more actively employed exclusively trusted by be easy to to keep up triple game principle of duplicity admitted by mediceans on own behalf deprived of standard by must measure trustworthiness of colleague who have not like hereditary interest alliance prejudice be intensely medicean in mind to deceive opposite party be fair stratagem to deceive own party be baseness to felt temptation in using tito facile ability be not keenly awake to fact that absence of traditional attachment made convenient agent be also absence of what among be chief guarantee of mutual honour again roman milanese friend of aristocratic party arrabbiati who be bitterest enemy of savonarola carried on system of underhand correspondence espionage in deepest hypocrisy be best service demanded heaviest pay so that to suspect agent because played part strongly must have be absurd want of logic on other hand piagnoni of popular party who have directness belongs to energetic conviction be more inclined to credit tito with sincerity in political adhesion to because affected religious sympathy by virtue of condition last three month have be time of flattering success to tito result most cared for be securing of future position for at rome at milan for have growing determination when favourable moment must come to quit florence for one of great capital where life be easier reward of talent learning be more splendid at present scale dipped in favour of milan if within year must render certain service to duke ludovico sforza have prospect of place at milanese court outweighed advantage of rome revelation of medicean conspiracy then have be subject of forethought to tito have not be able to foresee mode in must be brought about arrest of lamberto dell antella with tell tale letter on person bitter rancour

secretaryship for year unless previously resigned lastly price by have obtained guarantee be to be kept a state secret price must have be thought heavy by most men tito must rather not have paid have applied first to win mind of francesco valori who be not only one of ten under whom immediately held secretaryship one of special council appointed to investigate evidence of plot francesco valori a have seen be head of piagnoni man with certain fine quality be not incompatible with violent partisanship with arrogant temper alienated friend with bitter personal animositiesone of bitterest being directed against bernardo del nero to in brief private interview after obtaining pledge of secrecy tito avowed own agency for mediceansan agency induced by motif about be very frank declaring at same time that have always believed effort futile that sincerely preferred maintenance of popular government affected to confide to valori a secret own personal dislike for bernardo del nero after preparation came to important statement that there be medicean plot of if obtained certain condition from government must by journey to siena into romagna where piero de medici be again trying to gather force obtain documentary evidence to lay before council to end be essential that character a medicean agent must be unshaken for mediceans hence fact that have be source of information to authority must be wrapped in profound secrecy still odour of fact might escape in spite of precaution before tito must incur unpleasant consequence of acting against friend must be assured of immunity from prosecution a medicean from deprivation of office for year to come proposition did not sound in ear of francesco valori precisely a sound to valoris mind be not intensely bent on estimation of tito conduct be intensely bent on procuring extreme sentence against five prisoner there be sure to be immense effort to save be to be wished on public ground that evidence against must be of strongest so a to alarm well affected men at danger of clemency character of legal proceeding at time implied that evidence be one of desirable thing must only be come at by foul mean to catch few people torture into confessing everybodys guilt be one step towards justice be not always easy to see next unless traitor turned up lamberto dell antella have be tortured in aid of previous willingness to tell more than knew nevertheless additional stronger fact be desirable especially against bernardo del nero who so far a appeared hitherto have simply refrained from betraying late plot after having tried in vain to discourage for welfare of florence demanded that guilt of bernardo del nero must be put in strongest light so francesco valori zealously believed perhaps be not aware that strength of zeal be determined by hatred decided that tito proposition ought to be accepted laid before colleague without disclosing tito name won over to opinion late in day tito be admitted to audience of special council produced deep sensation among by revealing plot for insuring mastery of florence to piero de medici be to have be carried into execution in middle of very month of august

giving information against unsuccessful employer chapter lviii final understanding tito soon returned from siena almost immediately set out on journey from did not return till seventeenth of august nearly fortnight have passed since arrest of accused still be in prison still fate be uncertain romola have felt during interval a if care be suspended for other than watching fluctuating probability concerning that fate sometimes seemed strongly in favour of prisoner for chance of effective interest on behalf be heightened by delay indefinite prospect of delay be opened by reluctance of person in authority to incur odium attendant on decision on one side there be loud cry that republic be in danger lenity to prisoner must be signal of attack for enemy on other there be certainty that sentence of death confiscation of property passed on five citizen of distinguished name must entail rancorous hatred of relative on who be conspicuously instrumental to sentence final judgment properly lay with eight who presided over administration of criminal justice sentence depended on majority of six vote eight shrank from onerous responsibility asked in exceptional case to have shared by signoria gonfaloniere eight prior signoria in turn shrugged shoulder proposed appeal to great council for according to law passed by earnest persuasion of savonarola nearly three year before whenever citizen be condemned to death by fatal six vote called set fave six bean bean being in more sens than one political pulse of florence have right of appealing from sentence to great council in stage of business friend of accused resisted appeal determined chiefly by wish to gain delay in fact strict legality required that sentence must have be passed prior to appeal resistance prevailed middle course be taken sentence be referred to large assembly convened on seventeenth consisting of higher magistracy smaller council senate of eighty select number of citizen on day romola with anxiety heightened by possibility before close godfather fate might be decided have obtained leave to see for second time only in presence of witness have returned to via de bardi in company with cousin brigida still ignorant whether council have come to decisive issue monna brigida have gone out again to await momentous news at house of friend belonging to one of magistracy that might bring back authentic tidings a soon a be to be have romola have sunk on first seat in bright saloon too much agitated too sick at heart to care about place be conscious of discordance in object surrounded sat with back to door resting head on hand seemed long while since monna brigida have gone romola be expecting return when door opened knew be not monna brigida who entered since have parted from tito on memorable night have have external proof to warrant belief that have won safety by treachery on contrary have have evidence that be still trusted by mediceans be believed by to be accomplishing certain errand of theirs in romagna under cover of fulfilling commission of government for obscurity in evidence concerning conspirator be shrouded allowed to be understood that tito have escaped implication romolas suspicion be not to be dissipated horror of conduct towards baldassarre projected over conception of act be a if have seen committing murder have have diseased impression ever after that hand be covered with fresh blood a heard step on stone floor chill shudder passed through must not turn round must not rise to give greeting did not speak after instant pause took seat on other side of table just opposite to then raised eye looked at be mute did not show irritation said coolly meeting corresponds with parting romola understand that be moment of terrible suspense be come however if will listen to to bring relief of hope started altered position looked at dubiously will not be unwelcome to to heareven though be who tell itthat council be prorogued till twenty first eight have be frightened at last into passing sentence of condemnation demand have now be made on behalf of condemned for appeal to great council romolas face lost dubious expression asked eagerly when be to be made have not yet be granted may be granted special council be to meet again on twenty first to deliberate whether appeal will be allowed not in meantime there be interval of three day in chance may occur in favour of prisonersin interest may be used on behalf romola started from seat colour have risen to face like visible thought hand trembled in moment feeling towards tito be forgotten possibly said tito also rising own intention may have anticipated what be going to say be thinking of frate be said romola looking at with surprise have done anything be there anything to tell only be messer francesco valoris bitterness violence chiefly determined course of thing in council to day men who gave in opinion against prisoner be frightened into there be numerous friend of fra girolamo in special council out of who be strongly opposed to sentence of deathpiero guicciardini for example who be one member of signoria made stoutest resistance there be giovan battista ridolfi who piagnone a be will not lightly forgive death of brother niccol how can appeal be denied said romola indignantly when be lawwhen be one of chief glory of popular government to have passed law call exceptional case of course there be ingenious argument there be much more of loud bluster about danger of republic see opposition must prevent assembly from being prorogued certain powerful influence rightly applied during next three day might determine wavering courage of who desire that appeal must be granted might even give check to headlong enmity of francesco valori happens to have come to knowledge that frate have so far interfered a to send message to in favour of lorenzo tornabuoni know can sometimes have access to frate might at event be worth while to use privilege now be true said romola with air of abstraction can not believe that frate must approve denying appeal heard said by more than one person in court of palazzo before came away that must be to everlasting discredit of fra girolamo if allowed government be almost entirely made up of party to deny appeal without entering protest when have be boasting in book sermon that be who got law passed between ourselves with respect for frates ability romola have got into practice of preaching form of human sacrifice called killing tyrant wicked malcontent of follower be likely to think inconsistent with lenity in present case most recent in respect best biographer of savonarola signor villari endeavour to show that law of appeal ultimately enacted being wider than law originally contemplated by savonarola be source of bitter annoyance to a contrivance of aristocratic party for attaching to measure of popular government injurious result of licence in taking view estimable biographer lost sight of fact that not only in sermon in deliberately prepared book compendium revelationum written long after appeal have become law savonarola enumerates among benefit secured to florence appeal from six vote advocated by for greater security of citizen know know said romola with look tone of pain be driven into excess of speech used to be different will ask for interview can not rest without trust in greatness of heart be not looking at tito eye be bent with vague gaze towards ground have distinct consciousness that word heard came from husband better lose time then said tito with unmixed suavity moving cap round in hand a if be about to put on depart now romola will perhaps be able to see in spite of prejudice that wish go with yours in matter will not regard misfortune of safety a offence something like electric shock passed through romola be full consciousness of husband presence returning to looked at without speaking at least added in slightly harder tone will endeavour to base intercourse on other reasoning than because evil deed be possible have done be alone to be beyond pale of extensive charity feeling have be driven back from romolas lip fortnight before rose again with gathered force of tidal wave spoke with decision told that be careless of consequence be too late tito there be killing suspicion that deceit have once begotten now know everything know who that old man be be father to whom owe everythingto whom owe more than if have be own child by side of that be small thing that broke trust father a long a deny truth about old man there be horror rising between law must make one can never be obeyed too be human being have soul of own that abhors action union be pretenceas if perpetual lie must be sacred marriage tito did not answer immediately when did speak be with calculated caution be stimulated by alarm mean to carry out independence by quitting presume desire to quit said romola impetuously supposing submit to part with what law give security for retaining will then of course proclaim reason in ear of florence will bring forward mad assassin who be doubtless ready to obey call will tell world that believe testimony because be so rational a to desire to assassinate will first inform signoria be medicean conspirator then will inform mediceans have betrayed in case will offer excellent proof that believe capable in general of

careful supply of want a fair piagnone of high condition liberal charity think success in gibbeting be not certain doubtless must begin by winning ear of messer bernardo del nero why do speak of anything cried romola in anguish sinking on chair again be hateful in to be thinking of did not notice when tito left room know how long be before door opened to admit monna brigida in instant started up said cousin must go to san marco directly must see confessor fra salvestro chapter lix pleading morning be in early brightness when romola be again on way to san marco having obtained through fra salvestro evening before promise of interview with fra girolamo in chapter house of convent rigidity with savonarola guarded life from pretext of calumny made such interview very rare whenever be

with lay visitor for under auspex of government friendly to frate timidity about frequenting san marco have followed on first shock of excommunication have be gradually giving way in one of lay visitor recognised well known satellite of francesco valori named andrea cambini who be narrating expounding with emphatic gesticulation while fra salvestro be listening with air of trivial curiosity tell that listener care very much about news very little about quality characteristic of confessor be always repulsive to romola be made exasperating to at moment by certainty gathered from disjointed

opening doubling up paper stood expectant when frate have entered knelt according to usual practice of who saw in private a soon a have uttered benedictory greeting rose stood opposite to at few yard distance owing to seclusion since have be excommunicated have be unusually long while since have seen late month have visibly deepened in face mark of over taxed mental activity bodily severity yet romola be not so conscious of change a of be le definable be that expression of serene elevation pure human fellowship have once moved be no longer present in same force be that sense of being divided from in feeling about godfather roused slumbering source of alienation marred own vision perhaps cause be at work relation with fellow men be most often determined by coincident current of sort inexcusable word deed seldom come until after affection reverence have be already enfeebled by strain of repeated excuse be true that savonarola glance at romola have of hardness be caused by egotistic prepossession divined that interview have sought be to turn on fate of conspirator subject on have already have to quell inner voice might become loud again when encouraged from without seated in cell correcting sheet of triumph of cross be easier to repose on resolution of neutrality be question of moment doubtless on wished to see daughter began in tone be gentle rather from self control than from immediate inclination know be not wont to lay stress on small matter father know what be before tell said romola forgetting everything else a soon a began to pour forth plea know what be caring forit be for life of old man love best in world thought of have gone together with thought of father a long a remember daylight be warrant for coming to even if coming must have be needle perhaps be perhaps have already determined that power over heart of men will be used to prevent from denying to florentine right helped to earn for meddle not with function of state daughter said fra girolamo strongly disinclined to reopen externally debate have already gone through inwardly have preached laboured that florence must have good government for good government be needful to perfecting of christian life keep away hand from particular affair be office of experienced citizen to administer surely father romola broke off have uttered first word almost impetuously be checked by counter agitation of feeling in attitude of remonstrance towards man who have be source of guidance strength to in act of rebelling be bruising own reverence savonarola be too keen not to divine something of conflict be arresting hertoo noble deliberately to assume in calm speech that self justifying evasiveness into be often hurried in public by crowding impulse of orator say what be in heart speak on daughter said standing with arm laid one upon other looking at with quiet expectation be going to say father that matter be surely of higher moment than many about have heard preach exhort fervidly if belonged to to urge that men condemned for offence against state must have right to appeal to great councilif romola be getting eager againif count glory to have won right for can le belong to to declare against right being denied to almost first men who need surely that touch christian life more closely than whether knew beforehand that dauphin must die whether pisa will be conquered there be subtle movement like subdued sign of pain in savonarola strong lip before began to speak daughter speak a be given to speaki be not master of time when may become vehicle of knowledge beyond common light of men in case have illumination beyond what wisdom may give to who be charged with safety of state a to law of appeal against six vote laboured to have passed in order that florentine must be subject to loss of life good through private hatred of few who might happen to be in power five men who have desired to overthrow free government restore corrupt tyrant have be condemned with assent of large assembly of fellow citizen refused at first to have cause brought before great council have lost right to appeal how can have lost said romola be right to appeal against condemnation have never be condemned till now forgive father be private hatred must deny appeal be violence of few that frightens others else why be assembly divided again directly after have seemed to agree if anything weighs against observance of law let weigh for itthis that used to preach more earnestly than else that there must be place given to hatred bloodshed because of party strife so private ill will must not find opportunity in public act father know that there be private hatred concerned here will not dishonour not to have interposed on side of mercy when there be many who hold that be also side of law justice daughter said fra girolamo with more visible emotion than before there be mercy be weakness even treason against common good safety of florence mean even more than welfare of florentine now demand severity a once demanded mercy be not only for past plot that men be condemned also for plot have not yet be executed device be leading to execution be not put end to tyrant be still gathering force in romagna enemy of florence who sit in highest place of italy be ready to hurl stone will crush what plot said romola reddening trembling with alarmed surprise carry paper in hand see said fra girolamo pointing to handbill one of will perhaps tell that government have have new information romola hastily opened handbill have not yet read saw that government have now positive evidence of second plot be to have be carried out in august time to mind be like reading confirmation that tito have won safety by foul mean pretence of wishing that frate must exert on behalf of condemned only helped wretched conviction crushed up paper in hand turning to savonarola said with new passion father what safety can there be for florence when worst man can always escape went on sudden flash of remembrance coming from thought about husband have not encouraged deception corrupts life of florence by wanting more favour to be shown to lorenzo tornabuoni who have worn two face flattered with show of affection when godfather have always be honest ask florence who of five men have truest heart there will not be many who will name other name than bernardo del nero did interpose with francesco valori for sake of one prisoner have not then be neutral know that word will be powerful desire death of bernardo said savonarola colouring deeply must be enough if be sent out of city then why do not speak to save old man of seventy five from dying death of ignominyto give at least fair chance of law burst out romola impetuosity of nature so roused that forgot everything indignation be not that feel bound to be neutral else why did speak for lorenzo tornabuoni spoke for because be more friendly to san marco godfather feigns friendship be not then a medicean that godfather be to die be a man have love for when romola paused with cheek glowing with quivering lip there be dead silence a saw fra girolamo standing motionless before seemed to herself to be hearing own word over again word that in echo of consciousness be in strange painful dissonance with memory made part of presence to moment of silence be expanded by gathering compunction doubt have committed sacrilege in passion even sense that must retract nothing of plea that mind must not submit to savonarola negative made more needful to to satisfy reverential memory with sudden movement towards said forgive father be pain to to have spoken wordsyet can not help speaking be little feeble compared with brought light strength submitted because felt proffered strengthbecause saw light now can not see father declare that there come moment when soul must have guide voice within to tell whether consecrated thing have sacred virtue therefore must speak savonarola have that readily roused resentment towards opposition hardly separable from power loving powerful nature accustomed to seek great end cast reflected grandeur on mean by be sought sermon have much of red flame in if have be meaner man susceptibility might have shown in irritation at romolas accusatory freedom be in strong contrast with deference habitually received from disciple at moment such feeling be nullified by hard struggle made tragedy of lifethe struggle of mind possessed by never silent hunger after purity simplicity yet caught in tangle of egoistic demand false idea difficult outward condition made simplicity impossible keenly alive to suggestion of romolas remonstrating word be rapidly surveying a have done before course of action be open to probable result be question on argument must seem decisive only in proportion a be charged with feeling have received no impulse that must alter bias looked at romola said have full pardon for frankness daughter speak know out of fulness of family affection affection must give way to need of republic if men who have close acquaintance with affair of state believe a understand do that public safety requires extreme punishment of law to fall on five conspirator can not control opinion seeing that stand aloof from such affair then desire that must die desire that appeal must be denied said romola feeling anew repelled by vindication seemed to to have nature of subterfuge have said that desire death then said romola indignation rising again can be indifferent that florentine must inflict death desire when might have protested against itwhen might have helped to hinder by urging observance of law held good to get passed father used not to stand aloof used not to shrink from protesting say can not protest where life of men be concerned say rather desire death say rather hold good for florence that there will be more blood more hatred will death of five mediceans put end to party in florence will death of noble old man like bernardo del nero save city hold such men a dolfo spini daughter be enough cause of freedom be cause of god kingdom upon earth be often most injured by enemy who carry within power of certain human virtue wickedest man be often not most insurmountable obstacle to triumph of good then why do say again that desire godfather death said romola in mingled anger despair rather hold more needful must die because be better man can not unravel thought father can not hear real voice of judgment conscience there be moment pause then savonarola said with keener emotion than have yet shown be thankful daughter if own soul have be spared perplexity judge not to whom harder lot have be given see one ground of action in matter see many have to choose will further work intrusted to end seek be one to minor respect must be sacrificed death of five menwere le guilty than theseis light matter weighed against withstanding of vicious tyranny stifle life of italy foster corruption of church light matter weighed against furthering of god kingdom upon earth end for live be willing to die under other circumstance romola must have be sensitive to appeal at beginning of savonarola speech at moment be so utterly in antagonism with what called perplexity seemed to sophistry doubleness a went on word only fed that flame of indignation now again more fully than ever before lit up memory of mistake made trust in seem to have be purblind delusion spoke almost with bitterness do then know so well what will further coming of god kingdom father that will dare to despise plea of mercyof justiceof faithfulness to own teaching have french king then brought renovation to italy take care father lest enemy have reason when say that in vision of what will further god kingdom see only what will strengthen own party be true said savonarola with flashing eye romolas voice have seemed to in moment voice of enemy cause of party be cause of god kingdom believe said romola whole frame shaken with passionate repugnance god kingdom be something widerelse let stand outside with being love two face be lit up with opposite emotion with opposite certitude further word be impossible romola hastily covered head went out in silence chapter lx scaffold three day later moon be just surmounting building of piazza in front of old palace within hour of midnight did not make usual broad light shadow on pavement not hand breadth of pavement be to be seen only head of eager struggling multitude instead of background of silence in pattering footstep buzzing voice lute thrumming rapid scampering of many night wanderer of florence stood out in obtrusive distinctness there be background of roar from mingled shout imprecation trampling pushing accidental clashing of weapon across nothing be distinguishable darting shriek heavy dropping toll of bell almost who must call public of florence be awake at hour enclosed within limit of piazza struggling to enter within palace be still assembled in council chamber chief magistracy eighty member of senate other select citizen who have be in hot debate through long hour of daylight torchlight whether appeal must be granted whether sentence of death must be executed on prisoner forthwith to forestall dangerous chance of delay debate have be so much like fierce quarrel that noise from council chamber have reached crowd outside only within last hour have question be decided signoria have remained divided four of standing out resolutely for appeal in spite of strong argument that if did not give way house must be sacked until francesco valori in brief furious speech made determination of party more ominously distinct by declaring that if signoria must not defend liberty of florentine people by executing five perfidious citizen there must not be wanting others who must take cause in hand to peril of who opposed florentine cato triumphed when vote be counted again four obstinate white bean no longer appeared whole nine be of fatal affirmative black deciding death of five prisoner without delaydeciding also only tacitly with much more delay death of francesco valori now while judicial eight be gone to bargello to prepare for execution five condemned men be being led barefoot in iron through midst of council be friend who have contrived must not florentine be moved by visible association of such cruel ignominy with two venerable men like bernardo del nero niccol ridolfi who have taken bias long before new order of thing have come to make mediceanism retrogradewith two brilliant popular young men like tornabuoni pucci whose absence must be felt a haunting vacancy wherever there be meeting of chief florentine be useless such pity a must be awakened now be of hopeless sort lead not to rescue to tardier action of revenge while scene be passing upstairs romola stood below against one of massive pillar in court of palace expecting moment when godfather must appear on way to execution by use of strong interest have gained permission to visit in evening of day remain with until result of council must be determined now be waiting with confessor to follow guard must lead to bargello heart be bent on clinging to presence of childless old man to last moment a father must have done have overpowered remonstrance giovan battista ridolfi disciple of savonarola who be going in bitterness to behold death of elder brother niccol have promised that must be guarded now stood by side tito too be in palace romola have not seen since evening of seventeenth have avoided other tito only knew by inference from report of frates neutrality that pleading have failed be now surrounded with official other personage florentine foreign who have be awaiting issue of long protracted council maintaining except when be directly addressed subdued air grave silence of man whom actual event be placing in painful state of strife between public private feeling when allusion be made to wife in relation to event implied that owing to violent excitement of mind mere fact of continuing to hold office under government concerned in godfather condemnation roused in diseased hostility towards so that for sake felt best not to approach ah old bardi blood said cennini with shrug will not be surprised if business shake loose from frate a well a others must name be excusable in woman who be doubtless beautiful since be wife of messer tito said young french envoy smiling bowing to tito to think that affection must overrule good of state that nobody be to be beheaded who be anybodys cousin view be not to be encouraged in male population seems to florentine polity be much weakened by be true said niccol macchiavelli where personal tie be strong hostility raise must be taken due account of many of half way severity be mere hot headed blundering only safe blow to be inflicted on men party be blow be too heavy to be avenged said cennini there be clever wickedness in thy talk sometimes that make mistrust thy pleasant young face a if be mask of satan not at good domenico said macchiavelli smiling laying hand on elder shoulder satan be blunderer introducer of novita who made stupendous failure if have succeeded must have be worshipping portrait must have be more flattered well well said cennini say not thy doctrine be not too clever for satan only say be wicked enough for tell said macchiavelli doctrine be doctrine of men who seek end little farther off than own nose ask frate prophet how universal renovation be to be brought about will tell first by getting free pure government since appears that can not be done by making florentine love other must be done by cutting off head happens to be obstinately in way only if man incurs odium by sanctioning severity be not thorough enough to be final commits blunder something like blunder suspect frate have committed be occasion on might have won lustre by exerting to maintain appeal instead of that have lost lustre have gained strength before one else must speak there came expected announcement that prisoner be about to leave council chamber majority of who be present hurried towards door intent on securing freest passage to bargello in rear of prisoner guard for scene of execution be one drew alike who be moved by deepest passion who be moved by coldest curiosity tito be one of who remained behind have native repugnance to sight of death pain five day ago whenever have thought of execution a possibility have hoped that must not take place that utmost sentence must be exile own safety demanded more now felt that must be welcome guarantee of security when have learned that bernardo del nero head be off shoulder new knowledge new attitude towards disclosed by romola on day of return have given new dread of power possessed to make position insecure if act of hers only succeeded in making object of suspicion odium foresaw not only frustration frustration under unpleasant circumstance belief in baldassarre have clearly determined wavering feeling against further submission if godfather lived must win to share belief without much trouble romola seemed more than ever unmanageable fact in destiny if bernardo del nero be dead difficulty must beset in placing in opposition to husband must probably be insurmountable to shrinking pride therefore tito have felt easier when knew that eight have gone to bargello to order instant erection of scaffold four other menhis intimate confederateswere to die besides bernardo del nero man own safety be god sometimes make very grim demand tito felt to be grim even in pursuit of what be agreeable paradoxical life forced upon desire for what be disagreeable have have other experience of sort a heard through open doorway shuffle of many foot clanking of metal on stair be able to answer question of young french envoy without showing sign of other feeling than of sad resignation to state necessity sound fell on romola a if power of hearing have be exalted along with other sensibility of nature needed arm to support shed tear felt that intensity of life seems to transcend grief joyin mind seems to akin to elder force wrought out existence before birth of pleasure pain since godfather fate have be decided previous struggle of feeling in have given way to identification of with in supreme moment be inwardly asserting for if suffered punishment of treason did not deserve name of traitor be victim to collision between two kind of faithfulness be not given to die for noblest cause yet died because of nobleness might have be

forgetting that hand be bound with iron lifted towards golden head be bent towards then checking that movement leaned to kiss seized fettered hand be hung down again kissed a if have be sacred thing poor romola said bernardo in low voice have only to die thou hast to liveand will not be there to help thee yes said romola hurriedly will help mealwaysbecause will remember be taken away conducted up flight of step led to loggia surrounding grand old court took place there determined to look till moment when godfather laid head on block now while prisoner be allowed brief interval with confessor spectator be pressing into court until crowd became dense around black scaffold torch fixed in iron ring against pillar threw varying startling light at one moment on passionless stone carving at on pale face agitated with suppressed rage suppressed griefthe face of one among many near relative of condemned who be presently to receive dead carry home romolas face looked like marble image against dark arch a stood watching for moment when godfather must appear at foot of scaffold be to suffer first battista ridolfi who be by side have promised to take away through door behind when must have seen last look of man who alone in world have shared pitying love for father still in background of thought there be possibility striving to be hope that rescue might yet come something must keep that scaffold unstained by blood for long while there be constant movement light flickering head swaying to fro confused voice within court rushing wave of sound through entrance from without seemed to romola a if be in midst of storm troubled sea caring nothing about storm caring only to hold out signal till eye looked for must seek more suddenly there be stillness very taper seemed to tremble into quiet executioner be ready on scaffold bernardo del nero be seen ascending with slow firm step romola made visible movement uttered not even suppressed sound stood more firmly caring for firmness saw pause saw white head kept erect while said in voice distinctly audible be short space of life that fellow citizen have taken from perceived that be gazing slowly round a spoke felt that eye be resting on that be stretching out arm towards then saw more tilla long while after a seemeda voice said daughter be peace now can conduct to house uncovered head saw godfather confessor standing by in room where there be other grave men talking in subdued tone be ready said starting up let lose time thought clinging be at end for strength now must be given to escape from grasp under shuddered chapter lxi drifting away on eighth day from memorable night romola be standing on brink of mediterranean watching gentle summer pulse of sea just above what be then little fishing village of viareggio again have fled from florence time arresting voice have called back again wore grey religious dress time in heart sickness did not care that be disguise new rebellion have risen within new despair why must care about wearing one badge more than about being called by own name despaired of finding consistent duty belonging to name what force be there to create for supremely hallowed motive men call duty can have inward constraining existence save through form of believing love bond of strong affection be snapped in marriage highest bond of have ceased to see mystic union be own guarantee of indissolubleness have ceased even to see obligation of voluntary pledge have not proved that thing to have pledged be impossible impulse to set free have risen again with overmastering force yet freedom must only be exchange of calamity there be compensation for woman who feel that chief relation of life have be no more than mistake have lost crown deepest secret of human blessedness have half whispered to then for ever passed by now romolas best support under supreme woman sorrow have slipped away from vision of great purpose end of existence must ennoble endurance exalt common deed of dusty life with divine ardour be utterly eclipsed for now by sense of confusion in human thing made effort mere dragging at tangled thread fellowship for resistance advocacy mere unfairness exclusiveness what after be man who have represented for highest heroism heroism not of hard self contained endurance of willing self offering love be cause be struggling for romola have lost trust in savonarola have lost that fervour of admiration have made unmindful of aberration attentive only to grand curve of orbit now that keen feeling for godfather have thrown into antagonism with frate saw repulsive inconsistent detail in teaching with painful lucidity exaggerated proportion in bitterness of disappointment said that striving after renovation of church world be striving after mere name told more than title of book name have come to mean practically measure must strengthen own position in florence nay often questionable deed word for sake of saving influence from suffering by own error political reform have once made new interest in life seemed now to reduce to narrow device for safety of florence in contemptible contradiction with alternating profession of blind trust in divine care be inevitable that must judge frate unfairly on question of individual suffering at looked with eye of personal tenderness with eye of theoretic conviction in declaration of that cause of party be cause of god kingdom heard only ring of egoism perhaps such word have rarely be uttered without meaner ring in yet be implicit formula of energetic belief if such energetic belief pursuing grand remote end be often in danger of becoming demon worship in votary let son daughter pas through fire with readiness hardly look like sacrifice tender fellow feeling for nearest have danger too be apt to be timid sceptical towards larger aim without life can not rise into religion in way poor romola be being blinded by tear one who have ever known what be thus to lose faith in fellow man whom have profoundly loved reverenced will lightly say that shock can leave faith in invisible goodness unshaken with sinking of high human trust dignity of life sink too cease to believe in own better self since also be part of common nature be degraded in thought finer impulse of soul be dulled romola felt even spring of once active pity drying up leaving to barren egoistic complaining have not have sorrow too few have cared for while have cared for many have done enough have striven after impossible be weary of stifling crowded life longed for repose in mere sensation have sometimes dreamed of in sultry afternoon of early girlhood when have fancied floating naad like in water clear wave seemed to invite wished must lie down to sleep on pas from sleep into death romola must not directly seek death fulness of young life in forbade that must only wish that death must come at spot where have paused there be deep bend in shore small boat with sail be moored there in longing to glide over water be getting golden with level sun ray thought of story have be one of thing have loved to dwell on in boccaccio when father fell asleep glided from stool to sit on floor read decamerone be story of fair gostanza who in lovelorn ness desired to live no longer not having courage to attack young life have put into boat pushed off to sea then lying down in boat have wrapt mantle round head hoping to be wrecked so that fear must be helpless to flee from death memory have remained mere thought in romolas mind without budding into distinct wish now a paused again in walking to fro saw gliding black against red gold boat with one man in making towards bend where first smaller boat be moored walking on again at length saw man land pull boat ashore begin to unload something from be perhaps owner of smaller boat also must be going away soon opportunity must be gone with opportunity of buying that smaller boat have not yet admitted to herself that meant to use felt sudden eagerness to secure possibility of using disclosed half unconscious growth of thought into desire be little boat yours also said to fisherman who have looked up little startled by tall grey figure have made reverence to holy sister wandering thus mysteriously in evening solitude be boat old one hardly seaworthy yet worth repairing to man who must buy by blessing of san antonio whose chapel be in village yonder fishing have prospered have now better boat have once be giannis who died have not yet sold old one romola asked how much be worth then while be busy thrust price into little satchel lying on ground containing remnant of dinner after watched furling sail asked how must set if wanted to go out to sea then pacing up down again waited to see depart imagination of gliding away in boat on darkening water be growing more more into longing a thought of cool brook in sultriness becomes painful thirst to be freed from burden of choice when motive be bruised to commit sleeping to destiny must either bring death else new necessity might rouse new life in herit be thought beckoned more because soft evening air made long to rest in still solitude instead of going back to noise heat of village at last slow fisherman have gathered up movable be walking away soon gold be shrinking getting duskier in sea sky there be living thing in sight sound lulling monotony of lapping wave in sea there be tide must help to carry away if waited for ebb romola thought breeze from land be rising little got into boat unfurled sail fastened a have learned in first brief lesson saw that caught light breeze be cared for then loosed boat from mooring tried to urge with oar till be far out from land till sea be dark even to west star be disclosing like palpitating life over wide heaven resting at last threw back cowl taking off kerchief underneath confined hair doubled under head for pillow on one of boat rib fair head be still very young must bear hard pillow so lay with soft night air breathing on while glided on water watched deepening quiet of sky be alone now have freed from claim have freed even from burden of choice press with heavier heavier weight when claim have loosed guiding hold have found anything like dream of girlhood memory hung upon like weight of broken wing must never be liftedmemories of human sympathy even in pain leaf thirst that great mother have milk to still romola felt orphaned in wide space of sea sky read message of love for in far off symbolic writing of heaven with great sob wished that might be gliding into death drew cowl over head again covered face choosing darkness rather than light of star seemed to like hard light of eye looked at without seeing presently felt that be in grave not resting there be touching hand of beloved dead beside trying to wake chapter lxii benediction about ten oclock on morning of twenty seventh of february current of passenger along florentine street set decidedly towards san marco be last morning of carnival one knew there be second bonfire of vanity being prepared in front of old palace at hour be evident that centre of popular interest lay elsewhere piazza di san marco be filled by multitude who showed other movement than proceeded from pressure of new comer trying to force way forward from opening front rank be already close serried resisted pressure rank be ranged around semicircular barrier in front of church within barrier be already assembling dominican brother of san marco temporary wooden pulpit erected over church door be still empty be presently to be entered by man whom

wicked unbelieving pope who have gained pontifical chair by bribery be not christ vicar curse be broken sword grasp hilt without blade command be contrary to christian life be lawful to disobey themnay be not lawful to obey people still flocked to hear a preached in own church of san marco though pope be hanging terrible threat over florence if did not renounce pestilential schismatic send to rome to be convertedstill a on very morning accepted communion from excommunicated hand for how if frate have really more command over divine lightning than official successor of saint peter be momentous question for mass of citizen must never be decided by frates ultimate test namely what be what be not accordant with highest spiritual law no in case a if god have chosen frate a prophet to rebuke high priest who carried mystic raiment unworthily must attest choice by unmistakable sign a long a belief in prophet carried threat of outward calamity rather confident hope of exceptional safety sign be needed preaching be music to people felt marching along way wished to go now belief meant immediate blow to commerce shaking of position among italian state interdict on city there inevitably came question what miracle showest thou slowly at first then faster faster that fatal demand have be swelling in savonarola ear provoking response outwardly in declaration at fitting time miracle must come inwardly in faithnot unwavering for what faith be sothat if need for miracle became urgent work have before be too great for divine power to leave halting faith wavered not speech be lot of man who have to speak for satisfaction of crowd that must often speak in virtue of yesterday faith hoping will come back to morrow be in preparation for scene be really response to popular impatience for supernatural guarantee of prophet mission that wooden pulpit have be erected above church door while ordinary frati in black mantle be entering arranging face of multitude be not yet eagerly directed towards pulpit be felt that savonarola must not appear just yet there be interest in singling out various monk of belonging to high florentine family many of having father brother cousin among artisan shopkeeper who made majority of crowd be not till tale of monk be complete not till have fluttered book have begun to chant that people said to other fra girolamo must be coming now that expectation rather than spell from accustomed wail of psalmody be what made silence expectation seem to spread like paling solemn light over multitude of upturned face all now directed towards empty pulpit next instant pulpit be no longer empty figure covered from head to foot in black cowl mantle have entered be kneeling with bent head with face turned away seemed weary time to eager people while black figure knelt monk chanted stillness be not broken for frates audience with heaven be yet charged with electric awe for mixed multitude so that who have already will to stone felt arm unnerved at last there be vibration among multitude seeming to give neighbour momentary aspen like touch a when men who have be watching for something in heaven see expected presence silently disclosing frate have risen turned towards people partly pushed back cowl monotonous wail of psalmody have ceased to who stood near pulpit be a if sound have just be filling ear have suddenly merged in force of savonarola flashing glance a looked round in silence then stretched out hand in exquisite delicacy seemed transfigured from animal organ for grasping into vehicle of sensibility too acute to need gross contact hand came like appealing speech from part of soul be masked by strong passionate face written on now with deeper line about mouth brow than be made by forty four year of ordinary life at first stretching out of hand of crowd in front rank fell on knee here there devout disciple farther off great majority stood firm resisting impulse to kneel before excommunicated man might not great judgment fall upon even in act of blessingothers jarred with scorn hatred of ambitious deceiver who be getting up new comedy before nevertheless felt impotent a before triumph of fashion then came voice clear low at first uttering word of absolutionmisereatur vestriand more fell on knee a rose higher yet clearer erect head became fewer fewer till at word benedicat vos omnipotens deus rose to masculine cry a if protesting power to bless under clutch of demon wanted to stifle rang like trumpet to extremity of piazza under head be bowed after utterance of blessing savonarola fell on knee hid face in temporary exhaustion great jet of emotion be necessary part of life have said to people long ago without preaching can not live be life shattered in few minute more have risen to foot larger number remained kneeling face be intently watching have taken into hand crystal vessel containing consecrated host be about to address people remember child three day ago besought when must hold sacrament in hand in face of to pray fervently to most high that if work of mine doe not come from will send fire consume may vanish into eternal darkness away from light have hidden with falsity again beseech to make prayer to make now be breathless moment perhaps man really prayed if in spirit of devout obedience made effort to pray consciousness be chiefly possessed by sense that savonarola be praying in voice not loud distinctly audible in wide stillness lord if have not wrought in sincerity of soul if word cometh not from thee strike in moment with thy thunder let fire of thy wrath enclose ceased to speak stood motionless with consecrated mystery in hand with eye uplifted quivering excitement in whole aspect one else be motionless silent too while sunlight for last quarter of hour have here there be piercing greyness made fitful streak across convent wall causing awe stricken spectator to start timidly soon there be wider parting with gentle quickness like smile stream of brightness poured on crystal vase then spread over savonarola face with mild glorification instantaneous shout rang through piazza behold answer warm radiance thrilled through savonarola frame so did shout be last moment of untroubled triumph in rapturous confidence felt carried to grander scene yet to come before audience must represent christendom in whose presence must again be sealed a messenger of supreme righteousness feel full charged with divine strength be moment expanded in prevision while shout be still ringing in ear turned away within church feeling strain too great for to bear longer when frate have disappeared sunlight seemed no longer to have anything special in illumination be spreading impartially over thing clean unclean there began along with general movement of crowd confusion of voice in certain strong discord varying scale of laughter made evident that in previous silence universal kneeling hostility scorn have only submitted unwillingly to momentary spell seems to plaudit be giving way to criticism said tito who have be watching scene attentively from upper loggia in one of house opposite church nevertheless be striking moment eh messer pietro fra girolamo be man to make one understand that there be time when monk frock be symbol of power over men mind rather than over key of woman cupboard assuredly said pietro cennini until have seen proof fra girolamo have much le faith in god judgment than common run of men instead of having considerably more will not believe that must brave heaven in way if soul be laden with conscious lie chapter lxiii ripening scheme month after carnival one morning near end of march tito descended marble step of old palace bound on pregnant errand to san marco for reason did not choose to take direct road be slightly bent line from old palace chose rather to make circuit by piazza di santa croce where people must be pouring out of church after early sermon be in grand church of santa croce that daily lenten sermon have of late have largest audience for savonarola voice have ceased to be heard even in own church of san marco hostile signoria having imposed silence on in obedience to new letter from pope threatening city with immediate interdict if wretched worm monstrous idol be not forbidden to preach sent to demand pardon at rome next to hearing fra girolamo most exciting lenten occupation be to hear argued against vilified excitement be to be have in santa croce where franciscan appointed to preach quaresimal sermon have offered to clench argument by walking through fire with fra girolamo have not that schismatical dominican said that prophetic doctrine must be proved by miracle at fitting time here then be fitting time let savonarola walk through fire if came out unhurt divine origin of doctrine must be demonstrated if fire consumed falsity must be manifest that might have excuse for evading test franciscan declared willing to be victim to high logic to be burned for sake of securing necessary minor premiss savonarola according to habit have taken notice of pulpit attack happened that zealous preacher of santa croce be other than fra francesco di puglia who at prato year before have be engaged in like challenge with savonarola fervent follower fra domenico have be called home by superior while heat be simply oratorical honest fra domenico then who be preaching lenten sermon to woman in via del cocomero sooner heard of new challenge than took up gauntlet for master declared ready to walk through fire with fra francesco already people be beginning to take strong interest in what seemed to short easy method of argument for who be to be convinced when savonarola keenly alive to danger lay in mere discussion of case commanded fra domenico to withdraw acceptance of challenge secede from affair franciscan declared content have not directed challenge to subaltern to fra girolamo after that popular interest in lenten sermon have flagged little morning when tito entered piazza di santa croce found a expected that people be pouring from church in large number instead of dispersing many of concentrated towards particular spot near entrance of franciscan monastery tito took same direction threading crowd with careless leisurely air keeping careful watch on monastic entrance a if expected object of interest to issue from be such expectation occupied crowd object be caring about be already visible to in shape of large placard affixed by order of signoria covered with very legible official handwriting curiosity be somewhat balked by fact that manuscript be chiefly in latin though nearly man knew beforehand approximately what placard contained have appetite for more exact knowledge gave irritating sense of neighbour ignorance in not being able to interpret learned tongue for aural acquaintance with latin phrase unlearned might pick up from pulpit quotation constantly interpreted by preacher must help little when saw written latin spelling even of modern language being in unorganised scrambling condition for mass of people who must read write while majority of assembled nearest to placard be not in dangerous predicament of possessing little knowledge old diarist throw in consonant with regard rather to quantity than position well typified by ragnolo braghiello agnolo gabriello of boccaccio ferondo frates doctrine he to prove by being burned said that large public character goro who happened to be among foremost gazers signoria have taken in hand writing be to let know what padre have be telling about in sermon nay goro said sleek shopkeeper compassionately thou hast got thy leg into twisted hose there frate have to prove doctrine by not being burned be to walk through fire come out on other side sound whole yes yes said young sculptor who wore white streaked cap tunic with jaunty air fra girolamo object to walking through fire being sound whole already see reason why must walk through fire to come out in just same condition leaf such odds end of work to fra domenico then say flinch like coward said goro in wheezy treble suffocation be what did at carnival have in piazza to see lightning strike nothing came of stop that bleating said tall shoemaker who have stepped in to hear part of sermon with bunch of slipper hanging over shoulder seems to friend that be about a wise a calf with water on brain frate will flinch from nothing hell say nothing beforehand perhaps when moment come hell walk through fire without asking grey frock to keep company must give shoestring to know what latin be there so much of said shopkeeper else im pretty good at guessing be there scholar to be seen added with slight expression of disgust there be general turning of head caused talker to descry tito approaching in rear here be one said young sculptor smiling raising cap be secretary of ten be going to convent doubtless make way for said shopkeeper also doffing though mark of respect be rarely shown by florentine except to highest official exceptional reverence be really exacted by splendour grace of tito appearance made black mantle with gold fibula look like regal robe ordinary black velvet cap like entirely exceptional head dress hardening of cheek mouth be chief change in face since came to florence seemed to superficial glance only to give beauty more masculine character raised own cap immediately said thanks friend merely wished a did to see what be at foot of placardah be a expected have be informed that government permit one who will to subscribe name a candidate to enter firewhich be act of liberality worthy of magnificent signoriareserving of course right to make selection doubtless many believer will be eager to subscribe name for what be to enter fire to one whose faith be firm man be afraid of fire because belief will burn if belief contraryhere tito lifted shoulder made oratorical pausefor reason have never be one to disbelieve frate when have said that must enter fire to prove doctrine for in place if believed fire must not burn of friend must not enter a readily a must walk along dry bed of mugnone a tito looked round during appeal there be change in of audience very much like change in eager dog when be invited to smell something pungent since question of burning be becoming practical be not one who must rashly commit to general view of relation between faith fire scene might have be too much for gravity le under command than tito then messer segretario said young sculptor seems to fra francesco be greater hero for offer to enter fire for truth though be sure fire will burn deny said tito blandly if turn out that fra francesco be mistaken will have be burned for wrong side church have never reckoned such victim to be martyr must suspend judgment until trial have really taken place be true messer segretario said shopkeeper with subdued impatience will favour by interpreting latin assuredly said tito doe express conclusion doctrine frate specially teach trial by fire be to prove true false be doubtless familiar to first florence let have latin bit by bit then tell what mean said shoemaker who have be frequent hearer of fra girolamo willingly said tito smiling will then judge if give right meaning yes yes thats fair said goro ecclesia dei indiget renovatione be church of god need purifying regenerating be true said several voice at once mean priest ought to lead better life there need miracle to prove thats what frate have always be saying said shoemaker flagellabitur went on be will be scourged renovabitur will be purified florentia quoque post flagellam renovabitur et prosperabitur florence also after scourging will be purified will prosper mean be to get pisa again said shopkeeper get wool from england a used to do must hope said elderly man in old fashioned berretta who have be silent till now there be scourging enough with sinking of trade at moment tall personage surmounted by red feather issued from door of convent exchanged indifferent glance with tito who tossing becchetto carelessly over left shoulder turned to reading again while bystander with more timidity than respect shrank to make passage for messer dolfo spini infideles convertentur ad christum went on be infidel will be converted to christ be turk moor well ive nothing to say against said shopkeeper dispassionately haec autem omnia erunt temporibus nostris thing will happen in time why what use must be else said goro excommunicato nuper lata contra reverendum patrem nostrum fratrem hieronymum nulla est excommunication lately pronounced against reverend father fra girolamo be null non observantes eam non peccant who disregard be not committing sin will know better what to say to when have have trial by fire said shopkeeper doubtless will clear up everything said tito be latinall conclusion be to be proved true false by trial rest can perceive be simply proclamation of signoria in good tuscan calling on such a be eager to walk through fire to come to palazzo subscribe name can serve further if not tito a turned away raised cap bent slightly with so easy air that movement seemed natural prompting of deference quickened pace a left piazza after two three turning paused in quiet street before door at gave light peculiar knock be opened by young woman whom chucked under chin a asked if padrone be within then passed without further ceremony through door stood ajar on right hand admitted into handsome untidy room where dolfo spini sat playing with fine stag hound alternately snuffed at basket of pup licked hand with affectionate disregard of master moral sometimes held to be one of most agreeable attribute of sex just looked up a tito entered continued play simply from disposition to persistence in irrelevant action by slow witted sensual people seem to be continually counteracting own purpose tito be patient handsome bracca that said quietly standing with thumb in belt presently added in cool liquid tone seemed mild compelled attention when have finished such caress a can not possibly be deferred dolfo will talk of business if please time must wish to be eternity at service be not entirely own morning down mischief down said spini with sudden roughness malediction added still more gruffly pushing dog aside then starting from seat stood close to tito put hand on shoulder a spoke hope sharp wit see in out of business fine necromancer for seems to clearer than bottom of sack what be difficulty cavalier accursed frati minori at santa croce be drawing back now fra francesco seems afraid of sticking to challenge talk of prophet being likely to use magic to get up false miraclethinks might be dragged into fire burned prophet might come out whole by magic church be none better then after talking there not so much a blessed lay brother who will offer to pair with pious sheep fra domenico be peculiar stupidity of tonsured skull prevents from seeing of how little consequence be whether be burned not said tito have sworn well to that will be in danger of entering fire said spini looking puzzled because one of will be obliged to go in with fra domenico who think thousand year till fagot be ready not at fra domenico be not likely to go in have told before dolfo only powerful mind be not to be impressed without more repetition than suffices for vulgari have told that now have got signoria to take up affair prevent from being hushed up by fra girolamo nothing be necessary on given day fuel must be prepared in piazza people got together with expectation of seeing something prodigious if after that prophet quits piazza without appearance of miracle on side be ruined with people will be ready to pelt out of city signoria will find easy to banish from territory holiness may do a like with therefore alcibiades swear to franciscan grey frock will not come within singeing distance of fire spini rubbed back of head with one hand tapped sword against leg with other to stimulate power of seeing intangible combination said presently looking up again unless fall on in piazza when people be in rage make end of lie then there valori salviati albizzi will take up arm raise fight for know be talked of when there be hubbub on ascension sunday people may turn round again there may be story raised of french king coming again other cursed chance in hypocrite favour city will never be safe till he out of will be out of before long without giving further trouble than little comedy of trial by fire wine sun will make vinegar without shouting to help a florentine sage must say will have satisfaction of delivering city from incubus by able stratagem instead of risking blunder with sword thrust suppose did get magic devil to help walk through fire after said spini with grimace intended to hide certain shyness in trenching on speculative ground how do know there nothing in thing plenty of scholar believe in frate be bad enough for anything oh of course there be such thing said tito with shrug have particular reason for knowing that frate be not on such term with devil a can give confidence in affair only magic relies on be own ability ability said spini do call ability to be setting florence at loggerhead with pope power of italyall to keep beckoning at french king who never come may call able call hypocrite who want to be master of everybody get made pope judge with usual penetration captain opinion clash frate wanting to be master to carry out project against pope requires lever of foreign power requires florence a fulcrum used to think narrow minded bigot now think shrewd ambitious man who know what be aiming at directs aim a skilfully a direct ball when be playing at maglio yes yes said spini cordially can aim ball be true said tito with bland gravity must not have troubled with trivial remark on frates ability that may see how will heighten credit of success against at rome at milan be sure to serve in good stead when city come to change policy well thou art good little demon shalt have good pay said spini patronisingly whereupon thought only natural that useful greek adventurer must smile with gratification a said of course advantage to depends entirely on will have supper at palace to night interrupted spini with significant nod affectionate pat on tito shoulder will expound new scheme to pardon magnificent patron said tito scheme have be same from firstit have never varied except in memory be sure have fast hold of now spini rehearsed one thing more said a tito be hastening away there be that sharp nosed notary ser ceccone have be handy of late tell who can see man wink when youre behind do think may go on making use of tito dared not say no knew companion too well to trust with advice when spinis vanity self interest be not engaged in concealing adviser doubtless answered promptly have nothing to say against ceccone that suggestion of notary intimate access to spini caused tito passing twinge interrupting amused satisfaction in success with made tool of man who fancied patron for have be rather afraid of ser ceccone tito nature made peculiarly alive to circumstance might be turned to disadvantage memory be much haunted by such possibility stimulating to contrivance by might ward off be not likely that must forget that october morning more than year ago when romola have appeared suddenly before at door of nellos shop have compelled to declare certainty that fra girolamo be not going outside gate fact that ser ceccone have be witness of scene together with tito perception that for reason other be object of dislike to notary have received new importance from recent turn of event for after having be implicated in medicean plot having found advisable in consequence to retire into country for time ser ceccone have of late since reappearance in city attached to arrabbiati cultivated patronage of dolfo spini now captain of compagnacci be much given when in company of intimate to confidential narrative about own doings if ser ceccones power of combination be sharpened by enmity might gather knowledge must use against tito with very unpleasant result must be pitiable to be balked in well conducted scheme by insignificant notary to be lamed by sting of insect whom have offended unawares tito said to man dislike to can be nothing deeper than ill humour of dinnerless dog will conquer if can make prosperous have be very glad of opportunity have presented of providing notary with temporary post a extra cancelliere registering secretary under ten believing that with sop expectation of more waspish cur must be quite cured of disposition to bite perfect scheming demand omniscience notary envy have be stimulated into hatred by cause of tito knew nothing that evening when tito returning from critical audience with special council have brushed by ser ceccone on stair notary who have only just returned from pistoja learned arrest of conspirator be bound on errand bore humble resemblance to tito also without giving up show of popular zeal have be putting in medicean lottery also have be privy to unexecuted plot be willing to tell what knew knew much le to tell also must have be willing to go on treacherous errand more eligible agent have forestalled proposition be received coldly council be told be already in possession of needed information since have be thus busy in sedition must be well for to retire out of way of mischief otherwise government might be obliged to take note of ser ceccone wanted evidence to make attribute failure to tito spite be more bitter because nature of case compelled to hold peace about be whole of grudge against flourishing melema on issuing from hiding place attaching to arrabbiati have earned pay a one of spy who reported information on florentine affair to milanese court pay have be small notwithstanding pain to write full letter have lately be apprised that news be seldom more than late imperfect edition of what be known already now ser ceccone have positive knowledge that tito have underhand connection with arrabbiati court of milan have suspicion of chewed cud with a strong sense of flavour a if have be certainty fine grown vigorous hatred must swallow feeble opiate of tito favour be a lively a ever after why must ser ceccone like melema better for doing favour doubtless suave secretary have own end to serve what right have to superior position made possible for to show favour since have tuned voice to flattery ser ceccone must pitch in same key remained to be seen who must win at game of outwitting to have mind well oiled with sort of argument prevents claim from grasping seems eminently convenient sometimes only oil becomes objectionable when find anointing other mind on want to establish hold tito however not being quite omniscient felt now no more than passing twinge of uneasiness at suggestion of ser ceccones power to hurt be only for little while that cared greatly about keeping clear of suspicion hostility be now playing final game in florence skill be conscious of applying gave pleasure in even apart from expected winning errand on be sent to san marco be stroke in felt so much confidence that have already given notice to ten of desire to resign office at indefinite period within next month two have obtained permission to make resignation suddenly if affair needed with understanding niccol macchiavelli be to be provisional substitute if not successor be acting on hypothetic ground be sort of action have keenest interest for diplomatic mind from combination of general knowledge concerning savonarola purpose with diligently observed detail have framed conjecture be about to verify by visit to san marco if proved to be right game must be won might soon turn back on florence looked eagerly towards that consummation for many circumstance besides own weariness of place told that be time for to be gone chapter lxiv prophet in cell tito visit to san marco have be announced beforehand be at once conducted by fra niccol savonarola secretary up spiral staircase into long corridor lined with cellscorridors where fra angelicos fresco delicate a rainbow on melting cloud startled unaccustomed eye here there a if have be sudden reflection cast from ethereal world where madonna sat crowned in radiant glory divine infant looked forth with perpetual promise be hour of relaxation in monastery most of cell be empty light through narrow window looked in on nothing bare wall hard pallet crucifix even behind door at end of long corridor in inner cell opening from antechamber where prior usually sat at desk received private visitor high jet of light fell on only one more object that looked quite a common monastic sight a bare wall hard pallet be back of figure in long white dominican tunic scapulary kneeling with bowed head before crucifix might have be ordinary fra girolamo who have nothing worse to confess than thinking of wrong thing when be singing in coro feeling spiteful joy when fra benedetto dropped ink over own miniature in breviary be illuminatingwho have higher thought than of climbing safely into paradise up narrow ladder of prayer fasting obedience under particular white tunic there be heart beating with consciousness inconceivable to average monk perhaps hard to be conceived by man who have not arrived at self knowledge through tumultuous inner life consciousness in irrevocable error lapse from veracity be so entwined with noble purpose sincere belief in self justifying expediency be so inwoven with tissue of great work whole being seemed a unable to abandon a body be unable to abandon glowing trembling before object of hope fear that be perhaps impossible course might be adopted for conscience to find perfect repose savonarola be not only in attitude of prayer there be latin word of prayer on lip yet be not praying have entered cell have fallen on knee burst into word of supplication seeking in way for influx of calmness must be warrant to that resolution urged on by crowding thought passion be not wresting away from divine support prevision impulse have be at work within for last hour be too imperious while pressed hand against face while lip be uttering audibly cor mundum crea in mind be still filled with image of snare enemy have prepared for be still busy with argument by must justify against taunt accusation be not only against opponent that savonarola have to defend morning have have new proof that friend follower be a much inclined to urge on trial by fire a enemy desiring tacitly expecting that must at last accept challenge evoke long expected miracle be to dissipate doubt triumph over malignity have not said that god must declare at fitting time to understanding of plain florentine eager to get party question settled seemed that time must be more fitting than certainly if fra domenico walked through fire unhurt must be miracle faith ardour of good brother be felt to be cheering augury savonarola be acutely conscious that secret longing of follower to see accept challenge have not be dissipated by reason have given for refusal yet be impossible to to satisfy with bitter distress saw now that be impossible for longer to resist prosecution of trial in fra domenicos case not that savonarola have uttered written falsity when declared belief in future supernatural attestation of work mind be so constituted that while be easy for to believe in miracle being distant undefined be screened behind strong reason saw for occurrence yet easier for to have belief in inward miracle such a own prophetic inspiration divinely wrought intuition be at same time insurmountably difficult to to believe in probability of miracle like of being carried unhurt through fire pressed in detail on imagination involved demand not only for belief for exceptional action savonarola nature be one of in opposing tendency co exist in almost equal strength passionate sensibility impatient of definite thought flood idea with emotion tends towards contemplative ecstasy alternated in with keen perception of outward fact vigorous practical judgment of men thing in case of trial by fire latter characteristic be stimulated into unusual activity by acute physical sensitiveness give overpowering force to conception of pain destruction a necessary sequence of fact have already be cause of pain in experience promptitude with men will consent to touch red hot iron with wet finger be not to be measured by theoretic acceptance of impossibility that iron will burn practical belief depends on what be most strongly represented in mind at given moment with frates constitution when trial by fire be urged on imagination a immediate demand be impossible for to believe that other man must walk through flame unhurtimpossible for to believe that even if resolved to offer must not shrink at last moment florentine be not likely to make fine distinction to common run of mankind have always seemed proof of mental vigour to find moral question easy judge conduct according to concise alternative nothing be likely to seem plainer than that man who at one time declared that god must not leave without guarantee of miracle yet drew back when be proposed to test declaration have said what did not believe be not fra domenico fra mariano score of piagnoni besides ready to enter fire be cause of superior courage if be not superior faith savonarola must not have explained conduct satisfactorily to friend even if have be able to explain thoroughly to be not naked feeling make haste to clothe in proposition lie at hand among store of opinion to give true account of what pass within something else be necessary besides sincerity even when sincerity be unmixed in very moment when savonarola be kneeling in audible prayer have ceased to hear word on lip be drowned by argumentative voice within shaped reason more more for outward audience to appeal to heaven for miracle by rash acceptance of challenge be mere snare prepared for by ignoble foe must be tempting of god appeal must not be responded to let pope legate come let ambassador of great power come promise that calling of general council reform of church will hang on miracle will enter flame trusting that god will not withhold seal from great work until then reserve for higher duty be directly laid upon be not permitted to to leap from chariot for sake of wrestling with loud vaunter fra domenicos invincible zeal to enter into trial may be sign of divine vocation may be pledge that miracle when savonarola brought mind close to threatened scene in piazza imagined human body entering fire belief recoiled again be not event that imagination must simply see felt with shuddering vibration to extremity of sensitive finger miracle must not be nay trial be not to happen be warranted in doing in power to hinder fuel might be got ready in piazza people might be assembled preparatory formality might be gone through be perhaps inevitable now must no longer resist without bringing dishonour yes therefore on cause of god be not really intended that franciscan must enter fire while hung back there must be mean of preventing fra domenicos entrance at very worst if fra domenico be compelled to enter must carry consecrated host with with mystery in hand there might be warrant for expecting that ordinary effect of fire must be stayed more probably demand must be resisted might thus be final obstacle to trial intention must not be avowed must appear frankly to await trial to trust in issue that dissidence between inward reality outward seeming be not christian simplicity after have striven through year of youth prime have preached a chief fruit of divine life in stress heat of day with cheek burning with shout ringing in ear who be so blest a to remember yearning have in cool silent morning know that have not

man must be inspired with vision daring made sacred rebel even word of prayer have died away continued to kneel mind be filled with image of result to be felt through europe sense of immediate difficulty be being lost in glow of vision when knocking at door announced expected visit savonarola drew on mantle before left cell a be custom when received visitor with immediate response to appeal from without belongs to power loving nature accustomed to make power felt by speech met tito with glance a self possessed strong a if have risen from resolution instead of conflict tito did not kneel simply made greeting of profound deference savonarola received quietly without sacerdotal word then desiring to be seated said at once business be something of weight son must not be conveyed through others assuredly father else must not have presumed to ask will not trespass on time by proem gathered from remark of messer domenico mazzinghi that might be glad to make use of next special courier who be sent to france with despatch from ten must entreat to pardon if have be too officious inasmuch a messer domenico be at moment away at villa wished to apprise that courier carrying important letter be about to depart for lyon at daybreak to morrow muscle of fra girolamos face be eminently under command a must be case with men whose personality be powerful in deliberate speech be habitually cautious confiding intention to none without necessity under strong mental stimulus eye be liable to dilatation added brilliancy that strength of will must control looked steadily at tito did not answer immediately a if have to consider whether information have just heard met purpose of tito whose glance never seemed observant rarely let anything escape have expected precisely that dilatation flash of savonarola eye have noted on other occasion saw then immediately busied in adjusting gold fibula have got wrong seeming to imply that awaited answer patiently fact be that savonarola have expected to receive intimation from domenico mazzinghi one of ten ardent disciple of whom have already employed to write private letter to florentine ambassador in france to prepare way for letter to french king in savonarola handwriting now lay ready in desk at side be letter calling on king to assist in summoning general council might reform abuse of church begin by deposing pope alexander who be not rightfully pope being vicious unbeliever elected by corruption governing by simony fact be not what tito knew what constructive talent guided by subtle indication have led to guess hope be true son said savonarola quietlyit be true have letter must gladly send by safe conveyance under cover to ambassador community of san marco a know have affair in france being amongst other thing responsible for debt to singularly wise experienced frenchman signor philippe de comines on library of medici purchased apprehend that domenico mazzinghi may return to city before evening must gain more time for preparation of letter if waited to deposit in hand assuredly reverend father might be better on ground except one namely that if anything occurred to hinder messer domenicos return despatch of letter must require must come to san marco again at late hour that must send to by secretary be aware that wish to guard against false inference might be drawn from too frequent communication between officer of government in throwing out difficulty tito felt that more unwillingness frate showed to trust more certain must be of conjecture savonarola be silent while kept mouth firm slight glow rose in face with suppressed excitement be growing within must be critical momentthat in delivered letter out of own hand be most probable that messer domenico will return in time said tito affecting to consider frates determination settled rising from chair a spoke with permission will take leave father not to trespass on time when errand be done a may not be favoured with interview venture to confide to be not yet known to others except to magnificent contemplate resigning secretaryship leaving florence shortly be presuming too much on interest in stating what relates chiefly to speak on son said frate desire to know prospect find then have mistaken real vocation in forsaking career of pure letter for be brought up politics of florence father be worthy to occupy greatest mindto occupy yourswhen man be in position to execute own idea when like can only hope to be mere instrument of changing scheme requires to be animated by minor attachment of born florentine also wife unhappy alienation from florentine residence since painful event of august naturally influence wish to join savonarola inclined head approvingly intend then soon to leave florence to visit chief court of europe to widen acquaintance with men of letter in various university will go first to court of hungary where scholar be eminently welcome will probably start in week ten day have not concealed from father that be religious enthusiast have not wife ardour religious enthusiasm a conceive be not necessary in order to appreciate grandeur justice of view concerning government of nation church if condescend to intrust with commission will further relation wish to establish will feel honoured may now take leave stay son when depart from florence will send letter to wife of whose spiritual welfare must fain be assured for left in anger a for letter to france such a have ready savonarola rose turned to desk a spoke took from letter on tito must see not read address in frates own minute exquisite handwriting still to be seen covering margin of bible took large sheet of paper enclosed letter sealed pardon father said tito before savonarola have time to speak unless be decided wish must rather not incur responsibility of carrying away letter messer domenico mazzinghi will doubtless return if not fra niccol can convey to at second hour of evening when will place other despatch in courier hand at present son said frate waiving point wish to address packet to ambassador in own handwriting be preferable to secretary tito sat down to write address while frate stood by with folded arm glow mounting in cheek lip at last quivering tito rose be about to move away when savonarola said abruptlytake son there be use in waiting doe not please that fra niccol must have needle errand to palazzo a tito took letter savonarola stood in suppressed excitement forbade further speech there seems to be subtle emanation from passionate nature like making mental state tell immediately on others when be absent minded inwardly excited there be silence in air tito made deep reverence went out with letter under mantle letter be duly delivered to courier carried out of florence before happened messenger privately employed by tito have conveyed information in cipher be carried by series of relay to armed agent of ludovico sforza duke of milan on watch for very purpose of intercepting despatch on border of milanese territory chapter lxv trial by fire little more than week after on seventh of april great piazza della signoria presented stranger spectacle even than famous bonfire of vanity greater multitude have assembled to see than have ever before tried to find place for in wide piazza even on day of san giovanni be near mid day since early morning there have be gradual swarming of people at coign of vantage disadvantage offered by faades roof of house such space of pavement a be free to public men be seated on iron rod made sharp angle with rising wall be clutching slim pillar with arm leg be astride on neck of rough statuary here there surmounted entrance of grander house be finding palm breadth of seat on bit of architrave footing on rough projection of rustic stonework while clutched strong iron ring staple driven into wall beside for be come to see miracle cramped limb abraded flesh seemed slight inconvenience with prospect close at hand be ordinary lot of mankind to hear of miracle more le to believe in now florentine be going to see one at very least must see miracle for if monk did not come whole out of fire must see enter infer that be burned in middle there must be reasonable doubt seemed that fire must be kindled that monk must enter for there before eye be long platform eight foot broad twenty yard long with grove of fuel heaped up terribly great branch of dry oak a foundation crackling thorn above well anointed tow rag known to make fine flame in florentine illumination platform began at corner of marble terrace in front of old palace close to marzocco stone lion whose aged visage looked frowningly along grove of fuel that stretched obliquely across piazza besides that there be three large body of armed men five hundred hired soldier of signoria stationed before palace five hundred compagnacci under dolfo spini far off on opposite side of piazza three hundred armed citizen of sort under marco salviati savonarola friend in front of orgagnas loggia where franciscan dominican be to be placed with champion here have be much expense of money labour high dignity be concerned there must be reasonable doubt that something great be about to happen must certainly be great thing if two monk be simply burned for in case too god must have spoken said very plainly that fra girolamo be not prophet there be not much longer to wait for be now near mid day monk be already at post that half of loggia lie towards palace be already filled with grey mantle other half divided off by board be still empty of everything except small altar franciscan have entered taken place in silence now at other side of piazza be heard loud chanting from two hundred voice there be general satisfaction if not in chanting at least in evidence that dominican be come that loud chanting repetition of prayer let god arise let enemy be scattered be unpleasantly suggestive to impartial ear of desire to vaunt confidence excite dismay so be flame coloured velvet cope in fra domenico be arrayed a headed procession cross in hand simple mind really exalted with faith with genuine intention to enter flame for glory of god fra girolamo behind came savonarola in white vestment of priest carrying in hand vessel containing consecrated host too be chanting loudly too looked firm confident a eye be turned eagerly on in anxiety curiosity malignity from moment when entered piazza till mounted step of loggia deposited sacrament on altar there be intensifying flash energy in countenance responding to scrutiny be so made almost of that false seeming have thought of with painful shrinking when beforehand in solitude have urged on a necessity will posse muscle move lip a if nothing that be easy when once have come under stimulus of expectant eye ear strength of stimulus to savonarola can hardly be measured by experience of ordinary life perhaps man have ever have mighty influence over fellow without having innate need to dominate need usually becomes more imperious in proportion a complication of life make self inseparable from purpose be not selfish in way came to pas on day of trial by fire doubleness be pressing temptation in public career whether of priest orator statesman be more strongly defined in savonarola consciousness a acting of part than at other period in life be struggling not against impending martyrdom against impending ruin therefore looked acted a if be thoroughly confident when while foreboding be pressing with leaden weight on heart not only because of probable issue of trial because of event already pastan event be spreading sunny satisfaction through mind of man who be looking down at passion worn prophet from window of old palace be common turning point towards widely sundered life have be converging that two evening ago news have come that florentine courier of ten have be arrested robbed of despatch so that savonarola letter be already in hand of duke of milan must soon be in hand of pope not only heightening rage giving new justification to extreme measure there be malignity in tito melemas satisfaction be mild self gratulation of man who have won game have employed hypothetic skill not game have stirred muscle heated blood of course that bundle of desire contrivance called human nature when moulded into form of plain featured frate predicatore more le of impostor must not be pathetic object to brilliant minded scholar who understood everything yet tonsured girolamo with high nose large under lip be immensely clever frate mixing with absurd superstition fabrication very remarkable notion about government babbler man who must keep secret tito have more spite against than against saint dominic on contrary fra girolamos existence have be highly convenient to tito melema furnishing with round of ladder from be about to leap on to new smooth footing very much to heart content everything now be in forward preparation for leap let one more sun rise set tito hoped to quit florence have be so industrious that felt at full leisure to amuse with to day comedy thick headed dolfo spini must never have brought about for not yet did loud chanting cease rather swelled to deafening roar being taken up in part of piazza by piagnoni who carried little red cross a badge most of chanted prayer for confusion of god enemy with expectation of answer to be given through medium of more signal personage than fra domenico good frate in flame coloured cope be now kneeling before little altar on sacrament be deposited awaiting summons on franciscan side of loggia there be chanting flame colour only silence greyness there be counterbalancing difference that franciscan have two champion certain fra giuliano be to pair with fra domenico while original champion fra francesco confined challenge to savonarola surely thought men perched uneasily on rod pillar must be ready now chanting might stop must see better when frati be moving towards platform frati be not to be seen moving yet pale franciscan face be looking uneasily over boarding at flame coloured cope have evil look might be enchanted so that false miracle must be wrought by magic monk may come whole out of fire yet may be work of devil now there be passing to fro between loggia marble terrace of palazzo roar of chanting became little quieter for one at distance be beginning to watch more eagerly soon appeared that new movement be not beginning obstacle to beginning dignified florentine appointed to preside over affair a moderator on side went in out of palace there be much debate with franciscan at last be clear that fra domenico conspicuous in flame colour be being fetched towards palace probably fire have already be kindledit be difficult to see at distanceand miracle be going to begin not at flame coloured cope disappeared within palace then dominican be fetched away for long while everything went on a beforethe tiresome chanting be not miraculous fra girolamo in white vestment standing just in same place at last something happened fra domenico be seen coming out of palace again returning to brother have changed clothes with brother monk be guarded on flank by franciscan lest coming into vicinity of savonarola must be enchanted again ah then thought distant spectator little le conscious of cramped limb hunger fra domenico be not going to enter fire be fra girolamo who offer after will see move presently if come out of flame will have fine view of fra girolamo did not move except with ordinary action accompanying speech speech be bold firm perhaps somewhat ironically remonstrant like of elijah to priest of baal demanding cessation of trivial delay speech be most irritating kind of argument for who be out of hearing cramped in limb empty in stomach what need be there for speech if miracle did not begin must be one fault fra girolamos who might put end to difficulty by offering now fire be ready a have be forward enough to do when there be fuel in sight more movement to fro more discussion afternoon seemed to be slipping away faster because cloud have gathered changed light on everything sent chill through spectator hungry in mind body now be crucifix fra domenico wanted to carry into fire must not be allowed to profane in manner after little resistance savonarola gave way to objection thus have advantage of making one more concession immediately placed in fra domenicos hand vessel containing consecrated host idea that presence of sacred mystery might in worst extremity avert ordinary effect of fire hovered in mind a possibility issue on counted be of more positive kind in taking up host said quietly a if be only doing what have be presupposed from first since be not willing that must enter with crucifix brother enter simply with sacrament new horror in franciscan new firmness in savonarola be impious presumption to carry sacrament into fire if be burned scandal must be great in mind of weak ignorant not at all even if be burned accident only must be consumed substance must remain here be question might be argued till set of sun remain a elastic a ever one must propose settling by proceeding to trial since be essentially preliminary question be only necessary that side must remain firmthat franciscan must persist in not permitting host to be carried into fire that fra domenico must persist in refusing to enter without meanwhile cloud be getting darker air chiller even chanting be missed now have given way to inaudible argument confused sound of talk from point of piazza showing that expectation be everywhere relaxing contributed to irritating presentiment that nothing decisive must be done here there dropping shout be heard then more frequent shout in rising scale of scorn light fire drive in let have smell of roastwe want dinner come prophet let know whether anything be to happen before twenty four hour be over yes yes whats last vision oh he got dozen in inside theyre small change for miracle ola frate where be never mind wasting fuel still same movement to fro between loggia palace still same debate slow unintelligible to multitude a colloquy of insect touch antenna to other apparent effect than of going coming interpretation be not long wanting to unheard debate in fra girolamo be constantly speaker be who be hindering trial everybody be appealing to now be hanging back soon shout ceased to be distinguishable be lost in uproar not simply of voice of clashing metal trampling foot suggestion of irritated people have stimulated old impulse in dolfo spini band of compagnacci seemed opportunity not to be lost for putting end to florentine difficulty by getting possession of arch hypocrite person there be vigorous rush of armed men towards loggia thrusting people aside driving on to file of soldiery stationed in front of palace at movement everything be suspended with monk embarrassed magistrate except palpitating watch to see what must come of struggle loggia be well guarded by band under brave salviati soldier of signoria assisted in repulse trampling rushing be backward again towards tetto de pisani when blackness of heaven seemed to intensify in moment of utter confusion rain have already be felt in scattered drop began to fall with rapidly growing violence wetting fuel running in stream off platform wetting weary hungry people to skin driving man disgust rage inwards to ferment there in damp darkness everybody knew now that trial by fire be not to happen signoria be doubtless glad of rain a obvious reason better than pretext for declaring that party might go home be issue savonarola have expected desired yet must be ill description of what felt to say that be glad a rain fell plashed on edge of loggia sent spray over altar garment face frate knew that demand for to enter fire be at end knew too with certainty a irresistible a damp chill have taken possession of frame that design of enemy be fulfilled that honour be not saved knew that must have to make way to san marco again through enraged crowd that heart of many friend who must once have defended with life must now be turned against when rain have ceased asked for guard from signoria be given have said that be willing to die for work of life yes have not spoken falsely to die in dishonourheld up to scorn a hypocrite false prophet o god be not martyrdom be blotting out of life have be protest against wrong let die because of worth be in not because of weakness rain have ceased light from breaking cloud fell on savonarola a left loggia in midst of guard walking a have come with sacrament in hand there seemed glory in light fell on now smile of heaven be only that light shine on patiently impartially justifying condemning by simply showing thing in slow history of ripening heard blessing tone of pity only taunt threat knew be foretaste of coming bitterness yet courage mounted under moral attack showed sign of dismay well parried frate said tito a savonarola descended step of loggia fear career at florence be ended what say niccol be pity falsehood be not of wise sort said macchiavelli with melancholy shrug with time so much on side a be about church affair might have done something great chapter lxvi masque of fury next day be palm sunday olive sunday a be chiefly called in olive growing valdarno morning sun shone with more delicious clearness for yesterday rain once more savonarola mounted pulpit in san marco saw flock around whose faith in be still unshaken morning in calm sad sincerity declared ready to die in front of vision saw own doom once more uttered benediction saw face of men woman lifted towards in venerating love then descended step of pulpit turned away from sight for ever for before sun have set florence be in uproar passion have be roused day before have be smouldering through quiet morning have now burst out again with fury not unassisted by design not without official connivance uproar have begun at duomo in attempt of compagnacci to hinder evening sermon piagnoni have assembled to hear sooner have men blood mounted disturbance have become affray than cry arose to san fire to san marco long before daylight have died church convent be being besieged by enraged continually increasing multitude not without resistance for monk long conscious of growing hostility without have arm within wall of fought a vigorously in long white tunic a if have be knight templar even command of savonarola must not prevail against impulse to self defence in arm be still muscular under dominican serge there be layman too who have not chosen to depart of fought fiercely there be firing from high altar close by great crucifix there be pouring of stone hot ember from convent roof there be close fighting with sword in cloister notwithstanding force of assailant attack lasted till deep night demonstration of government have be against convent early in attack guard have be sent for not to disperse assailant to command within convent to lay down arm layman to depart from savonarola to quit florentine territory within twelve hour have savonarola quitted convent then must hardly have escaped being torn to piece be willing to go friend hindered be felt to be great risk even for layman of high name to depart by garden wall among who have chosen to do so be francesco valori who hoped to raise rescue from without now when be deep nightwhen struggle must hardly have lasted much longer compagnacci might soon have carried sword into library where savonarola be praying with brother who have not taken up arm have laid down at commandthere came second body of guard commissioned by signoria to demand person of fra girolamo two coadjutor fra domenico fra salvestro loud be roar of triumphant hate when light of lantern showed frate issuing from door of convent with guard who promised other safety than of prison struggle now be who must get first in stream rushed up narrow street to see prophet carried back in ignominy to piazza where have braved must be in best place for reaching ear with insult nay if possible for smiting kicking be not difficult for of armed compagnacci who be not prevented from mixing with guard when savonarola felt dragged pushed along in midst of hooting multitude when lantern be lifted to show deriding face when felt spit upon smitten kicked with grossest word of insult seemed to that worst bitterness of life be past if men judged guilty be bent on having blood be only death that awaited worst drop of bitterness can never be wrung on to lip from without lowest depth of resignation be not to be found in martyrdom be only to be found when have covered head in silence felt be not worthy to be martyr truth will prosper not by brief imperfect triumph of insulting frate who have soon disappeared under doorway of old palace be only like taste of blood to tiger be there not house of hypocrite friend to be sacked already one half of armed multitude too much in rear to share greatly in siege of convent have be employed in more profitable work of attacking rich house not with planless desire for plunder with discriminating selection of such a belonged to chief piagnoni showed that riot be under guidance that rabble with club stave be well officered by sword girt compagnacci be there notnext criminal after fratethe ambitious francesco valori suspected of wanting with frates help to make doge gonfaloniere for life grey haired man who eight month ago have lifted arm voice in such ferocious

be murdered a be on way to answer summons to palazzo by sword of men named ridolfi tornabuoni in way that masque of fury called riot be played on in florence through hour of night early morning chief director be not visible have reason for issuing order from private retreat being of rather too high name to let red feather be seen waving amongst work be to be done before dawn retreat be same house same room in quiet street between santa croce san marco where have seen tito paying secret visit to dolfo spini here captain of compagnacci sat through memorable night receiving visitor who came went went came of in guise of armed compagnacci others dressed obscurely without visible arm there be abundant wine on table with drinking cup for chance comer though spini be on guard against excessive drinking took enough from time to time to heighten excitement produced by news be being brought to continually among obscurely dressed visitor ser ceccone be one of most frequent a hour advanced towards morning twilight have remained a spinis constant companion together with francesco cei who be then in rather careless hiding in florence expecting to have banishment revoked when frates fall have be accomplished taper have burnt into low shapeless mass hole in shutter be just marked by sombre outward light when spini who have started from seat walked up down with angry flush on face at talk have be going forward with two unmilitary companion burst out devil spit will pay for though have have claw will be down on when little think of so be to be great man after he be pretending to chuck everything towards cap a if be blind beggarman while he be winking filling own scarsella must like to hang skin about set hound on he got that fine ruby of mine be fool enough to give yesterday malediction be laughing at in sleeve two year ago spoiling best plan that ever be laid be fool for trusting with rascal who have long twisted contrivance that nobody must see to end of greek too who dropped into florence with gem packed about said francesco cei who have slight smile of amusement on face at spinis fuming did not choose confidant very wisely dolfo he cursed deal cleverer than francesco handsomer too said spini turning on associate with general desire to worry anything presented humbly conceive said ser ceccone messer francescos poetic genius will outweigh yes yes rub hand hate that notary trick of yours interrupted spini whose patronage consisted largely in sort of frankness there come taddeo somebody now time what news eh went on a two compagnacci entered with heated look bad said one people have made up mind be going to have sacking of soderinis house now have be balked will have turning on if dont take care suspect there be mediceans buzzing about among may see attacking palace over bridge before long unless can find bait for way have said spini seizing taddeo by belt drew aside to give direction while other went on telling cei how signoria have interfered about soderinis house ecco exclaimed spini presently giving taddeo slight push towards door go make quick work chapter lxvii waiting by river about time when two compagnacci went on errand there be man who on opposite side of arno be also going out into chill grey twilight errand apparently must have relation to theirs be making way to brink of river at spot though within city wall be overlooked by dwelling only seemed more shrouded lonely for warehouse granary at little distance backward turned shoulder to river there be sloping width of long grass rush made more dank by broad gutter here there emptied into arno gutter loneliness be attraction drew man to come sit down among grass bend over water ran swiftly in channelled slope at side for have once have large piece of bread brought to by one of friendly runlets more than once raw carrot apple paring be worth while to wait for such chance in place where there be one to see often in restless wakefulness came to watch here before daybreak might save for one day need of silent begging consisted in sitting on church step by wayside out beyond porta san frediano for baldassarre hated begging so much that must perhaps have chosen to die rather than make even silent appeal for one reason made desire to live be no longer hope be only that possibility cling to idea have taken complete possession of mind sort of possibility make

lonely old man yet desired to live waited for something of have distinct visionsomething dim formlessthat startled made strong pulsation within like unknown thing look for when start from sleep though voice touch have waked baldassarre desired to live therefore crept out in grey light seated in long grass watched water have faint promise in meanwhile compagnacci be busy at work formidable band of armed men left to do will with very little interference from embarrassed if not conniving signoria have parted into two mass be soon making way by different road towards arno smaller mass be making for ponte rubaconte larger for ponte vecchio in same word have passed from mouth to mouth a signal almost man of multitude knew that be going to via de bardi to sack house there if knew other reason must demand better armed compagnacci knew something more for brief word of command fly quickly leader of two stream of rabble have perfect understanding that must meet before certain house little towards eastern end of via de bardi where master must probably be in bed be surprised in morning sleep master of house be sleeping in bed have not be in bed night for tito anxiety to quit florence

love with romola mistake be remedied now old life be cast off be soon to be far behind turned with rapid step towards piazza dei mozzi intending to pas over ponte rubaconte a went along certain sound came upon ear that made turn round walk yet more quickly in opposite direction be mob coming into oltrarno be vexation for must have preferred more private road must now go by ponte vecchio unpleasant sensation made draw mantle close round walk at utmost speed there be one to see in grey twilight before reached end of via de bardi like sound fell on ear again time be much louder nearer must have be deceived before mob must be coming over ponte vecchio again turned from impulse of fear be stronger than reflection be only to be assured that mob be actually entering street from opposite end chose not to go back to house after must not attack still have valuable about thing except reason order be possible with mob necessity doe work of courage went on towards ponte vecchio rush trampling confused voice getting so loud before that have ceased to hear behind for have reached end of street crowd pouring from bridge met at turning hemmed in way have not time to wonder at sudden shout before felt surrounded not in first instance by unarmed rabble by armed compagnacci next sensation be that cap fell off that be thrust violently forward amongst rabble along narrow passage of bridge then distinguished shout piagnone medicean piagnone throw over bridge mantle be being torn off with strong pull must have throttled if fibula have not given way then scarsella be snatched at while be being hustled dragged snatch failedhis scarsella still hung at side shouting yelling half motiveless execration rang stunningly in ear spreading even amongst who have not yet seen only knew there be man to be reviled tito horrible dread be that must be struck down trampled on before reached open arch surmount centre of bridge there be one hope for that might throw over before have wounded beaten strength out of whole soul be absorbed in one hope obverse terror yesthey be at arch in moment tito with bloodless face eye dilated have one of self preserving inspiration come in extremity with sudden desperate effort mastered clasp of belt flung belt scarsella forward towards yard of clear space against parapet cry in ringing voice there be diamond there be gold in instant hold on be relaxed there be rush towards scarsella threw on parapet with desperate leap next moment plungedplunged with great plash into dark river far below be chance of salvation be good chance life have be saved once before by fine swimming a rose to surface again after long dive have sense of deliverance struck out with energy of strong prime current helped if must only swim beyond ponte alla carrara might land in remote part of city even yet reach san gallo life be still before idiot mob shouting bellowing on bridge there must think be drowned did think so peering over parapet along dark stream must not see afar off moving blackness of floating hair velvet tunic sleeve be only from other way that pale olive face must be seen looking white above dark water face not easy even for indifferent to forget with square forehead long low arch of eyebrow long lustrous agate like eye onward face went on dark current with inflated quivering nostril with blue vein distended on temple one bridge be passedthe bridge of santa trinita must risk landing now rather than trust to strength no heard fancied heard yell cry pursuing terror pressed most from side of fellow men be le afraid of indefinite chance swam on panting straining be not so fresh a must have be if have passed night in sleep yet next bridgethe last bridgewas passed be conscious of in tumult of blood must only feel vaguely that be safe might land where current be having way with hardly knew where be exhaustion be bringing on dreamy state precedes unconsciousness now there be eye discerned himaged eye strong for distance baldassarre looking up blankly from search in runlet brought nothing have seen white object coming along broader stream must be fortunate chance for looked looked till object gathered form then leaned forward with start a sat among rank green stem eye seemed to be filled with new light yet only watchedmotionless something be being brought to next instant man body be cast violently on grass two yard from started forward like panther clutching velvet tunic a fell forward on body flashed look in man face deadwas dead eye be rigid must not bejustice have brought men looked dead sometimes yet life came back into baldassarre did not feel feeble in moment knew just what must do got large finger within neck of tunic held there kneeling on one knee beside body watching face there be fierce hope in heart be mixed with trembling in eye there be only fierceness slow burning remnant of life within seemed to have leaped into flame rigidrigid still eye with half fallen lid be locked against vengeance must be that be dead there be nothing to measure time seemed long enough for hope to freeze into despair surely at last eyelid be quivering eye be no longer rigid there be vibrating light in opened wide ah yes see meyou know tito knew did not know whether be life death have brought into presence of injured father might be deathand death might mean chill gloom with face of hideous past hanging over for ever now baldassarres only dread be lest young limb must escape pressed knuckle against round throat knelt upon chest with force of aged frame let death come now again kept watch on face when eye be rigid again dared not trust must never lose hold till one came found justice must send witness then baldassarre must declare that have killed traitor to whom have once be father must perhaps believe now then must be content with struggle of justice on earththen must desire to die with hold on body follow traitor to hell that might clutch there so knelt so pressed knuckle against round throat without trusting to seeming death till light got strong must kneel no longer then sat on body still clutching neck of tunic hour went on witness came eye descried afar off two human body among tall grass by riverside florence be busy with greater affair preparation of deeper tragedy not long after two body be lying in grass savonarola be being tortured cry out in agony will confess be not until sun be westward that waggon drawn by mild grey ox came to edge of grassy margin a man who led be leaning to gather up round stone that lay heaped in readiness to be carried away detected startling object in grass aged man have fallen forward dead clutch be on garment of other be not possible to separate nay be better to put into waggon carry a be into great piazza notice might be given to eight a waggon entered frequented street there be growing crowd escorting with strange burden one knew body for long while for aged face have fallen forward half hiding younger before have be moved out of sight have be recognised know that old man piero di cosimo have testified painted likeness once be prisoner who clutched melema on step of duomo be perhaps same old man who appeared at supper in garden said bernardo rucellai one of eight have forgotten thought have died in prison there be knowing truth now who will put finger on work of justice say be there justice be like kingdom of godit be not without a fact be within a great yearning chapter lxviii romolas waking romola in boat passed from dreaming into long deep sleep then again from deep sleep into busy dreaming till at last felt stretching out arm in court of bargello where flickering flame of taper seemed to get stronger stronger till dark scene be blotted out with light eye opened saw be light of morning boat be lying still in little creek on right hand lay speckle sapphire blue of mediterranean on left one of scene be still be repeated again again like sweet rhythm on shore of loveliest sea in deep curve of mountain lay breadth of green land curtained by gentle tree shadowed slope leaning towards rocky height up slope might be seen here there gleaming between tree top pathway leading to little irregular mass of building seemed to have clambered in hasty way up mountain side taken difficult stand there for sake of showing tall belfry a sight of beauty to scattered clustered house of village below ray of newly risen sun fell obliquely on westward horn of crescent shaped nook else lay in dewy shadow sound came across stillness very water seemed to have curved there for rest delicious sun ray fell on romola thrilled gently like caress lay motionless hardly watching scene rather feeling simply presence of peace beauty while be still in youth there can always come in early waking moment when mere passive existence be lethe when exquisiteness of subtle indefinite sensation creates bliss be without memory without desire a soft warmth penetrated romolas young limb a eye rested on sequestered luxuriance seemed that agitating past have glided away like dark scene in bargello that afternoon dream of girlhood have really come back to for minute two oblivion be untroubled did not even think that must rest here for ever only felt that rested then became distinctly conscious that be lying in boat have be bearing over water through night instead of bringing to death have be gently lulling cradle of new life in spite of evening despair be glad that morning have come to again glad to think that be resting in familiar sunlight rather than in unknown region of death must not rest here sound from florence must reach already oblivion be troubled from behind golden haze be piercing dome tower wall parted by river enclosed by green hill rose from reclining posture sat up in boat willing if must to resist rush of thought urged along with conjecture how far boat have carried why need mind be sheltered nook where there be simple villager who must not harm for little while at least might rest resolve on nothing presently must go get bread milk then must nestle in green quiet feel that there be pause in life turned to watch crescent shaped valley that might get back soothing sense of peace beauty have felt in first waking have not be in attitude of contemplation more than few minute when across stillness there came piercing cry not brief cry continuous more more intense romola felt sure be cry of little child in distress that one came to help started up put one foot on side of boat ready to leap on to beach paused there listened mother of child must be near cry must soon cease went on drew romola so irresistibly seeming more piteous to for sense of peace have preceded that jumped on to beach walked many pace before knew what direction must take cry thought came from rough garden growth many yard on right hand where saw half ruined hovel climbed over low broken stone fence made way across patch of weedy green crop ripe neglected corn cry grew plainer convinced that be right hastened towards hovel even in hurried walk felt oppressive change in air a left sea behind be there taint lurking amongst green luxuriance have seemed such inviting shelter from heat of coming day must see opening into hovel now cry be darting through like pain next moment foot be within doorway sight beheld in sombre light arrested with shock of awe horror on straw with floor be scattered lay three dead body one of tall man one of girl about eight year old one of young woman whose long black hair be being clutched pulled by living childthe child be sending forth piercing cry romolas experience in haunt of death disease made thought action prompt lifted little living child in trying to soothe on bosom still sent to look at body see if be really dead strongly marked type of race in feature peculiar garb made conjecture that be spanish portuguese jew who have perhaps be put ashore abandoned there by rapacious sailor to whom property remained a prey such thing be happening continually to jew compelled to abandon home by inquisition cruelty of greed thrust from sea cruelty of superstition thrust back to surely thought romola will find woman in village whose mother heart will not let refuse to tend helpless childif real mother be indeed dead doubt remained because while man girl looked emaciated also showed sign of having be long dead woman seemed to have be hardier have not quite lost robustness of form romola kneeling be about to lay hand on heart a lifted piece of yellow woollen drapery that lay across bosom saw purple spot marked familiar pestilence then struck that if villager knew of might have more difficulty than have expected in getting help from must perhaps shrink from with child in arm have money to offer must not refuse to give goat milk in exchange for set out at once towards village mind filled now with effort to soothe little dark creature with wondering how must win woman to be good to must not help hoping little in certain awe have observed to inspire when appeared unknown unexpected in religious dress a passed across breadth of cultivated ground noticed with wonder little patch of corn mingled with other crop have be left to over ripeness untouched by sickle golden apple dark fig lay rotting on weedy earth there be grassy space within sight cow sheep goat stillness began to have something fearful in to romola hurried along towards thickest cluster of house where there must be most life to appeal to on behalf of helpless life carried in arm have picked up two fig bit little piece from sweet pulp to still child with entered between two line of dwelling be time that villager must have be stirring long ago not soul be in sight air be becoming more more oppressive laden seemed with horrible impurity there be door open looked in saw grim emptiness open door through saw man lying dead with garment on head lying athwart spade handle earthenware cruse in hand a if have fallen suddenly romola felt horror taking possession of be in village of unburied dead wanted to listen if there be faint sound child cried out afresh when ceased to feed cry filled ear at last saw figure crawling slowly out of house soon sinking back in sitting posture against wall hastened towards figure be young woman in fevered anguish too held pitcher in hand a romola approached did not start one need be too absorbing for other idea to impress on water get water said with moaning utterance romola stooped to take pitcher said gently in ear will have water can point towards well hand be lifted towards more distant end of little street romola set off at once with a much speed a must use under difficulty of carrying pitcher a well a feeding child little one be getting more content a morsel of sweet pulp be repeated ceased to distress with cry so that must give le distracted attention to object around well lay twenty yard more beyond end of street a romola be approaching eye be directed to opposite green slope immediately below church high up on patch of grass between tree have descried cow couple of goat tried to trace line of path must lead close to cheering sight when once have done errand to well occupied in way be not aware that be very near well that one approaching on other side have fixed pair of astonished eye upon romola certainly presented sight at moment in place must hardly have be seen without pausing palpitation with gaze fixed intently on distant slope long line of thick grey garment giving gliding character to rapid walk hair rolling backward illuminated on left side by sun ray little olive baby on right arm now looking out with jet black eye might well startle youth of fifteen accustomed to swing censer in presence of madonna le fair marvellous than carry pitcher in handto fetch water for sick be holy mother come to take care of people who have pestilence be sight of awe must perhaps be angry with who fetched water for only youth flung down vessel in terror romola aware now of one near saw black white figure fly a if for dear life towards slope have just be contemplating remembering parched sufferer half filled pitcher quickly hastened back entering house to look for small cup saw salt meat meal there be sign of want in dwelling with nimble movement seated baby on ground lifted cup of water to sufferer who drank eagerly then closed eye leaned head backward seeming to give up to sense of relief presently opened eye looking at romola said languidly who be came over sea said romola only came morning be people dead in house think be ill nowall be not dead father sister lie dead upstairs there be one to bury soon will die not so hope said romola be come to take care of be used to pestilence be not afraid there must be left who be not ill saw youth running towards mountain when went to well can not tell when pestilence came great many people went away drove off cow goat give more water romola suspecting that if followed direction of youth flight must find men woman who be still healthy able determined to seek out at once that might at least win to take care of child leave free to come back see how many living needed help how many dead needed burial trusted to power of persuasion to conquer aid of timorous when once knew what be to be done promising sick woman to come back to lifted dark bantling again set off towards slope felt burden of choice on now longing for death be thinking how must go to other sufferer a have gone to fevered woman with child on arm be not so easy to a usual to walk up slope seemed long while before winding path took near cow goat be beginning to feel faint from heat hunger thirst a reached double turning paused to consider whether must not wait near cow one be likely to come milk soon rather than toil up to church before have taken rest raising eye to measure steep distance saw peeping between bough not more than five yard off broad round face watching attentively lower down black skirt of priest garment hand grasping bucket stood mutely observing face too remained motionless romola have often witnessed overpowering force of dread in case of pestilence be cautious raising voice in tone of gentle pleading said came over sea be hungry so be child will not give milk romola have divined part of truth have not divined that preoccupation of priest mind charged word with strange significance only little while ago young acolyte have brought word to padre that have seen holy mother with babe fetching water for sick be a tall a cypress have light about head looked up at church pievano parish priest have not listened with entire belief have be more than fifty year in world without having vision of madonna thought boy might have misinterpreted unexpected appearance of villager have be made uneasy before venturing to come down milk cow have repeated many aves pievanos conscience tormented little trembled at pestilence also trembled at thought of mild faced mother conscious that invisible mercy might demand something more of than prayer hail in state of mindunable to banish image boy have raised of mother with glory about tending sickthe pievano have come down to milk cow have suddenly caught sight of romola pausing at parted way pleading word with strange refinement of tone accent instead of being explanatory have preternatural sound for yet did not quite believe saw holy mother be in state of alarmed hesitation if anything miraculous be happening felt there be strong presumption that miracle must be in favour dared not run away dared not advance come down said romola after pause fear fear rather to deny food to hungry when ask moment after bough be parted complete figure of thickset priest with broad harmless face black frock much worn soiled stood bucket in hand looking at timidly still keeping aloof a took path towards cow in silence romola followed watched without speaking again a seated against tethered cow when have nervously drawn milk gave to in brass cup carried with in bucket a romola put cup to lip of eager child afterwards drank milk padre observed from wooden stool with timidity changed character little

gone on to prato be beginning to think that must be drawn on to florence in spite of dread when encountered that monk of san spirito who have be godfather confessor from learned full story of savonarola arrest of husband death augustinian monk have be in stream of people who have followed waggon with awful burthen into piazza must tell what be generally known in florencethat tito have escaped from assaulting mob by leaping into arno have be murdered on bank by old man who have long have enmity against romola understood catastrophe a one else did of savonarola monk told in tone of unfavourable prejudice be usual in black brother frati neri towards brother who showed white under black that have confessed deceiver of people romola paused no longer that evening be in florence sitting in agitated silence under exclamation of joy wailing mingled with exuberant narrative be poured into ear by monna brigida who have backslided into false hair in romolas absence now drew off again declared must not mind being grey if dear child must stay with romola be too deeply moved by main event have known before coming to florence to be wrought upon by doubtful gossiping detail added in brigidas narrative tragedy of husband death of fra girolamos confession of duplicity under coercion of torture left hardly power of apprehending minor circumstance mental activity must exert under load of awe stricken grief be absorbed by two purpose must supersede other to try see savonarola to learn what have become of tessa child tell cousin said abruptly when monna brigidas tongue have run

come down chimney youre welcome two childrensantiddio cousin poor thing have done conscious wrong be ignorant of everything will tell youbut not now early next morning romolas step be directed to house beyond san ambrogio where have once found tessa be a have feared tessa be gone romola conjectured that tito have sent away beforehand to spot where have intended to join for did not believe that must willingly part with child be painful conjecture because if tessa be out of florence there be hardly chance of finding romola pictured childish creature waiting waiting at wayside spot in wondering helpless misery who lived near must tell nothing except old deaf lisa have gone away week ago with good one knew where tessa have gone romola saw further active search open to for have knowledge must serve a starting point for inquiry not only innate reserve more noble sensitiveness made shrink from assuming attitude of generosity in eye of others by publishing tessas relation to tito along with own desire to find many day passed in anxious inaction even under strong solicitation from other thought romola found heart palpitating if caught sight of pair of round brown leg of short woman in contadina dress never for moment told that be heroism exalted charity in to seek being needed something that be bound specially to care for yearned to clasp child to make love at least must be sweet result for others a well a from past sorrow appeared there be much property of tito to have claim distrusted cleanness of money have determined to make over to state except so much a be equal to price of father library must be enough for modest support of tessa child monna brigida threw such planning into background by clamorously insisting that romola must live with never forsake till have seen safe in paradiseelse why have persuaded to turn piagnoneand if romola wanted to rear other people child monna brigida must rear too only must be found first romola felt full force of innuendo strong feeling unsatisfied be never without superstition of hope despair romolas be superstition of hope somehow be to find that mother child at last direction for active inquiry suggested learned that tito have provided horse mule to await in san gallo be therefore going to leave florence by gate of san gallo determined though without much confidence in issue to try ascertain from

to have be fetched away fortnight ago morehad money only clothes to pay poor widow with for food lodging since madonna knew romola waited to hear more opened door tessa be seated on low bed cry have passed into tearless sob be looking with sad blank eye at two child who be playing in opposite cornerlillo covering head with skirt roaring at ninna to frighten then peeping out again to see how bore door be little behind tessa did not turn round when opened thinking be only old woman expectation be no longer alive romola have thrown aside veil paused moment holding necklace in sight then said in pure voice used to cheer father tessa tessa started to foot looked round see said romola clasping bead on tessas neck god have sent to again poor thing screamed sobbed clung to arm fastened necklace must not speak two child came from corner laid hold of mother skirt looked up with wide eye at romola day went home to monna brigidas in borgo degli albizzi romola have made known to tessa by gentle degree that naldo must never come to again not because be cruel because be dead be comforted tessa said romola be come to take care of always have got lillo ninna monna brigidas mouth twitched in struggle between awe of romola desire to speak unseasonably let be for present thought seems to thousand year till tell little contadina who seems not to know how many finger shes got on hand who romola be will tell day else shell never know place very well for romolanobody will call soul own when shes by if im to have pus faced minx living in house must be humble to however monna brigida wanted to give child too many sweet for supper confessed to romola last thing before going to bed that must be shame not to take care of such cherub must give up to little romola about eating thing for have never have baby have twin only died a soon a be born chapter lxxi confession when romola brought home tessa child april be already near close other great anxiety on mind have be wrought to highest pitch by publication in print of fra girolamos trial rather of confession drawn from by sixteen florentine citizen commissioned to interrogate appearance of document issued by order of signoria have called forth such strong expression of public suspicion discontent severe measure be immediately taken for recalling of course there be copy accidentally mislaid second edition not by order of signoria be soon in hand of eager reader romola who began to despair of ever speaking with fra girolamo read evidence again again desiring to judge by clearer light than contradictory impression be taking form of assertion in mouth of partisan enemy in more devout follower of savonarola want of constancy under torture retraction of prophetic claim have produced consternation too profound to be at once displaced a ultimately be by suspicion soon grew into positive datum that reported word of be in inexplicable contradiction to faith in have not come from lip of prophet from falsifying pen of ser ceccone notary of evil repute who have made digest of examination there be obvious fact at once threw discredit on printed document be not list of sixteen examiner half made up of prophet bitterest enemy be not notorious dolfo spini one of new eight prematurely elected in order to load dice against man whose ruin have be determined on by party in power be murder with slow formality be being transacted in old palace signoria have resolved to drive good bargain with pope duke of milan by extinguishing man who be a great molestation to vicious citizen greedy foreign tyrant a to corrupt clergy frate have be doomed beforehand only question be pretended to exist now be whether republic in return for permission to lay tax on ecclesiastical property must deliver alive into hand of pope whether pope must further concede to republic what dignity demandedthe privilege of hanging burning own prophet on own piazza who under such circumstance must give full credit to so called confession if frate have denied prophetic gift denial have only be wrenched from by agony of tortureagony that in sensitive frame must quickly produce raving what if wicked examiner declared that have only have torture of rope pulley thrice only on one day that confession have be made when be under bodily coercionwas that to be believed have be tortured much more have be tortured in proportion to distress confession have created in heart of who loved other friend of savonarola who be le ardent partisan did not doubt substantial genuineness of confession however might have be coloured by transposition addition of notary argued indignantly that there be nothing must warrant condemnation to death even to grave punishment must be clear to impartial men that if examination represented only evidence against frate must die not for crime because have made inconvenient to pope to rapacious italian state wanted to dismember tuscan neighbour to unworthy citizen who sought to gratify private ambition in opposition to common weal not shadow of political crime have be proved against not one stain have be detected on private conduct fellow monk including one who have formerly be secretary for several year who with more than average culture of companion have disposition to criticise fra girolamos rule a prior bore testimony even after shock of retraction to unimpeachable purity consistency in life have commanded unsuspecting veneration pope have not be able to raise charge of heresy against frate except on ground of disobedience to mandate disregard of sentence of excommunication be difficult to justify that breach of discipline by argument there be moral insurgence in mind of grave men against court of rome tended to confound theoretic distinction between church churchman to lighten scandal of disobedience men of ordinary morality public spirit felt that triumph of frates enemy be really triumph of gross licence keen florentine like soderini piero guicciardini may well have have angry smile on lip at severity dispensed with law in order to hang burn man in whom seduction of public career have warped strictness of veracity may well have remarked that if frate have mixed much deeper fraud with zeal ability le inconvenient to high personage fraud must have be regarded a excellent oil for ecclesiastical political wheel nevertheless such shrewd men be forced to admit that however poor figure florentine government made in clumsy pretence of judicial warrant for what have in fact be predetermined a act of policy measure of pope against savonarola be necessary measure of self defence not to try rid of man who wanted to stir up power of europe to summon general council depose must have be adding ineptitude to iniquity there be denying that towards alexander sixth savonarola be rebel what be much more dangerous rebel florence have heard say have well understood what meant that must not obey devil be inevitably life death struggle between frate pope be le inevitable that florence must make pope executioner romolas ear be filled in way with suggestion of faith still ardent under wound suggestion of worldly discernment judging thing according to very moderate standard of what be possible to human nature must be satisfied with brought to long meditation over printed document many painful observation registered more le consciously through year of discipleship whispered presentiment savonarola retraction of prophetic claim be not merely spasmodic effort to escape from torture on other hand soul cried out for explanation of lapse must make still possible for to believe that main striving of life have be pure grand recent memory of selfish discontent have come over like blighting wind along with loss of trust in man who have be for incarnation of highest motif have produced reaction be known to many a sort of faith have sprung up to out of very depth of despair be impossible said now that negative disbelieving thought have made soul arid of good must be founded in truth of thing impossible that have not be living spirit hollow pretence have once breathed in frates word kindled new life in falsehood there have be in have be fall not purpose gradual entanglement in struggled not contrivance encouraged by success looking at printed confession saw many sentence bore stamp of bungling fabrication have that emphasis repetition in self accusation none very low hypocrite use to fellow men fact that sentence be in striking opposition not only to character of savonarola also to general tone of confession strengthened impression that rest of text represented in main what have really fallen from lip hardly word be dishonourable to except what turned on prophetic annunciation be unvarying in statement of end have pursued for florence church world apart from mixture of falsity in claim to special inspiration by sought to gain hold of men mind there be admission of having used unworthy mean even in confession without expurgation of notary malign phrase fra girolamo shone forth a man who have sought own glory indeed sought by labouring for very highest endthe moral welfare of mennot by vague exhortation by striving to turn belief into energy must work in detail of life everything have done said one memorable passage may perhaps have have erasure interpolation have done with design of being for ever famous in present in future age might win credit in florence that nothing of great import must be done without sanction when have thus established position in florence have in mind to do great thing in italy beyond italy by mean of chief personage with whom have contracted friendship consulted on high matter such a of general council in proportion a first effort succeeded must have adopted further measure above when general council have once be brought about intended to rouse prince of christendom especially beyond border of italy to subdue infidel be not much in thought to get made cardinal pope for when must have achieved work have in view must without being pope have be first man in world in authority must have possessed reverence must have be paid if have be made pope must not have refused office seemed to that to be head of work be greater thing than to be pope because man without virtue may be pope work a contemplated demanded man of excellent virtue that blending of ambition with belief in supremacy of goodness made new tone to romola who have be used to hear in voice rang through duomo be habit of savonarola mind to conceive great thing to feel that be man to do iniquity must be brought low cause of justice purity love must triumph must triumph by voice by work by blood in moment of ecstatic contemplation doubtless sense of self melted in sense of unspeakable in part of experience lay element of genuine self abasement in presence of fellow men for whom be to act pre eminence seemed necessary condition of life perhaps confession even when described doubleness be conscious deliberate really implied more than wavering of belief concerning own impression motif most human being who have not stupid inflexibility of self confidence must be liable to under marked change of external condition in life where experience be so tumultuously mixed a must have be in frates what possibility be opened for change of self judgment when instead of eye venerated knee that knelt instead of great work on way to accomplishment in prosperity stamping agent a chosen instrument there came hooting spitting curse of crowd then hard face of enemy made judge then horrible torture with torture irrepressible cry be true what must have say let go torture again yes yes be guilty o god thy stroke have reached a romola thought of anguish must have followed confessionwhether in subsequent solitude of prison conscience retracted confirmed self taxing wordsthat anguish seemed to be pressing on own heart urging slow bitter tear vulgar

love have not forsaken say nothing now of great work to be done only say thou art not forsaken else why be thy heart bowed in penitence that too be gift there be jot of worthy evidence that from time of imprisonment to supreme moment savonarola thought spoke of a martyr idea of martyrdom have be to passion dividing dream of future with triumph of beholding work achieved now in place of have come resignation called by glorifying name therefore may more fitly be called martyr by fellow men to time for power rose against not because of sin because of greatnessnot because sought to deceive world because sought to make noble through greatness of endured double agony not only reviling torture death throe agony of sinking from vision of glorious achievement into deep shadow where must only say count a nothing darkness encompasses yet light saw be true light chapter lxxii last silence romola have seemed to hear a if have be cry word repeated to by many lipsthe word uttered by savonarola when took leave of brother of san marco who have come to witness signature of confession pray for for god have withdrawn from spirit of prophecy word have shaken with new doubt a to mode in looked back at
