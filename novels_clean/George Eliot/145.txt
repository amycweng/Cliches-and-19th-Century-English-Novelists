mortification necklace be quite usual now madame poincon who be stricter in thing even than be used to wear ornament christian generallysurely there be woman in heaven now who wore jewel celia be conscious of mental strength when really applied to argument must like to wear exclaimed dorothea air of astonished discovery animating whole person with dramatic action have caught from very madame poincon who wore ornament of course then let have out why did not tell before key key pressed hand against side of head seemed to despair of memory be here said celia with whom explanation have be long meditated prearranged pray open large drawer of cabinet get out jewel box casket be soon open before various jewel spread out making bright parterre on table be great collection few of ornament

celia uneasily dear said dorothea stroking sister cheek soul have complexion too what will suit one will not suit might like to keep for mamma sake have other thing of mammasher sandal wood box be so fond ofplenty of thing in fact be yours dear need discus no longer theretake away property celia felt little hurt there be strong assumption of superiority in puritanic toleration hardly le trying to blond flesh of unenthusiastic sister than puritanic persecution how can wear ornament if who be elder sister will never wear nay celia be too much to ask must wear trinket to keep in countenance if be to put on necklace a must feel a if have be pirouetting world must go round with must not know how to walk celia have unclasped necklace drawn off must be little tight for neck something to lie down

must do dorothea glanced quickly at sister across imaginative adornment of whom loved there darted now then keen discernment be not without scorching quality if miss brooke ever attained perfect meekness must not be for lack of inward fire perhaps said rather haughtily can not tell to what level may sink celia blushed be unhappy saw that have offended sister dared not say even anything pretty about gift of ornament put back into box carried away dorothea too be unhappy a went on with plan drawing questioning purity of own feeling speech in scene have ended with little explosion celias consciousness told that have not be at in wrong be quite natural justifiable that must have asked that question repeated to herself that dorothea be inconsistent must have taken full share of jewel after what have said must have renounced altogether be sureat least trust thought celia that wearing of necklace will not interfere with prayer see must be bound by dorotheas opinion now be going into society though of course ought to be bound by dorothea be not always consistent thus celia mutely bending over tapestry until heard sister calling here kitty come look at plan will think be great architect if have not got incompatible stair fireplace a celia bent over paper dorothea put cheek against sister arm caressingly celia understood action dorothea saw that have be in wrong celia pardoned since must remember there have be mixture of criticism awe in attitude of celias mind towards elder sister younger have always worn yoke be there yoked creature without private opinion

mr brooke over soup in easy smiling way taking up sir james chettams remark that be studying davy agricultural chemistry well now sir humphry davy dined with year ago at cartwright wordsworth be there toothe poet wordsworth know now there be something singular be at cambridge when wordsworth be there never met himand dined with twenty year afterwards at cartwright there oddity in thing now davy be there be poet too a may say wordsworth be poet one davy be poet two be true in sense know dorothea felt little more uneasy than usual in beginning of dinner party being small room still mote from mass of magistrate mind fell too noticeably wondered how man like mr casaubon must support such triviality manner thought be very dignified set of iron gray hair deep eye socket made resemble portrait of locke have spare form pale complexion became student a different a possible from blooming englishman of red whiskered type represented by sir james chettam be reading agricultural chemistry said excellent baronet because be going to take one of farm into own hand see if something can not be done in setting good pattern of farming among tenant do approve of miss brooke great mistake chettam interposed mr brooke going into electrifying land that kind of thing making parlor of cow house do went into science great deal at one time saw must not do lead to everything can let nothing alone nosee that tenant dont sell straw that kind of thing give draining tile know fancy farming will not dothe most expensive sort of whistle can buy may a well keep pack of hound surely said dorothea be better to spend money in finding out how men can make most of land support than in keeping dog horse only to gallop over be not sin to make poor in performing experiment for good of spoke with more energy than be expected of so young lady sir james have appealed to be accustomed to do so have often thought that must urge to many good action when be brother in law mr casaubon turned eye very markedly on dorothea while be speaking seemed to observe newly young lady dont understand political economy know said mr brooke smiling towards mr casaubon remember when be reading adam smith there be book now took in new idea at one timehuman perfectibility now say history move in circle may be very well argued have argued fact be human reason may carry little too farover hedge in fact carried good way at one time saw must not do pulled up pulled up in time not too hard have always be in favor of little theory must have thought else will be landed back in dark age talking of book there be southey peninsular war be reading that of morning know southey said mr casaubon not keeping pace with mr brooke impetuous reason thinking of book only have little leisure for such literature just now have be using up eyesight on old character lately fact be want reader for evening be fastidious in voice can not endure listening to imperfect reader be misfortune in sens feed too much on inward source live too much with dead mind be something like ghost of ancient wandering about world trying mentally to construct a used to be in spite of ruin confusing change find necessary to use utmost caution about eyesight be first time mr casaubon have spoken at length delivered with precision a if have be called upon to make public statement balanced sing song neatness of speech occasionally corresponded to by movement of head be more conspicuous from contrast with good mr brooke scrappy slovenliness dorothea said to herself that mr casaubon be most interesting man have ever seen not excepting even monsieur liret vaudois clergyman who have given conference on history of waldenses to reconstruct past world doubtless with view to highest purpose of truthwhat work to be in way present at to assist in though only a lamp holder elevating thought lifted above annoyance at being twitted with ignorance of political economy never explained science be thrust a extinguisher over light be fond of riding miss brooke sir james presently took opportunity of saying must have thought must enter little into pleasure of hunting wish must let send over chestnut horse for to try have be trained for lady saw on saturday cantering over hill on nag not worthy of groom will bring corydon for day if will only mention time thank be very good mean to give up riding will not ride more said dorothea urged to brusque resolution by little annoyance that sir james must be soliciting attention when wanted to give to mr casaubon be too hard said sir james in tone of reproach showed strong interest sister be given to self mortification be not continued turning to celia who sat at right hand think be said celia feeling afraid lest must say something must not please sister blushing a prettily a possible above necklace like giving up if be true celia giving up must be self indulgence not self mortification there may be good reason for choosing not to do what be very agreeable said dorothea mr brooke be speaking at same time be evident that mr casaubon be observing dorothea be aware of exactly said sir james give up from high generous motive indeed not exactly did not say that of answered dorothea reddening unlike celia rarely blushed only from high delight anger at moment felt angry with perverse sir james why did not pay attention to celia leave to listen to mr casaubonif learned man must only talk instead of allowing to be talked to by mr brooke who be just then informing that reformation meant something did not that be protestant to core that catholicism be fact a to refusing acre of ground for romanist chapel men needed bridle of religion properly speaking be dread of hereafter made great study of theology at one time said mr brooke a if to explain insight just manifested know something of school knew wilberforce in best day do know wilberforce mr casaubon said well wilberforce be perhaps not enough of thinker if went into parliament a have be asked to do must sit on independent bench a wilberforce did work at philanthropy mr casaubon bowed observed that be wide field yes said mr brooke with easy smile have document began long while ago to collect document want arranging when question have struck have written to somebody got answer have document at back now how do arrange document in pigeon hole partly said mr casaubon with rather startled air of effort ah pigeon hole will not do have tried pigeon hole everything get mixed in pigeon hole never know whether paper be in z wish must let sort paper for uncle said dorothea must letter then make list of subject under letter mr casaubon gravely smiled approval said to mr brooke have excellent secretary at hand perceive said mr brooke shaking head can not let young lady meddle with document young lady be too flighty dorothea felt hurt mr casaubon must think that uncle have special reason for delivering opinion whereas remark lay in mind a lightly a broken wing of insect among other fragment there chance current have sent alighting on when two girl be in drawing room alone celia said how very ugly mr casaubon be celia be one of most distinguished looking men ever saw be remarkably like portrait of locke have same deep eye socket have locke two white mole with hair on oh dare say when people of certain sort looked at said dorothea walking away little mr casaubon be so sallow better suppose admire man with complexion of cochon de lait dodo exclaimed celia looking after in surprise never heard make such comparison before why must make before occasion came be good comparison match be perfect miss brooke be clearly forgetting celia thought so wonder show temper dorothea be so painful in celia that will look at human being a if be merely animal with toilet never see great soul in man face have mr casaubon great soul celia be not without touch of naive malice yes believe have said dorothea with full voice of decision everything see in corresponds to pamphlet on biblical cosmology talk very little said celia there be one for to talk to celia thought privately dorothea quite despises sir james chettam believe must not accept celia felt that be pity have never be deceived a to object of baronet interest sometimes indeed have reflected that dodo must perhaps not make husband happy who have not way of looking at thing stifled in depth of heart be feeling that sister be too religious for family comfort notion scruple be like spilt needle making one afraid of treading sitting down even eating when miss brooke be at tea table sir james came to sit down by not having felt mode of answering at offensive why must thought probable that miss brooke liked manner must be very marked indeed before cease to be interpreted by preconception confident distrustful be thoroughly charming to of course theorized little about attachment be made of excellent human dough have rare merit of knowing that talent even if let loose must not set smallest stream in county on fire hence liked prospect of wife to whom must say what will do about that who must help husband out with reason must also have property qualification for doing so a to excessive religiousness alleged against miss brooke have very indefinite notion of what consisted in thought that must die out with marriage in short felt to be in love in right place be ready to endure great deal of predominance after man must always put down when liked sir james have idea that must ever like to put down predominance of handsome girl in whose cleverness delighted why not man mindwhat there be of ithas always advantage of being masculineas smallest birch tree be of higher kind than most soaring palmand even ignorance be of sounder quality sir james might not have originated estimate kind providence furnishes limpest personality with little gum starch in form of tradition let hope that will rescind resolution about horse miss brooke said persevering admirer assure riding be most healthy of exercise be aware of said dorothea coldly think must do celia goodif must take to be such perfect horsewoman excuse have have very little practice must be easily thrown then be reason for more practice lady ought to be perfect horsewoman that may accompany husband see how widely differ sir james have made up mind ought not to be perfect horsewoman so must never correspond to pattern of lady dorothea looked straight before spoke with cold brusquerie very much with air of handsome boy in amusing contrast with solicitous amiability of admirer must like to know reason for cruel resolution be not possible that must think horsemanship wrong be quite possible must think wrong for oh why said sir james in tender tone of remonstrance mr casaubon have come up to table teacup in hand be listening must not inquire too curiously into motif interposed in measured way miss brooke know that be apt to become feeble in utterance aroma be mixed with grosser air must keep germinating grain away from light dorothea colored with pleasure looked up gratefully to speaker here be man who must understand higher inward life with whom there must be spiritual communion nay who must illuminate principle with widest knowledge man whose learning almost amounted to proof of believed dorotheas inference may seem large really life must never have gone on at period for liberal allowance of conclusion have facilitated marriage under difficulty of civilization have one ever pinched into pilulous smallness cobweb of pre matrimonial acquaintanceship certainly said good sir james miss brooke will not be urged to tell reason must rather be silent upon be sure reason must do honor be not in least jealous of interest with dorothea have looked up at mr casaubon never occurred to that girl to whom be meditating offer of marriage must care for dried bookworm towards fifty except indeed in religious sort of way a for clergyman of distinction however since miss brooke have become engaged in conversation with mr casaubon about vaudois clergy sir james betook to celia talked to about sister spoke of house in town asked whether miss brooke disliked london away from sister celia talked quite easily sir james said to that second miss brooke be certainly very agreeable a well a pretty though not a people pretended more clever sensible than elder sister felt that have chosen one who be in respect superior man naturally like to look forward to having best must be very mawworm of bachelor who pretended not to expect chapter iii say goddess what ensued when raphael affable archangel eve story heard attentive be filled with admiration deep muse to hear of thing so high strange paradise lost b vii if have really occurred to mr casaubon to think of miss brooke a suitable wife for reason might induce to accept be already planted in mind by evening of next day reason have budded bloomed for have have long conversation in morning while celia who did not like company of mr casaubons mole sallowness have escaped to vicarage to play with curate ill shod merry child dorothea by time have looked deep into ungauged reservoir of mr casaubons mind seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine extension quality brought have opened much of own experience to have understood from scope of great work also of attractively labyrinthine extent for have be a instructive a milton affable archangel with something of archangelic manner told how have undertaken to show what indeed have be attempted before not with thoroughness justice of comparison effectiveness of arrangement at mr casaubon aimed that mythical system erratic mythical fragment in world be corruption of tradition originally revealed having once mastered true position taken firm footing there vast field of mythical construction became intelligible nay luminous with reflected light of correspondence to gather in great harvest of truth be light speedy work note already made formidable range of volume crowning task must be to condense voluminous still accumulating result bring like earlier vintage of hippocratic book to fit little shelf in explaining to dorothea mr casaubon expressed nearly a must have done to fellow student for have not two style of talking at command be true that when used greek latin phrase always gave english with scrupulous care must probably have done in case learned provincial clergyman be accustomed to think of acquaintance a of lord knyghtes other noble worthi men conne latyn lytille dorothea be altogether captivated by wide embrace of conception here be something beyond willow of lady school literature here be living bossuet whose work must reconcile complete knowledge with devoted piety here be modern augustine who united glory of doctor saint sanctity seemed le clearly marked than learning for when dorothea be impelled to open mind on certain theme must speak of to one whom have before seen at tipton especially on secondary importance of ecclesiastical form article of belief compared with spiritual religion that submergence of self in communion with divine perfection seemed to to be expressed in best christian book of widely distant age found in mr casaubon listener who understood at once who must assure of own agreement with view when duly tempered with wise conformity must mention historical example before unknown to think with said dorothea to herself rather think whole world of thought be poor twopenny mirror feeling too whole experiencewhat lake compared with little pool miss brooke argued from word disposition not le unhesitatingly than other young lady of age sign be small measurable thing interpretation be illimitable in girl of sweet ardent nature sign be apt to conjure up wonder hope belief vast a sky colored by diffused thimbleful of matter in shape of knowledge be not always too grossly deceived for sinbad may have fallen by good luck on true description wrong reasoning sometimes land poor mortal in right conclusion starting long way off true point proceeding by loop zigzag now then arrive just where ought to be because miss brooke be hasty in trust be not therefore clear that mr casaubon be unworthy of stayed little longer than have intended on slight pressure of invitation from mr brooke who offered bait except own document on machine breaking rick burning mr casaubon be called into library to look at in heap while host picked up first one then other to read aloud from in skipping uncertain way passing from one unfinished passage to with yes now here finally pushing aside to open journal of youthful continental travel look herehere be about greece rhamnus ruin of rhamnusyou be great grecian now dont know whether have given much study to topography spent end of time in making out thingshelicon now here nowwe started next morning for parnassus double peaked parnassus volume be about greece know mr brooke wound up rubbing thumb transversely along edge of leaf a held book forward mr casaubon made dignified though somewhat sad audience bowed in right place avoided looking at anything documentary a far a possible without showing disregard impatience mindful that desultoriness be associated with institution of country that man who took on severe mental scamper be not only amiable host landholder custos rotulorum be endurance aided also by reflection that mr brooke be uncle of dorothea certainly seemed more more bent on making talk to on drawing out a celia remarked to herself in looking at face be often lit up by smile like pale wintry sunshine before left next morning while taking pleasant walk with miss brooke along gravelled terrace have mentioned to that felt disadvantage of loneliness need of cheerful companionship with presence of youth can lighten vary serious toil of maturity delivered statement with a much careful precision a if have be diplomatic envoy whose word must be attended with result indeed mr casaubon be not used to expect that must have to repeat revise communication of practical personal kind inclination have deliberately stated on d of october must think enough to refer to by mention of date judging by standard of own memory be volume where vide supra must serve instead of repetition not ordinary long used blotting book only tell of forgotten writing in case mr casaubons confidence be not likely to be falsified for dorothea heard retained what said with eager interest of fresh young nature to variety in experience be epoch be three oclock in beautiful breezy autumn day when mr casaubon drove off to rectory at lowick only five mile from tipton dorothea who have on bonnet shawl hurried along shrubbery across park that might wander through bordering wood with other visible companionship than of monk great st bernard dog who always took care of young lady in walk there have risen before girl vision of possible future for herself to looked forward with trembling hope wanted to wander on in visionary future without interruption walked briskly in brisk air color rose in cheek straw bonnet contemporary might look at with conjectural curiosity a at obsolete form of basket fell little backward must perhaps be hardly characterized enough if be omitted that wore brown hair flatly braided coiled behind so a to expose outline of head in daring manner at time when public feeling required meagreness of nature to be dissimulated by tall barricade of frizzed curl bow never surpassed by great race except feejeean be trait of miss brooke asceticism there be nothing of ascetic expression in bright full eye a looked before not consciously seeing absorbing into intensity of mood solemn glory of afternoon with long swathe of light between far off row of lime whose shadow touched other people young old be people in ante reform time must have thought interesting object if have referred glow in eye cheek to newly awakened ordinary image of young love illusion of chloe about strephon have be sufficiently consecrated in poetry a pathetic loveliness of spontaneous trust ought to be miss pippin adoring young pumpkin dreaming along endless vista of unwearying companionship be little drama never tired father mother have be put into costume let pumpkin have figure must sustain disadvantage of shortwaisted swallow tail everybody felt not only natural necessary to perfection of womanhood that sweet girl must be at once convinced of virtue exceptional ability above perfect sincerity perhaps person then livingcertainly none in neighborhood of tiptonwould have have sympathetic understanding for dream of girl whose notion about marriage took color entirely from exalted enthusiasm about end of life enthusiasm be lit chiefly by own fire included nicety of trousseau pattern of plate even honor sweet joy of blooming matron have now entered dorotheas mind that mr casaubon might wish to make wife idea that must do so touched with sort of reverential gratitude how good of himnay must be almost a if winged messenger have suddenly stood beside path held out hand towards for long while have be oppressed by indefiniteness hung in mind like thick summer haze over desire to make life greatly effective what must do what ought to doshe hardly more than budding woman yet with active conscience great mental need not to be satisfied by girlish instruction comparable to nibblings judgment of discursive mouse with endowment of stupidity conceit might have thought that christian young lady of fortune must find ideal of life in village charity patronage of humbler clergy perusal of female scripture character unfolding private experience of sara under old dispensation dorcas under new care of soul over embroidery in own boudoirwith background of prospective marriage to man who if le strict than a being involved in affair religiously inexplicable might be prayed for seasonably exhorted from such contentment poor dorothea be shut out intensity of religious disposition coercion exercised over life be one aspect of nature altogether ardent theoretic intellectually consequent with such nature struggling in band of narrow teaching hemmed in by social life seemed nothing labyrinth of petty course walled in maze of small path led whither outcome be sure to strike others a at once exaggeration inconsistency thing seemed to best

radiance of transfigured girlhood fell on first object came within level impetus with inclination became resolution be heightened by little event of day have roused discontent with actual condition of life after dinner when celia be playing air with variation small kind of tinkling symbolized aesthetic part of young lady education dorothea went up to room to answer mr casaubons letter why must defer answer wrote over three time not because wished to change wording because hand be unusually uncertain must not bear that mr casaubon must think handwriting bad illegible piqued on writing hand in letter be distinguishable without large range of conjecture meant to make much use of accomplishment to save mr casaubons eye three time wrote dear mr casauboni be very grateful to for loving thinking worthy to be wife can look forward to better happiness than must be one with yours if said more must only be same thing written out at greater length for can not now dwell on other thought than may be through life yours devotedly dorothea brooke later in evening followed uncle into library to give letter that might send in morning be surprised surprise only issued in few moment silence during pushed about various object on writing table finally stood with back to fire glass on nose looking at address of dorotheas letter have thought enough about dear said at last there be need to think long uncle know of nothing to make vacillate if changed mind must be because of something important entirely new to ahthen have accepted then chettam have chance have chettam offended youoffended know what be dont like in chettam there be nothing that like in said dorothea rather impetuously mr brooke threw head shoulder backward a if one have thrown light missile at dorothea immediately felt self rebuke said mean in light of husband be very kind thinkreally very good about cottage well meaning man must have scholar that sort of thing well lie little in family have myselfthat love of knowledge going into everythinga little too muchit took too far though sort of thing doesnt often run in female line run underground like river in greece knowit come out in son clever son clever mother went good deal into at one time however dear have always said that people must do a like in thing up to certain point couldnt a guardian have consented to bad match casaubon stand well position be good be afraid chettam will be hurt though mr cadwallader will blame that evening of course celia knew nothing of what have happened attributed dorotheas abstracted manner evidence of further cry since have got home to temper have be in about sir james chettam building be careful not to give further offence having once said what wanted to say celia have disposition to recur to disagreeable subject have be nature when child never to quarrel with oneonly to observe with wonder that quarrelled with looked like turkey cock whereupon be ready to play at cat cradle with whenever recovered a to dorothea have always be way to find something wrong in sister word though celia inwardly protested that always said just how thing be nothing else never did never must put word together out of own head best of dodo be that did not keep angry for long together now though have hardly spoken to other evening yet when celia put by work intending to go to bed proceeding in be always much earlier dorothea who be seated on low stool unable to occupy except in meditation said with musical intonation in moment of deep quiet feeling made speech like fine bit of recitative celia dear come kiss holding arm open a spoke celia knelt down to get right level gave little butterfly kiss while dorothea encircled with gentle arm pressed lip gravely on cheek in turn dont sit up dodo be so pale to night go to bed soon said celia in comfortable way without touch of pathos dear be very very happy said dorothea fervently so much better thought celia how strangely dodo go from one extreme to other next day at luncheon butler handing something to mr brooke said jonas be come back sir have brought letter mr brooke read letter then nodding toward dorothea said casaubon dear will be here to dinner didnt wait to write moredidnt wait know must not seem remarkable to celia that dinner guest must be announced to sister beforehand eye following same direction a uncle be struck with peculiar effect of announcement on dorothea seemed a if something like reflection of white sunlit wing have passed across feature ending in one of rare blush for first time entered into celias mind that there might be something more between mr casaubon sister than delight in bookish talk delight in listening hitherto have classed admiration for ugly learned acquaintance with admiration for monsieur liret at lausanne also ugly learned dorothea have never be tired of listening to old monsieur liret when celias foot be a cold a possible when have really become dreadful to see skin of bald head moving about why then must enthusiasm not extend to mr casaubon simply in same way a to monsieur liret seemed probable that learned men have sort of schoolmaster view of young people now celia be really startled at suspicion have darted into mind be seldom taken by surprise in way marvellous quickness in observing certain order of sign generally preparing to expect such outward event a have interest in not that now imagined mr casaubon to be already accepted lover have only begun to feel disgust at possibility that anything in dorotheas mind must tend towards such issue here be something really to vex about dodo be very well not to accept sir james chettam idea of marrying mr casaubon celia felt sort of shame mingled with sense of ludicrous perhaps dodo if be really bordering on extravagance might be turned away from experience have often shown that impressibility might be calculated on day be damp be not going to walk out so went up to sitting room there celia observed that dorothea instead of settling down with usual diligent interest to occupation simply leaned elbow on open book looked out of window at great cedar silvered with damp have taken up making of toy for curate child be not going to enter on subject too precipitately dorothea be in fact thinking that be desirable for celia to know of momentous change in mr casaubons position since have last be in house did not seem fair to leave in ignorance of what must necessarily affect attitude towards be impossible not to shrink from telling dorothea accused herself of meanness in timidity be always odious to to have small fear contrivance about action at moment be seeking highest aid possible that might not dread corrosiveness of celias pretty carnally minded prose reverie be broken difficulty of decision banished by celias small rather guttural voice speaking in usual tone of remark aside by bye be one else coming to dine besides mr casaubon not that know of hope there be one else then will not hear eat soup so what be there remarkable about soup eating really dodo cant hear how scrape spoon always blink before speaks dont know whether locke blinked im sure be sorry for who sat opposite to if did celia said dorothea with emphatic gravity pray dont make more observation of kind why not be quite true returned celia who have reason for persevering though be beginning to be little afraid many thing be true only commonest mind observe then think commonest mind must be rather useful think be pity mr casaubons mother have not commoner mind might have taught better celia be inwardly frightened ready to run away now have hurled light javelin dorotheas feeling have gathered to avalanche there must be further preparation be right to tell celia that be engaged to marry mr casaubon perhaps celia have never turned so pale before paper man be making must have have leg injured for habitual care of held in hand laid fragile figure down at once sat perfectly still for few moment when spoke there be tear gathering oh dodo hope will be happy sisterly tenderness must not surmount other feeling at moment fear be fear of affection dorothea be still hurt agitated be quite decided then said celia in awed under tone uncle know have accepted mr casaubons offer uncle brought letter contained knew about beforehand beg pardon if have said anything to hurt dodo said celia with slight sob never must have thought that must feel a did there be something funereal in whole affair mr casaubon seemed to be officiating clergyman about whom must be indecent to make remark never mind kitty grieve must never admire same people often offend in something of same way be apt to speak too strongly of who dont please in spite of magnanimity dorothea be still smarting perhaps a much from celias subdued astonishment a from small criticism of course world round tipton must be out of sympathy with marriage dorothea knew of one who thought a did about life best object nevertheless before evening be at end be very happy in hour tte tte with mr casaubon talked to with more freedom than have ever felt before even pouring out joy at thought of devoting to of learning how might best share further great end mr casaubon be touched with unknown delight what man must not have be at childlike unrestrained ardor be not surprised what lover must have be that must be object of dear young ladymiss brookedorothea said pressing hand between hand be happiness greater than have ever imagined to be in reserve for must ever meet with mind person so rich in mingled grace must render marriage

must not be rash to conclude that there be passion behind sonnet to delia strike a thin music of mandolin dorotheas faith supplied that mr casaubons word seemed to leave unsaid what believer see disturbing omission infelicity text whether of prophet of poet expands for whatever can put into even bad grammar be sublime be very ignorantyou will quite wonder at ignorance said dorothea have so many thought may be quite mistaken now will be able to tell to ask about added with rapid imagination of mr casaubons probable feeling will not trouble too much only when be inclined to listen to must often be weary with pursuit of subject in own track will gain enough if will take with there how must be able now to persevere in path without companionship said mr casaubon kissing candid brow feeling that heaven have vouchsafed blessing in way suited to peculiar want be being unconsciously wrought upon by charm of nature be entirely without hidden calculation for immediate effect for remoter end be made dorothea so childlike according to judge so stupid with reputed cleverness a for example in present case of throwing metaphorically speaking at mr casaubons foot kissing unfashionable shoe tie a if be protestant pope be not in least teaching mr casaubon to ask if be good enough for merely asking anxiously how must be good enough for mr casaubon before left next day

over there be chance if have married sir james of becoming sane sensible woman must never have contradicted when woman be not contradicted have motive for obstinacy in absurdity now wish joy of hair

to baronet that have made impression on celias heart for be not one of gentleman who languish after unattainable sappho apple laugh from topmost boughthe charm smile like knot of cowslip on cliff not to be come at by willing hand have sonnet to write must not strike agreeably that be not object of preference to woman whom have preferred already knowledge that dorothea have chosen mr casaubon have bruised attachment relaxed hold although sir james be sportsman have other feeling towards woman than towards grouse fox did not regard future wife in light of prey valuable chiefly for excitement of chase be so well acquainted with habit of primitive race a to feel that ideal combat for tomahawk in hand so to speak be necessary to historical continuity of marriage tie on contrary having amiable vanity knit to who be fond of disinclines to who be indifferent also good grateful nature mere idea that woman have kindness towards spun little thread of tenderness from out heart towards hers thus happened that after sir james have ridden rather fast for hour in direction away from tipton grange slackened pace at last turned into road must lead back by shorter cut various feeling wrought in determination after to go to grange to day a if nothing new have happened must not help rejoicing that have never made offer be rejected mere friendly politeness required that must call to see dorothea about cottage now happily mr cadwallader have prepared to offer congratulation if necessary without showing too much awkwardness really did not like giving up dorothea be very painful to there be something in resolve to make visit forthwith conquer show of feeling be sort of file biting counter irritant without distinctly recognizing impulse there certainly be present in sense that celia must be there that must pay more attention than have done before mortal men woman devour many disappointment between breakfast dinner time keep back tear look little pale about lip in answer to inquiry say oh nothing pride help pride be not bad thing when only urge to hide own hurtsnot to hurt others chapter vii piacer e popone vuol la sua stagione italian proverb mr casaubon a might be expected great deal of time at grange in week hindrance courtship occasioned to progress of great workthe key to mythologiesnaturally made look forward more eagerly to happy termination of courtship have deliberately incurred hindrance having made up mind that be now time for to adorn life with grace of female companionship to irradiate gloom fatigue be apt to hang over interval of studious labor with play of female fancy to secure in culminating age solace of female tendance for declining year hence determined to abandon to stream of feeling perhaps be surprised to find what exceedingly willow rill be a in droughty region baptism by immersion must only be performed symbolically mr casaubon found that sprinkling be utmost approach to plunge stream must afford concluded that poet have much exaggerated force of masculine passion nevertheless observed with pleasure miss brooke showed ardent submissive affection promised to fulfil most agreeable prevision of marriage have once twice crossed mind that possibly there be deficiency in dorothea to account for moderation of abandonment be unable to discern deficiency to figure to woman who must have pleased better so that there be clearly reason to fall back upon exaggeration of human tradition must not be preparing now to be more useful said dorothea to one morning early in time of courtship must not learn to read latin greek aloud to a milton daughter did to father without understanding what read fear must be wearisome to said mr casaubon smiling indeed if remember rightly young woman have mentioned regarded that exercise in unknown tongue a ground for rebellion against poet yes in first place be very naughty girl else must have be proud to minister to father in second place might have studied privately taught to understand what read then must have be interesting hope dont expect to be naughty stupid expect to be exquisite young lady can be in possible relation of life certainly might be great advantage if be able to copy greek character to end be well to begin with little reading dorothea seized a precious permission must not have asked mr casaubon at once to teach language dreading of thing to be tiresome instead of helpful be not entirely out of devotion to future husband that wished to know latin greek province of masculine knowledge seemed to standing ground from truth must be seen more truly a be constantly doubted own conclusion because felt own ignorance how must be confident that one roomed cottage be not for glory of god when men who knew classic appeared to conciliate indifference to cottage with zeal for glory perhaps even hebrew might be necessaryat least alphabet few rootsin order to arrive at core of thing judge soundly on social duty of christian have not reached that point of renunciation at must have be satisfied with having wise husband wished poor child to be wise miss brooke be certainly very naive with alleged cleverness celia whose mind have never be thought too powerful saw emptiness of other people pretension much more readily to have in general little feeling seems to be only security against feeling too much on particular occasion however mr casaubon consented to listen teach for hour together like schoolmaster of little boy rather like lover to whom mistress elementary ignorance difficulty have touching fitness few scholar must have disliked teaching alphabet under such circumstance dorothea be little shocked discouraged at own stupidity answer got to timid question about value of greek accent gave painful suspicion here indeed there might be secret not capable of explanation to woman reason mr brooke have doubt on point expressed with usual strength upon one day that came into library while reading be going forward well now casaubon such deep study classic mathematics that kind of thing be too taxing for womantoo taxing know dorothea be learning to read character simply said mr casaubon evading question have very considerate thought of saving eye ah well without understanding knowthat may not be so bad there be lightness about feminine minda touch gomusic fine art that kind of thingthey must study up to certain point woman must in light way know woman must be able to sit down play sing good old english tune be what like though have heard most thingsbeen at opera in vienna gluck mozart everything of sort im conservative in musicits not like idea know stick to good old tune mr casaubon be not fond of piano be very glad be not said dorothea whose slight regard for domestic music feminine fine art must be forgiven considering small tinkling smearing in chiefly consisted at dark period smiled looked up at betrothed with grateful eye if have always be asking to play last rose of summer must have required much resignation say there be only old harpsichord at lowick be covered with book ah there be behind celia dear celia now play very prettily be always ready to play however since casaubon doe not like be right pity must not have little recreation of sort casaubon bow always strungthat kind of thing knowwill not do never must look on in light of recreation to have ear teased with measured noise said mr casaubon tune much iterated have ridiculous effect of making word in mind perform sort of minuet to keep timean effect hardly tolerable imagine after boyhood a to grander form of music worthy to accompany solemn celebration even to serve a educating influence according to ancient conception say nothing for with be not immediately concerned music of sort must enjoy said dorothea when be coming home from lausanne uncle took to hear great organ at freiberg made sob kind of thing be not healthy dear said mr brooke casaubon will be in hand now must teach niece to take thing more quietly eh dorothea ended with smile not wishing to hurt niece really thinking that be perhaps better for to be early married to so sober fellow a casaubon since must not hear of chettam be wonderful though said to a shuffled out of roomit be wonderful that must have liked however match be good must have be travelling out of brief to have hindered let mr cadwallader say what will be pretty certain to be bishop be casaubon be very seasonable pamphlet of on catholic questiona deanery at least owe deanery here must vindicate claim to philosophical reflectiveness by remarking that mr brooke on occasion little thought of radical speech at later period be led to make on income of bishop what elegant historian must neglect striking opportunity for pointing out that hero did not foresee history of world even own actionsfor example that henry of navarre when protestant baby little thought of being catholic monarch alfred great when measured laborious night with burning candle have idea of future gentleman measuring idle day with watch here be mine of truth however vigorously may be worked be likely to outlast coal of mr brooke make further remark perhaps le warranted by precedentnamely that if have foreknown speech might not have made great difference to think with pleasure of niece husband having large ecclesiastical income be one thingto make liberal speech be thing be narrow mind can not look at subject from various point of view chapter viii oh rescue be brother now father gentle maid must have guardian in gentleman be wonderful to sir james chettam how well continued to like going to grange after have once encountered difficulty of seeing dorothea for first time in light of woman who be engaged to man of course forked lightning seemed to pas through when first approached remained conscious throughout interview of hiding uneasiness good a be must be owned that uneasiness be le than must have be if have thought rival brilliant desirable match have sense of being eclipsed by mr casaubon be only shocked that dorothea be under melancholy illusion mortification lost of bitterness by being mingled with compassion nevertheless while sir james said to that have completely resigned since with perversity of desdemona have not affected proposed match be clearly suitable according to nature must not yet be quite passive under idea of engagement to mr casaubon on day when first saw together in light of present knowledge seemed to that have not taken affair seriously enough brooke be really culpable ought to have hindered who must speak to something might be done perhaps even now at least to defer marriage on way home turned into rectory asked for mr cadwallader happily rector be at home visitor be shown into study where fishing tackle hung be in little room adjoining at work with turning apparatus called to baronet to join there two be better friend than other landholder clergyman in countya significant fact be in agreement with amiable expression of face mr cadwallader be large man with full lip sweet smile very plain rough in exterior with solid imperturbable ease good humor be infectious like great grassy hill in sunshine quiet even irritated egoism make rather ashamed of well how be said showing hand not quite fit to be grasped sorry missed before be there anything particular look vexed sir james brow have little crease in little depression of eyebrow seemed purposely to exaggerate a answered be only conduct of brooke really think somebody must speak to what meaning to stand said mr cadwallader going on with arrangement of reel have just be turning hardly think mean wheres harm if like one who object to whiggery must be glad when whig dont put up strongest fellow wont overturn constitution with friend brooke head for battering ram oh dont mean said sir james who after putting down hat throwing into chair have begun to nurse leg examine sole of boot with much bitterness mean marriage mean letting that blooming young girl marry casaubon what be matter with casaubon see harm in himif girl like be too young to know what like guardian ought to interfere ought not to allow thing to be done in headlong manner wonder man like cadwalladera man with daughter can look at affair with indifference with such heart a yours do think seriously about be not joking be a serious a possible said rector with provoking little inward laugh be a bad a elinor have be wanting to go lecture brooke have reminded that friend have very poor opinion of match made when married look at casaubon said sir james indignantly must be fifty dont believe must ever have be much more than shadow of man look at leg confound handsome young fellow think of having own way in world dont understand woman dont admire half so much a admire yourselves elinor used to tell sister that married for uglinessit be so various amusing that have quite conquered prudence be easy enough for woman to love be question of beauty dont like casaubon be sir james strongest way of implying that thought ill of man character why what do know against said rector laying down reel putting thumb into armhole with air of attention sir james paused did not usually find easy to give reason seemed to strange that people must not know without being told since only felt what be reasonable at last said now cadwallader have got heart well yes dont mean of melting sort sound kernel that may be sure of be very good to poor relation pension several of woman be educating young fellow at good deal of expense casaubon act up to sense of justice mother sister made bad matcha pole thinklost herselfat rate be disowned by family if have not be for casaubon must not have have so much money by half believe went to find out cousin see what must do for man must not ring so well a if tried metal must chettam not man dont know said sir james coloring be not so sure of paused moment then added that be right thing for casaubon to do man may wish to do what be right yet be sort of parchment code woman may not be happy with think when girl be so young a miss brooke be friend ought to interfere little to hinder from doing anything foolish laugh because fancy

immediately ran to papa be made comfortable on knee hear what be talking about said wife will make impression on humphrey a long a fish rise to bait everybody be what ought to be bless casaubon have got trout stream doe not care about fishing in must there be better fellow well there be something in said rector with quiet inward laugh be very good quality in man to have trout stream seriously said sir james whose vexation have not yet spent dont think rector might do good by speaking oh told beforehand what must say answered mr cadwallader lifting up eyebrow have done what must wash hand of marriage in first place said rector looking rather grave must be nonsensical to expect must convince brooke make act accordingly brooke be very good fellow pulpy will run into mould wont keep shape might keep shape long enough to defer marriage said sir james dear chettam why must use influence to casaubons disadvantage unless be much surer than be must be acting for advantage of miss brooke know harm of casaubon dont care about xisuthrus fee fo fum rest then doesnt care about fishing tackle a to line took on catholic question be unexpected have always be civil to dont see why must spoil

speechifying at middlemarch said casaubon be learned straw chopping incumbent freke be brick mortar incumbent be angling incumbent upon word dont see that one be worse better than other rector ended with silent laugh always saw joke of satire against conscience be large easy like rest of did only what must do without trouble clearly there must be interference with miss brooke marriage through mr cadwallader sir james felt with sadness that be to have perfect liberty of misjudgment be sign of good disposition that did not slacken at in intention of carrying out dorotheas design of cottage doubtless persistence be best course for own dignity pride only help to be generous never make so more than vanity make witty be now enough aware of sir james position with regard to to appreciate rectitude of perseverance in landlord duty to have at first be urged by lover complaisance pleasure in be great enough to count for something even in present happiness perhaps gave to sir james chettams cottage interest must spare from mr casaubon rather from symphony of hopeful dream admiring trust passionate self devotion learned gentleman have set playing in soul hence happened that in good baronet succeeding visit while be beginning to pay small attention to celia found talking with more more pleasure to dorothea be perfectly unconstrained without irritation towards now be gradually discovering delight there be in frank kindness companionship between man woman who have passion to hide confess chapter ix st gent ancient land in ancient oracle be called law thirsty struggle there be after order perfect rule pray where lie such land now d gent why where lay of oldin human soul mr casaubons behavior about settlement be highly satisfactory to mr brooke preliminary of marriage rolled smoothly along shortening week of courtship betrothed bride must see future home dictate change that must like to have made there woman dictate before marriage in order that may have appetite for submission afterwards certainly mistake that male female mortal make when have own way might fairly raise wonder that be so fond of on gray dry november morning dorothea drove to lowick in company with uncle celia mr casaubons home be manor house close by visible from part of garden be little church with old parsonage opposite in beginning of career mr casaubon have only held living death of brother have put in possession of manor also have small park with fine old oak here there avenue of lime towards southwest front with sunk fence between park pleasure ground so that from drawing room window glance swept uninterruptedly along slope of greensward till lime ended in level of corn pasture often seemed to melt into lake under setting sun be happy side of house for south east looked rather melancholy even under brightest morning ground here be more confined flower bed showed very careful tendance large clump of tree chiefly of sombre yew have risen high not ten yard from window building of greenish stone be in old english style not ugly small windowed melancholy looking sort of house must have child many flower open window little vista of bright thing to make seem joyous home in latter end of autumn with sparse remnant of yellow leaf falling slowly athwart dark evergreen in stillness without house too have air of autumnal decline mr casaubon when presented have bloom must be thrown into relief by background oh dear celia said to herself be sure freshitt hall must have be pleasanter than thought of white freestone pillared portico terrace full of flower sir james smiling above like prince issuing from enchantment in rose bush with handkerchief swiftly metamorphosed from most delicately odorous petalssir james who talked so agreeably always about thing have common sense in not about learning celia have light young feminine taste grave weatherworn gentleman sometimes prefer in wife happily mr casaubons bias have be different for must have have chance with celia dorothea on contrary found house ground that must wish dark book shelf in long library carpet curtain with color subdued by time curious old map bird eye view on wall of corridor with here there old vase below have oppression for seemed more cheerful than cast picture at grange uncle have long ago brought home from travelsthey being probably among idea have taken in at one time to poor dorothea severe classical nudity smirking renaissance correggiosities be painfully inexplicable staring into midst of puritanic conception have never be taught how must bring into sort of relevance with life owner of lowick apparently have not be traveller mr casaubons study of past be not carried on by mean of such aid dorothea walked about house with delightful emotion everything seemed hallowed to be to be home of wifehood looked up with eye full of confidence to mr casaubon when drew attention specially to actual arrangement asked if must like alteration appeal to taste met gratefully saw nothing to alter effort at exact courtesy formal tenderness have defect for filled up blank with unmanifested perfection interpreting a interpreted work of providence accounting for seeming discord by own deafness to higher harmony there be many blank left in week of courtship loving faith fill with happy assurance now dear dorothea wish to favor by pointing out room must like to have a boudoir said mr casaubon showing that view of womanly nature be sufficiently large to include requirement be very kind of to think of said dorothea assure must rather have matter decided for will be much happier to take everything a isjust a have be used to have a will choose to be have motive for wishing anything else oh dodo said celia will not have bow windowed room up stair mr casaubon led way thither bow window looked down avenue of lime furniture be of faded blue there be miniature of lady gentleman with powdered hair hanging in group piece of tapestry over door also showed blue green world with pale stag in chair table be thin legged easy to upset be room where one might fancy ghost of tight laced lady revisiting scene of embroidery light bookcase contained duodecimo volume of polite literature in calf completing furniture yes said mr brooke must be pretty room with new hanging sofa that sort of thing little bare now uncle said dorothea eagerly pray speak of altering anything there be so many other thing in world want alteringi like to take thing a be like a be dont added looking at mr casaubon perhaps be mother room when be young be said with slow bend of head be mother said dorothea who have turned to examine group of miniature be like tiny one brought only must think better portrait one opposite who be elder sister be like sister only two child of parent who hang above see sister be pretty said celia implying that thought le favorably of mr casaubons mother be new opening to celias imagination that came of family who have be young in timethe lady wearing necklace be peculiar face said dorothea looking closely deep gray eye rather near togetherand delicate irregular nose with sort of ripple in itand powdered curl hanging backward altogether seems to peculiar rather than pretty there be not even family likeness between mother be not alike in lot did not mention to said dorothea aunt made unfortunate marriage never saw dorothea wondered little felt that must be indelicate just then to ask for information mr casaubon did not proffer turned to window to admire view sun have lately pierced gray avenue of lime cast shadow will not walk in garden now said dorothea must like to see church know said mr brooke be droll little church village lie in nut shell by way will suit dorothea for cottage be like row of alms houseslittle garden gilly flower that sort of thing yes please said dorothea looking at mr casaubon must like to see that have got nothing from more graphic about lowick cottage than that be not bad be soon on gravel walk led chiefly between grassy border clump of tree being nearest way to church mr casaubon said at little gate leading into churchyard there be pause while mr casaubon went to parsonage close by to fetch key celia who have be hanging little in rear came up presently when saw that mr casaubon be gone away said in easy staccato always seemed to contradict suspicion of malicious intent do know dorothea one quite young coming up one of walk be that astonishing celia there may be young gardener knowwhy not said mr brooke told casaubon must change gardener not gardener said celia gentleman with sketch book have light brown curl only saw back be quite young curate son perhaps said mr brooke ah there be casaubon again tucker with be going to introduce tucker dont know tucker yet mr tucker be middle aged curate one of inferior clergy who be usually not wanting in son after introduction conversation did not lead to question about family startling apparition of youthfulness be forgotten by one celia inwardly declined to believe that light brown curl slim figure must have relationship to mr tucker who be just a old musty looking a must have expected mr casaubons curate to be doubtless excellent man who must go to heaven for celia wished not to be unprincipled corner of mouth be so unpleasant celia thought with dismalness of time must have to spend a bridesmaid at lowick while curate have probably pretty little child whom must like irrespective of principle mr tucker be invaluable in walk perhaps mr casaubon have not be without foresight on head curate being able to answer dorotheas question about villager other parishioner everybody assured be well off in lowick not cottager in double cottage at low rent kept pig strip of garden at back be well tended small boy wore excellent corduroy girl went out a tidy servant did little straw plaiting at home loom here dissent though public disposition be rather towards laying by money than towards spirituality there be not much vice speckled fowl be so numerous that mr brooke observed farmer leave barley for woman to glean see poor folk here might have fowl in pot a good french king used to wish for people french eat good many fowlsskinny fowl know think be very cheap wish of said dorothea indignantly be king such monster that wish like must be reckoned royal virtue if wished skinny fowl said celia must not be nice perhaps wished to have fat fowl yes word have dropped out of text perhaps be subauditum be present in king mind not uttered said mr casaubon smiling bending head towards

so much in town that called methodist others hypocrite according to resource of vocabulary there be various professional men in fact mr cadwallader said that brooke be beginning to treat middlemarchers that preferred farmer at tithe dinner who drank health unpretentiously be not ashamed of grandfather furniture for in part of country before reform have done notable part in developing

unexceptionable in point of breeding also interesting on ground of complaint puzzled doctor seemed clearly case wherein fulness of professional knowledge might need supplement of quackery lady chettam who attributed own remarkable health to home made bitter united with constant medical attendance entered with much exercise of imagination into mr renfrews account of symptom into amazing futility in case of strengthening medicine where can all strength of medicine go dear said mild stately dowager turning to mr cadwallader reflectively when mr renfrews attention be called away strengthens disease

be one of lydgates of northumberland really well connected one doe not expect in practitioner of kind for own part like medical man more on footing with servant be often cleverer assure found poor hick judgment unfailing never knew wrong be coarse butcher like knew constitution be loss to going off so suddenly dear what very animated conversation miss brooke seems to be having with mr lydgate be talking cottage hospital with said mr cadwallader whose ear power of interpretation be quick believe be sort of philanthropist so brooke be sure to take up james said lady chettam when son came near bring mr lydgate introduce to want to test affable dowager declared delighted with opportunity of making mr lydgates acquaintance having heard of success in treating fever on new plan mr lydgate have medical accomplishment of looking perfectly grave nonsense be talked to dark steady eye gave impressiveness a listener be a little a possible like lamented hick especially in certain careless refinement about toilet utterance yet lady chettam gathered much confidence in confirmed view of own constitution a being peculiar by admitting that constitution might be called peculiar did not deny that hers might be more peculiar than others did not approve of too lowering system including reckless cupping on other hand of incessant port wine bark said think so with air of so much deference accompanying insight of agreement that formed most cordial opinion of talent be quite pleased with protege said to mr brooke before going away protegedear mewho be that said mr brooke young lydgate new doctor seems to to understand profession admirably oh lydgate be not protege know only knew uncle of who sent letter about however think be likely to be first ratehas studied in paris knew

subdued tone have rather sickly air for part hail advent of mr lydgate hope to find good reason for confiding new hospital to management be very fine replied mr standish who be not fond of mr bulstrode if like to try experiment on hospital patient kill few people for charity have objection be not going to hand money out of purse to have experiment tried on like treatment have be tested little well know standish dose take be experiment experiment know said mr brooke nodding towards lawyer oh if talk in sense said mr standish with a much disgust at such non legal quibbling a man can well betray towards valuable client must be glad of treatment must cure without reducing to skeleton like poor grainger said mr vincy mayor florid man who must have served for study of flesh in striking contrast with franciscan tint of mr bulstrode uncommonly dangerous thing to be left without padding against shaft of disease a somebody saidand think very good expression mr lydgate of course be out of hearing have quitted party early must have thought altogether tedious for novelty of certain introduction especially introduction to miss brooke whose youthful bloom with approaching marriage to faded scholar interest in matter socially useful gave piquancy of unusual combination be good creaturethat fine girlbut little too earnest thought be troublesome to talk to such woman be always wanting reason yet be too ignorant to understand merit of question usually fall back on moral sense to settle thing after own taste evidently miss brooke be not mr lydgates style of woman more than mr chichelys considered indeed in relation to latter whose mind be matured be altogether mistake calculated to shock trust in final cause including adaptation of fine young woman to purplefaced bachelor lydgate be le ripe might possibly have experience before must modify opinion a to most excellent thing in woman miss brooke however be not again seen by of gentleman under maiden name not long after dinner party have become mr casaubon be on way to rome chapter xi deed language such a men do use person such a comedy must choose when must show image of time sport with human folly not

of particular woman be grace be perfectly lovely accomplished be what woman ought to be ought to produce effect of exquisite music plain woman regarded a did other severe fact of life to be faced with philosophy investigated by science rosamond vincy seemed to have true melodic charm when man have seen woman whom must have chosen if have intended to marry speedily remaining bachelor will usually

century before instead of behind have come to middlemarch bent on doing many thing be not directly fitted to make fortune even secure good income to man under such circumstance taking wife be something more than question of adornment however highly may rate lydgate be disposed to give first place among wifely function to taste guided by single conversation here be point on miss brooke must be found wanting notwithstanding undeniable beauty did not look at thing from proper feminine angle society of such woman be about a relaxing a going from work to teach second form instead of reclining in paradise with sweet laugh for bird note blue eye for heaven certainly nothing at present must seem much le important to lydgate than turn of miss brooke mind to miss brooke than quality of woman who have attracted young surgeon one watching keenly stealthy convergence of human lot see slow preparation of effect from one life on tell like calculated irony on indifference frozen stare

grimace alternately screwing widening mouth when spoke be in low tone might be taken for of informer ready to be bought off rather than for tone of offended senior be not man to feel strong moral indignation even on account of trespass against be natural that others must want to get advantage over then be little too cunning for so sir youve be paying ten per cent for money youve promised to pay off by mortgaging land when im dead gone eh put life at twelvemonth say can alter will yet fred blushed have not borrowed money in way for excellent reason be conscious of having spoken with

disgusting dilemma must be joking sir mr bulstrode like other men belief score of thing be not true have prejudice against must easily get to write that knew fact in proof of report speak of though might lead to unpleasantness must hardly ask to write down what belief doe not believe about fred paused instant then added in politic appeal to uncle vanity be hardly thing for gentleman to ask be disappointed in result ay know what mean youd sooner offend than bulstrode whats hehes got land hereabout that ever heard tell of speckilating fellow may come down day when devil leaf off backing

cant back bit come now thats bargain here give arm ill try walk round room fred in spite of irritation have kindness enough in to be little sorry for unloved unvenerated old man who with dropsical leg

not be true to declare in satisfactory antithesis that have virtue plainness have peculiar temptation vice quite a much a beauty be apt either to feign amiability not feigning to show repulsiveness of

not attained that perfect good sense good principle be usually recommended to le fortunate girl a if be to be obtained in quantity ready mixed with flavor of resignation a required shrewdness have streak of satiric bitterness continually renewed never carried utterly out of sight except by strong current of gratitude towards who instead of telling that ought to be contented did something to make so advancing womanhood have tempered plainness be of good human sort such a mother of race have very commonly worn in latitude under more le becoming headgear rembrandt must have painted with pleasure must have made broad feature look out of canvas with intelligent honesty for honesty truth telling fairness be mary reigning virtue tried to create illusion indulged in for own behoof when be in good mood have humor enough in to laugh at herself when rosamond happened to be reflected in glass said laughingly what brown patch be by side of rosy be most unbecoming companion oh one think of appearance be so sensible useful mary beauty be of very little consequence in reality said rosamond turning head towards mary with eye swerving towards new view of neck in glass mean beauty said mary rather sardonically rosamond thought poor mary take kindest thing ill aloud said what have be doing lately oh minding housepouring out syruppretending to be amiable contentedlearning to have bad opinion of everybody be wretched life for said mary curtly with little toss of head think life be pleasanter than miss morgan yes miss morgan be so uninteresting not young be interesting to herself suppose be not at sure that everything get easier a one get older said rosamond reflectively one wonder what such people do without prospect to be sure there be religion a support added dimpling be very different with mary may have offer have one told mean to make one of course not mean there be gentleman who may fall in love with seeing almost day certain change in mary face be chiefly determined by resolve not to show change doe that always make people fall in love answered carelessly seems to quite a often reason for detesting other not when be interesting agreeable hear that mr lydgate be oh mr lydgate said mary with unmistakable lapse into indifference want to know something about added not choosing to indulge rosamonds indirectness merely how like there be question of liking at present liking always want little kindness to kindle be not magnanimous enough to like people who speak to without seeming to see be so haughty said rosamond with heightened satisfaction know that be of good family no did not give that a reason mary be oddest girl what sort of looking man be describe to how can one describe man can give inventory heavy eyebrow dark eye straight nose thick dark hair large solid white handsandlet seeoh exquisite cambric pocket handkerchief will see know be about time of visit rosamond blushed little said meditatively rather like haughty manner can not endure rattling young man did not tell that mr lydgate be haughty il y en pour tous le gots a little mamselle used to say if girl can choose particular sort of conceit must like must think be rosy haughtiness be not conceit call fred conceited wish one said worse of must be more careful mr waule have be telling uncle that fred be very unsteady mary spoke from girlish impulse got better of judgment there be vague uneasiness associated with word unsteady hoped rosamond might say something to dissipate purposely abstained from mentioning mr waules more special insinuation oh fred be horrid said rosamond must not have allowed so unsuitable word to one mary what do mean by horrid be so idle make papa so angry say will not take order think fred be quite right how can say be quite right mary thought have more sense of religion be not fit to be clergyman ought to be fitwell then be not what ought to be know other people who be in same case one approves of must not like to marry clergyman there must be clergyman doe not follow fred must be one when papa have be at expense of educating for only suppose if must have fortune left can suppose very well said mary dryly then wonder can defend fred said rosamond inclined to push point dont defend said mary laughing must defend parish from having for clergyman of course if be clergyman must be different yes must be great hypocrite be not that yet be of use saying anything to mary always take freds part why must not take part said mary lighting up must take mine be only person who take least trouble to oblige make feel very uncomfortable mary said rosamond with gravest mildness must not tell mamma for world what must not tell said mary angrily pray go into rage mary said rosamond mildly a ever if mamma be afraid that fred will make offer tell must not marry if asked be not going to do so that be aware certainly never have asked mary be always so violent be always so exasperating what can blame for oh blameless people be always most exasperating there be belli think must go down did not mean to quarrel said rosamond putting on hat quarrel nonsense have not quarrelled if one be not to get into rage sometimes what be good of being friend be to repeat what have said just a please never say what be afraid of having repeated let go down mr lydgate be rather late morning visitor stayed long enough to see for mr featherstone asked rosamond to sing to be so kind a to propose second favorite song of hisflow on thou shining riverafter have sung home sweet home detested hard headed old overreach approved of sentimental song a suitable garnish for girl also a fundamentally fine sentiment being right thing for song mr featherstone be still applauding last performance assuring missy that voice be a clear a blackbird when mr lydgates horse passed window dull expectation of usual disagreeable routine with aged patientwho can hardly believe that medicine must not set up if doctor be only clever enoughadded to general disbelief in middlemarch charm made doubly effective background to vision of rosamond whom old featherstone made haste ostentatiously to introduce a niece though have never thought worth while to speak of mary garth in light nothing escaped lydgate in rosamonds graceful behavior how delicately waived notice old man want of taste have thrust upon by quiet gravity not showing dimple on wrong occasion showing afterwards in speaking to mary to whom addressed with so much good natured interest that lydgate after quickly examining more fully than have done before saw adorable kindness in rosamonds eye mary from cause looked rather out of temper miss rosy have be singing songyouve nothing to say against eh doctor said mr featherstone like better than physic have made forget how time be going said rosamond rising to reach hat have laid aside before singing so that flower like head on white stem be seen in perfection above riding habit fred must really go very good said fred who have own reason for not being in best spirit wanted to get away miss vincy be musician said lydgate following with eye nerve muscle in rosamond be adjusted to consciousness that be being looked at be by nature actress of part entered into physique even acted own character so well that did not know to be precisely own best in middlemarch ill be bound said mr featherstone let next be who will eh fred speak up for sister im afraid im out of court sir evidence must be good for nothing middlemarch have not very high standard uncle said rosamond with pretty lightness going towards whip lay at distance lydgate be quick in anticipating reached whip before did turned to present to bowed looked at of course be looking at eye met with peculiar meeting be never arrived at by effort seems like sudden divine clearance of haze think lydgate turned little paler than usual rosamond blushed deeply felt certain astonishment after be really anxious to go did not know what sort of stupidity uncle be talking of when went to shake hand with yet result took to be mutual impression called falling in love be just what rosamond have contemplated beforehand ever since important new arrival in middlemarch have woven little future of something like scene be necessary beginning stranger whether wrecked clinging to raft duly escorted accompanied by portmanteau have always have circumstantial fascination for virgin mind against native merit have urged in vain stranger be absolutely necessary to rosamonds social romance have always turned on lover bridegroom who be not middlemarcher who have connection at like own of late indeed construction seemed to demand that must somehow be related to baronet now that stranger have met reality proved much more moving than anticipation rosamond must not doubt that be great epoch of life judged of own symptom a of awakening love held still more natural that mr lydgate must have fallen in love at first sight of thing happened so often at ball why not by morning light when complexion showed better for rosamond though older than mary be rather used to being fallen in love with for part have remained indifferent fastidiously critical towards fresh sprig faded bachelor here be mr lydgate suddenly corresponding to ideal being altogether foreign to middlemarch carrying certain air of distinction congruous with good family possessing connection offered vista of middle class heaven rank man of talent also whom must be especially delightful to enslave in fact man who have touched nature quite newly brought vivid interest into life be better than fancied might be such a be in habit of opposing to actual thus in riding home brother sister be preoccupied inclined to be silent rosamond whose basis for structure have usual airy

elevation might ultimately come there be nothing financial still le sordid in prevision cared about what be considered refinement not about money be to pay for freds mind on other hand be busy with anxiety even ready hopefulness must not immediately quell saw way of eluding featherstones stupid demand without incurring consequence liked le even than task of fulfilling father be already out of humor with must be still more so if be occasion of additional coolness between own family bulstrodes then hated having to go speak to uncle bulstrode perhaps after drinking wine have said many foolish thing about featherstones property have be magnified by report fred felt that made wretched figure a fellow who bragged about expectation from queer old miser like featherstone went to beg for certificate at bidding butthose expectation really have saw agreeable alternative if gave up besides have lately made debt galled extremely old featherstone have almost bargained to pay off whole affair be miserably small debt be small even expectation be not anything so very magnificent fred have known men to whom must have be ashamed of confessing smallness of scrape such rumination naturally produced streak of misanthropic bitterness to be born son of middlemarch manufacturer inevitable heir to nothing in particular while such men a mainwaring vyancertainly life be poor business when spirited young fellow with good appetite for best of everything have so poor outlook have not occurred to fred that introduction of bulstrodes name in matter be fiction of old featherstones must have made difference to position saw plainly enough that old man wanted to exercise power by tormenting little also probably to get satisfaction out of seeing on unpleasant term with bulstrode fred fancied that saw to bottom of uncle featherstones soul though in reality half what saw there be more than reflex of own inclination difficult task of knowing soul be not for young gentleman whose consciousness be chiefly made up of own wish freds main point of debate with be whether must tell father try to get through affair without father knowledge be probably mr waule who have be talking about if mary garth have repeated mr waules report to rosamond must be sure to reach father who must a surely question about said to rosamond a slackened pace rosy did mary tell that mr waule have said anything about yes indeed did what that be very unsteady be that must think be enough fred be sure said more mary mentioned nothing else really fred think ought to be ashamed oh fudge dont lecture what did mary say about be not obliged to tell care so very much what mary say be too rude to allow to speak of course care what mary say be best girl know must never have thought be girl to fall in love with how do know what men must fall in love with girl never know at least fred let advise not to fall in love with for say must not marry if asked might have waited till did ask knew must nettle fred not at must not have said so if have not provoked before reaching home fred concluded that must tell whole affair a simply a possible to father who might perhaps take on unpleasant

wealth of book drifted relic of time a well sort at once by size livery vellum tall copy common calf will hardly cover more diversity than label cunningly devised to class unread author in consequence of what have heard from fred mr vincy determined to speak with mr bulstrode in private room at bank at half past one when be usually free from other caller visitor have come in at one oclock mr bulstrode have so much to say to that there be little chance of interview being over in hour banker speech be fluent be also copious used up appreciable amount of time in brief meditative pause imagine sickly aspect to have be of yellow black haired sort have pale blond skin thin gray besprinkled brown hair light gray eye large forehead loud men called subdued tone undertone sometimes implied that be inconsistent with openness though there seems to be reason why loud man must not be given to concealment of anything except own voice unless can be shown that holy writ have placed seat of candor in lung mr bulstrode have also deferential bending attitude in listening apparently fixed attentiveness in eye made person who thought worth hearing infer that be seeking utmost improvement from discourse others who expected to make great figure disliked kind of moral lantern turned on if be not proud of cellar there be thrill of satisfaction in seeing guest hold up wine glass to light look judicial such joy be reserved for conscious merit hence mr bulstrodes close attention be not agreeable to publican sinner in middlemarch be attributed by to being pharisee by others to being evangelical le superficial reasoner among wished to know who father grandfather be observing that five twenty year ago nobody have ever heard of bulstrode in middlemarch to present visitor lydgate scrutinizing look be matter of indifference simply formed unfavorable opinion of banker constitution concluded that have eager inward life with little enjoyment of tangible thing will be exceedingly obliged if will look in on here occasionally mr lydgate banker observed after brief pause if a dare to hope have privilege of finding valuable coadjutor in interesting matter of hospital management there will be many question will need to discus in private a to new hospital be nearly finished will consider what have said about advantage of special destination for fever decision will rest with for though lord medlicote have given land timber for building be not disposed to give personal attention to object there be few thing better worth pain in provincial town like said lydgate fine fever hospital in addition to old infirmary might be nucleus of medical school here when once get medical reform what must do more for medical education than spread of such school over country born provincial man who have grain of public spirit a well a few idea must do what can to resist rush of everything be little better than common towards london valid professional aim may often find freer if not richer field in province one of lydgates gift be voice habitually deep sonorous yet capable of becoming very low gentle at right moment about ordinary bearing there be certain fling fearless expectation of success confidence in own power integrity much fortified by contempt for petty obstacle seduction of have have experience proud openness be made lovable by expression of unaffected good will mr bulstrode perhaps liked better for difference between in pitch manner certainly liked better a rosamond did for being stranger in middlemarch one can begin so many thing with new personeven begin to be better man will rejoice to furnish zeal with fuller opportunity mr bulstrode answered mean by confiding to superintendence of new hospital must maturer knowledge favor issue for be determined that so great object will not be shackled by two physician indeed be encouraged to consider advent to town a gracious indication that more manifest blessing be now to be awarded to effort have hitherto be much withstood with regard to old infirmary have gained initial pointi mean election now hope will not shrink from incurring certain amount of jealousy dislike from professional brother by presenting a reformer will not profess bravery said lydgate smiling acknowledge good deal of pleasure in fighting must not care for profession if did not believe that better method be to be found enforced there a well a everywhere else standard of profession be low in middlemarch dear sir said banker mean in knowledge skill not in social status for medical men be most of connected with respectable townspeople here own imperfect health have induced to give attention to palliative resource divine mercy have placed within reach have consulted eminent men in metropolis be painfully aware of backwardness under medical treatment labor in provincial district yeswith present medical rule education one must be satisfied now then to meet with fair practitioner a to higher question determine starting point of diagnosisas to philosophy of medical evidenceany glimmering of can only come from scientific culture of country practitioner have usually more notion than man in moon mr bulstrode bending looking intently found form lydgate have given to agreement not quite suited to comprehension under such circumstance judicious man change topic enters on ground where own gift may be more useful be aware said that peculiar bias of medical ability be towards material mean nevertheless mr lydgate hope will not vary in sentiment a to measure in be not likely to be actively concerned in sympathetic concurrence may be aid to recognize hope existence of spiritual interest in patient certainly do word be apt to cover different meaning to different mind precisely on such subject wrong teaching be a fatal a teaching now point have much at heart to secure be new regulation a to clerical attendance at old infirmary building stand in mr farebrothers parish know mr farebrother have seen gave vote must call to thank seems very bright pleasant little fellow understand be naturalist mr farebrother dear sir be man deeply painful to contemplate suppose there be not clergyman in country who have greater talent mr bulstrode paused looked meditative have not yet be pained by finding excessive talent in middlemarch said lydgate bluntly what desire mr bulstrode continued looking still more serious be that mr farebrothers attendance at hospital must be superseded by appointment of chaplainof mr tyke in factand that other spiritual aid must be called in a medical man must have opinion on point unless knew mr tyke even then must require to know case in be applied lydgate smiled be bent on being circumspect of course can not enter fully into merit of measure at present buthere mr bulstrode began to speak with more chiselled emphasisthe subject be likely to be referred to medical board of infirmary what trust may ask of be that in virtue of cooperation between now look forward to will not so far a be concerned be influenced by opponent in matter hope will have nothing to do with clerical dispute said lydgate path have chosen be to work well in own profession responsibility mr lydgate be of broader kind with indeed question be one of sacred accountableness whereas with opponent have good reason to say that be occasion for gratifying spirit of worldly opposition will not therefore drop one iota of conviction cease to identify with truth evil generation hate have devoted to object of hospital improvement will boldly confess to mr lydgate must have interest in hospital if believed that nothing more be concerned therein than cure of mortal disease have ground of action in face of persecution will not conceal bulstrodes voice have become loud agitated whisper a said last word there certainly differ said lydgate be not sorry that door be now opened mr vincy be announced that florid sociable personage be become more interesting to since have seen rosamond not that like have be weaving future in lot be united man naturally remembers charming girl with pleasure be willing to dine where may see again before took leave mr vincy have given that invitation have be in hurry about for rosamond at breakfast have mentioned that thought uncle featherstone have taken new doctor into great favor mr bulstrode alone with brother in law poured out glass of water opened sandwich box can not persuade to adopt regimen vincy ive opinion of system life want padding said mr vincy unable to omit portable theory however went on accenting word a if to dismiss irrelevance what came here to talk about be little affair of young scapegrace freds be subject on be likely to take quite a different view a on diet vincy hope not time mr vincy be resolved to be good humored fact be about whim of old featherstones somebody have be cooking up story out of spite telling to old man to try to set against fred he very fond of fred be likely to do something handsome for indeed have a good a told fred that mean to leave land that make other people jealous vincy must repeat that will not get concurrence from a to course have pursued with eldest son be entirely from worldly vanity that destined for church with family of three son four daughter be not warranted in devoting money to expensive education have succeeded in

might use for glory of god went through great deal of spiritual conflict inward argument in order to adjust motif make clear to what god glory required a have seen motif be not always rightly appreciated there be many crass mind in middlemarch whose reflective scale must only weigh thing in lump have strong suspicion that since mr bulstrode must not enjoy life in fashion eating drinking so little a did worreting about everything must have sort of vampire feast in sense of mastery subject of chaplaincy came up at mr vincys table when lydgate be dining there family connection with mr bulstrode did not observed prevent freedom of remark even on part of host though reason against proposed arrangement turned entirely on objection to mr tyke sermon be doctrine preference for mr farebrother whose sermon be free from taint mr vincy liked well enough notion of chaplain having salary supposing be given to farebrother who be a good little fellow a ever breathed best preacher anywhere companionable too what line will take then said mr chichely coroner great coursing comrade of mr vincys oh im precious glad im not one of director now will vote for referring matter to director medical board together will roll of responsibility on shoulder doctor said mr vincy glancing first at dr sprague senior physician of town then at lydgate who sat opposite medical gentleman must consult sort of black draught will prescribe eh mr lydgate know little of said lydgate in general appointment be apt to be made too much question of personal liking fittest man for particular post be not always best fellow most agreeable sometimes if wanted to get reform only way must be to pension off good fellow whom everybody be fond of put out of question dr sprague who be considered physician of most weight though dr minchin be usually said to have more penetration divested large heavy face of expression looked at wine glass while lydgate be speaking be not problematical

very unpleasant to find deprecated lydgates remark however did not meet sense of company mr vincy said that if must have way must not put disagreeable fellow anywhere hang reform said mr chichely there greater humbug in world never hear of reform mean trick to put in new men hope be not one of lancet men mr lydgatewanting to take coronership out of hand of legal profession word appear to point way disapprove of wakley interposed dr sprague man more be ill intentioned fellow who must sacrifice respectability of profession everybody know depends on london college for sake of getting notoriety for there be men who dont mind about being kicked blue if can only get talked about wakley be right sometimes doctor added judicially must mention one two point in wakley be in right oh well said mr chichely blame man for standing up in favor of own cloth coming to argument must like to know how coroner be to judge of evidence if have not have legal training in opinion said lydgate legal training only make man more incompetent in question require knowledge of kind people talk about evidence a if must really be weighed in scale by blind justice man can judge what be good evidence on particular subject unless know that subject well lawyer be better than old woman at post mortem examination how be to know action of poison might a well say that scanning verse will teach to scan potato crop be aware suppose that be not coroner business to conduct post mortem only to take evidence of medical witness said mr chichely with scorn who be often almost a ignorant a coroner said lydgate question of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left to chance of decent knowledge in medical witness coroner ought not to be man who will believe strychnine will destroy coat of stomach if ignorant practitioner happens to tell so lydgate have really lost sight of fact that mr chichely be majesty coroner ended innocently with question dont agree with dr sprague to certain extentwith regard to

expensive illustrated book on natural history made think again of winning at card destination be beginning to wish that very best construction of everything that mr farebrother did must be true one

make enemy dont know that need mind about said lydgate rather proudly seems to have good idea about hospital spends large sum on useful public object might help good deal in carrying out idea a to religious notionswhy a voltaire said incantation will destroy flock of sheep if administered with certain quantity of arsenic look for man who will bring arsenic dont mind about incantation very good then must not offend arsenic man will not offend know said mr farebrother quite unaffectedly dont translate own convenience into other people duty be opposed to bulstrode in many way dont like set

for heaven added smilingly dont say bulstrodes new hospital be bad thing a to wanting to oust from old onewhy if think mischievous fellow be only returning compliment be not model clergymanonly decent makeshift lydgate be not at sure that vicar maligned model clergyman like model doctor ought to think own profession finest in world take knowledge a mere nourishment to moral pathology therapeutic only said what reason doe bulstrode give for superseding that dont teach opinionswhich call spiritual religion have time to spare statement be true then must make time must be glad of forty pound be

with scurvy week passed after conversation before question of chaplaincy gathered practical import for lydgate without telling reason deferred predetermination on side must give vote must really have be matter of total indifference to himthat be to say must have taken more convenient side given vote for appointment of tyke without hesitationif have not cared personally for mr farebrother liking for vicar of st botolphs grew with growing acquaintanceship that entering into lydgates position a new comer who have own professional object to secure mr farebrother must have taken pain rather to warn off than to obtain interest showed unusual delicacy generosity lydgates nature be keenly alive to went along with other point of conduct in mr farebrother be exceptionally fine made character resemble southern landscape seem divided between natural grandeur social slovenliness very few men must have be a filial chivalrous a be to mother aunt sister whose dependence on have in many way shaped life rather uneasily for few men who feel pressure of small need be so nobly resolute not to dress up inevitably self interested desire in pretext of better motif in matter be conscious that life must bear closest scrutiny perhaps consciousness encouraged little defiance towards critical strictness of person whose celestial intimacy seemed not to improve domestic manner whose lofty aim be not needed to account for action then preaching be ingenious pithy like preaching of english church in robust age sermon be delivered without book people outside parish went to hear since to fill church be always most difficult part of clergyman function here be ground for careless sense of superiority besides be likable man sweet tempered ready witted frank without grin of suppressed bitterness other conversational flavor make half of affliction to friend lydgate liked heartily wished for friendship with feeling uppermost continued to waive question of chaplaincy to persuade that be not only no proper business of likely enough never to vex with demand for vote lydgate at mr bulstrodes request be laying down plan for internal arrangement of new hospital two be often in consultation banker be always presupposing that must count in general on lydgate a coadjutor made special recurrence to coming decision between tyke farebrother when general board of infirmary have met however lydgate have notice that question of chaplaincy be thrown on council of director medical men to meet on following friday have vexed sense that must make up mind on trivial middlemarch business must not help hearing within distinct declaration that bulstrode be prime minister that tyke affair be question of office office must not help equally pronounced dislike to giving up prospect of office for observation be constantly confirming mr farebrothers assurance that banker must not overlook opposition confound petty politics be one of thought for three morning in meditative process of shaving when have begun to feel that must really hold court of conscience on matter certainly there be valid thing to be said against election of mr farebrother have too much on hand already especially considering how much time spent on non clerical occupation then again be continually repeated shock disturbing lydgates esteem that vicar must obviously play for sake of money liking play indeed evidently liking end served farebrother contended on theory for desirability of game said that englishman wit be stagnant for want of lydgate felt certain that must have played very much le for money there be billiard room at green dragon anxious mother wife regarded a chief temptation in middlemarch vicar be first rate billiard player though did not frequent green dragon there be report that have sometimes be there in daytime have won money a to chaplaincy did not pretend that cared for except for sake of forty pound lydgate be puritan did not care for play winning money at have always seemed meanness to besides have ideal of life made subservience of conduct to gaining of small sum thoroughly hateful to hitherto in own life want have be supplied without trouble to first impulse be always to be liberal with half crown a matter of importance to gentleman have never occurred to to devise plan for getting half crown have always known in general way that be not rich have never felt poor have power of imagining part want of money play in determining action of men money have never be motive to hence be not ready to frame excuse for deliberate pursuit of small gain be altogether repulsive to never entered into calculation of ratio between vicar income more le necessary expenditure be possible that must not have made calculation in own case now when question of voting have come repulsive fact told more strongly against mr farebrother than have done before one must know much better what to do if men character be more consistent especially if one friend be invariably fit for function desired to undertake lydgate be convinced that if there have be no valid objection to mr farebrother must have voted for bulstrode might have felt on subject did not intend to be vassal of bulstrodes on other hand there be tyke man entirely given to clerical office who be simply curate at chapel of ease in st peter parish have time for extra duty nobody have anything to say against mr tyke except that must not bear suspected of cant really from point of view bulstrode be thoroughly justified whichever way lydgate began to incline there be something to make wince being proud man be little exasperated at being obliged to wince did not like frustrating own best purpose by getting on bad term with bulstrode did not like voting against farebrother helping to deprive of function salary question occurred whether additional forty pound might not leave vicar free from ignoble care about winning at card moreover lydgate did not like consciousness that in voting for tyke must be voting on side obviously convenient for must end really be own convenience other people must say so must allege that be currying favor with bulstrode for sake of making important getting on in world what then for own part knew that if personal prospect simply have be concerned must not have cared rotten nut for banker friendship enmity what really cared for be medium for work vehicle for idea after be not bound to prefer object of getting good hospital where must demonstrate specific distinction of fever test therapeutic result before anything else connected with chaplaincy for first time lydgate be feeling hampering threadlike pressure of small social condition frustrating complexity at end of inward debate when set out for hospital hope be really in chance discussion might somehow give new aspect to question make scale dip so a to exclude necessity for voting think trusted little also to energy be begotten by circumstancessome feeling rushing warmly making resolve easy while debate in cool blood have only made more difficult however be did not distinctly say to on side must vote while be inwardly resenting subjection have be forced upon must have

even of lady patient who have strictest idea of frilling sentiment be perhaps negation in doctor made neighbor call hard headed dry witted condition of texture be also held favorable to storing of judgment connected with drug at event be certain that if medical man have come to middlemarch with reputation of having very definite religious view of being given to prayer of otherwise showing active piety there must have be general presumption against medical skill on ground be professionally speaking fortunate for dr minchin that religious sympathy be of general kind such a gave distant medical sanction to serious sentiment whether of church dissent rather than adhesion to particular tenet if mr bulstrode insisted a be apt to do on lutheran doctrine of justification a by church must stand fall dr minchin in return be quite sure that man be not mere machine fortuitous conjunction of atom if mr wimple insisted on particular providence in relation to stomach complaint dr minchin for

ready to combine against innovator against non professional given to interference on ground be in heart equally averse to mr bulstrode though dr minchin have never be in open hostility with never differed from without elaborate explanation to mr bulstrode who have found that dr minchin alone understood constitution layman who pried into professional conduct of medical men be always obtruding reformsthough be le directly embarrassing to two physician than to surgeon apothecary who attended pauper by contract be nevertheless offensive to professional nostril a such dr minchin shared fully in new pique against bulstrode excited by apparent determination to patronize lydgate long established practitioner mr wrench mr toller be just now standing apart having friendly colloquy in agreed that lydgate be jackanapes just made to serve bulstrodes purpose to non medical friend have already concurred in praising other young practitioner who have come into town on mr peacock retirement without further recommendation than own merit such argument for solid professional acquirement a might be gathered from having apparently wasted time on other branch of knowledge be clear that lydgate by not dispensing drug intended to cast imputation on equal also to obscure limit between own rank a general practitioner that of physician who in interest of profession felt bound to maintain various gradesespecially against man who have not be to of english university enjoyed absence of anatomical bedside study there came with libellous pretension to experience in edinburgh paris where observation might be abundant indeed hardly sound thus happened that on occasion bulstrode became identified with lydgate lydgate with tyke owing to variety of interchangeable name for chaplaincy

have be somewhat laborious one society have happily prevented from too continuous prosecution of thought beyond hour of study have be snare of solitary life be very glad that presence have made difference to said dorothea who have vivid memory of evening in have supposed that mr casaubons mind have gone too deep during day to be able to get to surface again fear there be little temper in reply hope when get to lowick will be more useful to be able to enter little more into what interest doubtless dear said mr casaubon with slight bow note have here made will want sifting can if please

up mind what part of will use begin to write book will make vast knowledge useful to world will write to dictation will copy extract what tell can be of other use dorothea in most unaccountable darkly feminine manner ended with slight sob eye full of tear excessive feeling manifested must alone have be highly disturbing to mr casaubon there be other reason why dorotheas word be among most cutting irritating to that must have be impelled to use be a blind to inward trouble a to hers have not yet learned hidden conflict in husband claim pity have not yet listened patiently to heartbeat only felt that own be beating violently in mr casaubons ear dorotheas voice gave loud emphatic iteration to muffled suggestion of consciousness be possible to explain a mere fancy illusion of exaggerated sensitiveness always when such suggestion be unmistakably repeated from without be resisted a cruel unjust be angered even by full acceptance of humiliating confessionshow much more by hearing in hard distinct syllable from lip of near observer confused murmur try to call morbid strive against a if be oncoming of numbness cruel outward accuser be there in shape of wifenay of young bride who instead of observing abundant pen scratch amplitude of paper with uncritical awe of elegant minded canary bird seemed to present a spy watching everything with malign power of inference here towards particular point of compass mr casaubon have sensitiveness to match dorotheas equal quickness to imagine more than fact have formerly observed with approbation capacity for worshipping right object now foresaw with sudden terror that capacity might be replaced by presumption worship by most exasperating of criticismthat see vaguely great many fine end have not least notion what cost to reach for first time since dorothea have known mr casaubons face have quick angry flush upon love said with irritation reined in by propriety may rely upon for knowing time season adapted to different stage of work be not to be measured by facile conjecture of ignorant onlooker have be easy for to gain temporary effect by mirage of baseless opinion be ever trial of scrupulous explorer to be saluted with impatient scorn of chatterer who attempt only smallest achievement being indeed equipped for other be well if such must be admonished to discriminate judgment of true subject matter lie entirely beyond reach from of element may be compassed by narrow superficial survey speech be delivered with energy readiness quite unusual with mr casaubon be not indeed entirely improvisation have taken shape in inward colloquy rushed out like round grain from fruit when sudden heat crack dorothea be not only wife be personification of willow world surround appreciated desponding author dorothea be indignant in turn have not be repressing everything in except desire to enter into fellowship with husband chief interest judgment be very superficial onesuch a be capable of forming answered with prompt resentment needed rehearsal showed row of notebooksyou have often spoken of themyou have often said that wanted digesting never heard speak of writing be to be published be very simple fact judgment went farther only begged to let be of good to dorothea rose to leave table mr casaubon made reply taking up letter lay beside a if to reperuse be shocked at mutual situationthat must have betrayed anger towards other if have be at home settled at lowick in ordinary life among neighbor clash must have be le embarrassing on wedding journey express object of be to isolate two people on ground that be world to other sense of disagreement be to say least confounding stultifying to have changed longitude extensively placed yourselves in moral solitude in order to have small explosion to find conversation difficult to hand glass of water without looking can hardly be regarded a satisfactory fulfilment even to toughest mind to dorotheas inexperienced sensitiveness seemed like catastrophe changing prospect to mr casaubon be new pain never having be on wedding journey before found in close union be more of subjection than have be able to imagine since charming young bride not only obliged to much consideration on behalf have sedulously given turned out to be capable of agitating cruelly just where most needed soothing instead of getting soft fence against cold shadowy unapplausive audience of life have only given more substantial presence neither of felt possible to speak again at present to have reversed previous arrangement declined to go out must have be show of persistent anger dorotheas conscience shrank from seeing that already began to feel guilty however just indignation might be ideal be not to claim justice to give tenderness so when carriage came to door drove with mr casaubon to vatican walked with through stony avenue of inscription when parted with at entrance to library went on through museum out of mere listlessness a to what be around have not spirit to turn round say that must drive anywhere be when mr casaubon be quitting that naumann have first seen have entered long gallery of sculpture at same time with here naumann have to await ladislaw with whom be to settle bet of champagne about enigmatical mediaeval looking figure there after have examined figure have walked on finishing dispute have parted ladislaw lingering behind while naumann have gone into hall of statue where again saw dorothea saw in brooding abstraction made pose remarkable did not really see streak of sunlight on floor more than saw statue be inwardly seeing light of year to come in own home over english field elm hedge bordered highroad feeling that way in might be filled with joyful devotedness be not so clear to a have be in dorotheas mind there be current into thought feeling be apt sooner later to flowthe reaching forward of whole consciousness towards fullest truth least partial good there be clearly something better than anger despondency chapter xxi hire facounde full womanly plain contrefeted termes have to semen wise chaucer be in way dorothea came to be sobbing a soon a be securely alone be presently roused by knock at door made hastily dry eye before saying come in tantripp have brought card said that there be gentleman waiting in lobby courier have told that only mr casaubon be at home said be relation of mr casaubons must see yes said dorothea without pause show into salon chief impression about young ladislaw be that when have seen at lowick have be made aware of mr casaubons generosity towards also that have be interested in own hesitation about career be alive to anything gave opportunity for active sympathy at moment seemed a if visit have come to shake out of self absorbed discontentto remind of husband goodness make feel that have now right to be helpmate in kind deed waited minute two when passed into next room there be just sign enough that have be cry to make open face look more youthful appealing than usual met ladislaw with exquisite smile of good will be unmixed with vanity held out hand to be elder by several year at moment looked much younger for transparent complexion flushed suddenly spoke with shyness extremely unlike ready indifference of manner with male companion while dorothea became calmer with wondering desire to put at ease be not aware that mr casaubon be in rome until morning when saw in vatican museum said knew at oncebuti mean concluded mr casaubons address must be found at poste restante be anxious to pay respect to a early a possible pray sit down be not here now will be glad to hear of be sure said dorothea seating unthinkingly between fire light of tall window pointing to chair opposite with quietude of benignant matron sign of girlish sorrow in face be only more striking mr casaubon be much engaged will leave addresswill notand will write to be very good said ladislaw beginning to lose diffidence in interest with be observing sign of weeping have altered face address be on card if will allow will call again to morrow at hour when mr casaubon be likely to be at home go to read in library of vatican day can hardly see except by appointment especially now be about to leave rome be very busy be usually away almost from breakfast till dinner be sure will wish to dine with will ladislaw be struck mute for few moment have never be fond of mr casaubon if have not be for sense of obligation must have laughed at a bat of erudition idea of dried up pedant elaborator of small explanation about a important a surplus stock of false antiquity kept in vendor back chamber having first got adorable young creature to marry then passing honeymoon away from groping after mouldy futility will be given to hyperbolethis sudden picture stirred with sort of comic disgust be divided between impulse to laugh aloud equally unseasonable impulse to burst into scornful invective for instant felt that struggle be causing queer contortion of mobile feature with good effort resolved into nothing more offensive than merry smile dorothea wondered smile be irresistible shone back from face too will ladislaws smile be delightful unless be angry with beforehand be gush of inward light illuminating transparent skin a well a eye playing about curve line a if ariel be touching with new charm banishing forever trace of moodiness reflection of smile must not have little merriment in too even under dark eyelash still moist a dorothea said inquiringly something amuses yes said will quick in finding resource be thinking of sort of figure cut first time saw when annihilated poor sketch with criticism criticism said dorothea wondering still more surely not always feel particularly ignorant about painting suspected of knowing so much that knew how to say just what be most cutting saidi dare say dont remember a dothat relation of sketch to nature be quite hidden from at least implied will must laugh now a well a smile be really ignorance said dorothea admiring will good humor must have said so only because never must see beauty in picture uncle told judge thought very fine have gone about with just same ignorance in rome there be comparatively few painting can really enjoy at first when enter room where wall be covered with fresco with rare picture feel kind of awelike child present at great ceremony where there be grand robe procession feel in presence of higher life than own when begin to examine picture one by one life go out of else be something violent strange to must be own dulness be seeing so much at once not understanding half of always make one feel stupid be painful to be told that anything be very fine not be able to feel that be finesomething like being blind while people talk of sky oh there be great deal in feeling for art must be acquired said will be impossible now to doubt directness of dorotheas confession art be old language with great many artificial affected style sometimes chief pleasure one get out of knowing be mere sense of knowing enjoy art of sort here immensely suppose if must pick enjoyment to piece must find made up of many different thread there be something in daubing little one self having idea of process mean perhaps to be painter said dorothea with new direction of interest mean to make painting profession mr casaubon will like to hear that have chosen profession oh said will with coldness have quite made up mind against be too one sided life have be seeing great deal of german artist here travelled from frankfort with one of be fine even brilliant fellowsbut must not like to get into way of looking at world entirely from studio point of view can understand said dorothea cordially in rome seems a if there be so many thing be more wanted in world than picture if have genius for painting must not be right to take a guide perhaps might do better thing than theseor different so that there might not be so many picture almost alike in same place there be mistaking simplicity will be won by into frankness man must have very rare genius to make change of sort be afraid mine must not carry even to pitch of doing well what have be done already at least not so well a to make worth while must never succeed in anything by dint of drudgery if thing dont come easily to never get have heard mr casaubon say that regret want of patience said dorothea gently be rather shocked at mode of taking life a holiday yes know mr casaubons opinion differ slight streak of contempt in hasty reply offended dorothea be more susceptible about mr casaubon because of morning trouble certainly differ said rather proudly did not think of comparing such power of persevering devoted labor a mr casaubons be not common will saw that be offended only gave additional impulse to new irritation of latent dislike towards mr casaubon be too intolerable that dorothea must be worshipping husband such weakness in woman be pleasant to man husband in question mortal be easily tempted to pinch life out of neighbor buzzing glory think that such killing be murder indeed answered promptly therefore be pity that must be thrown away a so much english scholarship be for want of knowing what be being done by rest of world if mr casaubon read german must save great deal of trouble understand said dorothea startled anxious merely mean said will in offhand way that german have taken lead in historical inquiry laugh at result be got by groping about in wood with pocket compass while have made good road when be with mr casaubon saw that deafened in direction be almost against will that read latin treatise written by german be very sorry will only thought of giving good pinch must annihilate that vaunted laboriousness be unable to imagine mode in dorothea must be wounded young mr ladislaw be not at deep in german writer very little achievement be required in order to pity man shortcoming poor dorothea felt pang at thought that labor of husband life might be void left energy to spare for question whether young relative who be so much obliged to ought not to have repressed observation did not even speak sat looking at hand absorbed in piteousness of thought will however having given that annihilating pinch be rather ashamed imagining from dorotheas silence that have offended still more having also conscience about plucking tail feather from benefactor regretted especially resumed taking usual course from detraction to insincere eulogy because of gratitude respect towards cousin must not signify so much in man whose talent character be le distinguished dorothea raised eye brighter than usual with excited feeling said in saddest recitative how wish have learned german when be at lausanne there be plenty of german teacher now can be of use there be new light still mysterious light for will in dorotheas last word question how have come to accept mr casaubonwhich have dismissed when first saw by saying that must be disagreeable in spite of appearanceswas not now to be answered on such short easy method else might be be not disagreeable be not coldly clever indirectly satirical adorably simple full of feeling be angel beguiled must be unique delight to wait watch for melodious fragment in heart soul came forth so directly ingenuously aeolian harp again came into mind must have made original romance for herself in marriage if mr casaubon have be dragon who have carried off to lair with talon simply without legal form must have be unavoidable feat of heroism to release fall at foot be something more unmanageable than dragon be benefactor with collective society at back be at moment entering room in unimpeachable correctness of demeanor while dorothea be looking animated with newly roused alarm regret will be looking animated with admiring speculation about feeling mr casaubon felt surprise be quite unmixed with pleasure did not swerve from usual politeness of greeting when will rose explained presence mr casaubon be le happy than usual perhaps made look dimmer more faded else effect might easily have be produced by contrast of young cousin appearance first impression on seeing will be one of sunny brightness added to uncertainty of changing expression surely very feature changed form jaw looked sometimes large sometimes small little ripple in nose be preparation for metamorphosis when turned head quickly hair seemed to shake out light person thought saw decided genius in coruscation mr casaubon on contrary stood rayless a dorotheas eye be turned anxiously on husband be perhaps not insensible to contrast be only mingled with other cause in making more conscious of new alarm on behalf be first stirring of pitying tenderness fed by reality of lot not by own dream yet be source of greater freedom to will be there young equality be agreeable also perhaps openness to conviction felt immense need of one to speak to have never before seen one who seemed so quick pliable so likely to understand everything mr casaubon gravely hoped that will be passing time profitably a well a pleasantly in romehad thought intention be to remain in south germanybut begged to come dine to morrow when must converse more at large at present be somewhat weary ladislaw understood accepting invitation immediately took leave dorotheas eye followed husband anxiously while sank down wearily at end of sofa resting elbow supported head looked on floor little flushed with bright eye seated beside said forgive for speaking so hastily to morning be wrong fear hurt made day more burdensome be glad that feel that dear said mr casaubon spoke quietly bowed head little there be still uneasy feeling in eye a looked at do forgive said dorothea with quick sob in need for manifestation of feeling be ready to exaggerate own fault must not love see returning penitence afar off fall on neck kiss dear dorotheawho with repentance be not satisfied be not of heaven earthyou think worthy to be banished by severe sentence said mr casaubon exerting to make strong statement also to smile faintly dorothea be silent tear have come up with sob must insist on falling be excited dear also be feeling unpleasant consequence of too much mental disturbance said mr casaubon in fact have in thought to tell that ought not to have received young ladislaw in absence abstained partly from sense that must be ungracious to bring new complaint in moment of penitent acknowledgment partly because wanted to avoid further agitation of by speech partly because be too proud to betray jealousy of disposition be not so exhausted on scholarly compeer that there be none to spare in other direction there be sort of jealousy need very little fire be hardly passion blight bred in cloudy damp despondency of uneasy egoism think be time for to dress added looking at watch rose there be never further allusion between to what have passed on day dorothea remembered to last with vividness with remember epoch in experience when dear expectation dy new motive be born today have begun to see that have be under wild illusion in expecting response to feeling from mr casaubon have felt waking of presentiment that there might be sad consciousness in life made a great need on side a on own be of born in moral stupidity taking world a udder to feed supreme self dorothea have early begun to emerge from stupidity yet have be easier to to imagine how must devote to mr casaubon become wise strong in strength wisdom than to conceive with distinctness be longer reflection feelingan idea wrought back to directness of sense like solidity of objectsthat have equivalent centre of self whence light shadow must always fall with certain difference chapter xxii nous cusames longtemps elle tait simple et bonne ne sachant pa le mal elle faisait le bien de riches du coeur elle fit laumne et tout en coutant comme le coeur se donne sans oser y penser je lui donnai le mien elle emporta ma vie et nen sut jamais rien alfred de musset will ladislaw be delightfully agreeable at dinner next day gave opportunity for mr casaubon to show disapprobation on contrary seemed to dorothea will have happier way of drawing husband into conversation of deferentially listening to than have ever observed in one before to be sure listener about tipton be not highly gifted will talked good deal what said be thrown in with such rapidity with such unimportant air of saying something by way that seemed gay little chime after great bell if will be not always perfect be certainly one of good day described touch of incident among poor people in rome only to be seen by one who must move about freely found in agreement with mr casaubon a to unsound opinion of middleton concerning relation of judaism catholicism passed easily to half enthusiastic half playful picture of enjoyment got out of very miscellaneousness of rome made mind flexible with constant comparison saved from seeing world age a set of box like partition without vital connection mr casaubons study will observed have always be of too broad kind for have perhaps never felt such sudden effect for confessed that rome have given quite new sense of history a whole fragment stimulated imagination made constructive then occasionally not too often appealed to dorothea discussed what said a if sentiment be item to be considered in final judgment even of madonna di foligno laocoon sense of contributing to form world opinion make conversation particularly cheerful mr casaubon too be not without pride in young wife who spoke better than most woman a indeed have perceived in choosing since thing be going on so pleasantly mr casaubons statement that labor in library must be suspended for couple of day after brief renewal must have further reason for staying in rome encouraged will to urge that mr casaubon must not go away without seeing studio two must not mr casaubon take sort of thing ought not to be missed be quite special be form of life that grew like small fresh vegetation with population of insect on huge fossil will must be happy to conduct themnot to anything wearisome only to few example mr casaubon seeing dorothea look earnestly towards must not ask if must be interested in such visit be now at service during whole day be agreed that will must come on morrow drive with will must not omit thorwaldsen living celebrity about whom even mr casaubon inquired before day be far advanced led way to studio of friend adolf naumann whom mentioned a one of chief renovator of christian art one of who have not only revived expanded that grand conception of supreme event a mystery at successive age be spectator in relation to great soul of period became a be contemporary will added that have made naumanns pupil for nonce have be making oil sketch under said will hate copying must put something of own in naumann have be painting saint drawing car of church have be making sketch of marlowe tamburlaine driving conquered king in chariot be not so ecclesiastical a naumann sometimes twit with excess of meaning time mean to outdo in breadth of intention take tamburlaine in chariot for tremendous course of world physical history lashing on harnessed dynasty in opinion be good mythical interpretation will here looked at mr casaubon who received offhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily bowed with neutral air sketch must be very grand if conveys so much said dorothea must need explanation even of meaning give do intend tamburlaine to represent earthquake volcano oh yes said will laughing migration of race clearing of forestsand america steam engine everything can imagine what difficult kind of shorthand said dorothea smiling towards husband must require knowledge to be able to read mr casaubon blinked furtively at will have suspicion that be being laughed at be not possible to include dorothea in suspicion found naumann painting industriously model be present picture be advantageously arranged own plain vivacious person set off by dove colored blouse maroon velvet cap so that everything be a fortunate a if have expected beautiful young english lady exactly at time painter in confident english gave little dissertation on finished unfinished subject seeming to observe mr casaubon a much a did dorothea will burst in here there with ardent word of praise marking out particular merit in friend work dorothea felt that be getting quite new notion a to significance of madonna seated under inexplicable canopied throne with simple country a background of saint with architectural model in hand knife accidentally wedged in skull thing have seemed monstrous to be gathering intelligibility even natural meaning be apparently branch of knowledge in mr casaubon have not interested think must rather feel that painting be beautiful than have to read a enigma must learn to understand picture sooner than yours with very wide meaning said dorothea speaking to will dont speak of painting before naumann said will will tell be pfuscherei be most opprobrious word be that true said dorothea turning sincere eye on naumann who made slight grimace said oh doe not mean seriously with painting walk must be belle lettres be wi ide naumanns pronunciation of vowel seemed to stretch word satirically will did not half like managed to laugh mr casaubon while felt disgust at artist german accent began to entertain little respect for judicious severity respect be not diminished when naumann after drawing will aside for moment looking first at large canvas then at mr casaubon came forward again said friend ladislaw think will pardon sir if say that sketch of head must be invaluable to for st thomas aquinas in picture there be too much to ask so seldom see just what wantthe idealistic in real astonish greatly sir said mr casaubon look improved with glow of delight if poor physiognomy have be accustomed to regard a of commonest order can be of use to in furnishing trait for angelical doctor will feel honored be to say if operation will not be lengthy one if mr casaubon will not object to delay a for dorothea nothing must have pleased more unless have be miraculous voice pronouncing mr casaubon wisest worthiest among son of men in case tottering faith must have become firm again naumanns apparatus be at hand in wonderful completeness sketch went on at once a well a conversation dorothea sat down subsided into calm silence feeling happier than have done for long while before one about seemed good said to herself that rome if have only be le ignorant must have be full of beauty sadness must have be winged with hope nature must be le suspicious than hers when be child believed in gratitude of wasp honorable susceptibility of sparrow be proportionately indignant when baseness be made manifest adroit artist be asking mr casaubon question about english polity brought long answer will meanwhile have perched on step in background overlooking presently naumann saidnow if must lay by for hour take up againcome look ladislawi think be perfect so far will vented adjuring interjection imply admiration be too strong for syntax naumann said in tone of piteous regret ahnowif must have have morebut have other engagementsi must not ask itor even to come again to morrow oh let stay said dorothea have nothing to do to day except go about have added looking entreatingly at mr casaubon must be pity not to make head a good a possible be at service sir in matter said mr casaubon with polite condescension having given up interior of head to idleness be a well that exterior must work in way be unspeakably goodnow be happy said naumann then went on in german to will pointing here there to sketch a if be considering that putting aside for moment looked round vaguely a if seeking occupation for visitor afterwards turning to mr casaubon said perhaps beautiful bride gracious lady must not be unwilling to let fill up time by trying to make slight sketch of hernot of course a see for pictureonly a single study mr casaubon bowing doubted not that mr casaubon must oblige dorothea said at once where will put be apology in asking to stand allow to adjust attitude to submitted without of affected air laugh frequently thought necessary on such occasion when painter said be a santa clara want to standleaning so with cheek against handsolooking at stool please so will be divided between inclination to fall at saint foot kiss robe temptation to knock naumann down while be adjusting arm be impudence desecration repented that have brought artist be diligent will recovering moved about occupied mr casaubon a ingeniously a must did not in end prevent time from seeming long to gentleman a be clear from expressing fear that mr casaubon must be tired naumann took hint said now sir if can oblige again will release lady wife so mr casaubons patience held out further when after turned out that head of saint thomas aquinas must be more perfect if sitting must be have be granted for morrow on morrow santa clara too be retouched more than once result of be so far from displeasing to mr casaubon that arranged for purchase of picture in saint thomas aquinas sat among doctor of church in disputation too abstract to be represented listened to with more le attention by audience above santa clara be spoken of in second place naumann declared to be dissatisfied withhe must not in conscience engage to make worthy picture of so about santa clara arrangement be conditional will not dwell on naumanns joke at expense of mr casaubon that evening on dithyramb about dorotheas charm in will joined with difference sooner did naumann mention detail of dorotheas beauty than will got exasperated at presumption there be grossness in choice of most ordinary word what business have to talk of lip be not woman to be spoken of a other woman be will must not say just what thought became irritable yet when after resistance have consented to take casaubons to friend studio have be allured by gratification of pride in being person who must grant naumann such opportunity of studying lovelinessor rather divineness for ordinary phrase might apply to mere bodily prettiness be not applicable to certainly tipton neighborhood a well a dorothea must have be surprised at beauty being made so much of in part of world miss brooke have be only fine young woman oblige by letting subject drop naumann mr casaubon be not to be talked of a if be model said will naumann stared at schn will talk of aquinas head be not bad type after dare say great scholastic must have be flattered to have portrait asked for nothing like starchy doctor for vanity be a thought cared much le for portrait than own he cursed white blooded pedantic coxcomb said will with gnashing impetuosity obligation to mr casaubon be not known to hearer will be thinking of wishing that must discharge by check naumann gave shrug said be good go away soon dear be spoiling fine temper will hope contrivance be now concentrated on seeing dorothea when be alone only wanted to take more emphatic notice of only wanted to be something more special in remembrance than must yet believe likely to be be rather impatient under open ardent good will saw be usual state of feeling remote worship of woman throned out of reach play great part in men life in most case worshipper longs for queenly recognition approving sign by soul sovereign may cheer without descending from high place be precisely what will wanted there be plenty of contradiction in imaginative demand be beautiful to see how dorotheas eye turned with wifely anxiety beseeching to mr casaubon must have lost of halo if have be without duteous preoccupation yet at next moment husband sandy absorption of such nectar be too intolerable will longing to say damaging thing about be perhaps not le tormenting because felt strongest reason for restraining will have not be invited to dine next day hence persuaded that be bound to call that only eligible time be middle of day when mr casaubon must not be at home dorothea who have not be made aware that former reception of will have displeased husband have hesitation about seeing especially a might be come to pay farewell visit when entered be looking at cameo have be buying for celia greeted will a if visit be quite matter of course said at once having cameo bracelet in hand be so glad be come perhaps understand about cameo can tell if be really good wished to have with in choosing mr casaubon objected thought there be not time will finish work to morrow will go away in three day have be uneasy about cameo pray sit down look at be not particularly knowing there can be great mistake about little homeric bit be exquisitely neat color be fine will just suit oh be for sister who have quite different complexion saw with at lowick be light haired very prettyat least think so be never so long away from other in life before be great pet never be naughty in life found out before came away that wanted to buy cameo must be sorry for not to be goodafter kind dorothea added last word with smile seem not to care about cameo said will seating at distance from observing while closed case frankly dont think great object in life said dorothea fear be heretic about art generally how be must have expected to be very sensitive to beautiful everywhere suppose be dull about many thing said dorothea simply must like to make life beautifuli mean everybodys life then immense expense of art seems somehow to lie outside life make better for world pain one spoil enjoyment of anything when be made to think that most people be shut out from call that fanaticism of sympathy said will impetuously might say same of landscape of poetry of refinement if carried out ought to be miserable in own goodness turn evil that might have advantage over others best piety be to enjoywhen can be doing most then to save earth character a agreeable planet enjoyment radiates be of use to try take care of world be being taken care of when feel delightin art in anything else must turn youth of world into tragic chorus wailing moralizing over misery suspect that have false belief in virtue of misery want to make life martyrdom will have gone further than intended checked dorotheas thought be not taking just same direction a own answered without special emotion indeed mistake be not sad melancholy creature be never unhappy long together be angry naughtynot like celia have great outburst then seems glorious again can not help believing in glorious thing in blind sort of way must be quite willing to enjoy art here there be so much that dont know reason ofso much that seems to consecration of ugliness rather than beauty painting sculpture may be wonderful feeling be often low brutal sometimes even ridiculous here there see what take at once a noblesomething that might compare with alban mountain sunset from pincian hill that make greater pity that there be so little of best kind among mass of thing over men have toiled so of course there be always great deal of poor work rarer thing want that soil to grow in oh dear said dorothea taking up thought into chief current of anxiety see must be very difficult to do anything good have often felt since have be in rome that most of life must look much uglier more bungling than picture if must be put on wall dorothea parted lip again a if be going to say more changed mind paused be too youngit be anachronism for to have such thought said will energetically with quick shake of head habitual to talk a if have never known youth be monstrousas if have have vision of hades in childhood like boy in legend have be brought up in of horrible notion choose sweetest woman to devourlike minotaur now will go be shut up in stone prison at lowick will be buried alive make savage to think of must rather never have seen than think of with prospect will again feared that have gone too far meaning attach to word depends on feeling tone of angry regret have so much kindness in for dorotheas heart have always be giving out ardor have never be fed with much from living being around that felt new sense of gratitude answered with gentle smile be very good of to be anxious about be because did not like lowick have set heart on kind of life lowick be chosen home last sentence be spoken with almost solemn cadence will did not know what to say since must not be useful for to embrace slipper tell that must die for be clear that required nothing of sort be silent for moment two when dorothea began again with air of saying at last what have be in mind beforehand wanted to ask again about something said other day perhaps be half of lively way of speaking notice that like to put thing strongly often exaggerate when speak hastily what be said will observing that spoke with timidity quite new in have hyperbolical tongue catch fire a go dare say will have to retract mean what said about necessity of knowing germani mean for subject mr casaubon be engaged in have be thinking about seems to that with mr casaubons learning must have before same material a german scholarshas not dorotheas timidity be due to indistinct consciousness that be in strange situation of consulting third person about adequacy of mr casaubons learning not exactly same material said will thinking that must be duly reserved be not orientalist know doe not profess to have more than second hand knowledge there there be very valuable book about antiquity be written long while ago by scholar who knew nothing about modern thing be still used why must mr casaubons not be valuable like theirs said dorothea with more remonstrant energy be impelled to have argument aloud have be having in own mind depends on line of study taken said will also getting tone of rejoinder subject mr casaubon have chosen be a changing a chemistry new discovery be constantly making new point of view who want system on basis of four element book to refute paracelsus do not see that be use now to be crawling little way after men of last centurymen like bryantand correcting mistakesliving in lumber room furbishing up broken legged theory about chus mizraim how can bear to speak so lightly said dorothea with look between sorrow anger if be a say what must be sadder than so much ardent labor in vain wonder doe not affect more painfully if really think that man like mr casaubon of so much goodness power learning must in way fail in what have be labor of best year be beginning to be shocked that have got to such point of supposition indignant with will for having led to questioned about matter of fact not of feeling said will if wish to punish for fact submit be not in position to express feeling toward mr casaubon must be at best pensioner eulogy pray excuse said dorothea coloring deeply be aware a say that be in fault in having introduced subject indeed be wrong altogether failure after long perseverance be much grander than never to have striving good enough to be called failure quite agree with said will determined to change situationso much so have made up mind not to run risk of never attaining failure mr casaubons generosity have perhaps be dangerous to mean to renounce liberty have given mean to go back to england shortly work own waydepend on nobody else

likely to be true can test man admission fred must not reckon own judgment of horse a worth something farmer have paused over freds respectable though broken winded steed long enough to show that thought worth consideration seemed probable that must take with five twenty pound in addition a equivalent of diamond in case fred when have parted with new horse for at least eighty pound must be fifty five pound in pocket by transaction must have hundred thirty five pound towards meeting bill so that deficit temporarily thrown on mr garth must at utmost be twenty five pound by time be

minute be in room rosamond went out after waiting just long enough to show pretty anxiety conflicting with sense of what be becoming lydgate have to hear narrative in mr vincys mind insisted with remarkable instinct on point of minor importance especially on what mr wrench have said have not said about coming again that there might be awkward affair with wrench lydgate saw at once case be serious enough to make dismiss consideration be convinced that fred be in pink skinned stage of typhoid fever that have taken just wrong medicine must go to bed immediately must have regular nurse various appliance precaution must be used about lydgate be particular poor mr vincys terror at indication of danger found vent in such word a came most easily thought very ill usage on part of mr wrench who have attended house so many year in preference to mr peacock though mr peacock be equally friend why mr wrench must neglect child more than others must not for life of understand have not neglected mr larchers when have measles indeed must mr vincy have wished that must if anything must happen here poor mr vincys spirit quite broke down niobe throat good humored face be sadly convulsed be in hall out of freds hearing rosamond have opened drawing room door now came forward anxiously lydgate apologized for mr wrench said that symptom yesterday might have be disguising that form of

offender with official air now broadened by putting thumb in armhole to let fever get unawares into house like there be thing ought to be actionable be not so thats opinion irrational reproach be easier to bear than sense of being instructed rather sense that younger man like lydgate inwardly considered in need of instruction for in point of fact mr wrench afterwards said lydgate paraded flighty foreign notion must not wear swallowed ire for moment afterwards wrote to decline further attendance in case house might be good one mr wrench be not going to truckle to anybody on professional matter reflected with much probability on side that lydgate must by by be caught tripping too that ungentlemanly attempt to discredit sale of drug by professional brother must by by recoil on threw out biting remark on lydgates trick worthy only of quack to get factitious reputation with credulous people cant about cure be never got up by sound practitioner be point on lydgate smarted a much a wrench must desire to be puffed by ignorance be not only humiliating perilous not more enviable than reputation of weather prophet be impatient of foolish expectation amidst work must be carried on likely enough to damage a much a mr wrench must wish by unprofessional openness however lydgate be installed a medical attendant on vincys event be subject of general conversation in middlemarch said that vincys have behaved scandalously that mr vincy have threatened wrench that mr vincy have accused of poisoning son others be of opinion that mr lydgates passing by be providential

clashing of temper between dorothea husband since little explosion in rome have left such strong trace in mind that have be easier ever since to quell emotion than to incur consequence of venting ill tempered anticipation that must desire visit might be disagreeable to husband gratuitous defence of against selfish complaint on part be too sharp sting to be meditated on until after have be resented dorothea have thought that must have be patient with john milton have never imagined behaving in way for moment mr casaubon seemed to be stupidly undiscerning odiously unjust pity that new born babe be by by to rule many storm within did not stride blast on occasion with first word uttered in tone shook startled mr casaubon into looking at meeting flash of eye why do attribute to wish for anything must annoy speak to a if be something have to contend against wait at least till appear to consult own pleasure apart from yours dorothea be hasty answered mr casaubon nervously decidedly woman be too young to be on formidable level of wifehoodunless have be pale featureless taken everything for granted think be who be first hasty in false supposition about feeling said dorothea in

made a if must return to writing though hand trembled so much that word seemed to be written in unknown character there be answer in turning away wrath only send to other end of room to have discussion coolly waived when feel that justice be on own side be even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy dorothea left ladislaws two letter unread on husband writing table went to own

be gradually reviving when sir james chettam came in having be met in hall with news that mr casaubon have have fit in library good god be just what might have be expected be immediate thought if prophetic soul have be urged to particularize seemed to that fit must have be definite expression alighted upon asked informant butler whether doctor have be sent for butler never knew master to want doctor before must not be right to send for physician when sir james entered library however mr casaubon must make sign of usual politeness dorothea who in reaction from first terror have be kneeling sobbing by side now rose proposed that one must ride off for medical man recommend to send for lydgate said sir james mother have called in have found uncommonly clever have have poor opinion of physician since father death dorothea appealed to husband made silent sign of approval so mr lydgate be sent for came wonderfully soon for messenger who be sir james chettams man knew mr lydgate met

stretching tender arm under husband neck looking at with unspeakable sorrow did not know how much penitence there be in sorrow yes said celia thinking be very well for sir james to say so must not have be comfortable with dodo will go to must help do think think must be well for just to go see before lydgate come said sir james magnanimously only dont stay long while celia be gone walked up down remembering what have originally felt about dorotheas engagement feeling revival of disgust at mr brooke indifference if cadwalladerif one else have regarded affair a sir james have done marriage might have be hindered be wicked to let young girl blindly decide fate in way without effort to save sir james have long ceased to have regret on own account heart be satisfied with engagement to celia have chivalrous nature be not disinterested service of woman among ideal glory of old chivalry disregarded love have not turned to bitterness death have made sweet odorsfloating memory that clung with consecrating effect to dorothea must remain brotherly friend interpreting action with generous trustfulness chapter xxx qui veut dlasser hors de propos lassepascal mr casaubon have second

intense anxiety in face voice about touched mind health made drama lydgate be inclined to watch said to that be only doing right in telling truth about husband probable future certainly thought also that must be interesting to talk confidentially with medical man like to make psychological observation sometimes in pursuit of such study be too easily tempted into momentous prophecy life death easily set at nought lydgate have often be satirical on gratuitous prediction meant now to be guarded asked for mr casaubon being told that be out walking be going away when dorothea celia appeared glowing from struggle with march wind when lydgate begged to speak with alone dorothea opened library door happened to be nearest thinking of nothing at moment what might have to say about mr casaubon

expected indeed be already nearly in usual state of health fear that illness will return said dorothea whose quick ear have detected significance in lydgates tone such case be peculiarly difficult to pronounce upon said only point on can be confident be that will be desirable to be very watchful on mr casaubons account lest must in way strain nervous power beseech to speak quite plainly said dorothea in imploring tone can not bear to think that there might be something did not know if have known must have made act differently word came out like cry be evident that be voice of mental experience lay not very far off sit down added placing on nearest chair throwing off bonnet glove with instinctive discarding of formality where great question of destiny be concerned what say now

when be gone dorotheas tear gushed forth relieved stifling oppression then dried eye reminded that distress must not be betrayed to husband looked round room thinking that must order servant to attend to a usual since mr casaubon might now at moment wish to enter on writing table there be letter have lain untouched since morning when be taken ill among a dorothea well remembered there be young ladislaws letter one addressed to still unopened association of letter have be made more painful by sudden attack of illness felt that agitation caused by anger might have helped to bring on must be time enough to read when be again thrust upon have have inclination to fetch from library now occurred to that must be put out of husband sight might have be source of annoyance about must if possible not be annoyed again ran eye first over letter addressed to to assure whether not must be necessary to write in order to hinder offensive visit will wrote from rome began by saying that obligation to

bulstrode must be delighted with what have happened for have done everything to put mr lydgate forward selina what do mean said mr bulstrode in genuine surprise not what be truly thankful for neds sake said mr plymdale must certainly better afford to keep wife than people can must wish to look elsewhere still mother have anxiety young men must take to bad life in consequence besides if be obliged to speak must say be not fond of stranger coming into town dont know selina said mr bulstrode with little emphasis in turn mr bulstrode be stranger here at one time abraham moses be stranger in land be told to entertain stranger especially added after slight pause when be unexceptionable be not speaking in religious sense harriet spoke a mother selina be sure have never heard say anything against niece of mine marrying son oh be pride in miss vincyi be sure be nothing else said mr plymdale who have never before given confidence to harriet on subject young man in middlemarch be good

disappointment be ignorant of what can go on in elegant leisure of young lady mind on eleventh day however lydgate when leaving stone court be requested by mr vincy to let husband know that there be marked change in mr featherstones health that wished to come to stone court on day now lydgate might have called at warehouse might have written message on leaf of pocket book left at door yet simple device apparently did not occur to from may conclude that have strong objection to calling at house at hour when mr vincy be not at home leaving message with miss vincy man may from various motif decline to give company perhaps not even sage must be gratified that nobody missed must be graceful easy way of piecing on new habit to old to have few playful word with rosamond about resistance to dissipation firm resolve to take long fast even from sweet sound must be confessed also that momentary speculation a to possible ground for mr bulstrodes hint have managed to get woven like slight clinging hair into more substantial web of thought miss vincy be alone blushed so deeply when lydgate came in that felt corresponding embarrassment instead of playfulness began at once to speak of reason for calling to beg almost formally to deliver message to father rosamond who at first moment felt a if happiness be returning be keenly hurt by lydgates manner blush have departed assented

forgetting everything else completely mastered by outrush of tenderness at sudden belief that sweet young creature depended on for joy actually put arm round folding gently protectinglyhe be used to being gentle with weak sufferingand kissed of two large tear be strange way of arriving at understanding be short way rosamond be not angry moved backward little in timid happiness lydgate must now sit near speak le incompletely rosamond have to make little confession poured out word of gratitude tenderness with impulsive lavishment in hour left house engaged man whose soul be not own woman to whom have bound came again in evening to speak with mr vincy who just returned from stone court be feeling sure that must not be long before heard of mr featherstones demise felicitous word demise have seasonably occurred to have raised spirit even above usual evening pitch right word be always power communicates definiteness to action considered a demise old featherstones death assumed merely legal aspect so mr vincy must tap snuff box over be jovial without even intermittent affectation of solemnity mr vincy hated solemnity affectation who be ever awe struck about testator sang hymn on title to real property mr vincy be inclined to take jovial view of thing that evening even observed to lydgate that fred have got family constitution after must soon be a fine fellow a ever again when approbation of rosamonds engagement be asked for gave with astonishing facility passing at once to general remark on desirableness of matrimony for young men maiden apparently deducing from whole appropriateness of little more punch chapter xxxii theyll take suggestion a cat lap milk shakespeare tempest triumphant confidence of mayor founded on mr featherstones insistent demand fred mother must not leave be feeble emotion compared with be agitating breast of old man blood relation who naturally manifested more sense of family tie be more visibly numerous now that have become bedridden naturally for when poor peter have occupied arm chair in wainscoted parlor assiduous beetle for whom cook prepares boiling water must have be le welcome on hearth have reason for preferring than person whose featherstone blood be ill nourished not from penuriousness on part from poverty brother solomon sister jane be rich family candor total abstinence from false politeness with be always received seemed to argument that brother in solemn act of making will must overlook superior claim of wealth at least have never be unnatural enough to banish from house seemed hardly eccentric that must have kept away brother jonah sister martha rest who have shadow of such claim knew peter maxim that money be good egg must be laid in warm nest brother jonah sister martha needy exile held different point of view probability be a various a face to be seen at will in fretwork paper hanging form be there from jupiter to judy if only look with creative inclination to poorer least favored

nephew niece cousin arguing with still greater subtilty a to what might be done by man able to will away property give large treat of oddity felt in handsome sort of way that there be family interest to be attended to thought of stone court a place must be nothing right for to visit sister martha otherwise mr cranch living with wheeziness in chalky flat must not undertake journey son a being poor peter own nephew must represent advantageously watch lest uncle jonah must make unfair use of improbable thing seemed likely to happen in fact there be general sense running in featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else that must be well for everybody else to reflect that almighty be watching thus stone court continually saw one other blood relation alighting departing mary garth have unpleasant task of carrying message to mr featherstone who must see none of sent down with still more unpleasant task of telling so a manager of household felt bound to ask in good provincial

child must write to first before can answer himand rosamond be certain that have gained point mr vincys answer consisted chiefly in demand lydgate must insure lifea demand immediately conceded be delightfully reassuring idea supposing that lydgate died in mean time not self supporting idea however seemed to make everything comfortable about rosamonds marriage necessary purchase went on with much spirit not without prudential consideration however bride who be going to visit at baronet must have few first rate pocket handkerchief beyond absolutely necessary half dozen rosamond contented without very highest style of embroidery valenciennes lydgate also finding that sum of eight hundred pound have be considerably reduced since have come to middlemarch restrained inclination for plate

accepted suggestion that proud pleasure of showing so charming bride be worth trouble now came to think of must like to see old spot with rosamond will write to then cousin be bore seemed magnificent to rosamond to be able to speak so slightingly of baronet family felt much contentment in prospect of being able to estimate contemptuously on own account mamma be near spoiling day two later by saying hope uncle sir godwin will not look down on rosy mr lydgate must think must do something handsome thousand two can be nothing to baronet mamma said rosamond blushing deeply lydgate pitied so much that remained silent went to other end of room to examine print curiously a if have be absent minded mamma have little filial lecture afterwards be docile a usual rosamond reflected that if of high bred cousin who be bore must be induced to visit middlemarch must see many thing in own family might shock hence seemed desirable that lydgate must by by get first rate position elsewhere than in

given quotation from delectus familiar to from tender year sometimes mentioned curtly what ancient sect personage have held similar idea a if there be too much of sort in stock already at other time must inform that be mistaken reassert what remark have questioned will ladislaw always seemed to see more in what said than saw dorothea have little vanity have ardent woman need to rule beneficently by making joy of soul hence mere chance of seeing will occasionally be like lunette opened in wall of prison giving glimpse of sunny air pleasure began to nullify original alarm at what husband might

dread of offending dorothea found out at last that wanted to take particular sketch at lowick one morning when mr brooke have to drive along lowick road on way to county town will asked to be set down with sketch book camp stool at lowick without announcing at manor settled to sketch in position where must see dorothea if came out to walkand knew that usually walked hour in morning stratagem be defeated by weather cloud gathered with treacherous quickness rain came down will be obliged to take shelter in house intended on strength of relationship to go into drawing room wait there without being announced seeing old acquaintance butler in hall said dont mention that be here pratt will wait till luncheon know mr casaubon doe not like to be disturbed when be in library master be out sir there only mr casaubon in library id better tell youre here sir said pratt red cheeked man given to lively converse with tantripp often agreeing with that must be dull for madam oh very well

casaubon have gone to archdeacon said at once dont know whether will be at home again long before dinner be uncertain how long must be did want to say anything particular to came to sketch rain drove in else must not have disturbed yet supposed that mr casaubon be here know dislike interruption at hour be indebted to rain then be so glad to see dorothea uttered common word with simple sincerity of unhappy child visited at school really came for chance of seeing alone said will mysteriously forced to be just a simple a be must not stay to ask why not wanted to talk about thing a did in rome always make difference when other people be present yes said dorothea in clear full tone of assent sit down seated on dark ottoman with brown book behind looking in plain dress of thin woollen white material without single ornament on besides wedding ring a if be under vow to be different from other woman will sat down opposite at two yard distance light falling on bright curl delicate rather petulant profile with defiant curve of lip chin looked at other a if have be two flower have opened then there dorothea for moment forgot husband mysterious irritation against will seemed fresh water at thirsty lip to speak without fear to one person whom have found receptive for in looking backward through sadness exaggerated past solace have often thought that must like to talk to again said immediately seems strange to how many thing said to remember said will with unspeakable content in soul of feeling that be in presence of creature worthy to be perfectly loved think own feeling at moment be perfect for mortal have divine moment when love be satisfied in completeness of beloved object have tried to learn great deal since be in rome said dorothea can read latin little be beginning to understand just little greek can help mr casaubon better now can find out reference for save eye in many way be very difficult to be learned seems a if people be worn out on way to great thought can never enjoy because be too tired if man have capacity for great thought be likely to overtake before be decrepit said will with irrepressible quickness through certain sensibility dorothea be a quick a seeing face change added immediately be quite true that best mind have be sometimes overstrained in working out idea correct said dorothea expressed ill must have said that who have great thought get too much worn in working out used to feel about even when be little girl always seemed to that use must like to make of life must be to help one who did great work so that burthen might be lighter dorothea be led on to bit of autobiography without sense of making revelation have never before said anything to will threw so strong light on marriage did not shrug shoulder for want of muscular outlet thought more irritably of beautiful lip kissing holy skull other emptiness ecclesiastically enshrined also have to take care that speech must not betray that thought may easily carry help too far said get over wrought be not too much shut up already look paler must be better for mr casaubon to have secretary must easily get man who must do half work for must save more effectually need only help in lighter way how can think of said dorothea in tone of earnest remonstrance must have happiness if did not help in work what must do there be good to be done in lowick only thing desire be to help more object to secretary please not to mention again certainly not now know feeling have heard mr brooke sir james chettam express same wish yes said dorothea dont understandthey want to be great deal on horseback have garden altered new conservatory to fill up day thought must understand that one mind have other want added rather impatientlybesides mr casaubon can not bear to hear of secretary mistake be excusable said will in old day used to hear mr casaubon speak a if looked forward to having secretary indeed held out prospect of office to turned out to benot good enough for dorothea be trying to extract out of excuse for husband evident repulsion a said with playful smile be not steady worker enough said will shaking head backward somewhat after manner of spirited horse then old irritable demon prompting to give good pinch at moth wing of poor mr casaubons glory went on have seen since mr casaubon doe not like one to overlook work know thoroughly what be doing be too doubtfultoo uncertain of may not be good for much dislike because disagree with will be not without intention to be always generous tongue be little trigger have usually be pulled before general intention can be brought to bear be too intolerable that casaubons dislike of must not be fairly accounted for to dorothea yet when have spoken be rather uneasy a to effect on dorothea be strangely quietnot immediately indignant a have be on like occasion in rome cause lay deep be no longer struggling against perception of fact adjusting to clearest perception now when looked steadily at husband failure still more at possible consciousness of failure seemed to be looking along one track where duty became tenderness will want of reticence might have be met with more severity if have not already be recommended to mercy by husband dislike must seem hard to till saw better reason for did not answer at once after looking down ruminatingly said with earnestness mr casaubon must have overcome dislike of so far a action be concerned be admirable yes have shown sense of justice in family matter be abominable thing that grandmother must have be disinherited because made what called mesalliance though there be nothing to be said against husband except that be polish refugee who gave lesson for bread wish knew about said dorothea wonder how bore change from wealth to poverty wonder whether be happy with husband do know much about only that grandfather be patriota bright fellowcould speak many languagesmusicalgot bread by teaching sort of thing died rather early never knew much of father beyond what mother told inherited musical talent remember slow walk long thin hand one day remains with when be lying ill be very hungry have only little bit of bread ah what different life from mine said dorothea with keen interest clasping hand on lap have always have too much of everything tell how wasmr casaubon must not have known about then father have made known to mr casaubon be last hungry day father died soon after mother be well taken care of mr casaubon always expressly recognized a duty to take care of because of harsh injustice have be shown to mother sister now be telling what be not new to in inmost soul will be conscious of wishing to tell dorothea what be rather new even in own construction of thingsnamely that mr casaubon have never done more than pay debt towards will be much too good fellow to be easy under sense of being ungrateful when gratitude have become matter of reasoning there be many way of escaping from bond answered dorothea mr casaubon have always avoided dwelling on own honorable action did not feel that husband conduct be depreciated notion of what justice have required in relation with will ladislaw took strong hold on mind after moment pause added have never told that supported mother be still living died by accidenta fallfour year ago be curious that mother too ran away from family not for sake of husband never must tell anything about family except forsook to get own livingwent on stage in fact be dark eyed creature with crisp ringlet never seemed to be getting old see come of rebellious blood on side will ended smiling brightly at dorothea while be still looking with serious intentness before like child seeing drama for first time face too broke into smile a said that be apology suppose for having be rather rebellious mean to mr casaubons wish must remember that have not done what thought best for if dislike be speaking of dislike little while agobut must rather say if have shown painful feeling towards must consider how sensitive have become from wearing effect of study perhaps continued getting into pleading tone uncle have not told how serious mr casaubons illness be must be very petty of who be well can bear thing to think much of small offence from who carry weight of trial teach better said will will never grumble on subject again there be gentleness in tone came from unutterable contentment of perceivingwhat dorothea be hardly conscious ofthat be travelling into remoteness of pure pity loyalty towards husband will be ready to adore pity loyalty if must associate with in manifesting have really sometimes be perverse fellow went on will never again if can help do say what must disapprove be very good of said dorothea with open smile will have little kingdom then where will give law will soon go away out of rule imagine will soon be tired of staying at grange be point wanted to mention to youone of reason why wished to speak to alone mr brooke proposes must stay in neighborhood have bought one of middlemarch newspaper wish to conduct also to help in other way must not that be sacrifice of higher prospect for said dorothea perhaps have always be blamed for thinking of prospect not settling to anything here be something offered to if must not like to accept will give up otherwise must rather stay in part of country than go away belong to nobody anywhere else must like to stay very much said dorothea at once a simply readily a have spoken at rome there be not shadow of reason in mind at moment why must not say so then will stay said ladislaw shaking head backward rising going towards window a if to see whether rain have ceased next moment dorothea according to habit be getting continually stronger began to reflect that husband felt differently from herself colored deeply under double embarrassment of having expressed what might be in opposition to husband feeling of having to suggest opposition to will face be not turned towards made easier to say opinion be of little consequence on subject think must be guided by mr casaubon spoke without thinking of anything else than own feeling have nothing to do with real question now occurs to meperhaps mr casaubon might see that proposal be not wise can not wait now mention to cant wait to day said will inwardly seared by possibility that mr casaubon must enter rain be quite over now told mr brooke not to call for must rather walk five mile will strike across halsell common see gleam on wet grass like that approached to shake hand quite hurriedly longing not daring to say dont mention subject to mr casaubon no dared not must not say to ask to be le simple direct must be like breathing on crystal that want to see light through there be always other great dreadof becoming dimmed forever ray shorn in eye wish must have stayed said dorothea with touch of mournfulness a rose put out hand also have thought did not like to expresswill certainly ought to lose time in consulting mr casaubons wish for to urge might seem undue dictation so only said good by will quitted house striking across field so a not to run risk of encountering mr casaubons carriage however did not appear at gate until four oclock be unpropitious hour for coming home be too early to gain moral support under ennui of dressing person for dinner too late to undress mind of day frivolous ceremony affair so a to be prepared for good plunge into serious business of study on such occasion usually threw into easy chair in library allowed dorothea to read london paper to closing eye while to day however declined that relief observing that have already have too many public detail urged upon spoke more cheerfully than usual when dorothea asked about fatigue added with air of formal effort never forsook even when spoke without waistcoat cravat have have gratification of meeting former acquaintance dr spanning to day of being praised by one who be worthy recipient of praise spoke very handsomely of late tractate on egyptian mysteriesusing in fact term must not become to repeat in uttering last clause mr casaubon leaned over elbow of chair swayed head up down apparently a muscular outlet instead of recapitulation must not have be becoming be very glad have have that pleasure said dorothea delighted to see husband le weary than usual at hour before came have be regretting that happened to be out to day why so dear said mr casaubon throwing backward again because mr ladislaw have be here have mentioned proposal of uncle must like to know opinion of husband felt be really concerned in question even with ignorance of world have vague impression that position offered to will be out of keeping with family connection certainly mr casaubon have claim to be consulted did not speak merely bowed dear uncle know have many project appears that have bought one of middlemarch newspaper have asked mr ladislaw to stay in neighborhood conduct paper for besides helping in other way dorothea looked at husband while spoke have at first blinked finally closed eye a if to save while lip became more tense what be opinion added rather timidly after slight pause did mr ladislaw come on purpose to ask opinion said mr casaubon opening eye narrowly with knife edged look at dorothea be really uncomfortable on point inquired about only became little more serious eye did not swerve answered immediately did not say that came to ask opinion when mentioned proposal of course expected to tell of mr casaubon be silent feared that might feel objection certainly young man with so much talent might be very useful to unclemight help to do good in better way mr ladislaw wish to have fixed occupation have be blamed say for not seeking something of kind must like to stay in neighborhood because one care for elsewhere dorothea felt that be consideration to soften husband however did not speak presently recurred to dr spanning archdeacon breakfast there be longer sunshine on subject

energy of dorotheas nature went on side of responsibilitythe fulfilment of claim founded on own deed such a marriage parentage be true said to herself that mr casaubon have debt to ladislawsthat have to pay back what ladislaws have be wronged of now began to think of husband will have be made at time of marriage leaving bulk of property to with proviso in case of having child ought to be altered time ought to be lost very question have just arisen about will ladislaws occupation be occasion for placing thing on new right footing husband felt sure according to previous conduct must be ready to take just view if proposed itshe in whose interest unfair concentration of property have be urged sense of right have surmounted must continue to surmount anything might be called antipathy suspected that uncle scheme be disapproved by mr casaubon made seem more opportune that fresh understanding must be begun so that instead of will starting penniless accepting first function offered must find in possession of rightful income must be paid by husband during life by immediate alteration of will must be secured at death vision of a what ought to be done seemed to dorothea like sudden letting in of daylight waking from previous stupidity incurious self absorbed ignorance about husband relation to others will ladislaw have refused mr casaubons future aid on ground that longer appeared right to mr casaubon have never seen fully what be claim upon will said dorothea great strength of character lie here what be doing with money make use of half of income own money buy nothing uneasy conscience there be peculiar fascination for dorothea in division of property intended for herself always regarded by a excessive be blind see to many thing obvious to otherslikely to tread in wrong place a celia have warned yet blindness to did not lie in own pure purpose carried safely by side of precipice where vision must have be perilous with fear thought have gathered vividness in solitude of boudoir occupied incessantly through day on mr casaubon have sent letter to will everything seemed hindrance to till must find opportunity of opening heart to husband to preoccupied mind subject be to be approached gently have never since illness lost from consciousness dread of agitating when young ardor be set brooding over conception of prompt deed deed seems to start forth with independent life mastering ideal obstacle day passed in sombre fashion not unusual though mr casaubon be perhaps unusually silent there be hour of night might be counted on a opportunity of conversation for dorothea when aware of husband sleeplessness have established habit of rising lighting candle reading to sleep again night be from beginning sleepless excited by resolve slept a usual for few hour have risen softly have sat in darkness for nearly hour before said dorothea since be up will light candle do feel ill dear be first question a obeyed not at will be obliged since be up if will read few page of lowth may talk to little instead said dorothea certainly have be thinking about money have always have too much especially prospect of too much dear dorothea be providential arrangement if one have too much in consequence of others being wronged seems to that divine voice tell to set that wrong right must be obeyed what love be bearing of remark that have be too liberal in arrangement for mei mean with regard to property make unhappy how so have none comparatively distant connection have be led to think about aunt julia how be left in poverty only because married poor man act be not disgraceful since be not unworthy be on ground know that educated mr ladislaw provided for mother dorothea waited few moment for answer must help onward none came next word seemed more forcible to falling clear upon dark silence surely must regard claim a much greater one even to half of property know that have destined for think ought at once to be provided for on understanding be not right that must be in dependence of poverty while be rich if there be objection to proposal mentioned giving true place true share must set aside motive for accepting mr ladislaw have probably be speaking to on subject said mr casaubon with certain biting quickness not habitual to indeed said dorothea earnestly how can imagine since have so lately declined everything from fear think too hardly of dear only told little about parent grandparent almost in answer to question be so good so justyou have done everything thought to be right seems to clear that more than be right must speak about since be person who must get what be called benefit by more not being done there be perceptible pause before mr casaubon replied not quickly a before with still more biting emphasis dorothea love be not first occasion be well that must be last on have assumed judgment on subject beyond scope into question how far conduct especially in matter of alliance constitutes forfeiture of family claim now enter suffice that be not here qualified to discriminate what now wish to understand be that accept revision still dictation within range of affair have deliberated upon a distinctly properly mine be not for to interfere between mr ladislaw still le to encourage communication from to constitute criticism on procedure poor dorothea shrouded in darkness be in tumult of conflicting emotion alarm at possible effect on of husband strongly manifested anger must have checked expression of own resentment even if have be quite free from doubt compunction under consciousness that there might be justice in last insinuation hearing breathe quickly after have spoken sat listening frightened wretchedwith dumb inward cry for help to bear nightmare of life in energy be arrested by dread nothing else happened except that remained long while sleepless without speaking again next day mr casaubon received following answer from will ladislaw dear mr casauboni have given due consideration to letter of yesterday be unable to take precisely view of mutual position with fullest acknowledgment of generous conduct to in past must still maintain that obligation of kind can not fairly fetter a appear to expect that must granted that benefactor wish may constitute claim there must always be reservation a to quality of wish may possibly clash with more imperative consideration benefactor veto might impose such negation on man life that consequent blank might be more cruel than benefaction be generous be merely using strong illustration in present case be unable to take view of bearing acceptance of occupationnot enriching certainly not dishonorablewill have on own position seems to too substantial to be affected in shadowy manner though believe that change in relation will occur certainly none have yet occurred can nullify obligation imposed on by past pardon for not seeing that obligation must restrain from using ordinary freedom of living where choose maintaining by lawful occupation may choose regretting that there exists difference between a to relation in conferring of benefit have be entirely on side remain yours with persistent obligation will ladislaw poor mr casaubon felt must not being impartial feel with little that man have juster cause for disgust suspicion than young ladislaw be sure meant to defy annoy meant to win dorotheas confidence sow mind with disrespect perhaps aversion towards husband motive beneath surface have be needed to account for will sudden change of course in rejecting mr casaubons aid quitting travel defiant determination to fix in neighborhood by taking up something so much at variance with former choice a mr brooke middlemarch project revealed clearly enough that undeclared motive have relation to dorothea not for one moment did mr casaubon suspect dorothea of doubleness have suspicion of have what be little le uncomfortable positive knowledge that tendency to form opinion about husband conduct be accompanied with disposition to regard will ladislaw favorably be influenced by what said own proud reticence have prevented from ever being undeceived in supposition that dorothea have originally asked uncle to invite will to house now on receiving will letter mr casaubon have to consider duty must never have be easy to call action anything else than duty in case contending motif thrust back into negation must apply directly to mr brooke demand of troublesome gentleman to revoke proposal must consult sir james chettam get to concur in remonstrance against step touched whole family in case mr casaubon be aware that failure be just a probable a success be impossible for to mention dorotheas name in matter without alarming urgency mr brooke be a likely a not after meeting representation with apparent assent to wind up by saying never fear casaubon depend upon young ladislaw will do credit depend upon have put finger on right thing mr casaubon shrank nervously from communicating on subject with sir james chettam between whom there have never be cordiality who must immediately think of dorothea without mention of poor mr casaubon be distrustful of everybodys feeling towards especially a husband to let one suppose that be jealous must be to admit suspected view of disadvantage to let know that did not find marriage particularly blissful must imply conversion to probably earlier disapproval must be a bad a letting carp brasenose generally know how backward be in organizing matter for key to mythology through life mr casaubon have be trying not to admit even to inward sore of self doubt jealousy on most delicate of personal subject habit of proud suspicious reticence told doubly thus mr casaubon remained proudly bitterly silent have forbidden will to come to lowick manor be mentally preparing other measure of frustration chapter xxxviii cest beaucoup que le jugement de hommes sur le action humaines tt ou tard il devient efficaceguizot sir james chettam must not look with

than worthy did braver thence will spring be to keep hid dr donne sir james chettams mind be not fruitful in device growing anxiety to act on brooke once brought close to constant belief in dorotheas capacity for influence became formative issued in little plan namely to plead celias indisposition a reason for fetching dorothea by to hall to leave at grange with carriage on way after making fully aware of situation concerning management of estate in way happened that one day near four oclock when mr brooke ladislaw be seated in library door opened mr casaubon be announced will moment before

anything to do with why yes dear be quite hobby to draw plan be good to break off little hobby be apt to run away with know doesnt do to be run away with must keep rein have never let be run away with always pulled up be what tell ladislaw be alike know like to go into everything be working at capital punishment will do great deal together ladislaw yes said dorothea with characteristic directness

going to engage mr garth who praised cottage sir james say chettam be little hasty dear said mr brooke coloring slightly little hasty know never said must do anything of kind never said must not do know only feel confident that will do said dorothea in voice a clear unhesitating a of young chorister chanting credo because mean to enter parliament a member who care for improvement of people one of first thing to be made better be state of land laborer think of kit downes uncle who life with wife seven child in house with one sitting room one bedroom hardly larger than tableand poor dagleys in tumble down farmhouse where live in back kitchen leave other room to rat be one reason why did not like picture here dear unclewhich think stupid about used to come from village with dirt coarse ugliness like pain within simpering picture in drawing room seemed to like wicked attempt to find delight in what be false while dont mind how hard truth be for neighbor outside wall think have right to come forward urge wider change for good until have tried to alter evil lie under own hand dorothea have gathered emotion a went on have forgotten everything except relief of pouring forth feeling unchecked experience once habitual with hardly ever present since marriage have be perpetual struggle of energy with fear for moment will admiration be accompanied with chilling sense of remoteness man be seldom ashamed of feeling that can not love woman so well when see certain greatness in nature having intended greatness for men nature have sometimes made sad oversight in carrying out intention a in case of good mr brooke whose masculine consciousness be at moment in rather stammering condition under eloquence of niece must not immediately find other mode of expressing than of rising fixing eye glass fingering paper before at last said there be something in what say dear something in what saybut not everythingeh ladislaw dont like picture statue being found fault with young

felt odd mixture of delight vexation of delight that must dwell be cherished in thought a in pure home without suspicion without stintof vexation because be of too little account with be not formidable enough be treated with unhesitating benevolence did not flatter dread of change in dorothea be stronger than discontent began to speak again in tone of mere explanation mr casaubons reason be displeasure at taking position here considers unsuited to rank a cousin have told can not give way on point be little too hard on to expect that course in life be to be hampered by prejudice think ridiculous obligation may be stretched till be better than brand of slavery stamped on when be too young to know meaning must not have accepted position if have not meant to make useful honorable be not bound to regard family dignity in other light dorothea felt wretched thought husband altogether in wrong on more ground than will have mentioned be better for not to speak on subject said with tremulousness not common in voice since mr casaubon disagree intend to remain be looking out on lawn with melancholy meditation yes will hardly ever see now said will in tone of almost boyish

telling truth about feeling must wait till must do without interruption might wonder be hurt at message be good that must wonder be hurt anger said a anger be apt to say that god be with herthat heaven though be crowded with spirit watching must be on side have determined to ring bell when there came rap at door mr casaubon have sent to say that must have dinner in library wished to be quite alone evening being much occupied will not dine then tantripp oh madam let bring little something be not well get everything ready in dressing room pray disturb again dorothea sat almost motionless in meditative struggle while evening slowly deepened into night struggle changed continually a of man who begin with movement towards striking end with conquering desire to strike energy must animate

coming up stair with light in hand if did not come soon thought that must go down even risk incurring pang must never again expect anything else did hear library door open slowly light advanced up staircase without noise from footstep on carpet when husband stood opposite to saw that face be more haggard started slightly on seeing looked up at beseechingly without speaking dorothea said with gentle surprise in tone be waiting for yes did not like to disturb come dear come be young need not to extend life by watching when kind quiet melancholy of speech fell on dorotheas ear felt something like thankfulness might well up in if have narrowly escaped hurting lamed creature put hand into husband went along broad corridor together book v dead hand chapter xliii figure hath high price t be

such a occur to lady of wealth when life within three mile of town two day after scene in yew tree walk determined to use such opportunity in order if possible to see lydgate learn from whether husband have really felt depressing change of symptom be concealing from whether have insisted on knowing utmost about felt almost guilty in asking for knowledge about from dread of being without itthe dread of ignorance must make unjust hardovercame scruple that there have be crisis in husband mind be certain have very next day begun new method of arranging note have associated quite newly in carrying out plan poor dorothea needed to lay up store of patience be about four oclock when drove to lydgates house in lowick gate wishing in immediate doubt of finding at home that have written beforehand be not at home be mr lydgate at home said dorothea who have never that knew of seen rosamond now remembered fact of marriage yes mr lydgate be at home will go in speak to if will allow will ask if can see mesee mr casaubon for few minute when servant have gone to deliver message dorothea must hear sound of music through open windowa few note from man voice then piano bursting into roulade roulade broke off suddenly then servant came back saying that mr lydgate must be happy to see mr casaubon when drawing room door opened dorothea entered there be sort of contrast not infrequent in country life when habit of different rank be le blent than now let who know tell exactly what stuff be that dorothea wore in day of mild autumnthat thin white woollen stuff soft to touch soft to eye always seemed to have be lately washed to smell of sweet hedgeswas always in shape of pelisse with sleeve hanging out of fashion yet if have entered before still audience a imogene catos daughter dress might have seemed right enough grace dignity be in limb neck about simply parted hair candid eye large round poke be then in fate of woman seemed more odd a head dress than gold trencher call halo by present audience of two person dramatic heroine must have be expected with more interest than mr casaubon to rosamond be one of county divinity not mixing with middlemarch mortality whose slightest mark of manner appearance be worthy of study moreover rosamond be not without satisfaction that mr casaubon must have opportunity of studying what be use of being exquisite if be not seen by best judge since rosamond have received highest compliment at sir godwin lydgates felt quite confident of impression must make on people of good birth dorothea put out hand with usual simple kindness looked admiringly at lydgates lovely brideaware that there be gentleman standing at distance seeing merely a coated figure at wide angle gentleman be too much occupied with presence of one woman to reflect on contrast between twoa contrast must certainly have be striking to calm observer be tall eye be on level imagine rosamonds infantine blondness wondrous crown of hair plait with pale blue dress of fit fashion so perfect that dressmaker must look at without emotion large embroidered collar be to be hoped beholder must know price of small hand duly set off with ring controlled consciousness of manner be expensive substitute for simplicity thank very much for allowing to interrupt said dorothea immediately be anxious to see mr lydgate if possible before go home hoped that might possibly tell where must find even allow to wait for if expect soon be at new hospital said rosamond be not sure how soon will come home can send for will let go fetch said will ladislaw coming forward have already taken up hat before dorothea entered colored with surprise put out hand with smile of unmistakable pleasure saying did not know be have thought of seeing here may go to hospital tell mr lydgate that wish to see said will must be quicker to send carriage for said dorothea if will be kind enough to give message to coachman will be moving to door when dorothea whose mind have flashed in instant over many connected memory turned quickly said will go thank wish to lose time before getting home again will drive to hospital see mr lydgate there pray excuse mr lydgate be very much obliged to mind be evidently arrested by sudden thought left room hardly conscious of what be immediately around herhardly conscious will opened door for offered arm to lead to carriage took arm said nothing will be feeling rather vexed miserable found nothing to say on side handed into carriage in silence said good by dorothea drove away in five minute drive to hospital have time for reflection be quite new to decision to go preoccupation in leaving room have come from sudden sense that there must be sort of deception in voluntarily allowing further intercourse between herself will be unable to mention to husband already errand in seeking lydgate be matter of concealment be have be explicitly in mind have be urged also by vague discomfort now that be alone in drive heard note of man voice accompanying piano have not noted much at time returning on inward sense found thinking with wonder will ladislaw be passing time with mr lydgate in husband absence then must not help remembering that have passed time with under like circumstance so why must there be unfitness in fact will be mr casaubons relative one towards whom be bound to show kindness still there have be sign perhaps ought to have understood a implying that mr casaubon did not like cousin visit during own absence perhaps have be mistaken in many thing said poor dorothea to while tear came rolling have to dry quickly felt confusedly unhappy image of will have be so clear to before be mysteriously spoiled carriage stopped at gate of hospital be soon walking round grass plot with lydgate feeling recovered strong bent have made seek for interview will ladislaw meanwhile be mortified knew reason of clearly enough chance of meeting dorothea be rare here for first time there have come chance have set at disadvantage be not only a have be hitherto that be not supremely occupied with that have seen under circumstance in might appear not to be supremely occupied with felt thrust to new distance from amongst circle of middlemarchers who made part of life be not fault of course since have taken lodging in town have be making a many acquaintance a must position requiring that must know everybody everything lydgate be really better worth knowing than one else in neighborhood happened to have wife who be musical altogether worth calling upon here be whole history of situation in diana have descended too unexpectedly on worshipper be mortifying will be conscious that must not have be at middlemarch for dorothea yet position there be threatening to divide from with barrier of habitual sentiment be more fatal to persistence of mutual interest than distance between rome britain prejudice about rank status be easy enough to defy in form of tyrannical letter from mr casaubon prejudice like odorous body have double existence solid subtlesolid a pyramid subtle a twentieth echo of echo a memory of hyacinth once scented darkness will be of temperament to feel keenly presence of subtlety man of clumsier perception must not have felt a did that for first time sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with have sprung up in dorotheas mind that silence a conducted to carriage have have chill in perhaps casaubon in hatred jealousy have be insisting to dorothea will have slid below socially confound casaubon will re entered drawing room took up hat looking irritated a advanced towards mr lydgate who have seated herself at work table said be always fatal to have music poetry interrupted may come day just finish about rendering of lungi dal caro bene will be happy to be taught said rosamond be sure admit that interruption be very beautiful one quite envy acquaintance with mr casaubon be very clever look a if be really never thought about said will sulkily be just answer tertius gave when first asked if be handsome what be that gentleman be thinking of when be with mr casaubon herself said will not indisposed to provoke charming mr lydgate when one see perfect woman one never think of attributesone be conscious of presence will be jealous when tertius go to lowick said rosamond dimpling speaking with aery lightness will come back think nothing of doe not seem to have be effect on lydgate hitherto mr casaubon be too unlike other woman for to be compared with be devout worshipper perceive often see suppose said will almost pettishly worship be usually matter of theory rather than of practice be practising to excess just at momenti must really tear away pray come again evening mr lydgate will like to hear music can not enjoy so well without when husband be at home again rosamond said standing in front of holding coat collar with hand mr ladislaw be here singing with when mr casaubon came in seemed vexed do think disliked seeing at house surely position be more than equal to hiswhatever may be relation to casaubons must be something else if be really vexed ladislaw be sort of gypsy think nothing of leather prunella music apart be not always very agreeable do like yes think be good fellow rather miscellaneous bric brac likable do know think adores mr casaubon poor devil said lydgate smiling pinching wife ear rosamond felt beginning to know great deal of world especially in discovering what when be in unmarried girlhood have be inconceivable to except a dim tragedy in by gone costumesthat woman even after marriage might make conquest enslave men at time young lady in country even when educated at mr lemon read little french literature later than racine public print have not cast present magnificent illumination over scandal of life still vanity with woman whole mind day to work in can construct abundantly on slight hint especially on such hint a possibility of indefinite conquest how delightful to make captive from throne of marriage with husband a crown prince by sidehimself in fact subjectwhile captive look up forever hopeless losing rest probably if appetite too so much better rosamonds romance turned at present chiefly on crown prince be enough to enjoy assured subjection when said poor devil asked with playful curiosity why so why what can man do when take to adoring one of mermaid only neglect work run up bill be sure neglect work be always at hospital seeing poor patient thinking about doctor quarrel then at home always want to pore over microscope phial confess like thing better than havent ambition enough to wish that husband must be something better than middlemarch doctor said lydgate letting hand fall on to wife shoulder looking at with affectionate gravity will make learn favorite bit from old poet why must pride make stir to be be forgot what good be like to to do worthy writing to write reading world delight what want rosy be to do worthy writingand to write out have done man must work to do pet of course wish to make discovery one must more wish to attain high position in better place than middlemarch can not say have ever tried to hinder from working can not live like hermit be not discontented with tertius dear be too entirely contented what did mr casaubon want to say to merely to ask about husband health think be going to be splendid to new hospital think will give two hundred year chapter xliv must not creep along coast steer out in mid sea by guidance of star when dorothea walking round laurel planted plot of new hospital with lydgate have learned from that there be sign of change in mr casaubons bodily condition beyond mental sign of anxiety to know truth about illness be silent for few moment wondering whether have said done anything to rouse new anxiety lydgate not willing to let slip opportunity of furthering favorite purpose ventured to say dont know whether mr casaubons attention have be drawn to need of new hospital circumstance have made seem rather egotistic in to urge subject be not fault be because there be fight being made against by other medical men think be generally interested in such thing for remember that when first have pleasure of seeing at tipton grange before marriage be asking question about way in health of poor be affected by miserable housing yes indeed said dorothea brightening will be quite grateful to if will tell how can help to make thing little better everything of sort have slipped away from since have be married mean said after moment hesitation that people in village be tolerably comfortable mind have be too much taken up for to inquire further herein such place a middlemarchthere must be great deal to be done there be everything to be done said lydgate with abrupt energy hospital be capital piece of work due entirely to mr bulstrodes exertion in great degree to money one man cant do everything in scheme of sort of course looked forward to help now there mean petty feud set up against thing in town by certain person who want to make failure what can be reason said dorothea with naive surprise chiefly mr bulstrodes unpopularity to begin with town must almost take trouble for sake of thwarting in stupid world most people never consider that thing be good to be done unless be done by own set have connection with bulstrode before came here look at quite impartially see that have notionsthat have set thing on footwhich can turn to good public purpose if fair number of better educated men went to work with belief that observation might contribute to reform of medical doctrine practice must soon see change for better thats point of view hold that by refusing to work with mr bulstrode must be turning back on opportunity of making profession more generally serviceable quite agree with said dorothea at once fascinated by situation sketched in lydgates word what be there against mr bulstrode know that uncle be friendly with people dont like religious tone said lydgate breaking off there be stronger reason for despising such opposition said dorothea looking at affair of middlemarch by light of great persecution to put matter quite fairly have other objection to himhe be masterful rather unsociable be concerned with trade have complaint of own know nothing about what have to do with question whether must not be fine thing to establish here more valuable hospital than have in county immediate motive to opposition however be fact that bulstrode have put medical direction into hand of course be glad of that give opportunity of doing good workand be aware have to justify choice of consequence be that whole profession in middlemarch have set nail against hospital not only refuse to cooperate try to blacken whole affair hinder subscription how very petty exclaimed dorothea indignantly suppose one must expect to fight one way there be hardly anything to be done without ignorance of people about here be stupendous dont lay claim to anything else than having used opportunity have not come within everybodys reach there be stifling offence of being young new comer happening to know something more than old inhabitant still if believe that can set going better method of treatmentif believe that can pursue certain observation inquiry may be lasting benefit to medical practice must be base truckler if allowed consideration of personal comfort to hinder course be clearer from there being salary in question to put persistence in equivocal light be glad have told mr lydgate said dorothea cordially feel sure can help little have money dont know what to do with itthat be often uncomfortable thought to be sure can spare two hundred year for grand purpose like how happy must be to know thing that feel sure will do great good wish must awake with knowledge morning there seems to be so much trouble taken that one can hardly see good of there be melancholy cadence in dorotheas voice a spoke last word presently added more cheerfully pray come to lowick tell more of will mention subject to mr casaubon must hasten home now did mention that evening said that must like to subscribe two hundred yearshe have seven hundred year a equivalent of own fortune settled on at marriage mr casaubon made objection beyond passing remark that sum might be disproportionate in relation to other good object when dorothea in ignorance resisted that suggestion acquiesced did not care about spending money be not reluctant to give if ever felt keenly question of money be through medium of passion than love of material property dorothea told that have seen lydgate recited gist of conversation with about hospital mr casaubon did not question further felt sure that have wished to know what have passed between lydgate know that know said ever restless voice within that increase of tacit knowledge only thrust further off confidence between distrusted affection what loneliness be more lonely than distrust chapter xlv be humor of many head to extol day of forefather declaim against wickedness of time present notwithstanding can not handsomely do without borrowed help satire of time past condemning vice of own time by expression of vice in time commend can not argue community of vice in horace therefore juvenal persius be prophet although line did seem to indigitate point at timessir thomas browne pseudodoxia epidemica opposition to new fever hospital lydgate have sketched to dorothea be like other opposition to be viewed in many different light regarded a mixture of jealousy dunderheaded prejudice mr bulstrode saw in not only medical jealousy determination to thwart prompted mainly by hatred of vital religion of have striven to be effectual lay representativea hatred certainly found pretext apart from religion such a be only too easy to find in entanglement of human action might be called ministerial view opposition have illimitable range of objection at command need never stop short at boundary of knowledge can draw forever on vasts of ignorance what opposition in middlemarch said about new hospital administration have certainly great deal of echo in for heaven have taken care that everybody will not be originator there be difference represented social shade between polished moderation of dr minchin trenchant assertion of mr dollop landlady of tankard in slaughter lane mr dollop became more more convinced by own asseveration that dr lydgate meant to let people die in hospital if not to poison for sake of cutting up without saying by leave with leave for be known fac that have wanted to cut up mr goby a respectable woman a in parley street who have money in trust before marriagea poor tale for doctor who if be good for anything must know what be matter with before died not want to pry into inside after be gone if be not reason mr dollop wished to know what be there be prevalent feeling in audience that opinion be bulwark that if be overthrown there must be limit to cutting up of body a have be well seen in burke hare with pitch plaisterssuch hanging business a be not wanted in middlemarch let not be supposed opinion at tankard in slaughter lane be unimportant to medical profession old authentic public housethe original tankard known by name of dollopswas resort of great benefit club have month before put to vote whether long standing medical man doctor gambit must not be cashiered in favor of doctor lydgate who be capable of performing most astonishing cure rescuing people altogether given up by other practitioner balance have be turned against lydgate by two member who for private reason held that power of resuscitating person a good a dead be equivocal recommendation might interfere with providential favor in course of year however there have be change in public sentiment of unanimity at dollop be index good deal more than year ago before anything be known of lydgates skill judgment on have naturally be divided depending on sense of likelihood situated perhaps in pit of stomach in pineal gland differing in verdict not le valuable a guide in total deficit of evidence patient who have chronic disease whose life have long be worn threadbare like old featherstones have be at once inclined to try also many who did not like paying doctor bill thought agreeably of opening account with new doctor sending for without stint if childrens temper wanted dose occasion when old practitioner be often crusty person thus inclined to employ lydgate held likely that be clever considered that might do more than others where there be liverat least there must be harm in getting few bottle of stuff from since if proved useless must still be possible to return to purifying pill kept alive if did not remove yellowness be people of minor importance good middlemarch family be of course not going to change doctor without reason shown everybody who have employed mr peacock did not feel obliged to accept new man merely in character of successor objecting that be not likely to be equal to peacock lydgate have not be long in town before there be particular enough reported of to breed much more specific expectation to intensify difference into partisanship of particular being of impressive order of significance be entirely hidden like statistical amount without standard of comparison with note of exclamation at end cubic foot of oxygen yearly swallowed by full grown manwhat shudder might have created in middlemarch circle oxygen nobody know what may beis wonder cholera have got to dantzic yet there be people who say quarantine be good one of fact quickly rumored be that lydgate did not dispense drug be offensive to physician whose exclusive distinction seemed infringed on to surgeon apothecary with whom ranged only little while before might have counted on having law on side against man who without calling london made md dared to ask for pay except a charge on drug lydgate have not be experienced enough to foresee that new course must be even more offensive to laity to mr important grocer in top market who though not one of patient questioned in affable manner on subject be injudicious enough to give hasty popular explanation of reason pointing out to mr mawmsey that must lower character of practitioner be constant injury to public if only mode of getting paid for work be by making out long bill for draught bolus mixture be in way hard working medical men may come to be almost a mischievous a quack said lydgate rather thoughtlessly to get own bread must overdose king liege thats bad sort of treason mr mawmseyundermines constitution in fatal way mr mawmsey be not only overseer be about question of outdoor pay that be having interview with lydgate be also asthmatic have increasing family thus from medical point of view a well a from own be important man indeed exceptional grocer whose hair be arranged in flame like pyramid whose retail deference be of cordial encouraging kindjocosely complimentary with certain considerate abstinence from letting out full force of mind be mr mawmseys friendly jocoseness in questioning have set tone of lydgates reply let wise be warned against too great readiness at explanation multiplies source of mistake lengthening sum for reckoner sure to go wrong lydgate smiled a ended speech putting foot into stirrup mr mawmsey laughed more than must have done if have known who king liege be giving good morning sir good morning sir with air of one who saw everything clearly enough in truth view be perturbed for year have be paying bill with strictly made item so for half crown eighteen penny be certain something measurable have be delivered have done with satisfaction including among responsibility a husband father regarding longer bill than usual a dignity worth mentioning moreover in addition to massive benefit of drug to self family have enjoyed pleasure of forming acute judgment a to immediate effect so a to give intelligent statement for guidance of mr gambita practitioner just little lower in status than wrench toller especially esteemed a accoucheur of whose ability mr mawmsey have poorest opinion on other point in doctoring be wont to say in undertone placed gambit above of here be deeper reason than superficial talk of new man appeared still flimsier in drawing room over shop when be recited to mr mawmsey woman accustomed to be made much of a fertile mothergenerally under attendance more le frequent from mr gambit occasionally having attack required dr minchin doe mr lydgate mean to say there be use in taking medicine said mr mawmsey who be slightly given to drawling must like to tell how must bear up at fair time if didnt take strengthening medicine for month beforehand think of what have to provide for calling customer dearhere mr mawmsey turned to intimate female friend who sat bya large veal piea stuffed filleta round of beefham tongue et cetera et cetera what keep up best be pink mixture not brown wonder mr mawmsey with experience must have patience to listen must have told at once knew little better than said mr mawmsey be not going to tell opinion hear everything judge for yourself be motto didnt know who be talking to be not to be turned on finger people often pretend to tell thing when might a well say mawmsey youre fool smile at humor everybodys weak place if physic have done harm to self family must have found out by time next day mr gambit be told that lydgate went about saying physic be of use indeed said lifting eyebrow with cautious surprise be stout husky man with large ring on fourth finger how will cure patient then be what say returned mr mawmsey who habitually gave weight to speech by loading pronoun doe suppose that people will pay only to come sit with go away again mr mawmsey have have great deal of sitting from mr gambit including very full account of own habit of body other affair of course knew there be innuendo in remark since spare time personal narrative have never be charged for so replied humorously well lydgate be good looking young fellow know not one must employ said mr mawmsey others may do a please hence mr gambit must go away from chief grocer without fear of rivalry not without sense lydgate be one of hypocrite who try to discredit others by advertising own honesty that might be worth people while to show up mr gambit however have satisfactory practice much pervaded by smell of retail trading suggested reduction of cash payment to balance did not think worth while to show lydgate up until knew how have not indeed great resource of education have have to work own way against good deal of professional contempt made none worse accoucheur for calling breathing apparatus longs other medical men felt more capable mr toller shared highest practice in town belonged to old middlemarch family there be toller in law everything else above line of retail trade unlike irascible friend wrench have easiest way in world of taking thing might be supposed to annoy being well bred quietly facetious man who kept good house be very fond of little sporting when must get very friendly with mr hawley hostile to mr bulstrode may seem odd that with such pleasant habit must have be given to heroic treatment bleeding blistering starving patient with dispassionate disregard to personal example incongruity favored opinion of ability among patient who commonly observed that mr toller have lazy manner treatment be a active a must desire man said carried more seriousness into profession be little slow in coming when came did something be great favorite in own circle implied to one disadvantage told doubly from careless ironical tone naturally got tired of smiling saying ah when be told that mr peacock successor did not mean to dispense medicine mr hackbutt one day mentioning over wine at dinner party mr toller said laughingly dibbitts will get rid of stale drug then im fond of little dibbittsim glad he in luck see meaning toller said mr hackbutt be entirely of opinion will take opportunity of expressing to effect medical man must be responsible for quality of drug consumed by patient be rationale of system of charging have hitherto obtained nothing be more offensive than ostentation of reform where there be real amelioration ostentation hackbutt said mr toller ironically dont see that man cant very well be ostentatious of what nobody belief in there reform in matter question be whether profit on drug be paid to medical man by druggist by patient whether there will be extra pay under name of attendance ah to be sure one of damned new version of old humbug said mr hawley passing decanter to mr wrench mr wrench generally abstemious often drank wine rather freely at party getting more irritable in consequence a to humbug hawley said thats word easy to fling about what contend against be way medical men be fouling own nest setting up cry about country a if general practitioner who dispenses drug couldnt be gentleman throw back imputation with scorn say most ungentlemanly trick man can be guilty of be to come among member of profession with innovation be libel on time honored procedure be opinion be ready to maintain against one who contradicts mr wrench voice have become exceedingly sharp cant oblige there wrench said mr hawley thrusting hand into trouser pocket dear fellow said mr toller striking in pacifically looking at mr wrench physician have toe trodden on more than have if come to dignity be question for minchin sprague doe medical jurisprudence provide nothing against infringement said mr hackbutt with disinterested desire to offer light how doe law stand eh hawley nothing to be done there said mr hawley looked into for sprague youd only break nose against damned judge decision pooh need of law said mr toller so far a practice be concerned attempt be absurdity patient will like itcertainly not peacock who have be used to depletion pas wine mr toller prediction be partly verified if mr mr mawmsey who have idea of employing lydgate be made uneasy by supposed declaration against drug be inevitable that who called in must watch little anxiously to see whether did use mean might use in case even good mr powderell who in constant charity of interpretation be inclined to esteem lydgate more for what seemed conscientious pursuit of better plan have mind disturbed with doubt during wife attack of erysipelas must not abstain from mentioning to lydgate mr peacock on similar occasion have administered series of bolus be not otherwise definable than by remarkable effect in bringing mr powderell round before michaelmas from illness have begun in remarkably hot august at last indeed in conflict between desire not to hurt lydgate anxiety that mean must be lacking induced wife privately to take widgeon purifying pill esteemed middlemarch medicine arrested disease at fountain by setting to work at once upon blood co operative measure be not to be mentioned to lydgate mr powderell have certain reliance on only hoping that might be attended with blessing in doubtful stage of lydgates introduction be helped by what mortal rashly call good fortune suppose doctor ever came newly to place without making cure surprised somebodycures may be called fortune testimonial deserve a much credit a written printed kind various patient got well while lydgate be attending even of dangerous illness be remarked that new doctor with new way have at least merit of bringing people back from brink of death trash talked on such occasion be more vexatious to lydgate because gave precisely sort of prestige incompetent unscrupulous man must desire be sure to be imputed to by simmering dislike of other medical men a encouragement on own part of ignorant puffing even proud outspokenness be checked by discernment that be a useless to fight against interpretation of ignorance a to whip fog good fortune insisted on using interpretation mr larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming symptom in charwoman when dr minchin called asked to see then there to give certificate for infirmary whereupon after examination wrote statement of case a one of tumor recommended bearer nancy nash a out patient nancy calling at home on way to infirmary allowed stay maker wife in whose attic lodged to read dr minchins paper by mean became subject of compassionate conversation in neighboring shop of churchyard lane a being afflicted with tumor at first declared to be a large hard a duck egg later in day to be about size of fist most hearer agreed that must have to be cut out one have known of oil of squitchineal a adequate to soften reduce lump in body when taken enough of into insidethe oil by gradually soopling squitchineal by eating away meanwhile when nancy presented at infirmary happened to be one of lydgates day there after questioning examining lydgate said to house surgeon in undertone not tumor cramp ordered blister steel mixture told to go home rest giving at same time note to mr larcher who said be best employer to testify that be in need of good food by by nancy in attic became portentously worse supposed tumor having indeed given way to blister only wandered to region with angrier pain staymakers wife went to fetch lydgate continued for fortnight to attend nancy in own home until under treatment got quite well went to work again case continued to be described a one of tumor in churchyard lane other streetsnay by mr larcher also for when lydgates remarkable cure be mentioned to dr minchin naturally did not like to say case be not one of tumor be mistaken in describing a such answered indeed ah saw be surgical case not of fatal kind have be inwardly annoyed however when have asked at infirmary about woman have recommended two day before to hear from house surgeon youngster who be not sorry to vex minchin with impunity exactly what have occurred privately pronounced that be indecent in general practitioner to contradict physician diagnosis in open manner afterwards agreed with wrench that lydgate be disagreeably inattentive to etiquette lydgate did not make affair ground for valuing very particularly despising minchin such rectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal qualification report took up amazing case of tumor not clearly distinguished from cancer considered more awful for being of wandering sort till much prejudice against lydgates method a to drug be overcome by proof of marvellous skill in speedy restoration of nancy nash after have be rolling rolling in agony from presence of tumor hard obstinate nevertheless compelled to yield how must lydgate help be offensive to tell lady when be expressing amazement at skill that be altogether mistaken rather foolish in amazement to have entered into nature of disease must only have added to breach of medical propriety thus have to wince under promise of success given by ignorant praise miss valid quality in case of more conspicuous patient mr borthrop trumbull lydgate be conscious of having shown something better than day doctor though here too be equivocal advantage that won eloquent auctioneer be seized with pneumonia having be patient of mr peacock sent for lydgate whom have expressed intention to patronize mr trumbull be robust man good subject for trying expectant theory uponwatching course of interesting disease when left a much a possible to so that stage might be noted for future guidance from air with described sensation lydgate surmised that must like to be taken into medical man confidence be represented a partner in own cure auctioneer heard without much surprise that be constitution always with due watching might be left to so a to offer beautiful example of disease with phase seen in clear delineation that probably have rare strength of mind voluntarily to become test of rational procedure thus make disorder of pulmonary function general benefit to society mr trumbull acquiesced at once entered strongly into view that illness of be ordinary occasion for medical science never fear sir be not speaking to one who be altogether ignorant of vi medicatrix said with usual superiority of expression made rather pathetic by difficulty of breathing went without shrinking through abstinence from drug much sustained by application of thermometer implied importance of temperature by sense that furnished object for microscope by learning many new word seemed suited to dignity of secretion for lydgate be acute enough to indulge with little technical talk may be imagined that mr trumbull rose from couch with disposition to speak of illness in have manifested strength of mind a well a constitution be not backward in awarding credit to medical man who have discerned quality of patient have to deal with auctioneer be not ungenerous man liked to give others due feeling that must afford have caught word expectant method rang chime on other learned phrase to accompany assurance lydgate knew thing two more than rest of doctorswas far better versed in secret of profession than majority of compeer have happened before affair of fred vincys illness have given to mr wrench enmity towards lydgate more definite personal ground new comer already threatened to be nuisance in shape of rivalry be certainly nuisance in shape of practical criticism reflection on hard driven elder who have have something else to do than to busy with untried notion practice have spread in one two quarter from first report of high family have led to being pretty generally invited so that other medical men have to meet at dinner in best house having to meet man whom dislike be not observed always to end in mutual attachment there be hardly ever so much unanimity among a in opinion that lydgate be arrogant young fellow yet ready for sake of ultimately predominating to show crawling subservience to bulstrode that mr farebrother whose name be chief flag of anti bulstrode party always defended lydgate made friend of be referred to farebrothers unaccountable way of fighting on side here be plenty of preparation for outburst of professional disgust at announcement of law mr bulstrode be laying down for direction of new hospital be more exasperating because there be present possibility of interfering with will pleasure everybody except lord medlicote having refused help towards building on ground that preferred giving to old infirmary mr bulstrode met expense have ceased to be sorry that be purchasing right to carry out notion of improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutor have have to spend large sum building have lingered caleb garth have undertaken have failed during progress before interior fitting be begun have retired from management of business when referring to hospital often said that however bulstrode might ring if tried liked good solid carpentry masonry have notion of drain chimney in fact hospital have become object of intense interest to bulstrode must willingly have continued to spare large yearly sum that might rule dictatorially without board have favorite object also required money for accomplishment wished to buy land in neighborhood of middlemarch therefore wished to get considerable contribution towards maintaining hospital meanwhile framed plan of management hospital be to be reserved for fever in form lydgate be to be chief medical superintendent that might have free authority to pursue comparative investigation study particularly in paris have shown importance of other medical visitor having consultative influence power to contravene lydgates ultimate decision general management be to be lodged exclusively in hand of five director associated with mr bulstrode who be to have vote in ratio of contribution board filling up vacancy in number mob of small contributor being admitted to share of government there be immediate refusal on part of medical man in town to become visitor at fever hospital very well said lydgate to mr bulstrode have capital house surgeon dispenser clear headed neat handed fellow well get webbe from crabsley a good country practitioner a of to come over twice week in case of exceptional operation protheroe will come from brassing must work harder thats have given up post at infirmary plan will flourish in spite of then theyll be glad to come in thing cant last a be there must be sort of reform soon then young fellow may be glad to come study here lydgate be in high spirit will not flinch may depend upon mr lydgate said mr bulstrode while see carrying out high intention with vigor will have unfailing support have humble confidence that blessing have hitherto attended effort against spirit of evil in town will not be withdrawn suitable director to assist have doubt of securing mr brooke of tipton have already given concurrence pledge to contribute yearly have not specified sumprobably not great one will be useful member of board useful member be perhaps to be defined a one who must originate nothing always vote with mr bulstrode medical aversion to lydgate be hardly disguised now dr sprague dr minchin said that disliked lydgates knowledge disposition to improve treatment what disliked be arrogance nobody felt to be altogether deniable implied that be insolent pretentious given to reckless innovation for sake of noise show be essence of charlatan word charlatan once thrown on air must not be let drop in day world be agitated about wondrous doings of mr st john long nobleman gentleman attesting extraction of fluid like mercury from temple of patient mr toller remarked one day smilingly to mr taft that bulstrode have found man to suit in lydgate charlatan in religion be sure to like other sort of charlatan yes indeed can imagine said mr taft keeping number of thirty stitch carefully in mind while there be so many of sort remember mr cheshire with iron trying to make people straight when almighty have made crooked said mr toller cheshire be rightall fair above board there st john longthats kind of fellow call charlatan advertising cure in way nobody know anything about fellow who want to make noise by pretending to go deeper than other people other day be pretending to tap man brain get quicksilver out of good gracious what dreadful trifling with people constitution said mr taft after came to be held in various quarter lydgate played even with respectable constitution for own purpose how much more likely that in flighty experimenting must make six seven of hospital patient especially be to be expected a landlady of tankard have said that must recklessly cut up dead body for lydgate having attended mr goby who died apparently of heart disease not very clearly expressed in symptom too daringly asked leave of relative to open body thus gave offence quickly spreading beyond parley street where lady have long resided on income such a made association of body with victim of burke hare flagrant insult to memory affair be in stage when lydgate opened subject of hospital to dorothea see that be bearing enmity silly misconception with much spirit aware that be partly created by good share of success will not drive away said talking confidentially in mr farebrothers study have got good opportunity here for end care most about be pretty sure to get income enough for want by by will go on a quietly a possible have seduction now away from home work be more more convinced that will be possible to demonstrate homogeneous origin of tissue raspail others be on same track have be losing time have power of prophecy there said mr farebrother who have be puffing at pipe thoughtfully while lydgate talked a to hostility in town youll weather if be prudent how be to be prudent said lydgate just do what come before to do cant help people ignorance spite more than vesalius must isnt possible to square one conduct to silly conclusion nobody can foresee quite true didnt mean meant only two thing one be keep a separable from bulstrode a can of course can go on doing good work of own by help dont get tied perhaps seems like personal feeling in to say soand there good deal of ownbut personal feeling be not always in wrong if boil down to impression make simply opinion bulstrode be nothing to said lydgate carelessly except on public ground a to getting very closely united to be not fond enough of for be other thing meant said lydgate who be nursing leg a comfortably a possible feeling in great need of advice why take careexperto credetake care not to get hampered about money matter know by word let fall one day that dont like playing at card so much for money be right enough there try keep clear of wanting small sum that havent got be perhaps talking rather superfluously man like to assume superiority over by holding up bad example sermonizing on lydgate took mr farebrothers hint very cordially though must hardly have borne from man must not help remembering that have lately made debt have seemed inevitable have intention now to do more than keep house in simple way furniture for owed must not want renewing even stock of wine for long while many thought cheered at timeand justly man conscious of enthusiasm for worthy aim be sustained under petty hostility by memory of great worker who have to fight way not without wound who hover in mind a patron saint invisibly helping at home same evening when have be chatting with mr farebrother have long leg stretched on sofa head thrown back hand clasped behind according to favorite ruminating attitude while rosamond sat at piano played one tune after of husband only knew like emotional elephant be that fell in with mood a if have be melodious sea breeze there be something very fine in lydgates look just then one might have be encouraged to bet on achievement in dark eye on mouth brow there be that placidity come from fulness of contemplative thoughtthe mind not searching beholding glance seeming to be filled with what be behind presently rosamond left piano seated on chair close to sofa opposite husband face be that enough music for lord said folding hand before putting on little air of meekness yes dear if be tired said lydgate gently turning eye resting on not otherwise moving rosamonds presence at moment be perhaps no more than spoonful brought to lake woman instinct in matter be not dull what be absorbing said leaning forward bringing face nearer to moved hand placed gently behind shoulder be thinking of great fellow who be about a old a be three hundred year ago have already begun new era in anatomy cant guess said rosamond shaking head used to play at guessing historical character at mr lemon not anatomist ill tell name be vesalius only way must get to know anatomy a did be by going to snatch body at night from graveyard place of execution oh said rosamond with look of disgust on pretty face be very glad be not vesalius must have thought might find le horrible way than couldnt said lydgate going on too earnestly to take much notice of answer must only get complete skeleton by snatching whitened bone of criminal from gallows burying fetching away by bit secretly in dead of night hope be not one of great hero said rosamond half playfully anxiously else will have getting up in night to go to st peter churchyard know how angry told people be about mr goby have enemy enough already so have vesalius rosy wonder medical fogy in middlemarch be jealous when of greatest doctor living be fierce upon vesalius because have believed in galen showed that galen be wrong called liar poisonous monster fact of human frame be on side so got better of what happened to afterwards said rosamond with interest oh have good deal of fighting to last did exasperate enough at one time to make burn good deal of work then got shipwrecked just a be coming from jerusalem to take great chair at padua died rather miserably there be moment pause before rosamond said do know tertius often wish have not be medical man nay rosy dont say that said lydgate drawing closer to be like saying wish have married man not at be clever enough for anything might easily have be something else cousin at quallingham think that have sunk below in choice of profession cousin at quallingham may go to devil said lydgate with scorn be like impudence if said anything of sort to still said rosamond think be nice profession dear know that have much quiet perseverance in opinion be grandest profession in world rosamond said lydgate gravely to say that love without loving medical man in be same sort of thing a to say that like eating peach dont like flavor dont say that again dear pain very well doctor grave face said rosy dimpling will declare in future that dote on skeleton body snatcher bit of thing in phial quarrel with everybody end in dying miserably not so bad a said lydgate giving up remonstrance petting resignedly chapter xlvi pues podemos haber aquello que queremos queramos aquello que podremos since can not get what like let like what can getspanish proverb while lydgate safely married with hospital under command felt struggling for medical reform against middlemarch middlemarch be becoming more more conscious of national struggle for kind of reform by time that lord john russell measure be being debated in house of common there be new political animation in middlemarch new definition of party might show decided change of balance if new election came there be who already predicted event declaring that reform bill must never be carried by actual parliament be what will ladislaw dwelt on to mr brooke a reason for congratulation that have not yet tried strength at hustings thing will grow ripen a if be comet year said will public temper will soon get to cometary heat now question of reform have set in there be likely to be election before long by time middlemarch will have got more idea into head what have to work at now be pioneer political meeting quite right ladislaw will make new thing of opinion here said mr brooke only want to keep independent about reform know dont want to go too far want to take up wilberforces romillys line know work at negro emancipation criminal lawthat kind of thing of course must support grey if go in for principle of reform must be prepared to take what situation offer said will if everybody pulled for own bit against everybody else whole question must go to tatter yes yes agree with youi quite take point of view must put in light must support grey know dont want to change balance of constitution dont think grey must be what country want said will else there must be meaning in political union other movement know what about want to have house of common be not weighted with nominee of landed class with representative of other interest a to contending for reform short of that be like asking for bit of avalanche have already begun to thunder be fine ladislaw be way to put write that down now must begin to get document about feeling of country a well a machine breaking general distress a to document said will two inch card will hold plenty few row of figure be enough to deduce misery from few more will show rate at political determination of people be growing good draw out little more at length ladislaw be idea now write out in pioneer put figure deduce misery know put other figure deduceand so on have way of putting thing burke nowwhen think of burke cant help wishing somebody have pocket borough to give ladislaw youd never get elected know will always want talent in house reform a will will always want talent that avalanche thunder now be really little like burke want that sort of thingnot idea know way of putting pocket borough must be fine thing said ladislaw if be always in right pocket there be always burke at hand will be not displeased with complimentary comparison even from mr brooke for be little too trying to human flesh to be conscious of expressing one self better than others never to have noticed in general dearth of admiration for right thing even chance bray of applause falling exactly in time be rather fortifying will felt that literary refinement be usually beyond limit of middlemarch perception nevertheless be beginning thoroughly to like work of when began have said to rather languidly why notand studied political situation with a ardent interest a have ever given to poetic metre mediaevalism be undeniable that for desire to be where dorothea be perhaps want of knowing what else to do will must not at time have be meditating on need of english people criticising english statesmanship must probably have be rambling in italy sketching plan for several drama trying prose finding too jejune trying verse finding too artificial beginning to copy bit from old picture leaving off because be good observing that after self culture be principal point while in politics must have be sympathizing warmly with liberty progress in general sense of duty must often wait for work will take place of dilettanteism make feel that quality of action be not matter of indifference ladislaw have now accepted bit of work though be not that indeterminate loftiest thing have once dreamed of a alone worthy of continuous effort nature warmed easily in presence of subject be visibly mixed with life action easily stirred rebellion in helped glow of public spirit in spite of mr casaubon banishment from lowick be rather happy getting great deal of fresh knowledge in vivid way for practical purpose making pioneer celebrated a far a brassing never mind smallness of area writing be not worse than much that reach four corner of earth mr brooke be occasionally irritating will impatience be relieved by division of time between visit to grange retreat to middlemarch lodging gave variety to life shift peg little said to mr brooke might be in cabinet while be under secretary be common order of thing little wave make large one be of same pattern be better here than in sort of life mr casaubon must have trained for where doing must be laid down by precedent too rigid for to react upon dont care for prestige high pay a lydgate have said of be sort of gypsy rather enjoying sense of belonging to class have feeling of romance in position pleasant consciousness of creating little surprise wherever went that sort of enjoyment have be disturbed when have felt new distance between dorothea in accidental meeting at lydgates irritation have gone out towards mr casaubon who have declared beforehand will must lose caste never have caste must have said if prophecy have be uttered to quick blood must have come gone like breath in transparent skin be one thing to like defiance thing to like consequence meanwhile town opinion about new editor of pioneer be tending to confirm mr casaubons view will relationship in distinguished quarter did not like lydgates high connection serve a advantageous introduction if be rumored that young ladislaw be mr casaubons nephew cousin be also rumored that mr casaubon must have nothing to do with brooke have taken up said mr hawley because be what man in sens must have expected casaubon have devilish good reason may be sure for turning cold shoulder on young fellow whose bringing up paid for just like brookeone of fellow who must praise cat to sell horse oddity of will more le poetical appeared to support mr keck editor of trumpet in asserting that ladislaw if truth be known be not only polish emissary crack brained accounted for preternatural quickness glibness of speech when got on to platformas did whenever have opportunity speaking with facility cast reflection on solid englishman generally be disgusting to keck to see strip of fellow with light curl round head get up speechify by hour against institution have existed when be in cradle in leading article of trumpet keck characterized ladislaws speech at reform meeting a violence of energumena miserable effort to shroud in brilliancy of firework daring of irresponsible statement poverty of knowledge be of cheapest most recent description be rattling article yesterday keck said dr sprague with sarcastic intention what be energumen oh term came up in french revolution said keck dangerous aspect of ladislaw be strangely contrasted with other habit became matter of remark have fondness half artistic half affectionate for little childrenthe smaller be on tolerably active leg funnier clothing better will liked to surprise please know that in rome be given to ramble about among poor people taste did not quit in middlemarch have somehow picked up troop of droll child little hatless boy with galligaskins much worn scant shirting to hang out little

clear day to gather stick for bonfire in hollow of hillside where drew out small feast of gingerbread for improvised punch judy drama with private home made puppet here be one oddity be that in house where got friendly be given to stretch at full length on rug while talked be apt to be discovered in attitude by occasional caller for whom irregularity be likely to confirm notion of dangerously mixed blood general laxity will article speech naturally recommended in family new strictness of party division have marked off on side of reform be invited to mr bulstrodes here must not lie down on rug mr bulstrode felt that mode of talking about catholic country a if there be truce with antichrist illustrated usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men at mr farebrothers however whom irony of event have brought on same side with bulstrode in national movement will became favorite with lady especially with little miss noble whom be one of oddity to escort when met in street with little basket giving arm in eye of town insisting on going with to pay call where distributed small filchings from own share of sweet thing house where visited oftenest lay most on rug be lydgates two men be not at alike agreed none worse lydgate be abrupt not irritable taking little notice of megrim in healthy people ladislaw did not usually throw away susceptibility on who took notice of with rosamond on other hand pouted be waywardnay often uncomplimentary much to inward surprise nevertheless be gradually becoming necessary to entertainment by companionship in music varied talk freedom from grave preoccupation with husband tenderness indulgence often made manner unsatisfactory to confirmed dislike of medical profession lydgate inclined to be sarcastic on superstitious faith of people in efficacy of bill while nobody cared about low state of pathology sometimes assailed will with troublesome question one evening in march rosamond in cherry colored dress with swansdown trimming about throat sat at tea table lydgate lately come in tired from outdoor work be seated sideways on easy chair by fire with one leg over elbow brow looking little troubled a eye rambled over column of pioneer while rosamond having noticed that be perturbed avoided looking at inwardly thanked heaven that have not moody disposition will ladislaw be stretched on rug contemplating curtain pole abstractedly humming very low note of when first saw thy face while house spaniel also stretched out with small choice of room looked from between paw at usurper of rug with silent strong objection rosamond bringing lydgate cup of tea threw down paper said to will who have started up gone to table use puffing brooke a reforming landlord ladislaw only pick more hole in coat in trumpet matter who read pioneer dont read trumpet said will swallowing tea walking about do suppose public read with view to own conversion must have witch brewing with vengeance thenmingle mingle mingle mingle that mingle mayand nobody must know side be going to take farebrother say doesnt believe brooke must get elected if opportunity came very men who profess to be for must bring member out of bag at right moment there harm in trying good to have resident member why said lydgate who be much given to use inconvenient word in curt tone represent local stupidity better said will laughing shaking curl be kept on best behavior in neighborhood brooke be not bad fellow have done good thing on estate that never must have done for parliamentary bite he not fitted to be public man said lydgate with contemptuous decision must disappoint everybody who counted on can see at hospital only there bulstrode hold rein drive depends on how fix standard of public men said will he good enough for occasion when people have made up mind a be making up now dont want manthey only want vote be way with political writer ladislawcrying up measure a if be universal cure cry up men who be part of very disease that want curing why not men may help to cure off face of land without knowing said will who must find reason impromptu when have not thought of question beforehand be excuse for encouraging superstitious exaggeration of hope about particular measure helping cry to swallow whole to send up voting popinjay who be good for nothing to carry go against rottenness there be nothing more thoroughly rotten than making people believe that society can be cured by political hocus pocus thats very fine dear fellow cure must begin somewhere put that thousand thing debase population can never be reformed without particular reform to begin with look what stanley said other daythat house have be tinkering long enough at small question of bribery inquiring whether that voter have have

be one man who must carry medical reform who must oppose must inquire have better motif even better brain oh of course said lydgate seeing checkmated by move have often used if one did not work with such men a be at hand thing must come to dead lock suppose worst opinion in town about bulstrode be true one must not make le true that have sense resolution to do what think ought to be done in matter know care most about be only ground on go with lydgate added rather proudly bearing in mind mr farebrothers remark be nothing to otherwise must not cry up on personal groundi must keep clear of do mean that cry up brooke on personal ground said will ladislaw nettled turning sharp round for first time felt offended with lydgate not le so perhaps because must have declined close inquiry into growth of relation to mr brooke not at said lydgate be simply explaining own action meant that man may work for special end with others whose motif general course be equivocal if be quite sure of personal independence that be not working for private interesteither place money then why dont extend liberality to others said will still nettled personal independence be a important to a yours be to have more reason to imagine have personal expectation from brooke than have to imagine that have personal expectation from bulstrode motif be point of honor supposenobody can prove a to money place in world will ended tossing back head think be pretty clear that be not determined by consideration of sort quite mistake ladislaw said lydgate surprised have be preoccupied with own vindication have be blind to what ladislaw might infer on own account beg pardon for unintentionally annoying in fact must rather attribute to romantic disregard of own worldly interest on political question referred simply to intellectual bias how very unpleasant be evening said rosamond can not conceive why money must have be referred to politics medicine be sufficiently disagreeable to quarrel upon can of go on quarrelling with world with other on two topic rosamond looked mildly neutral a said rising to ring bell then crossing to work table poor rosy said lydgate putting out hand to a be passing disputation be not amusing to cherub have music ask ladislaw to sing with when will be gone rosamond said to husband what put out of temper evening tertius be ladislaw who be out of temper be like bit of tinder mean before something have vexed before came in looked cross that made begin to dispute with mr ladislaw hurt very much when look so tertius do then be brute said lydgate caressing penitently what vexed oh outdoor thingsbusiness be really letter insisting on payment of bill for furniture rosamond be expecting to have baby lydgate wished to save from perturbation chapter xlvii be never true love

towards lydgatea heat still kept restless be not making fool of himselfand at time when be more than ever conscious of being something better than fool for what end well for definite end true have

otherwise be practical heaven be not only that be unwilling to entertain thought must be accused of baseness be already uneasy in sense that have to justify from charge of ingratitudethe latent

prohibition to visit lowick dorothea will be displeased nonsense argued inclination must be too monstrous for to hinder from going out to pretty country church on spring morning dorothea will be glad

wore black gown mounted to highest box a probably chief of better one most awful if offended even in lowick be at peace not more agitated by reform than by solemn tenor of sunday sermon congregation have be used to seeing will at church in former day one took much note of except choir who expected to make figure in singing dorothea did at last appear on quaint background walking up short aisle in white beaver bonnet gray cloakthe same have worn in vatican face being from entrance towards chancel even shortsighted eye soon discerned will there be outward show of feeling except slight paleness grave bow a passed to own surprise will felt suddenly uncomfortable dared not look at after have bowed to other two minute later when mr casaubon came out of vestry entering pew seated in face of dorothea will felt paralysis more complete must look nowhere except at choir in little gallery over vestry door dorothea be perhaps pained have made wretched blunder be no longer amusing to vex mr casaubon who have advantage probably of watching seeing that dared not turn head why have not imagined beforehandbut must not expect that must sit in square pew alone unrelieved by tucker who have apparently departed from lowick altogether for new clergyman be in desk still called stupid now for not foreseeing that must be impossible for to look towards dorotheanay that might feel coming

vainly strive to run see white lock streaming in wind face be haggard a look at slow turning in constant clasping round storm driven dorotheas distress when be leaving church came chiefly from perception that mr casaubon be determined not to speak to cousin that will presence at church have served to mark more strongly alienation between will coming seemed to quite excusable nay thought amiable movement in towards reconciliation have be constantly wishing for have probably imagined a have that if mr casaubon must meet easily must shake hand friendly intercourse might return now dorothea felt quite robbed of hope will be banished further than ever for mr casaubon must have be newly embittered by thrusting upon of presence refused to recognize have not be very well that morning suffering from difficulty in breathing have not preached in consequence be not surprised therefore that be nearly silent at luncheon still le that made allusion to will ladislaw for own part felt that must never again introduce that subject usually spent apart hour between luncheon dinner on sunday mr casaubon in library dozing chiefly dorothea in boudoir where be wont to occupy with of

able to repose on delight in what be thing that liked that spontaneously cared to have seemed to be always excluded from life for if be only granted not shared by husband might a well have be denied about will ladislaw there have be difference between from first have ended since mr casaubon have so severely repulsed dorotheas strong feeling about claim on family property by being convinced that be in right husband in wrong that be helpless afternoon helplessness be more wretchedly benumbing than ever longed for object who must be dear to to whom must be dear longed for work must be directly beneficent like sunshine rain now appeared that be to live more more in virtual tomb where there be apparatus of ghastly labor producing what must never see light today have stood at door of tomb seen

proposal be only one more sign added to many since memorable interview with lydgate mr casaubons original reluctance to let dorothea work with have given place to contrary disposition namely to demand much interest labor from after have read marked for two hour said will take volume up stairsand pencil if pleaseand in case of reading in night can pursue task be not wearisome to trust dorothea prefer always reading what like best to hear said dorothea who told simple truth for what dreaded be to exert in reading anything else left a joyless a ever be proof of force with certain characteristic in dorothea impressed around that husband with jealousy suspicion have gathered implicit trust in integrity of promise power of devoting to idea of right best of late have begun to feel that quality be peculiar possession for wanted to engross reading in night did come dorothea in young weariness have slept soon fast be awakened by sense of light seemed to at first like sudden vision of sunset after have climbed steep hill opened eye saw husband wrapped in warm gown seating in arm chair near fire place where ember be still glowing have lit two candle expecting that dorothea must awake not liking to rouse by more direct mean be ill edward said rising immediately felt uneasiness in reclining posture will sit here for time threw wood on fire wrapped up said must like to read to must oblige greatly by doing so dorothea said mr casaubon with shade more meekness than usual in polite manner be wakeful mind be remarkably lucid fear that excitement may be too great for said dorothea remembering lydgates caution be not conscious of undue excitement thought be easy dorothea dared not insist read for hour more on same plan a have done in evening getting over page with more quickness mr casaubons mind be more alert seemed to anticipate what be coming after very slight verbal indication saying will domark thator pas on to next headi omit second excursus on crete dorothea be amazed to think of bird like speed with mind be surveying ground where have be creeping for year at last said close book now dear will resume work to morrow have deferred too long must gladly see completed observe that principle on selection be made be to give adequate not disproportionate illustration to of thesis enumerated in introduction a at present sketched have perceived that distinctly dorothea yes said dorothea rather tremulously felt sick at heart now think that can take repose said mr casaubon laid down again begged to put out light when have down too there be darkness only broken by dull glow on hearth said before sleep have request to make dorothea what be said dorothea with dread in mind be that will let know deliberately whether in case of death will carry out wish whether will avoid doing what must deprecate apply to do what must desire dorothea be not taken by surprise many incident have be leading to conjecture of intention on husband part might make new yoke for did not answer immediately refuse said mr casaubon with more edge in tone yet refuse said dorothea in clear voice need of freedom asserting within be too solemni think be not rightto make promise when be ignorant what will bind to whatever affection prompted must do without promising must use own judgment ask to obey mine refuse dear said dorothea beseechingly crushed by opposing fear may wait reflect little while desire with whole soul to do what will comfort can not give pledge suddenlystill le pledge to do know not what can not then confide in nature of wish grant till to morrow said dorothea beseechingly till to morrow then said mr casaubon soon must hear that be sleeping there be more sleep for while constrained to lie still lest must disturb mind be carrying on conflict in imagination ranged force first on one side then on other have presentiment that power husband wished to establish over future action have relation to anything else than work be clear enough to that must expect to devote to sifting mixed heap of material be to be doubtful illustration of principle still more doubtful poor child have become altogether unbelieving a to trustworthiness of key have made ambition labor of husband life be not wonderful that in spite of small instruction judgment in matter be truer than for looked with unbiassed comparison healthy sense at probability on have risked egoism now pictured to herself day month year must spend in sorting what might be called shattered mummy fragment of tradition be mosaic wrought from crushed ruinssorting a food for theory be already withered in birth like elfin child doubtless vigorous error vigorously pursued have kept embryo of truth breathing quest of gold being at same time questioning of substance body of chemistry be prepared for soul lavoisier be born mr casaubons theory of element made seed of tradition be not likely to bruise unawares against discovery floated among flexible conjecture more solid than etymology seemed strong because of likeness in sound until be shown that likeness in sound made impossible be method of interpretation be not tested by necessity of forming anything have sharper collision than elaborate notion of gog magog be a free from interruption a plan for threading star together dorothea have so often have to check weariness impatience over questionable riddle guessing a revealed to instead of fellowship in high knowledge be to make life worthier must understand well enough now why husband have come to cling to a possibly only hope left that labor must ever take shape in must be given to world at first have seemed that wished to keep even aloof from close knowledge of what be doing gradually terrible stringency of human needthe prospect of too speedy death here dorotheas pity turned from own future to husband pastnay to present hard struggle with lot have grown out of past lonely labor ambition breathing hardly under pressure of self distrust goal receding heavier limb now at last sword visibly trembling above have not wished to marry that might help in life laborbut have thought work be to be something greater must serve in devoutly for own sake be right even to soothe griefwould be possible even if promisedto work a in treadmill fruitlessly yet must deny must say refuse to content pining hunger must be refusing to do for dead what be almost sure to do for living if lived a lydgate have said might for fifteen year more life must certainly be spent in helping obeying still there be deep difference between devotion to living that indefinite promise of devotion to dead while lived must claim nothing that must not still be free to remonstrate against even to refuse butthe thought passed through mind more than once though must not believe in itmight not mean to demand something more from than have be able to imagine since wanted pledge to carry out wish without telling exactly what be heart be bound up in work only be end for failing life be to be eked out by hers now if be to say if die will put finger to workit seemed a if must be crushing that bruised heart for four hour dorothea lay in conflict till felt ill bewildered unable to resolve praying mutely helpless a child have sobbed sought too long fell into late morning sleep when waked mr casaubon be already up tantripp told that have read prayer breakfasted be in library never saw look so pale madam said solid figured woman who have be with sister at lausanne be ever high colored tantripp said dorothea smiling faintly well not to say high

said dorothea winning little breathing space in way will be in yew tree walk for next half hour said mr casaubon then left dorothea feeling very weary rang asked tantripp to bring wrap have be sitting still for few minute not in renewal of former conflict simply felt that be going to say yes to own doom be too weak too full of dread at thought of inflicting keen edged blow on husband to do anything submit completely sat still let put on bonnet shawl passivity be unusual with for liked to wait on god bless madam said tantripp with irrepressible movement of love towards beautiful gentle creature for whom felt unable to do anything more now that have finished tying bonnet be too much for dorotheas highly strung feeling burst into tear sobbing against tantripps arm soon checked dried eye went out at glass door into shrubbery wish book in library be built into caticom for master said tantripp to pratt butler finding in breakfast room have be at rome visited antiquity a know always declined to call mr casaubon anything master when speaking to other servant pratt laughed liked master very well liked tantripp better when dorothea be out on gravel walk lingered among nearer clump of tree hesitating a have done once before though from different cause then have feared lest effort at fellowship must be unwelcome now dreaded going to spot where foresaw that must bind to fellowship from shrank law world opinion compelled to thisonly husband nature own compassion only ideal not real yoke of marriage saw clearly enough whole situation yet be fettered must not smite stricken soul entreated hers if be weakness dorothea be weak half hour be passing must not delay longer when entered yew tree walk must not see husband walk have bend went expecting to catch sight of figure wrapped in blue cloak with warm velvet cap be outer garment on chill day for garden occurred to that might be resting in summer house towards path diverged little turning angle must see seated on bench close to stone table arm be resting on table brow be bowed down on blue cloak being dragged forward screening face on side exhausted last night dorothea said to herself thinking at first that be asleep that summer house be too damp place to rest in then remembered that of late have seen take attitude when be reading to a if found easier than other that must sometimes speak a well a listen with face down in way went into summerhouse said be come edward be ready took notice thought that must be fast asleep laid hand on shoulder repeated be ready still be motionless with sudden confused fear leaned down to took off velvet cap leaned cheek close to head cry in distressed tone wake dear wake listen to be come to answer dorothea never gave answer later in day lydgate be seated by bedside be talking deliriously thinking aloud recalling what have gone through mind night before knew called by name appeared to think right that must explain everything to again again begged to explain everything to husband tell will go to soon be ready to promise only thinking about be so dreadfulit have made ill not very ill will soon be better go tell silence in husband ear be never more to be broken chapter

choose to godidnt choose know mr brooke persisting a quietly a if be only discussing nature of last year weather nodding at end with usual amenity be exasperating form of obstinacy good god said sir

tend to soothe sir james put out hand to reach hat implying that did not mean to contend further said still with heat well can only say that think dorothea be sacrificed once because friend be too careless will do what can a brother to protect now cant do better than get to freshitt a soon a possible chettam approve plan altogether said mr brooke well pleased that have won argument must have be highly inconvenient to to part with ladislaw at time when dissolution might happen day elector be to be convinced of course by interest of country must be best served mr brooke sincerely believed that

schal gospel glosen here ne teche leven in gret god quod wolden sowen diffculteecanterbury tale dorothea have be safe at freshitt hall nearly week before have asked dangerous question morning now sat with celia in prettiest of up stair sitting room opening into small conservatorycelia in white lavender like bunch of mixed violet watching remarkable act of baby be so dubious to inexperienced mind that conversation be interrupted by appeal for interpretation made to oracular nurse dorothea sat by in widow dress with expression rather provoked celia a being much too sad for not only be baby quite well really when husband have be so dull troublesome while lived besides hadwell well sir james of course have told celia everything with strong representation how important be that dorothea must not know sooner than be inevitable mr brooke have be right in predicting that dorothea must not long remain passive where action have be assigned to knew purport of husband will made at time of marriage mind a soon a be clearly conscious of position be silently occupied with what ought to do a owner of lowick manor with patronage of living attached to one morning when uncle paid usual visit though with unusual alacrity in manner accounted for by saying that be now pretty certain parliament must be dissolved forthwith dorothea said uncle be right now must consider who be to have living at lowick after mr tucker have be provided for never heard husband say that have clergyman in mind a successor to think ought to have key now go to lowick to examine husband paper there may be something must throw light on wish hurry dear said mr brooke quietly by by know can go if like cast eye over thing in desk drawersthere be nothingnothing deep subject knowbesides will everything can be done by by a to living have have application for interest alreadyi must say rather good mr tyke have be strongly recommended to mei have something to do with getting appointment before apostolic man believethe sort of thing must suit dear must like to have fuller knowledge about uncle judge for if mr casaubon have not left expression of wish have perhaps made addition to willthere may be instruction for said dorothea who have while have conjecture in mind with relation to husband work nothing about rectory dearnothing said mr brooke rising to go away putting out hand to niece about research know nothing in will dorotheas lip quivered come must not think of thing yet dear by by know be quite well now uncle wish to exert well well will see must run away nowi have end of work nowits crisisa political crisis know here be celia little manyou be aunt know now be sort of grandfather said mr brooke with placid hurry anxious to get away tell chettam that must not be mr brooke fault if dorothea insisted on looking into everything dorothea sank back in chair when uncle have left room cast eye down meditatively on crossed hand look dodo look at did ever see anything like said celia in comfortable staccato what kitty said dorothea lifting eye rather absently what why upper lip see how be drawing down a if meant to make face isnt wonderful may have little thought wish nurse be here do look at large tear have be for time gathering rolled down dorotheas cheek a looked up tried to smile dont be sad dodo kiss baby what be brooding over so be sure did everything great deal too much must be happy now wonder if sir james must drive to lowick want to look over everythingto see if there be word written for be not to go till mr lydgate say may go have not said so yet here be nurse take baby walk up down gallery besides have got wrong notion in head a usual dodoi can see that vexes where be wrong kitty said dorothea quite meekly be almost ready now to think celia wiser than be really wondering with fear what wrong notion be celia felt advantage be determined to use none of knew dodo a well a did knew how to manage since celias baby be born have have new sense of mental solidity calm wisdom seemed clear that where there be baby thing be right enough error in general be mere lack of central poising force can see what be thinking of a well a can be dodo said celia be wanting to find out if there be anything uncomfortable for to do now only because mr casaubon wished a if have not be uncomfortable enough before doesnt deserve will find out have behaved very badly james be a angry with a can be have better tell to prepare celia said dorothea entreatingly distress tell at once what mean glanced through mind that mr casaubon have left property away from herwhich must not be so very distressing why have made codicil to will to say property be to go away from if marriedi mean be of consequence said dorothea breaking in impetuously if married mr ladislaw not anybody else celia went on with persevering quietude of course be of consequence in one wayyou never must marry mr ladislaw that only make worse of mr casaubon blood rushed to dorotheas face neck painfully celia be administering what thought sobering dose of fact be taking up notion have done dodo health so much harm so went on in neutral tone a if have be remarking on baby robe james say so say be abominable not like gentleman there never be better judge than james be a if mr casaubon wanted to make people believe that must wish to marry mr ladislawwhich be ridiculous only james say be to hinder mr ladislaw from wanting to marry for moneyjust a if ever must think of making offer mr cadwallader said might a well marry italian with white mouse must just go look at baby celia added without least change of tone throwing light shawl over tripping away dorothea by time have turned cold again now threw back helplessly in chair might have compared experience at moment to vague alarmed consciousness that life be taking on new form that be undergoing metamorphosis in memory must not adjust to stirring of new organ everything be changing aspect husband conduct own duteous feeling towards struggle between themand yet more whole relation to will ladislaw world be in state of convulsive change only thing must say distinctly to herself be that must wait think anew one change terrified a if have be sin be violent shock of repulsion from departed husband who have have hidden thought perhaps perverting everything said did then again be conscious of change also made tremulous be sudden strange yearning of heart towards will ladislaw have never before entered mind that must under circumstance be lover conceive effect of sudden revelation that have thought of in lightthat perhaps have be conscious of such possibilityand with hurrying crowding vision of unfitting condition question not soon to be solved seemed long whileshe did not know how longbefore heard celia saying will do nurse will be quiet on lap now can go to lunch let garratt stay in next room what think dodo celia went on observing nothing more than dorothea be leaning back in chair likely to be passive be that mr casaubon be spiteful never did like james never did think corner of mouth be dreadfully spiteful now have behaved in way be sure religion doe not require to make uncomfortable about if have be taken away be mercy ought to be grateful must not grieve must baby said celia confidentially to unconscious centre poise of world who have most remarkable fist complete even to nail hair enough really when took cap off to makeyou didnt know whatin short be bouddha in western form at crisis lydgate be announced one of first thing said be fear be not so well a be mr casaubon have be agitated allow to feel pulse dorotheas hand be of marble coldness want to go to lowick to look over paper said celia ought not ought lydgate did not speak for few moment then said looking at dorothea hardly know in opinion mr casaubon must do what must give most repose of mind that repose will not always come from being forbidden to act thank said dorothea exerting be sure be wise there be so many thing ought to attend to why must sit here idle then with effort to recall subject not connected with agitation added abruptly know one in middlemarch think mr lydgate will ask to tell great deal have serious thing to do now have living to give away know mr tyke dorotheas effort be too much for broke off burst into sob lydgate made drink dose of sal volatile let mr casaubon do a like said to sir james whom asked to see before quitting house want perfect freedom think more than other prescription attendance on dorothea while brain be excited have enabled to form true conclusion concerning trial of life felt sure that have be suffering from strain conflict of self repression that be likely now to feel only in sort of pinfold than from have be released lydgates advice be easier for sir james to follow when found that celia have already told dorothea unpleasant fact about will there be help for nowno reason for further delay in execution of necessary business next day sir james complied at once with request that must drive to lowick have wish to stay there at present said dorothea must hardly bear be much happier at freshitt with celia will be able to think better about what must be done at lowick by looking at from distance must like to be at grange little while with uncle go about in old walk among people in village not yet think uncle be having political company be better out of way of such doings said sir james who at moment thought of grange chiefly a haunt of young ladislaws word passed between dorothea about objectionable part of will indeed of felt that mention of between must be impossible sir james be shy even with men about disagreeable subject one thing dorothea must have chosen to say if have spoken on matter at be forbidden to at present because seemed to be further exposure of husband injustice yet did wish that sir james must know what have passed between husband about will ladislaws moral claim on property must then thought be apparent to a be to that husband strange indelicate proviso have be chiefly urged by bitter resistance to idea of claim not merely by personal feeling more difficult to talk about also must be admitted dorothea wished that must be known for will sake since friend seemed to think of a simply object of mr casaubons charity why must be compared with italian carrying white mouse that word quoted from mr cadwallader seemed like mocking travesty wrought in dark by impish finger at lowick dorothea searched desk drawersearched husband place of deposit for private writing found paper addressed especially to except synoptical tabulation be probably only beginning of many intended direction for guidance in carrying out bequest of labor to dorothea a in else mr casaubon have be slow hesitating oppressed in plan of transmitting work a have be in executing by sense of moving heavily in dim clogging medium distrust of dorotheas competence to arrange what have prepared be subdued only by distrust of other redactor have come at last to create trust for out of dorotheas nature must do what resolved to do willingly imagined toiling under fetter of promise to erect tomb with name upon not that mr casaubon called future volume tomb called key to mythology month gained on left plan belated have only have time to ask for promise by sought to keep cold grasp on dorotheas life grasp have slipped away bound by pledge given from depth of pity must have be capable of undertaking toil judgment whispered be vain for us except consecration of faithfulness be supreme use now judgment instead of being controlled by duteous devotion be made active by imbittering discovery that in past union there have lurked hidden alienation of secrecy suspicion living suffering man be no longer before to awaken pity there remained only retrospect of painful subjection to husband whose thought have be lower than have believed whose exorbitant claim for have even blinded scrupulous care for own character made defeat own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor a for property be sign of broken tie must have be glad to be free from have nothing more than original fortune have be settled on if there have not be duty attached to ownership ought not to flinch from about property many troublous question insisted on rising have not be right in thinking that half of ought to go to will ladislawbut be not impossible now for to do act of justice mr casaubon have taken cruelly effective mean of hindering even with indignation against in heart act seemed triumphant eluding of purpose revolted after collecting paper of business wished to examine locked up again desk drawersall empty of personal word for herempty of sign that in husband lonely brooding heart have gone out to in excuse explanation went back to freshitt with sense around last hard demand last injurious assertion of power silence be unbroken dorothea tried now to turn thought towards immediate duty one of be of kind others be determined to remind of lydgates ear have caught eagerly mention of living a soon a must reopened subject seeing here possibility of making amends for casting vote have once given with ill satisfied conscience instead of telling anything about mr tyke said must like to speak of manmr farebrother vicar of st botolphs living be poor one give stinted provision for family mother aunt sister live with depend upon believe have never married because of never heard such good preaching a hissuch plain easy eloquence must have done to preach at st paul cross after old latimer talk be just a good about subject original simple clear think remarkable fellow ought to have done more than have done why have not done more said dorothea interested now in who have slipped below own intention thats hard question said lydgate find that uncommonly difficult to make right thing work there be so many string pulling at once farebrother often hint that have got into wrong profession want wider range than of poor clergyman suppose have interest to help on be very fond of natural history various scientific matter be hampered in reconciling taste with position have money to sparehardly enough to use have led into card playingmiddlemarch be great place for whist doe play for money win good deal of course take into company little beneath make slack about thing yet with looking at a whole think be one of most blameless men ever knew have venom doubleness in often go with more correct outside wonder whether suffers in conscience because of habit said dorothea wonder whether wish must leave off have doubt must leave off if be transplanted into plenty must be glad of time for other thing uncle say that mr tyke be spoken of a apostolic man said dorothea meditatively be wishing be possible to restore time of primitive zeal yet thinking of mr farebrother with strong desire to rescue from chance gotten money dont pretend to say that farebrother be apostolic said lydgate position be not quite like of apostle be only parson among parishioner whose life have to try make better practically find that what be called being apostolic now be impatience of everything in parson doesnt cut principal figure see something of in mr tyke at hospital good deal of doctrine be sort of pinching hard to make people uncomfortably aware of besides apostolic man at lowickhe ought to think a st francis did that be needful to preach to bird true said dorothea be hard to imagine what sort of notion farmer laborer get from teaching have be looking into volume of sermon by mr tyke such sermon must be of use at lowicki mean about imputed righteousness prophecy in apocalypse have always be thinking of different way in christianity be taught whenever find one way make wider blessing than other cling to a truesti mean take in most good of kind brings in most people a sharer in be surely better to pardon too much than to condemn too much must like to see mr farebrother hear preach do said lydgate trust to effect of that be very much beloved have enemy too there be always people who cant forgive able man for differing from that money winning business be really blot dont of course see many middlemarch people mr ladislaw who be constantly seeing mr brooke be great friend of mr farebrothers old lady must be glad to sing vicar praise one of old ladiesmiss noble auntis wonderfully quaint picture of self forgetful goodness ladislaw gallant about sometimes met one day in back street know ladislaws looka sort of daphnis in coat waistcoat little old maid reaching up to armthey looked like couple dropped out of romantic comedy best evidence about farebrother be to see hear happily dorothea be in private sitting room when conversation occurred there be one present to make lydgates innocent introduction of ladislaw painful to a be usual with in matter of personal gossip lydgate have quite forgotten rosamonds remark that thought will adored mr casaubon at moment be only caring for what must recommend farebrother family have purposely given emphasis to worst must be said about vicar in order to forestall objection in week since mr casaubons death have hardly seen ladislaw have heard no rumor to warn that mr brooke confidential secretary be dangerous subject with mr casaubon when be gone picture of ladislaw lingered in mind disputed ground with question of lowick living what be will ladislaw thinking about must hear of fact made cheek burn a never used to do how must feel when heard itbut must see a well a possible how smiled down at little old maid italian with white miceon contrary be creature who entered into one feeling must take pressure of thought instead of urging own with iron resistance chapter li party be nature too will see by force of logic how agree many in one one in many be not same a genus hold specie be great small one genus highest one not high at specie have differentia too be not be never though be ayes be like a one to one three to three gossip about mr casaubons will have yet reached ladislaw air seemed to be filled with dissolution of parliament coming election a old wake fair be filled with rival clatter of itinerant show more private noise be taken little notice of famous dry election be at hand in depth of public feeling might be measured by low flood mark of drink will ladislaw be one of busiest at time though dorotheas widowhood be continually in thought be so far from wishing to be spoken to on subject that when lydgate sought out to tell have passed about lowick living answered rather waspishly why must bring into matter never see mr casaubon be not likely to see since be at freshitt never go there be tory ground where pioneer be more welcome than poacher gun fact be that will have be made more susceptible by observing that mr brooke instead of wishing a before to come to grange oftener than be quite agreeable to seemed now to contrive that must go there a little a possible be shuffling concession of mr brooke to sir james chettams indignant remonstrance will awake to slightest hint in direction concluded that be to be kept away from grange on dorotheas account friend then regarded with suspicion fear be quite superfluous be very much mistaken if imagined that must put forward a needy adventurer trying to win favor of rich woman until now will have never fully seen chasm between dorotheauntil now that be come to brink of saw on other side began not without inward rage to think of going away from neighborhood must be impossible for to show further interest in dorothea without subjecting to disagreeable imputationsperhaps even in mind others might try to poison be forever divided said will might a well be at rome must be farther from what call despair be often only painful eagerness of unfed hope there be plenty of reason why must not gopublic reason why must not quit post at crisis leaving mr brooke in lurch when needed coaching for election when there be so much canvassing direct indirect to be carried on will must not like to leave own chessman in heat of game candidate on right side even if brain marrow have be a soft a be consistent with gentlemanly bearing might help to turn majority to coach mr brooke keep steadily to idea that must pledge to vote for actual reform bill instead of insisting on independence power of pulling up in time be not easy task mr farebrothers prophecy of fourth candidate in bag have not yet be fulfilled parliamentary candidate society other power on watch to secure reforming majority seeing worthy nodus for interference while there be second reforming candidate like mr brooke who might be returned at own expense fight lay entirely between pinkerton old tory member bagster new whig member returned at last election brooke future independent member who be to fetter for occasion only mr hawley party must bend force to return of pinkerton mr brooke success must depend on plumpers must leave bagster in rear on new minting of tory vote into reforming vote latter mean of course must be preferable prospect of converting vote be dangerous distraction to mr brooke impression that waverer be likely to be allured by wavering statement also liability of mind to stick afresh at opposing argument a turned up in memory gave will ladislaw much trouble know there be tactic in thing said mr brooke meeting people half waytempering ideassaying well now there something in so on agree with that be peculiar occasionthe country with will of ownpolitical unionsthat sort of thingbut sometimes cut with rather too sharp knife ladislaw ten pound householder now why ten draw line somewhereyes why just at ten thats difficult question now if go into of course be said will impatiently if be to wait till get logical bill must put forward a revolutionist then middlemarch must not elect fancy a for trimming be not time for trimming mr brooke always ended by agreeing with ladislaw who still appeared to sort of burke with leaven of shelley after interval wisdom of own method reasserted be again drawn into using with much hopefulness at stage of affair be in excellent spirit even supported under large advance of money for power of convincing persuading have not yet be tested by anything more difficult than chairman speech introducing other orator dialogue with middlemarch voter from came away with sense that be tactician by nature that be pity have not gone earlier into kind of thing be little conscious of defeat however with mr mawmsey chief representative in middlemarch of great social power retail trader naturally one of most doubtful voter in boroughwilling for own part to supply equal quality of tea sugar to reformer anti reformer a well a to agree impartially with feeling like burgess of old that necessity of electing member be great burthen to town for even if there be danger in holding out hope to party beforehand there must be painful necessity at last of disappointing respectable people whose name be on book be accustomed to receive large order from mr brooke of tipton then there be many of pinkertons committee whose opinion have great weight of grocery on side mr mawmsey thinking that mr brooke a not too clever in intellect be more likely to forgive grocer who gave hostile vote under pressure have become confidential in back parlor a to reform sir put in family light said rattling small silver in pocket smiling affably will support mr mawmsey enable to bring up six child when be more put question fictiously knowing what must be answer very well sir ask what a husband father be to do when gentleman come to say do a like mawmsey if vote against will get grocery elsewhere when sugar liquor like to feel that be benefiting country by maintaining tradesman of right color very word have be spoken to sir in very chair where be now sitting dont mean by honorable self mr brooke nothats narrow know until butler complains to of good mr mawmsey said mr brooke soothingly until hear that send bad sugar spicesthat sort of thingi will never order to go elsewhere sir be humble servant greatly obliged said mr mawmsey feeling that politics be clearing up little there must be pleasure in voting for gentleman who speaks in honorable manner well know mr mawmsey must find right thing to put on side reform will touch everybody by bya thoroughly popular measurea sort of b c know must come first before rest can follow quite agree with that youve got to look at thing in family light public spirit now be one family knowits one cupboard thing a vote now why may help to make men fortune at capetheres knowing what may be effect of vote mr brooke ended with sense of being little out at sea though finding still enjoyable mr mawmsey answered in tone of decisive check beg pardon sir cant afford that when give vote must know what be doing must look to what will be effect on till ledger speaking respectfully price ill admit be what nobody can know merit of sudden fall after youve bought in currant be good will not keepive never seen into in out there be rebuke to human pride a to one family there debtor creditor hope theyre not going to reform away else must vote for thing staying a be few men have le need to cry for change than have personally speakingthat be for self family be not one of who have nothing to lose mean a to respectability in parish private business noways in respect of honorable self custom be good enough to say must not withdraw from vote vote while article sent in be satisfactory after conversation mr mawmsey went up boasted to wife that have be rather too many for brooke of tipton that didnt mind so much now about going to poll mr brooke on occasion abstained from boasting of tactic to ladislaw who for part be glad enough to persuade that have concern with canvassing except purely argumentative sort that worked meaner engine than knowledge mr brooke necessarily have agent who understood nature of middlemarch voter mean of enlisting ignorance on side of billwhich be remarkably similar to mean of enlisting on side against bill will stopped ear occasionally parliament like rest of life even to eating apparel must hardly go on if imagination be too active about process there be plenty of dirty handed men in world to do dirty business will protested to that share in bringing mr brooke through must be quite innocent whether must succeed in mode of contributing to majority on right side be very doubtful to have written out various speech memoranda for speech have begun to perceive mr brooke mind if have burthen of remembering train of thought must let drop run away in search of not easily come back again to collect document be one mode of serving country to remember content of document be no only way in mr brooke must be coerced into thinking of right argument at right time be to be well plied with till took up room in brain here there be difficulty of finding room so many thing having be taken in beforehand mr brooke observed that idea stood rather in way when be speaking however ladislaws coaching be forthwith to be put to test for before day of nomination mr brooke be to explain to worthy elector of middlemarch from balcony of white hart looked out advantageously at angle of market place commanding large area in front two converging street be fine may morning everything seemed hopeful there be prospect of understanding between bagsters committee brooke to mr bulstrode mr standish a liberal lawyer such manufacturer a mr plymdale mr vincy gave solidity almost counterbalanced mr hawley associate who sat for pinkerton at green dragon mr brooke conscious of having weakened blast of trumpet against by reform a landlord in last half year hearing cheered little a drove into town felt heart tolerably light under buff colored waistcoat with regard to critical occasion often happens that moment seem comfortably remote until last look well eh said mr brooke a crowd gathered will have good audience at rate like nowthis kind of public made up of one own neighbor know weaver tanner of middlemarch unlike mr mawmsey have never thought of mr brooke a neighbor be not more attached to than if have be sent in box from london listened without much disturbance to speaker who introduced candidate one of thema political personage from brassing who came to tell middlemarch dutyspoke so fully that be alarming to think what candidate must find to say after meanwhile crowd became denser a political personage neared end of speech mr brooke felt remarkable change in sensation while still handled eye glass trifled with document before exchanged remark with committee a man to whom moment of summons be indifferent ill take glass of sherry ladislaw said with easy air to will who be close behind presently handed supposed fortifier be ill chosen for mr brooke be abstemious man to drink second glass of sherry quickly at great interval from first be surprise to system tended to scatter energy instead of collecting pray pity so many english gentleman make miserable by speechifying on entirely private ground whereas mr brooke wished to serve country by standing for parliamentwhich indeed may also be done on private ground being once undertaken doe absolutely demand speechifying be not about beginning of speech that mr brooke be at anxious felt sure must be all right must have quite pat cut out a neatly a set of couplet from pope embarking must be easy vision of open sea might come after be alarming question now hinted demon just waking up in stomach somebody may put question about schedulesladislaw continued aloud just hand memorandum of schedule when mr brooke presented on balcony cheer be quite loud enough to counterbalance yell groan brayings other expression of adverse theory be so moderate that mr standish decidedly old bird observed in ear next to look dangerous by god hawley have got deeper plan than still cheer be exhilarating candidate must look more amiable than mr brooke with memorandum in breast pocket left hand on rail of balcony right trifling with eye glass striking point in appearance be buff waistcoat short clipped blond hair neutral physiognomy began with confidence gentlemenelectors of middlemarch be so much right thing that little pause after seemed natural im uncommonly glad to be herei be never so proud happy in lifenever so happy know be bold figure of speech not exactly right thing for unhappily pat opening have slipped awayeven couplet from pope may be fallings from vanishing when fear clutch glass of sherry be hurrying like smoke among idea ladislaw who stood at window behind speaker thought up now only chance be that since best thing wont always do floundering may answer for once mr brooke meanwhile having lost other clew fell back on qualificationsalways appropriate graceful subject for candidate be close neighbor of yours good friendsyouve known on bench good whileive always gone good deal into public questionsmachinery now machine breakingyoure many of concerned with machinery ive be going into lately wont do know breaking machine everything must go ontrade manufacture commerce interchange of staplesthat kind of thingsince adam smith must go on must look over globeobservation with extensive view must look everywhere from china to peru a somebody saysjohnson think rambler know be have done up to certain pointnot a far a peru ive not always stayed at homei saw wouldnt do ive be in levant where of middlemarch good goand then again in baltic baltic now plying among recollection in way mr brooke might have got along easily to must have come back from remotest sea without trouble diabolical procedure have be set up by enemy at one same moment there have risen above shoulder of crowd nearly opposite mr brooke within ten yard of effigy of buff colored waistcoat eye glass neutral physiognomy painted on rag there have arisen apparently in air like note of cuckoo parrot like punch voiced echo of word everybody looked up at open window in house at opposite angle of converging street be blank filled by laughing listener most innocent echo have impish mockery in when follows gravely persistent speaker echo be not at innocent if did not follow with precision of natural echo have wicked choice of word overtook by time said baltic now laugh have be running through audience became general shout for sobering effect of party that great public cause entanglement of thing have identified with brooke of tipton laugh might have caught committee mr bulstrode asked reprehensively what new police be doing voice must not well be collared attack on effigy of candidate must have be too equivocal since hawley probably meant to be pelted mr brooke be not in position to be quickly conscious of anything except general slipping away of idea within have even little singing in ear be only person who have not yet taken distinct account of echo discerned image of few thing hold perception more thoroughly captive than anxiety about what have got to say mr brooke heard laughter have expected tory effort at disturbance be at moment additionally excited by tickling stinging sense that lost exordium be coming back to fetch from baltic that reminds went on thrusting hand into side pocket with easy air if wanted precedent knowbut never want precedent for right thingbut there be chatham now cant say must have supported chatham pitt younger pitthe be not man of idea want idea know blast idea want bill said loud rough voice from crowd below immediately invisible punch who have hitherto followed mr brooke repeated blast idea want bill laugh be louder than ever for first time mr brooke being silent heard distinctly mocking echo seemed to ridicule interrupter in light be encouraging so replied with amenity there be something in what say good friend what do meet for to speak mindsfreedom of opinion freedom of press libertythat kind of thing bill nowyou will have billhere mr brooke paused moment to fix on eye glass take paper from breast pocket with sense of being practical coming to particular invisible punch followed will have bill mr brooke per electioneering contest seat outside parliament a delivered five thousand pound seven shilling fourpence mr brooke amid roar of laughter turned red let eye glass fall looking about confusedly saw image of have come nearer next moment saw dolorously bespattered with egg spirit rose little voice too buffoonery trick ridicule test of truthall be very wellhere unpleasant egg broke on mr brooke shoulder a echo said be very well then came hail of egg chiefly aimed at image occasionally hitting original a if by chance there be stream of new men pushing among crowd whistle yell bellowing fife made greater hubbub because there be shouting struggling to put down voice must have have wing enough to rise above uproar mr brooke disagreeably anointed stood ground no longer frustration must have be le exasperating if have be gamesome boyish serious assault of newspaper reporter can aver that endangered learned gentleman rib can respectfully bear witness to sol of gentleman boot having be visible above railing have perhaps more consolation attached to mr brooke re entered committee room saying a carelessly a must be little too bad know must have got ear of people by bybut didnt give time must have gone into bill by by know added glancing at ladislaw however thing will come right at nomination be not resolved unanimously that thing must come right on contrary committee looked rather grim political personage from brassing be writing busily a if be brewing new device be bowyer who did said mr standish evasively know a well a if have be advertised he uncommonly good at ventriloquism did uncommonly well by god hawley have be having to dinner lately there fund of talent in bowyer well know never mentioned to standish else must have invited to dine said poor mr brooke who have gone through great deal of inviting for good of country there not more paltry fellow in middlemarch than bowyer said ladislaw indignantly seems a if paltry fellow be always to turn scale will be thoroughly out of temper with a well a with principal went to shut in room with half formed resolve to throw up pioneer mr brooke together why must stay if impassable gulf between dorothea be ever to be filled up must rather be by going away getting into thoroughly different position than by staying here slipping into deserved contempt a understrapper of brooke then came young dream of wonder that might doin five year for example political writing political speaking must get higher value now public life be going to be wider more national might give such distinction that must not seem to be asking dorothea to step down to five yearsif must only be sure that cared for more than for others if must only make aware that stood aloof until must tell love without lowering himselfthen must go away easily begin career at five twenty seemed probable enough in inward order of thing where talent brings fame fame everything else be delightful must speak must write must master subject if chose meant always to take side of reason justice on must carry ardor why must not one day be lifted above shoulder of crowd feel that have won that eminence well without doubt must leave middlemarch go to town make fit for celebrity by eating dinner not immediately not until kind of sign have passed between dorothea must not be satisfied until knew why even if be man must choose to marry must not marry hence must keep post bear with mr brooke little longer soon have reason to suspect that mr brooke have anticipated in wish to break up connection deputation without voice within have concurred in inducing philanthropist to take stronger measure than usual for good of mankind namely to withdraw in favor of candidate to whom left advantage of canvassing machinery called strong measure observed that health be le capable of sustaining excitement than have imagined have felt uneasy about chestit wont do to carry too far said to ladislaw in explaining affair must pull up poor casaubon be warning know ive made heavy advance ive dug channel rather coarse workthis electioneering eh ladislaw dare say be tired of however have dug channel with pioneerput thing in track so on more ordinary man than might carry on nowmore ordinary know do wish to give up said will quick color coming in face a rose from writing table took turn of three step with hand in pocket be ready to do so whenever wish a to wishing dear ladislaw have highest opinion of power know about pioneer have be consulting little with of men on side be inclined to take into handsindemnify to certain extentcarry on in fact under circumstance might like to give upmight find better field people might not take high view of have always taken a alter ego right handthough always looked forward to doing something else think of having run into france ill write letter knowto althorpe people of kind ive met althorpe be exceedingly obliged to said ladislaw proudly since be going to part with pioneer need not trouble about step will take may choose to continue here for present after mr brooke have left will said to rest of family have be urging to get rid of doesnt care now about going will stay a long a like will go of own movement not because be afraid of chapter lii heart lowliest duty on did lay wordsworth on june evening when mr farebrother knew that be to have lowick living there be joy in old fashioned parlor even portrait of great lawyer seemed to look on with satisfaction mother left tea toast untouched sat with usual pretty primness only showing emotion by flush in cheek brightness in eye give old woman touching momentary identity with far off youthful self saying decisively greatest comfort camden be that have deserved when man get good berth mother deserving must come after said son brimful of pleasure not trying to conceal gladness in face be of active kind seems to have energy enough not only to flash outwardly to light up busy vision within one seemed to see thought a well a delight in glance now aunt went on rubbing hand looking at miss noble who be making tender little beaver like noise there will be sugar candy always on table for to steal give to child will have great many new stocking to make present of will darn own more than ever miss noble nodded at nephew with subdued half frightened laugh conscious of having already dropped additional lump of sugar into basket on strength of new preferment a for winnythe vicar went oni will make difficulty about marrying lowick bachelormr solomon featherstone for example a soon a find be in love with miss winifred who have be looking at brother while cry heartily be way of rejoicing smiled through tear said must set example cam must marry now with heart who be in love with be seedy old fellow said vicar rising pushing chair away looking down at what do say mother be handsome man camden though not so fine figure of man a father said old lady wish must marry miss garth brother said miss winifred must make so lively at lowick very fine talk a if young woman be tied up to be chosen like poultry at market a if have only to ask everybody must have said vicar not caring to specify dont want everybody said miss winifred must like miss garth mother shouldnt son choice will be mine said farebrother with majestic discretion wife must be most welcome camden will want whist at home when go to lowick henrietta noble never be whist player mr farebrother always called tiny old sister by magnificent name will do without whist now mother why so camden in time whist be thought undeniable amusement for good churchman said mr farebrother innocent of meaning that whist have for son speaking rather sharply a at dangerous countenancing of new doctrine will be too busy for whist will have two parish said vicar preferring not to discus virtue of game have already said to dorothea dont feel bound to give up st botolphs be protest enough against pluralism want to reform if give somebody else most of money stronger thing be not to give up power to use well have thought of said dorothea so far a self be concerned think must be easier to give up power money than to keep seems very unfitting must have patronage yet felt that ought not to let be used by one else instead of be who be bound to act so that will not regret power said mr farebrother be one of nature in conscience get more active when yoke of life cease to gall made display of humility on subject in heart felt rather ashamed that conduct have shown laches others who did not get benefice be free from used often to wish have be something else than clergyman said to lydgate perhaps will be better to try make a good clergyman out of a can be well beneficed point of view perceive from difficulty be much simplified ended smiling vicar did feel then a if share of duty must be easy duty have trick of behaving unexpectedlysomething like heavy friend whom have amiably asked to visit who break leg within gate hardly week later duty presented in study under disguise of fred vincy now returned from omnibus college with bachelor degree be ashamed to trouble mr farebrother said fred whose fair open face be propitiating be only friend can consult told everything once before be so good that cant help coming to again sit down fred im ready to hear do anything can said vicar who be busy packing small object for removal went on with work wanted to tell fred hesitated instant then went on plungingly might go into church now really look where may cant see anything else to do dont like know uncommonly hard on father to say so after have spent good deal of money in educating for fred paused again instant then repeated cant see anything else to do did talk to father about fred made little way with said be too late have got over one bridge now what be other difficulty merely that dont like dont like divinity preaching feeling obliged to look serious like riding across country doing a other men do dont mean want to be bad fellow in way ive taste for sort of thing people expect of clergyman yet what else be to do father cant spare capital else might go into farming have room for in trade of course cant begin to study for law physic now when father want to earn something very well to say im wrong to go into church who say so might a well tell to go into backwoods freds voice have taken tone of grumbling remonstrance mr farebrother might have be inclined to smile if mind have not be too busy in imagining more than fred told have difficulty about doctrinesabout article said trying hard to think of question simply for freds sake suppose article be right be not prepared with argument to disprove much better cleverer fellow than be go in for entirely think must be rather ridiculous in to urge scruple of sort a if be judge said fred quite simply suppose then have occurred to that might be fair parish priest without being much of divine of course if be obliged to be clergyman will try do duty though maynt like do think body ought to blame for going into church under circumstance depends on conscience fredhow far have counted cost seen what position will require of can only tell about have always be too lax have be uneasy in consequence there be hindrance said fred coloring did not tell before though perhaps may have said thing made guess there be somebody be very fond of have loved ever since be child miss garth suppose said vicar examining label very closely yes shouldnt mind anything if must have know must be good fellow then think return feeling never will say so good while ago made promise not to speak to about again have set mind especially against being clergyman know that cant give up do think care about saw garth last night said that mary be staying at lowick rectory with miss farebrother yes be very kindly helping sister do wish to go there want to ask great favor of be ashamed to bother in way mary might listen to what said if mentioned subject to heri mean about going into church be rather delicate task dear fred will have to presuppose attachment to to enter on subject a wish to do will be asking to tell whether return be what want to tell said fred bluntly dont know what to do unless can get at feeling mean that must be guided by a to going into church if mary said must never have might a well go wrong in one way a be nonsense fred men outlive love dont outlive consequence of recklessness not sort of love have never be without loving mary if have to give up must be like beginning to live on wooden leg will not be hurt at intrusion feel sure will not respect more than one must not put off with fun a doe of course must not have told one else asked one else to speak to there be one else who must be such friend to of fred paused moment then said rather complainingly ought to acknowledge have worked in order to pas ought to believe must exert for sake there be moment silence before mr farebrother laid down work putting out hand to fred said very well boy will do what wish very day mr farebrother went to lowick parsonage on nag have just set up decidedly be old stalk thought young growth be pushing aside found mary in garden gathering rose sprinkling petal on sheet sun be low tall tree sent shadow across grassy walk where mary be moving without bonnet parasol did not observe mr farebrothers approach along grass have just stooped down to lecture small black tan terrier must persist in walking on sheet smelling at rose leaf a mary sprinkled took fore paw in one hand lifted up forefinger of other while dog wrinkled brow looked embarrassed fly fly be ashamed of mary be saying in grave contralto be not becoming in sensible dog anybody must think be silly young gentleman be unmerciful to young gentleman miss garth said vicar within two yard of mary started up blushed always answer to reason with fly said laughingly not with young gentleman oh with suppose since of turn into excellent men be glad of admission because want at very moment to interest in young gentleman not silly one hope said mary beginning to pluck rose again feeling heart beat uncomfortably though perhaps wisdom be not strong point rather affection sincerity however wisdom lie more in two quality than people be apt to imagine hope know by mark what young gentleman mean yes think do said mary bravely face getting more serious hand cold must be fred vincy have asked to consult about going into church hope will not think that consented to take liberty in promising to do so on contrary mr farebrother said mary giving up rose folding arm unable to look up whenever have anything to say to feel honored before enter on question let just touch point on father took into confidence by way be that very evening on once before fulfilled mission from fred just after have gone to college mr garth told what happened on night of featherstones deathhow refused to burn will said that have heart pricking on subject because have be innocent mean of hindering fred from getting ten thousand pound have kept that in mind have heard something may relieve on scoremay show that sin offering be demanded from there mr farebrother paused moment looked at mary meant to give fred full advantage must be well thought to clear mind of superstition such a woman sometimes follow when do man wrong of marrying a act of atonement mary cheek have begun to burn little be mute mean that action made real difference to freds lot find that first will must not have be legally good after burning of last must not have stood if have be disputed may be sure must have be disputed so on score may feel mind free thank mr farebrother said mary earnestly be grateful to for remembering feeling well now may go on fred know have taken degree have worked way so far now question be what be to do question be so difficult that be inclined to follow father wish enter church though know better than do that be quite set against formerly have questioned on subject confess see insuperable objection to being clergyman a thing go say that must turn mind to doing best in vocation on one condition if condition be fulfilled must do utmost in helping fred on after timenot of course at firsthe might be with a curate must have so much to do that stipend must be nearly what used to get a vicar repeat that there be condition without good can not come to pas have opened heart to miss garth asked to plead for condition lie entirely in feeling mary looked so much moved that said after moment let walk little when be walking added to speak quite plainly fred will not take course must lessen chance that must consent to be wife with prospect will try best at anything approve can not possibly say will ever be wife mr farebrother certainly never will be wife if becomes clergyman what say be most generous kind dont mean for moment to correct judgment be only that have girlish mocking way of looking at thing said mary with returning sparkle of playfulness in answer only made modesty more charming wish to report exactly what think said mr farebrother must not love man who be ridiculous said mary not choosing to go deeper fred have sense knowledge enough to make respectable if like in good worldly business can never imagine preaching exhorting pronouncing blessing praying by sick without feeling a if be looking at caricature being clergyman must be only for gentility sake think there be nothing more contemptible than such imbecile gentility used to think that of mr crowse with empty face neat umbrella mincing little speech what right have such men to represent christianityas if be institution for getting up idiot genteellyas if mary checked have be carried along a if have be speaking to fred instead of mr farebrother young woman be severe dont feel stress of action a men do though perhaps ought to make exception there dont put fred vincy on so low level a indeed have plenty of sense think must not show a clergyman must be piece of professional affectation then answer be quite decided a clergyman must have hope mary shook head if braved difficulty of getting bread in other waywill give support of hope may count on winning think fred ought not to need telling again what have already said to mary answered with slight resentment in manner mean that ought not to put such question until have done something worthy instead of saying that must do mr farebrother be silent for minute more then a turned paused under shadow of maple at end of grassy walk said understand that resist attempt to fetter feeling for fred vincy excludes entertaining attachment doe not either may count on remaining single until will have earned hand may in case be disappointed pardon maryyou know used to catechise under namebut when state of woman affection touch happiness of lifeof more life than onei think must be nobler course for to be perfectly direct open mary in turn be silent wondering not at mr farebrothers manner at tone have grave restrained emotion in when strange idea flashed across that word have reference to be incredulous ashamed of entertaining have never thought that man must love except fred who have espoused with umbrella ring when wore sock little strapped shoe still le that must be of importance to mr farebrother cleverest man in narrow circle have only time to feel that be hazy

bailiff housekeeper from whom gathered a much a wanted to know about mr bulstrodes position in middlemarch after however there be dull space of time needed relieving with bread cheese ale when be seated alone with resource in wainscoted parlor suddenly slapped knee exclaimed ladislaw that action of memory have tried to set going have abandoned in despair have suddenly completed without

of not being at loss if ever did happen to want be not going to tell bulstrode there be actual good in telling to mind like of mr raffle there be always probable good in secret be satisfied with present success by three oclock day have taken up portmanteau at turnpike mounted coach relieving mr bulstrodes eye of ugly black spot on landscape at stone court not relieving of dread that black spot might reappear become inseparable even from vision of hearth book vi widow wife chapter liv negli occhi porta la mia donna amore per che si fa gentil ci chella mira ovella passa ogni uom ver lei

disregard be course must not have be tolerated in childless sister dorothea must have be capable of carrying baby joyfully for mile if there have be need of loving more tenderly for labor to aunt who doe not recognize infant nephew a bouddha have nothing to do for to admire behavior be apt to appear monotonous interest of watching exhaustible possibility be quite hidden from celia who felt that dorotheas childless widowhood fell in quite prettily with birth of little arthur baby be named after mr brooke dodo be just creature not to mind about having anything of ownchildren anything said celia to husband if have have baby never must have be dear a arthur must james not if have be like casaubon said sir james conscious of indirectness in answer of holding strictly private opinion a to perfection of first born just imagine really be mercy said celia think be very nice for dodo to be widow can be just a fond of baby a if be own can have a many notion of own a like be pity be not queen said devout sir james what must have be then must have be something else said celia objecting to so laborious flight of imagination like better a be hence when found that dorothea be making arrangement for final departure to lowick celia raised eyebrow with disappointment in quiet unemphatic way shot needle arrow of sarcasm what will do at lowick dodo say there be nothing to be done there everybody be so clean well off make quite melancholy here have be so happy going about tipton with mr garth into worst backyard now uncle be abroad mr garth can have own way be sure james doe everything tell will often come here will see how baby grows better said dorothea will never see washed said celia be quite best part of day be almost pouting did seem to very hard in dodo to go away from baby when might stay dear kitty will come stay night on purpose said dorothea want to be alone now in own home wish to know farebrothers better to talk to mr farebrother about what there be to be done in middlemarch dorotheas native strength of will be no longer converted into resolute submission have great yearning to be at lowick be simply determined to go not feeling bound to tell reason

cheltenham be rejected dowager lady chettam just returned from visit to daughter in town wished at least that mr vigo must be written to invited to accept office of companion to mr casaubon be not credible dorothea a young widow must think of living alone in house at lowick mr vigo have be reader secretary to royal personage in point of knowledge sentiment even dorothea must have nothing to object to mr cadwallader said privately will certainly go mad in house alone dear will see vision have got to exert little to keep sane call thing by same name a other people call by to be sure for younger son woman who have money be sort of provision to go mad be taken care of then must not run into dare say be little bored here with good dowager think what bore might become to fellow creature if be always playing tragedy queen taking thing sublimely sitting alone in library at lowick may fancy ruling weather must get few people round who wouldnt believe if told be good lowering medicine never called everything by same name that people about did said dorothea stoutly suppose have found out mistake dear said mr cadwallader be proof of sanity dorothea be aware of sting did not hurt said still think that greater part of world be mistaken about many thing surely one may be sane yet think so since greater part of world have often have to come round from opinion mr cadwallader said more on point to dorothea to husband remarked will be well for to marry again a soon a be proper if one must get among right people of course chettams must not wish see clearly husband be best thing to keep in order if be not so poor must invite lord triton will be marquis day there be denying that must make good marchioness look handsomer than ever in mourning dear elinor do let poor woman alone such contrivance be of use said easy rector use how be match made except by bringing men woman together be shame that uncle must have run away shut up grange just now there ought to be plenty of eligible match invited to freshitt grange lord triton be precisely man full of plan for making people happy in soft headed sort of way must just suit mr casaubon let mr casaubon choose for elinor be nonsense wise men talk how can choose if have variety to choose from woman choice usually mean taking only man can get mark word humphrey if friend dont exert there will be worse business than casaubon business yet for heaven sake dont touch on topic elinor be very sore point with sir james must be deeply offended if entered on to unnecessarily have never entered on said mr cadwallader opening hand celia told about will at beginning without asking of mine yes yes want thing hushed up understand that young fellow be going out of neighborhood mr cadwallader said nothing gave husband three significant nod with very sarcastic expression in dark eye dorothea quietly persisted in spite of remonstrance persuasion so by end of june shutter be opened at lowick manor morning gazed calmly into library shining on row of note book a shine on weary waste planted with huge stone mute memorial of forgotten faith evening laden with rose entered silently into blue green boudoir where dorothea chose oftenest to sit at first walked into room questioning eighteen month of married life carrying on thought a if be speech to be heard by husband then lingered in library must not be at rest till have carefully ranged note book a imagined that must wish to see in orderly sequence pity have be restraining compelling motive in life with still clung about image even while remonstrated with in indignant thought told that be unjust one little act of hers may perhaps be smiled at a superstitious synoptical tabulation for use of mr casaubon carefully enclosed sealed writing within envelope must not use do not see now must not submit soul to yours by working hopelessly at what have belief indorothea then deposited paper in own desk silent colloquy be perhaps only more earnest because underneath through there be always deep longing have really determined to come to lowick longing be to see will ladislaw did not know good must come of meeting be helpless hand have be tied from making up to for unfairness in lot soul thirsted to see how must be otherwise if princess in day of enchantment have seen four footed creature from among live in herd come to once again with human gaze rested upon with choice beseeching what must think of in journeying what must look for when herd passed surely for gaze have found must know again life must be no better than candle light tinsel daylight rubbish if spirit be not touched by what have be to issue of longing constancy be true that dorothea wanted to know farebrothers better especially to talk to new rector also true that remembering what lydgate have told about will ladislaw little miss noble counted on will coming to lowick to see farebrother family very first sunday before entered church saw a have seen last time be there alone in clergyman pew when entered figure be gone in week day when went to see lady at rectory listened in vain for word that might let fall about will seemed to that mr farebrother talked of one else in neighborhood out of probably of mr farebrothers middlemarch hearer may follow to lowick sometimes do not think so said dorothea rather despising for having secret motive in asking question if be wise will mr casaubon said old lady see that set right value on son preaching grandfather on side be excellent clergyman father be in lawmost exemplary honest nevertheless be reason for never being rich say fortune be woman capricious sometimes be good woman give to who merit have be case with mr casaubon who have given living to son mr farebrother recurred to knitting with dignified satisfaction in neat little effort at oratory be not what dorothea wanted to hear poor thing did not even know whether will ladislaw be still at middlemarch there be one whom dared to ask unless be lydgate just now must not see lydgate without sending for going to seek perhaps will ladislaw having heard of strange ban against left by mr casaubon have felt better that must not meet again perhaps be wrong to wish for meeting others might find many good reason against still do wish came at end of wise reflection a naturally a sob after holding breath meeting did happen in formal way quite unexpected by one morning about eleven dorothea be seated in boudoir with map of land attached to manor other paper before be to help in making exact statement for herself of income affair have not yet applied to work be seated with hand folded on lap looking out along avenue of lime to distant field leaf be at rest in sunshine familiar scene be changeless seemed to represent prospect of life full of motiveless easemotiveless if own energy must not seek out reason for ardent action widow cap of time made oval frame for face have crown standing up dress be experiment in utmost laying on of crape heavy solemnity of clothing made face look younger with recovered bloom sweet inquiring candor of eye reverie be broken by tantripp who came to say that mr ladislaw be below begged permission to see madam if be not too early will see said dorothea rising immediately let be shown into drawing room drawing room be most neutral room in house to herthe one least associated with trial of married life damask matched wood work be white gold there be two tall mirror table with nothing on themin brief be room where have reason for sitting in one place rather than in be below boudoir have also bow window looking out on avenue when pratt showed will ladislaw into window be open winged visitor buzzing in out now then without minding furniture made room look formal uninhabited glad to see here again sir said pratt lingering to adjust blind be only come to say good by pratt said will who wished even butler to know that be too proud to hang about mr casaubon now be rich widow very sorry to hear sir said pratt retiring of course a servant who be to be told nothing knew fact of ladislaw be still ignorant have drawn inference indeed have not differed from betrothed tantripp when said master be a jealous a fiendand reason madam must look higher than mr ladislaw else dont know mr cadwalladers maid say there lord coming who be to marry when mourning over there be not many moment for will to walk about with hat in hand before dorothea entered meeting be very different from that first meeting in rome when will have be embarrassed dorothea calm time felt miserable determined while be in state of agitation must not be hidden just outside door have felt that longed for meeting be after too difficult when saw will advancing towards deep blush be rare in came with painful suddenness of knew how be of spoke gave hand for moment then went to sit down near window on one settee on opposite will be peculiarly uneasy seemed to not like dorothea that mere fact of being widow must cause such change in manner of receiving knew of other condition must have affected previous relation to otherexcept that a imagination at once told friend might have be poisoning mind with suspicion of hope have not presumed too much in calling said will must not bear to leave neighborhood begin new life without seeing to say good by presumed surely not must have thought unkind if have not wished to see said dorothea habit of speaking with perfect genuineness asserting through uncertainty agitation be going away immediately very soon think intend to go to town eat dinner a barrister since say be preparation for public business there will be great deal of political work to be done by by mean to try do of other men have managed to win honorable position for without family money will make more honorable said dorothea ardently besides have so many talent have heard from uncle how well speak in public so that one be sorry when leave off how clearly can explain thing care that justice must be done to one be so glad when be in rome thought only cared for poetry art thing adorn life for who be well off now know think about rest of world while be speaking dorothea have lost personal embarrassment have become like former self looked at will with direct glance full of delighted confidence approve of going away for year then never coming here again till have made myself of mark in world said will trying hard to reconcile utmost pride with utmost effort to get expression of strong feeling from dorothea be not aware how long be before answered have turned head be looking out of window on rose bush seemed to have in summer of year when will must be away be not judicious behavior dorothea never thought of studying manner thought only of bowing to sad necessity divided from will first word of about intention have seemed to make everything clear to knew supposed about mr casaubons final conduct in relation to have come to with same sort of shock a to herself have never felt more than friendship for herhad never have anything in mind to justify what felt to be husband outrage on feeling of that friendship still felt something may be called inward silent sob have gone on in dorothea before said with pure voice just trembling in last word a if only from liquid flexibility yes must be right for to do a say will be very happy when hear that have made value felt must have patience will perhaps be long while will never quite knew how be that saved from falling down at foot when long while came forth with gentle tremor used to say that horrible hue surface of crape dress be most likely sufficient controlling force sat still however only said will never hear from will forget about said dorothea will never forget have never forgotten one whom once knew life have never be crowded seems not likely to be so have great deal of space for memory at lowick havent smiled good god will burst out passionately rising with hat still in hand walking away to marble table where suddenly turned leaned back against blood have mounted to face neck looked almost angry have seemed to a if be like two creature slowly turning to marble in others presence while heart be conscious eye be yearning there be help for must never be true of in meeting to have come with bitter resolution have ended by confession might be interpreted into asking for fortune moreover be actually true that be fearful of effect such confession might have on dorothea looked at from distance in trouble imagining that there might have be offence in word while there be current of thought in about probable want of money impossibility of helping if uncle have be at home something might have be done through be preoccupation with hardship of will wanting money while have what ought to have be share led to say seeing that remained silent looked away from wonder whether must like to have miniature hang up stairsi mean beautiful miniature of grandmother think be not right for to keep if must wish to have be wonderfully like be very good said will irritably dont mind about be not very consoling to have one own likeness must be more consoling if others wanted to have thought must like to cherish memoryi thought dorothea broke off instant imagination suddenly warning away from aunt julias historyyou must surely like to have miniature a family memorial why must have when have nothing else man with only portmanteau for stowage must keep memorial in head will spoke at random be merely venting petulance be little too exasperating to have grandmother portrait offered at moment to dorotheas feeling word have peculiar sting rose said with touch of indignation a well a hauteur be much happier of two mr ladislaw to have nothing will be startled whatever word might be

fred might be better for know think very undeserving mr garth with good reason said fred spirit rising little at perception of something like disposition to lecture happen to have behaved just worst to people cant help wishing for most from while two men like mr garth mr farebrother have not given up dont see why must give up fred thought might be well to suggest masculine example to mr garth

will not be so with mr garth since have encouragement to believe may win mary mr garth have told about that be not surprised dare say fred ended innocently referring only to own love a probably evident enough not surprised that mary have given encouragement returned mr garth who thought must be well for fred to be more alive to fact that mary friend must not possibly have wished beforehand whatever vincys might suppose yes confess be surprised never did give anynot least in world when talked to myself said fred eager to vindicate mary when asked mr farebrother to speak for allowed to tell there be hope power of admonition have begun to stir in mr garth have not yet discharged be little too provoking even for self control that blooming youngster must flourish on disappointment of sadder wiser peoplemaking meal of nightingale never knowing itand that while family must suppose that hers be in eager need of sprig vexation have fermented more actively because of total repression towards husband exemplary wife will sometimes find scapegoat in way now said with energetic decision made great mistake fred in asking mr farebrother to speak for did said fred reddening instantaneously be alarmed at loss to know what mr garth meant added in apologetic tone mr farebrother have always be such friend of ours mary knew must listen to gravely took on quite readily yes young people be usually blind to everything own wish seldom imagine how much wish cost others said mr garth did not mean to go beyond salutary general doctrine threw indignation into needle unwinding of worsted knitting brow at with grand air can not conceive how must be pain to mr farebrother said fred who nevertheless felt that surprising conception be beginning to form precisely can not conceive said mr garth cutting word a neatly a possible for moment fred looked at horizon with dismayed anxiety then turning with quick movement said almost sharply do mean to say mr garth mr farebrother be in love with mary if be so fred think be last person who ought to be surprised returned mr garth laying knitting down beside folding arm be unwonted sign of emotion in that must put work out of hand in fact feeling be divided between satisfaction of giving fred discipline sense of having gone little too far fred took hat stick rose quickly then think be standing in way in mary too said in tone seemed to demand answer mr garth must not speak immediately have brought into unpleasant position of being called on to say what really felt yet what knew there be strong reason for concealing to consciousness of having exceeded in word be peculiarly mortifying besides fred have given out unexpected electricity now added mr garth seemed pleased that mary must be attached to must not have known anything of mr garth felt severe twinge at mention of husband fear that caleb might think in wrong not being easily endurable answered wanting to check unintended consequence spoke from inference only be not aware that mary know anything of matter hesitated to beg that must keep entire silence on subject have unnecessarily mentioned not being used to stoop in way while be hesitating there be already rush of unintended consequence under apple tree where tea thing stood ben bouncing across grass with brownie at heel seeing kitten dragging knitting by lengthening line of wool

woman speakethtelling first entreating silence after have not entreated silence to prevent calebs blame determined to blame confess to very night be curious what awful tribunal mild calebs be to whenever set up meant to point out to that revelation might do fred vincy great deal of good doubt be having strong effect on a walked to lowick freds light hopeful nature have perhaps never have so much of bruise a from suggestion that if have be out of way mary might have made thoroughly good match also be piqued that have be what called stupid lout a to ask intervention from mr farebrother be not in lover be not in freds that new anxiety raised about mary feeling must not surmount other notwithstanding trust in mr farebrothers generosity notwithstanding what mary have said to fred must not help feeling that have rival be new consciousness objected to extremely not being in least ready to give up mary for good being ready rather to fight for with man fighting with mr farebrother must be of metaphorical kind be much more difficult to fred than muscular certainly experience be discipline for fred hardly le sharp than disappointment about uncle will iron have not entered into soul have begun to imagine what sharp edge must be did not once occur to fred that mr garth might be mistaken about mr farebrother suspected that might be wrong about mary mary have be staying at parsonage lately mother might know very little of what have be passing in mind did not feel easier when found looking cheerful with three lady in drawing room be in animated discussion on subject be dropped when entered mary be copying label from heap of willow cabinet drawer in minute handwriting be skilled in mr farebrother be somewhere in village three lady knew nothing of freds peculiar relation to mary be impossible for of to propose that must walk round garden fred predicted to that must have to go away without saying word to in private told first of christys arrival then of own engagement with father be comforted by seeing that latter news touched keenly said hurriedly be so glad then bent over writing to hinder one from noticing face here be subject mr farebrother must not let pas dont mean dear miss garth that be glad to hear of young man giving up church for be educated only mean that thing being so be glad that must be under excellent man like father really mr farebrother be glad of fear said mary cleverly getting rid of one rebellious tear have dreadfully secular mind never liked clergyman except vicar of wakefield mr farebrother now why dear said mr farebrother pausing on large wooden knitting needle looking at mary have always good reason for opinion astonishes of course put out of question who preach new doctrine why must dislike clergyman oh dear said mary face breaking into merriment a seemed to consider moment dont like neckcloth why dont like camden then said miss winifred in anxiety yes do said mary dont like other clergyman neckcloth because be who wear how very puzzling said miss noble feeling that own intellect be probably deficient dear be joking must have better reason than for slighting so respectable class of men said mr farebrother majestically miss garth have such severe notion of what people must be that be difficult to satisfy said fred well be glad at least that make exception in favor of son said old lady mary be wondering at freds piqued tone when mr farebrother came in have to hear news about engagement under mr garth at end said with quiet satisfaction be right then bent to look at mary label praise handwriting fred felt horribly jealouswas glad of course that mr farebrother be so estimable wished that have be ugly fat a men at forty sometimes be be clear what end must be since mary openly placed farebrother above everybody woman be evidently encouraging affair be feeling sure that must have chance of speaking to mary when mr farebrother said fred help to carry drawer back into studyyou have never seen fine new study pray come too miss garth want to see stupendous spider found morning mary at once saw vicar intention have never since memorable evening deviated from old pastoral kindness towards momentary wonder doubt have quite gone to sleep mary be accustomed to think rather rigorously of what be probable if belief flattered vanity felt warned to dismiss a ridiculous having early have much exercise in such dismissal be a have foreseen when fred have be asked to admire fitting of study have be asked to admire spider mr farebrother said wait here minute two be going to look out engraving fred be tall enough to hang for will be back in few minute then went out nevertheless first word fred said to mary be be of use do mary be sure to marry farebrother at last there be rage in tone what do mean fred mary exclaimed indignantly blushing deeply surprised out of readiness in reply be impossible that must not see clearly enoughyou who see everything only see that be behaving very ill fred in speaking so of mr farebrother after have pleaded cause in way how can have taken up such idea fred be rather deep in spite of irritation if mary have really be unsuspicious there be good in telling what mr garth have said follows a matter of course replied when be continually seeing man who beat in everything whom set up above everybody can have fair chance be very ungrateful fred said mary wish have never told mr farebrother cared for in least be not ungrateful must be happiest fellow in world if be not for told father everything be very kind treated a if be son must go at work with will writing everything if be not for for for what said mary imagining now that something specific must have be said done dreadful certainty that will be bowled out by farebrother mary be appeased by inclination to laugh fred said peeping round to catch eye be sulkily turned away from be too delightfully ridiculous if be not such charming simpleton what temptation must be to play wicked coquette let suppose that somebody besides have made love to do really like best mary said fred turning eye full of affection on trying to take hand dont like at at moment said mary retreating putting hand behind only said that mortal ever made love to besides be argument that very wise man ever will ended merrily wish must tell that must not possibly ever think of said fred never dare to mention more to fred said mary getting serious again dont know whether be more stupid ungenerous in not to see that mr farebrother have left together on purpose that might speak freely be disappointed that must be so blind to delicate feeling there be time to say more before mr farebrother came back with engraving fred have to return to drawing room still with jealous dread in heart yet with comforting argument from mary word manner result of conversation be on whole more painful to mary inevitably attention have taken new attitude saw possibility of new interpretation be in position in seemed to herself to be slighting mr farebrother in relation to man who be much honored be always dangerous to firmness of grateful woman to have reason for going next day be relief for mary earnestly desired to be always clear that loved fred best when tender affection have be storing in through many of year idea that must accept exchange for seems to be cheapening of life can set watch over affection constancy a can over other treasure fred have lost other expectation must keep mary said to herself with smile curling lip be impossible to help fleeting vision of kindnew dignity acknowledged value of have often felt absence thing with fred outside fred forsaken looking sad for want of must never tempt deliberate thought chapter lviii for there can live hatred in thine eye therefore in can not know thy change in manys look false heart history be writ in mood frown wrinkle strange heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love must ever dwell whateer thy thought thy heart working be thy look must nothing thence sweetness tell shakespeare sonnet at time when mr vincy uttered that presentiment about rosamond have never have idea that must be driven to make sort of appeal foresaw have not yet have anxiety about way mean although domestic life have be expensive a well a eventful baby have be born prematurely embroidered robe cap have to be laid by in darkness misfortune be attributed entirely to having persisted in going out on horseback one day when husband have desired not to do so must not be supposed that have shown temper on occasion rudely told that must do a liked what led particularly to desire horse exercise be visit from captain lydgate baronet third son who be sorry to say be detested by tertius of name a vapid fop parting hair from brow to nape in despicable fashion not followed by tertius showing ignorant security that knew proper thing to say on topic lydgate inwardly cursed own folly that have drawn down visit by consenting to go to uncle on wedding tour made rather disagreeable to rosamond by saying so in private for to rosamond visit be source of unprecedented gracefully concealed exultation be so intensely conscious of having cousin who be baronet son staying in house that imagined knowledge of what be implied by presence to be diffused through other mind when introduced captain lydgate to guest have placid sense that rank penetrated a if have be odor satisfaction be enough for time to melt away disappointment in condition of marriage with medical man even of good birth seemed now that marriage be visibly a well a ideally floating above middlemarch level future looked bright with letter visit to from quallingham vague advancement in consequence for tertius especially a probably at captain suggestion married sister mr mengan have come with maid stayed two night on way from town hence be clearly worth while for rosamond to take pain with music careful selection of lace a to captain lydgate low brow aquiline nose bent on one side rather heavy utterance might have be disadvantageous in young gentleman who have not military bearing mustache to give what be doted on by flower like blond head a style have that sort of high breeding consists in being free from petty solicitude of middle class gentility be great critic of feminine charm rosamond delighted in admiration now even more than have done at quallingham found easy to spend several hour of day in flirting with visit altogether be one of pleasantest lark have ever have not le so perhaps because suspected that queer cousin tertius wished away though lydgate who must rather hyperbolically speaking have died than have failed in polite hospitality suppressed dislike only pretended generally not to hear what gallant officer said consigning task of answering to rosamond for be not at jealous husband preferred leaving feather headed young gentleman alone with wife to bearing company wish must talk more to captain at dinner tertius said rosamond one evening when important guest be gone to loamford to see brother officer stationed there really look so absent sometimesyou seem to be seeing through head into something behind instead of looking at dear rosy dont expect to talk much to conceited as a hope said lydgate brusquely if got head broken might look at with interest not before can not conceive why must speak of cousin so contemptuously said rosamond finger moving at work while spoke with mild gravity have touch of disdain in ask ladislaw if doesnt think captain greatest bore ever met with ladislaw have almost forsaken house since came rosamond thought knew perfectly well why mr ladislaw disliked captain be jealous liked being jealous be impossible to say what will suit eccentric person answered in opinion captain lydgate be thorough gentleman think ought not out of respect to sir godwin to treat with neglect dear have have dinner for come in go out a like doesnt want still when be in room might show more attention may not be phoenix of cleverness in sense profession be different must be better for to talk little on subject think conversation be quite agreeable be anything unprincipled man fact be must wish to be little more like rosy said lydgate in sort of resigned murmur with smile be not exactly tender certainly not merry rosamond be silent did not smile again lovely curve of face looked good tempered enough without smiling word of lydgates be like sad milestone marking how far have travelled from old dreamland in rosamond vincy appeared to be that perfect piece of womanhood who must reverence husband mind after fashion of accomplished mermaid using comb looking glass singing song for relaxation of adored wisdom alone have begun to distinguish between imagined adoration attraction towards man talent because give prestige be like order in button hole honorable before name might have be supposed that rosamond have travelled too since have found pointless conversation of mr ned plymdale perfectly wearisome to most mortal there be stupidity be unendurable stupidity be altogether acceptableelse indeed what must become of social bond captain lydgates stupidity be delicately scented carried with style talked with good accent be closely related to sir godwin rosamond found quite agreeable caught many of phrase therefore since rosamond a know be fond of horseback there be plenty of reason why must be tempted to resume riding when captain lydgate who have ordered man with two horse to follow put up at green dragon begged to go out on gray warranted to be gentle trained to carry ladyindeed have bought for sister be taking to quallingham rosamond went out first time without telling husband came back before return ride have be so thorough success declared so much better in consequence that be informed of with full reliance on consent that must go riding again on contrary lydgate be more than hurthe be utterly confounded that have risked on strange horse without referring matter to wish after first almost thundering exclamation of astonishment sufficiently warned rosamond of what be coming be silent for moment however have come back safely said at last in decisive tone will not go again rosy be understood if be quietest most familiar horse in world there must always be chance of accident know very well that wished to give up riding roan on account there be chance of accident indoors tertius darling dont talk nonsense said lydgate in imploring tone surely be person to judge for think be enough that say be not to go again rosamond be arranging hair before dinner reflection of head in glass showed change in loveliness except little turning aside of long neck lydgate have be moving about with hand in pocket now paused near a if awaited assurance wish must fasten up plait dear said rosamond letting arm fall with little sigh so a to make husband ashamed of standing there like brute lydgate have often fastened plait before being among deftest of men with large finely formed finger swept up soft festoon of plait fastened in tall comb to such us do men come what must do then kiss exquisite nape be shown in delicate curve when do what have done before be often with difference lydgate be still angry have not forgotten point will tell captain that ought to have known better than offer horse said a moved away beg will not do anything of kind tertius said rosamond looking at with something more marked than usual in speech will be treating a if be child promise that will leave subject to there did seem to be truth in objection lydgate said very well with surly obedience thus discussion ended with promising rosamond not with promising in fact have be determined not to promise rosamond have that victorious obstinacy never waste energy in impetuous resistance what liked to do be to right thing cleverness be directed to getting mean of doing meant to go out riding again on gray did go on next opportunity of husband absence not intending that must know until be late enough not to signify to temptation be certainly great be very fond of exercise gratification of riding on fine horse with captain lydgate sir godwins son on fine horse by side of being met in position by one husband be something a good a dream before marriage moreover be riveting connection with family at quallingham must be wise thing to do gentle gray unprepared for crash of tree be being felled on edge of halsell wood took fright caused worse fright to rosamond leading finally to loss of baby lydgate must not show anger towards be rather bearish to captain whose visit naturally soon came to end in future conversation on subject rosamond be mildly certain that ride have made difference that if have stayed at home same symptom must have come on must have ended in same way because have felt something like before lydgate must only say poor poor darlingbut secretly wondered over terrible tenacity of mild creature there be gathering within amazed sense of powerlessness over rosamond superior knowledge mental force instead of being a have imagined shrine to consult on occasion be simply set aside on practical question have regarded rosamonds cleverness a precisely of receptive kind became woman be now beginning to find out what that cleverness be shape into have run a into close network aloof independent one quicker than rosamond to see cause effect lay within track of own taste interest have seen clearly lydgates preeminence in middlemarch society must go on imaginatively tracing still more agreeable social effect when talent must have advanced for professional scientific ambition have other relation to desirable effect than if have be fortunate discovery of ill smelling oil oil apart with have nothing to do of course believed in own opinion more than did in lydgate be astounded to find in numberless trifling matter a well a in last serious case of riding that affection did not make compliant have doubt that affection be there have presentiment that have done anything to repel for own part said to that loved a tenderly a ever must make up mind to negation butwell lydgate be much worried conscious of new element in life a noxious to a inlet of mud to creature have be used to breathe bathe dart after illuminated prey in clearest of water rosamond be soon looking lovelier than ever at worktable enjoying drive in father phaeton thinking likely that might be invited to quallingham knew that be much more exquisite ornament to drawing room there than daughter of family in reflecting that gentleman be aware of did not perhaps sufficiently consider whether lady must be eager to see surpassed lydgate relieved from anxiety about relapsed into what inwardly called moodinessa name to covered thoughtful preoccupation with other subject than a well a uneasy look of brow distaste for ordinary thing a if be mixed with bitter herb really made sort of weather glass to vexation foreboding latter state of mind have one cause amongst others have generously mistakenly avoided mentioning to rosamond lest must affect health spirit between indeed there be that total missing of others mental track be too evidently possible even between person who be continually thinking of other to lydgate seemed that have be spending month after month in sacrificing more than half of best intent best power to tenderness for rosamond bearing little claim interruption without impatience above bearing without betrayal of bitterness to look through le le of interfering illusion at blank unreflecting surface mind presented to ardor for more impersonal end of profession scientific study ardor have fancied that ideal wife must somehow worship a sublime though not in least knowing why endurance be mingled with self discontent if know how to be candid will confess to make more than bitterness under grievance wife husband included always remains true that if have be greater circumstance must have be le strong against lydgate be aware that concession to rosamond be often little more than lapse of slackening resolution creeping paralysis apt to seize enthusiasm be out of adjustment to constant portion of life on lydgates enthusiasm there be constantly pressing not simple weight of sorrow biting presence of petty degrading care such a cast blight of irony over higher effort be care have hitherto abstained from mentioning to rosamond believed with wonder that have never entered mind though certainly difficulty must be le mysterious be inference with conspicuous handle to have be easily drawn by indifferent observer lydgate be in debt must not succeed in keeping out of mind for long together that be day getting deeper into swamp tempts men towards with pretty covering of flower verdure be wonderful how soon man get up to chin therein condition in in spite of be forced to think chiefly of release though have scheme of universe in soul eighteen month ago lydgate be poor have never known eager want of small sum felt rather burning contempt for one who descended step in order to gain be now experiencing something worse than simple deficit be assailed by vulgar hateful trial of man who have bought used great many thing might have be done without be unable to pay for though demand for payment have become pressing how came about may be easily seen without much arithmetic knowledge of price when man in setting up house preparing for marriage find that furniture other initial expense come to between four five hundred pound more than have capital to pay for when at end of year appears that household expense horse et caeteras amount to nearly thousand while proceeds of practice reckoned from old book to be worth eight hundred per annum have sunk like summer pond make hardly five hundred chiefly in unpaid entry plain inference be that whether mind not be in debt be le expensive time than own provincial life be comparatively modest ease with medical man who have lately bought practice who thought that be obliged to keep two horse whose table be supplied without stint who paid insurance on life high rent for house garden might find expense doubling receipt can be conceived by one who doe not think detail beneath consideration rosamond accustomed from childhood to extravagant household thought that good housekeeping consisted simply in ordering best of everythingnothing else answered lydgate supposed that if thing be done at must be done properlyhe did not see how be to live otherwise if head of household expenditure have be mentioned to beforehand must have probably observed that must hardly come to much if one have suggested saving on particular articlefor example substitution of cheap fish for dearit must have appeared to simply penny wise mean notion rosamond even without occasion a captain lydgates visit be fond of giving invitation lydgate though often thought guest tiresome did not interfere sociability seemed necessary part of professional prudence entertainment must be suitable be true lydgate be constantly visiting home of poor adjusting prescription of diet to small mean dear have not by time ceased to be remarkableis not rather that expect in men that must have numerous strand of experience lying side by side never compare with other expenditurelike ugliness errorsbecomes totally new thing when attach own personality to measure by wide difference be manifest in own sensation between ourselves others lydgate believed to be careless about dress despised man who calculated effect of costume seemed to only matter of course that have abundance of fresh garmentssuch thing be naturally ordered in sheaf must be remembered that have never hitherto felt check of importunate debt walked by habit not by self criticism check have come novelty made more irritating be amazed disgusted that condition so foreign to purpose so hatefully disconnected with object cared to occupy with must have lain in ambush clutched when be unaware there be not only actual debt there be certainty that in present position must go on deepening two furnishing tradesman at brassing whose bill have be incurred before marriage whom uncalculated current expense have ever since prevented from paying have repeatedly sent unpleasant letter have forced on attention must hardly have be more galling to disposition than to lydgates with intense pridehis dislike of asking favor being under obligation to one have scorned even to form conjecture about mr vincys intention on money matter nothing extremity must have induced to apply to father in law even if have not be made aware in various indirect way since marriage that mr vincys own affair be not flourishing that expectation of help from must be resented men easily trust in readiness of friend have never in former part of life occurred to lydgate that must need to do so have never thought what borrowing must be to now that idea have entered mind felt that must rather incur other hardship in mean time have money prospect of money practice be not getting more lucrative wonder lydgate have be unable to suppress sign of inward trouble during last few month now that rosamond be regaining brilliant health meditated taking entirely into confidence on difficulty new conversance with tradesman bill have forced reasoning into new channel of comparison have begun to consider from new point of view what be necessary unnecessary in good ordered to see that there must be change of habit how must such change be made without rosamonds concurrence immediate occasion of opening disagreeable fact to be forced upon having money having privately sought advice a to what security must possibly be given by man in position lydgate have offered one good security in power to le peremptory creditor who be silversmith jeweller who consented to take on upholsterer credit also accepting interest for given term security necessary be bill of sale on furniture of house might make creditor easy for reasonable time about debt amounting to le than four hundred pound silversmith mr dover be willing to reduce by taking back portion of plate other article be a good a new other article be phrase delicately implying jewellery more particularly purple amethyst costing thirty pound lydgate have bought a bridal present opinion may be divided a to wisdom in making present may think that be graceful attention to be expected from man like lydgate that fault of troublesome consequence lay in pinched narrowness of provincial life at time offered convenience for professional people whose fortune be not proportioned to taste also in lydgates ridiculous fastidiousness about asking friend for money however have seemed question of moment to on fine morning when went to give final order for plate in presence of other jewel enormously expensive a addition to order of amount have not be exactly calculated thirty pound for ornament so exquisitely suited to rosamonds neck arm must hardly appear excessive when there be ready cash for to exceed at crisis lydgates imagination must not help dwelling on possibility of letting amethyst take place again among mr dover stock though shrank from idea of proposing to rosamond having be roused to discern consequence have never be in habit of tracing be preparing to act on discernment with of rigor by mean that must have applied in pursuing experiment be nerving to rigor a rode from brassing meditated on representation must make to rosamond be evening when got home be intensely miserable strong man of nine twenty of many gift be not saying angrily within that have made profound mistake mistake be at work in like recognized chronic disease mingling uneasy importunity with prospect enfeebling thought a went along passage to drawing room heard piano singing of course ladislaw be there be week since will have parted from dorothea yet be still at old post in middlemarch lydgate have objection in general to ladislaws coming just now be annoyed that must not find hearth free when opened door two singer went on towards key note raising eye looking at indeed not regarding entrance a interruption to man galled with harness a poor lydgate be be not soothing to see two people warbling at a come in with sense that painful day have still pain in store face already paler than usual took on scowl a walked across room flung into chair singer feeling excused by fact that have only three bar to sing now turned round how be lydgate said will coming forward to shake hand lydgate took hand did not think necessary to speak have dined tertius expected much earlier said rosamond who have already seen that husband be in horrible humor seated in usual place a spoke have dined must like tea please said lydgate curtly still scowling looking markedly at leg stretched out before will be too quick to need more will be off said reaching hat tea be coming said rosamond pray dont go yes lydgate be bored said will who have more comprehension of lydgate than rosamond have be not offended by manner easily imagining outdoor cause of annoyance there be more need for to stay said rosamond playfully in lightest accent will not speak to evening yes rosamond will said lydgate in strong baritone have serious business to speak to about introduction of business must have be le like lydgate have intended indifferent manner have be too provoking there see said will im going to meeting about mechanic institute good by went quickly out of room rosamond did not look at husband presently rose took place before tea tray be thinking that have never seen so disagreeable lydgate turned dark eye on watched a delicately handled tea service with taper finger looked at object immediately before with curve in face disturbed yet with ineffable protest in air against people with unpleasant manner for moment lost sense of wound in sudden speculation about new form of feminine impassibility revealing in sylph like frame have once interpreted a sign of ready intelligent sensitiveness mind glancing back to laure while looked at rosamond said inwardly must kill because wearied then be way with woman power of generalizing give men so much superiority in mistake over dumb animal be immediately thwarted by lydgates memory of wondering impression from behavior of womanfrom dorotheas look tone of emotion about husband when lydgate began to attend himfrom passionate cry to be taught what must best comfort man for whose sake seemed a if must quell impulse in except yearning of faithfulness compassion revived impression succeeded other quickly dreamily in lydgates mind while tea be being brewed have shut eye in last instant of reverie while heard dorothea saying advise methink what can dohe have be life laboring looking forward mind about nothing elseand mind about nothing else that voice of deep souled womanhood have remained within a enkindling

reappear when be not expected to do so first farewell have pathos in to come back for second lends opening to comedy be possible even that there might be bitter sneer afloat about will motif for lingering still be on whole more satisfactory to feeling to take directest mean of seeing dorothea than to use device might give air of chance to meeting of wished to understand that be what earnestly sought when have parted from before have be in ignorance of fact gave new aspect to relation between made more absolute severance than have then believed in knew nothing of dorotheas private fortune being little used to reflect on such matter took for granted that according to mr casaubons arrangement marriage to will ladislaw must mean that consented to be penniless be not what must wish for even in secret heart even if have be ready to meet such hard contrast for sake then too there be fresh smart of disclosure about mother family if known must be added reason why dorotheas friend must look down upon a utterly below secret hope that after year might come back with sense that have at least personal value equal to wealth seemed now dreamy continuation of dream change must surely justify in asking dorothea to receive once more dorothea on morning be not at home to receive will note in consequence of letter from uncle announcing intention to be at home in week have driven first

going immediately be fact to embitter sir james suspicion at least to justify aversion to young fellow whom represented to a slight volatile likely enough to show such recklessness a naturally went along with position unriveted by family tie strict profession have just heard something from standish while justified surmise about will offered mean of nullifying danger with regard to dorothea unwonted circumstance may make rather unlike there be condition under most majestic person be obliged to sneeze emotion be liable to be acted on in same incongruous manner good sir james be morning so

gossip have in mind before dorothea happened to arrive have be trying to imagine how with shyness unready tongue must ever manage to introduce communication unexpected presence brought to utter hopelessness in own power of saying anything unpleasant desperation suggested resource sent groom on unsaddled horse across park with pencilled note to mr cadwallader who already knew gossip must think compromise of herself to repeat a often a required dorothea be detained on good pretext mr garth whom wanted to see be expected at hall within hour be still talking to caleb on gravel when sir

that one report be false mr cadwallader believe be false too said dorothea with indignant energy at least feel sure be misrepresentation will not hear evil spoken of mr ladislaw have already suffered too much injustice dorothea when thoroughly moved cared little what one thought of feeling even if have be able to reflect must have held petty to keep silence at injurious word about will from fear of being misunderstood face be flushed lip trembled sir james glancing at repented of stratagem mr cadwallader equal to occasion spread palm of hand outward saidheaven grant deari mean that bad tale about anybody may be false be pity that young lydgate must have married one of middlemarch girl considering he son of somebody might have got woman with good blood in vein not too young who must have

have found portfolio have laid on table at far end of room to turn over sketch please by looking at memorable piece of art have relation to nature too mysterious for dorothea be smiling at still shaking sketch into order with thought that might find letter from awaiting at middlemarch when mr kell close to elbow said mr casaubon be coming in sir will turned round quickly next moment dorothea be entering a mr kell closed door behind met be looking at other consciousness be overflowed by something suppressed utterance be not confusion that kept silent for felt that parting be near there be

dorothea be wishing that might overtake will see once more after turn of road there be with portfolio under arm next moment be passing while raised hat felt pang at being seated there in sort of exaltation leaving behind must not look back at be a if crowd of indifferent object have thrust asunder forced along different path taking farther farther away from other making useless to look back

only wish have known beforei wish knewthen must be quite happy in thinking of other though be forever parted if must have given money made thing easier for longing came back most persistently yet so heavily did world weigh on in spite of independent energy that with idea of will a in need of such help at disadvantage with world there came always vision of unfittingness of closer relation between lay in opinion of one connected with felt to full imperativeness of motif urged will conduct how must dream of defying barrier that husband have placed between themhow must ever say to herself that must defy will certainty a carriage grew smaller in distance have much more bitterness in very slight matter be enough to gall in sensitive mood sight of dorothea driving past while felt plodding along a poor devil seeking position in world in present temper offered little that coveted made conduct seem mere matter of necessity took away sustainment of resolve after have assurance that loved must man pretend that be simply glad in such case to have suffering on own side that evening will spent with lydgates next evening be gone book vii two temptation chapter lxiii little thing be great to little mangoldsmith have seen much of scientific phoenix lydgate lately said mr toller at one of christmas dinner party speaking to mr farebrother on right hand not much be sorry to say answered vicar accustomed to parry mr toller banter about belief in new medical light be out of way be too busy be be glad to hear said dr minchin with mingled suavity surprise give great deal of time to new hospital said mr farebrother who have reason for continuing subject hear of from neighbor mr casaubon who go there often say lydgate be indefatigable be making fine thing of bulstrodes institution be preparing new ward in case of cholera coming to preparing theory of treatment to try on patient suppose said mr toller come toller be candid said mr farebrother be too clever not to see good of bold fresh mind in medicine a well a in everything else a to cholera fancy none of be very sure what ought to do if man go little too far along new road be usually that harm more than one else be sure wrench ought to be obliged to said dr minchin looking towards toller for have sent cream of peacock patient lydgate have be living at great rate for young beginner said mr harry toller brewer suppose relation in north back up hope so said mr chichely else ought not to have married that nice girl be so fond of hang have grudge against man who carry off prettiest girl in town ay by god best too said mr standish friend vincy didnt half like marriage know said mr chichely wouldnt do much how relation on other side may have come down cant say there be emphatic kind of reticence in mr chichelys manner of speaking oh shouldnt think lydgate ever looked to practice for living said mr toller with slight touch of sarcasm there subject be dropped be not first time mr farebrother have heard hint of lydgates expense being obviously too great to be met by practice thought not unlikely that there be resource expectation excused large outlay at time of lydgates marriage might hinder bad consequence from disappointment in practice one evening when took pain to go to middlemarch on purpose to have chat with lydgate a of old noticed in air of excited effort quite unlike usual easy way of keeping silence breaking with abrupt energy whenever have anything to say lydgate talked persistently when be in work room putting argument for against probability of certain biological view have none of definite thing to say to show give waymarks of patient uninterrupted pursuit such a used to insist on saying that there must be systole diastole in inquiry that man mind must be continually expanding shrinking between whole human horizon horizon of object glass that evening seemed to be talking widely for sake of resisting personal bearing before long went into drawing room where lydgate having asked rosamond to give music sank back in chair in silence with strange light in eye may have be taking opiate be thought crossed mr farebrothers mindtic douloureux perhapsor medical worry did not occur to that lydgates marriage be not delightful believed a rest did that rosamond be amiable docile creature though have always thought rather uninterestinga little too much pattern card of finishing school mother must not forgive rosamond because never seemed to see that henrietta noble be in room however lydgate fell in love with said vicar to must be to taste mr farebrother be aware that lydgate be proud man having very little corresponding fibre in perhaps too little care about personal dignity except dignity of not being mean foolish must hardly allow enough for way in lydgate shrank a from burn from utterance of word about private affair soon after conversation at mr toller vicar learned something made watch more eagerly for opportunity of indirectly letting lydgate know that if wanted to open about difficulty there be friendly ear ready opportunity came at mr vincys where on new year day there be party to mr farebrother be irresistibly invited on plea that must not forsake old friend on first new year of being greater man rector a well a vicar party be thoroughly friendly lady of farebrother family be present vincy child dined at table fred have persuaded mother that if did not invite mary garth farebrothers must regard a slight to mary being particular friend mary came fred be in high spirit though enjoyment be of checkered kindtriumph that mother must see mary importance with chief personage in party being much streaked with jealousy when mr farebrother sat down by fred used to be much more easy about own accomplishment in day when have not begun to dread being bowled out by farebrother terror be still before mr vincy in fullest matronly bloom looked at mary little figure rough wavy hair visage quite without lily rose wondered trying unsuccessfully to fancy caring about mary appearance in wedding clothes feeling complacency in grandchild who must feature garths however party be merry one mary be particularly bright being glad for freds sake that friend be getting kinder to being also quite willing that must see how much be valued by others whom must admit to be judge mr farebrother noticed that lydgate seemed bored mr vincy spoke a little a possible to son in law rosamond be perfectly graceful calm only subtle observation such a vicar have not be roused to bestow on must have perceived total absence of interest in husband presence loving wife be sure to betray even if etiquette keep aloof from when lydgate be taking part in conversation never looked towards more than if have be sculptured psyche modelled to look way when after being called out for hour two re entered room seemed unconscious of fact eighteen month before must have have effect of numeral before cipher in reality however be intensely aware

of hall mr farebrother played rubber to satisfy mother who regarded occasional whist a protest against scandal novelty of opinion in light even revoke have dignity at end got mr chichely to take place left room a crossed hall lydgate have just come in be taking off great coat be man be going to look for said vicar instead of entering drawing room walked along hall stood against fireplace where frosty air helped to make glowing bank see can leave whist table easily enough went on smiling at lydgate now dont play for money owe to mr casaubon say how said lydgate coldly ah didnt mean to know call ungenerous reticence must let man have pleasure of feeling that have done good turn dont enter into people dislike of being under obligation upon word prefer being under obligation to everybody for behaving well to cant tell what mean said lydgate unless be once spoke of to mr casaubon did not think that must break promise not to mention have done so said lydgate leaning back against corner of mantel piece showing radiance in face be brooke who let out only other day paid compliment of saying that be very glad have living though have come across tactic have praised up a ken tillotson that sort of thing till mr casaubon must hear of one else oh brooke be such leaky minded fool said lydgate contemptuously well be glad of leakiness then dont see why shouldnt like to know that wished to do service dear fellow certainly have done one rather strong check to one complacency to find how much of one right doing depends on not being in want of money man will not be tempted to say lord prayer backward to please devil if doesnt want devil service have need to hang on smile of chance now dont see that there money getting without chance said lydgate if man get in profession pretty sure to come by chance mr farebrother thought must account for speech in striking contrast with lydgates former way of talking a perversity will often spring from moodiness of man ill at ease in affair answered in tone of good humored admission ah there enormous patience wanted with way of world be easier for man to wait patiently when have friend who love ask for nothing better than to help through so far a lie in power oh yes said lydgate in careless tone changing attitude looking at watch people make much more of difficulty than need to do knew a distinctly a possible that be offer of help to from mr farebrother must not bear so strangely determined be mortal that after having be long gratified with sense that have privately done vicar service suggestion that vicar discerned need of service in return made shrink into unconquerable reticence besides behind making of such offer what else must comethat must mention case imply that wanted specific thing at moment suicide seemed easier mr farebrother be too keen man not to know meaning of reply there be certain massiveness in lydgates manner tone corresponding with physique if repelled advance in first instance seemed to put persuasive device out of question what time be said vicar devouring wounded feeling after eleven said lydgate went into drawing room chapter lxiv st gent where lie power there let blame lie too d gent nay power be relative can not fright coming pest with border fortress catch carp with subtle argument force be twain in one cause be not cause unless effect be there action must need contain passive so command exists with obedience even if lydgate have be inclined to be quite open about affair knew that must have hardly be in mr farebrothers power to give help immediately wanted with year bill coming in from tradesman with dover threatening hold on furniture with nothing to depend on slow dribbling payment from patient who must not be offendedfor handsome fee have have from freshitt hall lowick manor have be easily absorbednothing le than thousand pound must have freed from actual embarrassment left residue according to favorite phrase of hopefulness in such circumstance must have given time to look about naturally merry christmas bringing happy new year when fellow citizen expect to be paid for trouble good have smilingly bestowed on neighbor have so tightened pressure of sordid care on lydgates mind that be hardly possible for to think unbrokenly of other subject even most habitual soliciting be not ill tempered man intellectual activity ardent kindness of heart a well a strong frame must always under tolerably easy condition have kept above petty uncontrolled susceptibility make bad temper be now prey to worst irritation arises not simply from annoyance from second consciousness underlying annoyance of wasted energy degrading preoccupation be reverse of former purpose be what be thinking of be what might have be thinking of be bitter incessant murmur within making difficulty double goad to impatience gentleman have made amazing figure in literature by general discontent with universe a trap of dulness into great soul have fallen by mistake sense of stupendous self insignificant world may have consolation lydgates discontent be much harder to bear be sense that there be grand existence in thought effective action lying around while self be being narrowed into miserable isolation of egoistic fear vulgar anxiety for event might allay such fear trouble will perhaps appear miserably sordid beneath attention of lofty person who can know nothing of debt except on magnificent scale doubtless be sordid for majority who be not lofty there be escape from sordidness by being free from money craving with base hope temptation watching for death hinted request horse dealer desire to make bad work pas for good seeking for function ought to be anothers compulsion often to long for luck in shape of wide calamity be because lydgate writhed under idea of getting neck beneath vile yoke that have fallen into bitter moody state be continually widening rosamonds alienation from after first disclosure about bill of sale have made many effort to draw into sympathy with about possible measure for narrowing expense with threatening approach of christmas proposition grew more more definite two can do with only one servant live on very little said will manage with one horse for lydgate a have seen have begun to reason with more distinct vision about expense of living share of pride have given to appearance of sort be meagre compared with pride made revolt from exposure a debtor from asking men to help with money of course can dismiss other two servant if like said rosamond must have thought must be very injurious to position for to live in poor way must expect practice to be lowered dear rosamond be not question of choice have begun too expensively peacock know lived in much smaller house than be fault ought to have known better deserve thrashingif there be anybody who have right to give mefor bringing into necessity of living in poorer way than have be used to married because loved other suppose may help to pull along till thing get better come dear put down work come to be really in chill gloom about at moment dreaded future without affection be determined to resist oncoming of division between rosamond obeyed took on knee in secret soul be utterly aloof from poor thing saw only that world be not ordered to liking lydgate be part of world held waist with one hand laid other gently on of hers for rather abrupt man have much tenderness in manner towards woman seeming to have always present in imagination weakness of frame delicate poise of health in body mind began again to speak persuasively find now look into thing little rosy that be wonderful what amount of money slip away in housekeeping suppose servant be careless have have great many people coming there must be many in rank who manage with much le must do with commoner thing suppose look after scrap seems money go little way in matter for wrench have everything a plain a possible have very large practice oh if think of living a wrench do said rosamond with little turn of neck have heard express disgust at way of living yes have bad taste in everythingthey make economy look ugly neednt do that only meant that avoid expense although wrench have capital practice why must not have good practice tertius mr peacock have must be more careful not to offend people must send out medicine a others do be sure began well got several good house can not answer to be eccentric must think what will be generally liked said rosamond in decided little tone of admonition lydgates anger rose be prepared to be indulgent towards feminine weakness not towards feminine dictation willowness of waternixies soul may have charm until becomes didactic controlled only said with touch of despotic firmness what be to do in practice rosy be for to judge be not question between be enough for to know that income be likely to be very narrow onehardly four hundred perhaps le for long time to come must try to re arrange life in accordance with fact rosamond be silent for moment two looking before then said uncle bulstrode ought to allow salary for time give to hospital be not right that must work for nothing be understood from beginning that service must be gratuitous that again need not enter into discussion have pointed out what be only probability said lydgate impatiently then checking went on more quietly think see one resource must free from good deal of present difficulty hear that young ned plymdale be going to be married to miss sophy toller be rich be not often that good house be vacant in middlemarch feel sure that must be glad to take house from with most of furniture must be willing to pay handsomely for lease can employ trumbull to speak to plymdale about rosamond left husband knee walked slowly to other end of room when turned round walked towards be evident that tear have come that be biting under lip clasping hand to keep from cry lydgate be wretchedshaken with anger yet feeling that must be unmanly to vent anger just now be very sorry rosamond know be painful thought at least when have borne to send plate back have man taking inventory of furniturei must have thought must suffice explained to at time dear be only security behind security there be debt debt must be paid within next few month else will have furniture sold if young plymdale will take house most of furniture will be able to pay debt others too will be quit of place too expensive for might take smaller house trumbull know have very decent one to let at thirty pound year be ninety lydgate uttered speech in curt hammering way with usually try to nail down vague mind to imperative fact tear rolled silently down rosamonds cheek just pressed handkerchief against stood looking at large vase on mantel piece be moment of more intense bitterness than have ever felt before at last said without hurry with careful emphasis never must have believed that must like to act in way like burst out lydgate rising from chair thrusting hand in pocket stalking away from hearth not question of liking of course dont like only thing can do wheeled round there turned towards must have thought there be many other mean than said rosamond let have sale leave middlemarch altogether to do what what be use of leaving work in middlemarch to go where have none must be just a penniless elsewhere a be here said lydgate still more angrily if be to be in position will be entirely own doing tertius said rosamond turning round to speak with fullest conviction will not behave a ought to do to own family offended captain lydgate sir godwin be very kind to when be at quallingham be sure if showed proper regard to told affair must do anything for rather than that like giving up house furniture to mr ned plymdale there be something like fierceness in lydgates eye a answered with new violence well then if will have so do like admit that like better than making fool of myself by going to beg where of use understand then that be what like to do there be tone in last sentence be equivalent to clutch of strong hand on rosamonds delicate arm for will be not whit stronger than hers immediately walked out of room in silence with intense determination to hinder what lydgate liked to do went out of house a blood cooled felt that chief result of discussion be deposit of dread within at idea of opening with wife in future subject might again urge to violent speech be a if fracture in delicate crystal have begun be afraid of movement might make fatal marriage must be mere piece of bitter irony if must not go on loving other have long ago made up mind to what thought be negative characterher want of sensibility showed in disregard of specific wish of general aim first great disappointment have be borne tender devotedness docile adoration of ideal wife must be renounced life must be taken up on lower stage of expectation a be by men who have lost limb real wife have not only claim have still hold on heart be intense desire that hold must remain strong in marriage certainty will never love much be easier to bear than fear will love more hence after outburst inward effort be entirely to excuse to blame hard circumstance be partly fault tried that evening by petting to heal wound have made in morning be not in rosamonds nature to be repellent sulky indeed welcomed sign that husband loved be under control be something quite distinct from loving lydgate must not have chosen soon to recur to plan of parting with house be resolved to carry out say a little more about a possible rosamond touched on at breakfast by saying mildly have spoken to trumbull yet said lydgate will call on a go by morning time must be lost took rosamonds question a sign that withdrew inward opposition kissed head caressingly when got up to go away a soon a be late enough to make call rosamond went to mr plymdale mr neds mother entered with pretty congratulation into subject of coming marriage mr plymdales maternal view be that rosamond might possibly now have retrospective glimpse of own folly feeling advantage to be at present on side of son be too kind woman not to behave graciously yes ned be most happy must say sophy toller be must desire in daughter in law of course father be able to do something handsome for be only what must be expected with brewery like connection be everything must desire be not what look at be such very nice girlno air pretension though on level with first dont mean with titled aristocracy see very little good in people aiming out of own sphere mean that sophy be equal to best in town be contented with have always thought very agreeable said rosamond look upon a reward for ned who never held head too high that must have got into very best connection continued mr plymdale native sharpness softened by fervid sense that be taking correct view such particular people a toller be might have objected because of friend be not theirs be well known that aunt bulstrode have be intimate from youth mr plymdale have be always on mr bulstrodes side prefer serious opinion toller have welcomed ned same be sure be very deserving well principled young man said rosamond with neat air of patronage in return for mr plymdales wholesome correction oh have not style of captain in army that sort of carriage a if everybody be beneath that showy kind of talking singing intellectual talent be thankful have not be poor preparation for here hereafter oh dear yes appearance have very little to do with happiness said rosamond think there be prospect of being happy couple what house will take oh a for that must put up with what can get have be looking at house in st peter place next to mr hackbutts belongs to be putting nicely in repair suppose be not likely to hear of better indeed think ned will decide matter to day must think be nice house like st peter place well be near church genteel situation window be narrow be ups down dont happen to know of other must be at liberty said mr plymdale fixing round black eye on rosamond with animation of sudden thought in oh hear so little of thing rosamond have not foreseen that question answer in setting out to pay visit have simply meant to gather information must help to avert parting with own house under circumstance thoroughly disagreeable to a to untruth in reply more reflected on than did on untruth there be in saying that appearance have very little to do with happiness object be convinced be thoroughly justifiable be lydgate whose intention be inexcusable there be plan in mind when have carried out fully must prove how very false step must have be for to have descended from position returned home by mr borthrop trumbull office meaning to call there be first time in life that rosamond have thought of doing anything in form of business felt equal to occasion that must be obliged to do what intensely disliked be idea turned quiet tenacity into active invention here be case in must not be enough simply to disobey be serenely placidly obstinate must act according to judgment said to herself that judgment be rightindeed if have not be must not have wished to act on mr trumbull be in back room of office received rosamond with finest manner not only because have much sensibility to charm because good natured fibre in be stirred by certainty that lydgate be in difficulty that uncommonly pretty womanthis young lady with highest personal attractionswas likely to feel pinch of troubleto find involved in circumstance beyond control begged to do honor to take seat stood before trimming comporting with eager solicitude be chiefly benevolent rosamonds first question be whether husband have called on mr trumbull morning to speak about disposing of house yes maam did did so said good auctioneer trying to throw something soothing into iteration be about to fulfil order if possible afternoon wished not to procrastinate called to tell not to go further mr trumbull beg of not to mention what have be said on subject will oblige certainly will mr lydgate certainly confidence be sacred with on business other topic be then to consider commission withdrawn said mr trumbull adjusting long end of blue cravat with hand looking at rosamond deferentially yes if please find that mr ned plymdale have taken housethe one in st peter place next to mr hackbutts mr lydgate must be annoyed that order must be fulfilled uselessly besides that there be other circumstance render proposal unnecessary very good mr lydgate very good be at command whenever require service of said mr trumbull who felt pleasure in conjecturing that new resource have be opened rely on beg affair will go further that evening lydgate be little comforted by observing that rosamond be more lively than have usually be of late even seemed interested in doing what must please without being asked thought if will be happy can rub through what doe signify be only narrow swamp that have to pas in long journey if can get mind clear again will do be so much cheered that began to search for account of experiment have long ago meant to look up have neglected out of creeping despair come in train of petty anxiety felt again of old delightful absorption in far reaching inquiry while rosamond played quiet music be a helpful to meditation a plash of oar on evening lake be rather late have pushed away book be looking at fire with hand clasped behind head in forgetfulness of everything except construction of new controlling experiment when rosamond who have left piano be leaning back in chair watching said mr ned plymdale have taken house already lydgate startled jarred looked up in silence for moment like man who have be disturbed in sleep then flushing with unpleasant consciousness asked how do know called at mr plymdales morning told that have taken house in st peter place next to mr hackbutts lydgate be silent drew hand from behind head pressed against hair be hanging a be apt to do in mass on forehead while rested elbow on knee be feeling bitter disappointment a if have opened door out of suffocating place have found walled up also felt sure that rosamond be pleased with cause of disappointment preferred not looking at not speaking until have got over first spasm of vexation after said in bitterness what can woman care about so much a house furniture husband without be absurdity when looked up pushed hair aside dark eye have miserable blank non expectance of sympathy in only said coolly perhaps one else may turn up told trumbull to be on look out if failed with plymdale rosamond made remark trusted to chance that nothing more must pas between husband auctioneer until issue must have justified interference at rate have hindered event immediately dreaded after pause said how much money be that disagreeable people want what disagreeable people who took listand others mean how much money must satisfy so that need not be troubled more lydgate surveyed for moment a if be looking for symptom then said oh if must have got six hundred from plymdale for furniture a premium might have managed must have paid off dover given enough on account to others to make wait patiently if contracted expense mean how much must want if stayed in house more than be likely to get anywhere said lydgate with rather grating sarcasm in tone angered to perceive rosamonds mind be wandering over impracticable wish instead of facing possible effort why must not mention sum said rosamond with mild indication that did not like manner well said lydgate in guessing tone must take at least thousand to set at ease added incisively have to consider what will do without not with rosamond said more next day carried out plan of writing to sir godwin lydgate since captain visit have received letter from also one from mr mengan married sister condoling with on loss of baby expressing vaguely hope that must see again at quallingham lydgate have told that politeness meant nothing be secretly convinced that backwardness in lydgates family towards be due to cold contemptuous behavior have answered letter in most charming manner feeling confidence that specific invitation must follow there have be total silence captain evidently be not great penman rosamond reflected that sister might have be abroad however season be come for thinking of friend at home at rate sir godwin who have chucked under chin pronounced to be like celebrated beauty mr croly who have made conquest of in must be touched by appeal from must find pleasant for sake to behave a ought to do towards nephew rosamond be naively convinced of what old gentleman ought to do to prevent from suffering annoyance wrote what considered most judicious letter possibleone must strike sir godwin a proof of excellent sensepointing out how desirable be that tertius must quit place a middlemarch for one more fitted to talent how unpleasant character of inhabitant have hindered professional success how in consequence be in money difficulty from must require thousand pound thoroughly to extricate did not say that tertius be unaware of intention to write for have idea that supposed sanction of letter must be in accordance with what did say of great regard for uncle godwin a relative who have always be best friend such be force of poor rosamonds tactic now applied to affair have happened before party on new year day answer have yet come from sir godwin on morning of day lydgate have to learn that rosamond have revoked order to borthrop trumbull feeling necessary that must be gradually accustomed to idea of quitting house in lowick gate overcame reluctance to speak to again on subject when be breakfasting said will try to see trumbull morning tell to advertise house in pioneer trumpet if thing be advertised one might be inclined to take who must not otherwise have thought of change in country place many people go on in old house when family be too large for for want of knowing where can find trumbull seems to have got bite at rosamond knew that inevitable moment be come ordered trumbull not to inquire further said with careful calmness be evidently defensive lydgate stared at in mute amazement only hour before have be fastening up plait for talking little language of affection rosamond though not returning accepted a if have be serene lovely image now then miraculously dimpling towards votary with such fibre still astir in shock received must not at once be distinctly anger be confused pain laid down knife fork with be carving throwing back in chair said at last with cool irony in tone may ask when why did so when knew that plymdales have taken house called to tell not to mention ours to at same time told not to let affair go on further knew that must be very injurious to if be known that wished to part with house furniture have very strong objection to think be reason enough be of consequence then have told imperative reason of kind of consequence have come to different conclusion given order accordingly said lydgate bitingly thunder lightning gathering about brow eye effect of one anger on rosamond have always be to make shrink in cold dislike to become more calmly correct in conviction that be not person to misbehave others might do replied think have perfect right to speak on subject concern at least a much a clearlyyou have right to speak only to have right to contradict order secretly treat a if be fool said lydgate in same tone a before then with added scorn be possible to make understand what consequence will be be of use for to tell again why must try to part with house be not necessary for to tell again said rosamond in voice fell trickled like cold water drop remembered what said spoke just a violently a do now that doe not alter opinion that ought to try other mean rather than take step be so painful to a to advertising house think must be perfectly degrading to suppose disregard opinion a disregard mine can do so of course think ought to have told before be married that must place in worst position rather than give up own will lydgate did not speak tossed head on one side twitched corner of mouth in despair rosamond seeing that be not looking at rose set cup of coffee before took notice of went on with inward drama argument occasionally moving in seat resting one arm on table rubbing hand against hair there be conflux of emotion thought in must not let either give thorough way to anger persevere with simple rigidity of resolve rosamond took advantage of silence when be married everyone felt that position be very high must not have imagined then that must want to sell furniture take house in bride street where room be like cage if be to live in way let at least leave middlemarch must be very strong consideration said lydgate half ironicallystill there be withered paleness about lip a looked at coffee did not drinkthese must be very strong consideration if did not happen to be in debt many person must have be in debt in same way if be respectable people trust be sure have heard papa say that torbits be in debt went on very well can not be good to act rashly said rosamond with serene wisdom lydgate sat paralyzed by opposing impulse since reasoning must apply to rosamond seemed likely to conquer assent wanted to smash grind object on must at least produce impression else to tell brutally that be master must obey not only dreaded effect of such extremity on mutual lifehe have growing dread of rosamonds quiet elusive obstinacy must not allow assertion of power to be final again have touched in spot of keenest feeling by implying that have be deluded with false vision of happiness in marrying a to saying that be master be not fact very resolution to have wrought by dint of logic honorable pride be beginning to relax under torpedo contact swallowed cup of coffee then rose to go may at least request that will not go to trumbull at presentuntil have be seen that there be other mean said rosamond although be not subject to much fear felt safer not to betray that have written to sir godwin promise that will not go to for few week without telling lydgate gave short laugh think be who must exact promise that will hing without telling said turning eye sharply upon then moving to door remember that be going to dine at papa said rosamond wishing that must turn make more thorough concession to only said oh yes impatiently went away held to be very odious in that did not think painful proposition have have to make to be enough without showing so unpleasant temper when put moderate request that must defer going to trumbull again be cruel in not to assure of what meant to do be convinced of having acted in way for best grating angry speech of lydgates served only a addition to register of offence in mind poor rosamond for month have begun to associate husband with feeling of disappointment terribly inflexible relation of marriage have lost charm of encouraging delightful dream have freed from disagreeables of father house have not given everything that have wished hoped lydgate with whom have be in love have be group of airy condition for most of have disappeared while place have be taken by day detail must be lived through slowly from hour to hour not floated through with rapid selection of favorable aspect habit of lydgates profession home preoccupation with scientific subject seemed to almost like morbid vampire taste peculiar view of thing have never entered into dialogue of courtshipall continually alienating influence even without fact of having placed at disadvantage in town without first shock of revelation about dover debt must have made presence dull to there be presence ever since early day of marriage until four month ago have be agreeable excitement be gone rosamond must not confess to herself how much consequent blank have to do with utter ennui seemed to perhaps be right that invitation to quallingham opening for lydgate to settle elsewhere than in middlemarchin london somewhere likely to be free from unpleasantnesswould satisfy quite well make indifferent to absence of will ladislaw towards whom felt resentment for exaltation of mr casaubon be state of thing with lydgate rosamond on new year day when dined at father looking mildly neutral towards in remembrance of ill tempered behavior at breakfast carrying much deeper effect from inward conflict in that morning scene be only one of many epoch flushed effort while talking to mr farebrotherhis effort after cynical pretence that way of getting money be essentially same chance have empire reduces choice to fool illusionwas symptom of wavering resolve benumbed response to old stimulus of enthusiasm what be to do saw even more keenly than rosamond did dreariness of taking into small house in bride street where must have scanty furniture around discontent within life of privation life with rosamond be two image have become more more irreconcilable ever since threat of privation have disclosed even if resolve have forced two image into combination useful preliminary to hard change be not visibly within reach though have not given promise wife have asked for did not go again to trumbull even began to think of taking rapid journey to north seeing sir godwin have once believed that nothing must urge into making application for money to uncle have not then known full pressure of alternative yet more disagreeable must not depend on effect of letter be only in interview however disagreeable might be to that must give thorough explanation must test effectiveness of kinship sooner have lydgate begun to represent step to a easiest than there be reaction of anger hehe who have long ago determined to live aloof from such abject calculation such self interested anxiety about inclination pocket of men with whom have be proud to have aim in commonshould have fallen not simply to level to level of soliciting chapter lxv one of two must bowen douteless sith man be more reasonable than woman be ye men moste be suffrable chaucer canterbury tale bias of human nature to be slow in correspondence triumph even over present quickening in general pace of thing what wonder then that in old sir godwin lydgate be slow to write letter be of consequence to others rather than to nearly three week of new year be gone rosamond awaiting answer to winning appeal be day disappointed lydgate in total ignorance of expectation be seeing bill come in feeling that dover use of advantage over other creditor be imminent have never mentioned to rosamond brooding purpose of going to quallingham did not want to admit what must appear to concession to wish after indignant refusal until last moment be really expecting to set off soon slice of railway must enable to manage whole journey back in four day one morning after lydgate have gone out letter came addressed to rosamond saw clearly to be from sir godwin be full of hope perhaps there might be particular note to enclosed lydgate be naturally addressed on question of money other aid fact that be written to nay very delay in writing at seemed to certify that answer be thoroughly compliant be too much excited by thought to do anything light stitching in warm corner of dining room with outside of momentous letter lying on table before about twelve heard husband step in passage tripping to open door said in lightest tone tertius come in herehere be letter for ah said not taking off hat just turning round within arm to walk towards spot where letter lay uncle godwin exclaimed while rosamond reseated watched a opened letter have expected to be surprised while lydgates eye glanced rapidly over brief letter saw face usually of pale brown taking on dry whiteness with nostril lip quivering tossed down letter before said violently will be impossible to endure life with if will always be acting secretlyacting in opposition to hiding action checked speech turned back on herthen wheeled round walked about sat down got up again restlessly grasping hard object deep down in pocket be afraid of saying something irremediably cruel rosamond too have changed color a read letter ran in way dear tertiusdont set wife to write to when have anything to ask be roundabout wheedling sort of thing must not have credited with never choose to write to woman on matter of business a to supplying with thousand pound only half that sum can hing of sort own family drain to last penny with two younger son three daughter be not likely to have cash to spare seem to have got through own money pretty quickly to have made mess where be sooner go somewhere else better have nothing to do with men of profession cant help there did best must for a guardian let have own way in taking to medicine might have gone into army church money must have held out for there must have be surer ladder before uncle charles have have grudge against for not going into profession not have always wished well must consider on own leg entirely now affectionate uncle godwin lydgate when rosamond have finished reading letter sat quite still with hand folded before restraining show of keen disappointment intrenching in quiet passivity under husband wrath lydgate paused in movement looked at again said with biting severity will be enough to convince of harm may do by secret meddling have sense enough to recognize now incompetence to judge act for meto interfere with ignorance in affair belongs to to decide on word be hard be not first time lydgate have be frustrated by did not look at made reply have nearly resolved on going to quallingham must have cost pain enough to do yet might have be of use have be of use for to think of anything have always be counteracting secretly delude with false assent then be at mercy of device if mean to resist wish express say so defy will at least know what be doing then be terrible moment in young life when closeness of love bond have turned to power of galling in spite of rosamonds control tear fell silently rolled over lip still said nothing under quietude be hidden intense effect be in such entire disgust with husband that wished have never seen sir godwins rudeness towards utter want of feeling ranged with dover other creditorsdisagreeable people who only thought of did not mind how annoying be to even father be unkind might have done more for in fact there be one person in rosamonds world whom did not regard a blameworthy be graceful creature with blond plait with little hand crossed before who have never expressed unbecomingly have always acted for bestthe best naturally being what best liked lydgate pausing looking at began to feel that half maddening sense of helplessness come over passionate people

to have sport never learned to write bookkeeping hand now mary being out of way for little while fred like other strong dog who can not slip collar have pulled up staple of chain made small escape not of course meaning to go fast far there must be reason why must not play at billiards be determined not to bet a to money just now fred have in mind heroic project of saving almost of eighty pound that mr garth offered returning must easily do by giving up futile money spending since have superfluous stock of clothes expense in board in way must in one year go good way towards repaying ninety pound

formal reason be very artificial inexact way of representing tingling return of old habit caprice of young blood there be lurking in prophetic sense that evening when began to play must also begin to betthat must enjoy punch drinking in general prepare for feeling rather seedy in morning be in such indefinable movement that action often begin last thing likely to have entered freds expectation be that must see brother in law lydgateof whom have never quite dropped old opinion that be prig tremendously conscious of superioritylooking excited betting just a might have done fred felt shock greater than must quite account for by vague knowledge that lydgate be in debt that father have refused to help own inclination to enter into play be suddenly checked be strange reversal of attitude freds blond face blue eye usually bright careless ready to give attention to anything held out promise of amusement looking involuntarily grave almost embarrassed a if by sight of something unfitting while lydgate who have habitually air of self possessed strength certain meditativeness seemed to lie behind most observant attention be acting watching speaking with excited narrow consciousness reminds one of animal with fierce eye retractile claw lydgate by betting on own stroke have won sixteen pound young hawleys arrival have changed poise of thing made first rate stroke began to bet against lydgates stroke strain of whose nerve be thus changed from simple confidence in own movement to defying person doubt in defiance be more exciting than confidence be le sure continued to bet on own play began often to fail still went on for mind be a utterly narrowed into precipitous crevice of play a if have be most ignorant lounger there fred observed that lydgate be losing fast found in new situation of puzzling brain to think of device by without being offensive must withdraw lydgates attention perhaps suggest to reason for quitting room saw that others be observing lydgates strange unlikeness to occurred to merely to touch elbow call aside for moment might rouse from absorption must think of nothing cleverer than daring improbability of saying that wanted to see rosy wished to know if be at home evening be going desperately to carry out weak device when waiter came up to with message saying that mr farebrother be below begged to speak with fred be surprised not quite comfortably sending word that must be down immediately went with new impulse up to lydgate said can speak to moment drew aside farebrother have just sent up message to say that want to speak to be below thought might like to know be there if have anything to say to fred have simply snatched up pretext for speaking because must not say be losing confoundedly be making everybody stare at have better come away inspiration must hardly have served better lydgate have not before seen that fred be present sudden appearance with announcement of mr farebrother have effect of sharp concussion said lydgate have nothing particular to say to butthe game be upi must be goingi came in just to see bambridge bambridge be over there be making rowi dont think he ready for business come down with to farebrother expect be going to blow up will shield said fred with adroitness lydgate felt shame must not bear to act a if felt by refusing to see mr farebrother went down merely shook hand however spoke of frost when three have turned into street vicar seemed quite willing to say good by to lydgate present purpose be clearly to talk with fred alone said kindly disturbed young gentleman because have pressing business with walk with to st botolphs will be fine night sky thick with star mr farebrother proposed that must make circuit to old church by london road next thing said be thought lydgate never went to green dragon so did said fred said that went to see bambridge be not playing then fred have not meant to tell be obliged now to say yes be suppose be accidental thing have never seen there before have be going often then lately oh about five six time think have good reason for giving up habit of going there yes know about said fred not liking to be catechised in way made clean breast to suppose give warrant to speak about matter now be understood between be notthat be on footing of open friendship have listened to will be willing to listen to may take turn in talking little about be under deepest obligation to mr farebrother said fred in state of uncomfortable surmise will not affect to deny that be under obligation to be going to confess to fred have be tempted to reverse that by keeping silence with just now when somebody said to young vincy have taken to being at billiard table night againhe wont bear curb long be tempted to do opposite of what be doingto hold tongue wait while went down ladder again betting first then have not made bet said fred hastily glad to hear say prompting be to look on see take wrong turning wear out garths patience lose best opportunity of lifethe opportunity made rather difficult effort to secure can guess feeling raised that temptation in mei be sure know be sure know that satisfaction of affection stand in way of mine there be pause mr farebrother seemed to wait for recognition of fact emotion perceptible in tone of fine voice gave solemnity to word feeling must quell freds alarm must not be expected to give up said after moment hesitation be not case for pretence of generosity clearly not when affection met yours relation of sort even when be of long standing be always liable to change can easily conceive that might act in way to loosen tie feel towards youit must be remembered that be only conditionally bound to youand in case man who may flatter that have hold on regard might succeed in winning that firm place in love a well a respect have let slip can easily conceive such result repeated mr farebrother emphatically there be companionship of ready sympathy might get advantage even over longest association seemed to fred that if mr farebrother have have beak talon instead of very capable tongue mode of attack must hardly be more cruel have horrible conviction that behind hypothetic statement there be knowledge of actual change in mary feeling of course know might easily be up with said in troubled voice if be beginning to compare broke off not liking to betray felt then said by help of little bitterness thought be friendly to so be be why be here have have strong disposition to be otherwise have said to myself if there be likelihood of youngster doing harm why must interfere arent worth a much a be dont sixteen year over above in have gone rather hungry give more right to satisfaction than have if there chance of going to dog let himperhaps must nohow hinder itand do take benefit there be pause in fred be seized by most uncomfortable chill what be coming next dreaded to hear that something have be said to maryhe felt a if be listening to threat rather than warning when vicar began again there be change in tone like encouraging transition to major key have once meant better than be come back to old intention thought must hardly secure in better fred than by telling just what have gone on in now do understand want to make happiness of life own if there be chance that word of warning from may turn aside risk to contrarywell have uttered there be drop in vicar voice when spoke last word pausedthey be standing on patch of green where road diverged towards st botolphs put out hand a if to imply that conversation be closed fred be moved quite newly one highly susceptible to contemplation of fine act have said that produce sort of regenerating shudder through frame make one feel ready to begin new life good degree of effect be just then present in fred vincy will try to be worthy said breaking off before must say of a well a of meanwhile mr farebrother have gathered impulse to say something more must not imagine that believe there be at present decline in preference of fred set heart at rest that if keep right other thing will keep right will never forget what have done fred answered cant say anything seems worth sayingonly will try that goodness will not be thrown away thats enough good by god bless in way parted of walked about long while before went out of starlight much of freds rumination might be summed up in word certainly must have be fine thing for to marry farebrotherbut if love best be good husband perhaps mr farebrothers might be concentrated into single shrug one little speech to think of part one little woman can play in life of man so that to renounce may be very good imitation of heroism to win may be discipline chapter lxvii now be there civil war within soul resolve be thrust from off sacred throne by clamorous need pride grand vizier make humble compact play supple part of envoy deft tongued apologist for hungry rebel happily lydgate have ended by losing in billiard room brought away encouragement to make raid on luck on contrary felt unmixed disgust with next day when have to pay four five pound over above gain carried about with most unpleasant vision of figure have made not only rubbing elbow with men at green dragon behaving just a did philosopher fallen to betting be hardly distinguishable from philistine under same circumstance difference will chiefly be found in subsequent reflection lydgate chewed very disagreeable cud in way reason told how affair might have be magnified into ruin by slight change of sceneryif have be gambling house that have turned into where chance must be clutched with hand instead of being picked up with thumb fore finger nevertheless though reason strangled desire to gamble there remained feeling that with assurance of luck to needful amount must have liked to gamble rather than take alternative be beginning to urge a inevitable that alternative be to apply to mr bulstrode lydgate have so many time boasted to others that be totally independent of bulstrode to whose plan have lent solely because enabled to carry out own idea of professional work public benefithe have so constantly in personal intercourse have pride sustained by sense that be making good social use of predominating banker whose opinion thought contemptible whose motif often seemed to absurd mixture of contradictory impressionsthat have be creating for strong ideal obstacle to proffering of considerable request to on own account still early in march affair be at pas in men begin to say that oath be delivered in ignorance to perceive that act have called impossible to be becoming manifestly possible with dover ugly security soon to be put in force with proceeds of practice immediately absorbed in paying back debt with chance if worst be known of daily supply being refused on credit above with vision of rosamonds hopeless discontent continually haunting lydgate have begun to see that must inevitably bend to ask help from somebody other at first have considered whether must write to mr vincy on questioning rosamond found that a have suspected have already applied twice to father last time being since disappointment from sir godwin papa have said that lydgate must look out for papa said have come with one bad year after to trade more more on borrowed capital have have to give up many indulgence must not spare single hundred from charge of family said let lydgate ask bulstrode have always be hand glove indeed lydgate have come to conclusion that if must end by asking for free loan relation with bulstrode more at least than with other man might take shape of claim be not purely personal bulstrode have indirectly helped to cause failure of practice have also be highly gratified by getting medical partner in plansbut who among ever reduced to sort of dependence in lydgate now stood without trying to believe that have claim diminished humiliation of asking be true that of late there have seemed to be new languor of interest in bulstrode about hospital health have got worse showed sign of deep seated nervous affection in other respect did not appear to be changed have always be highly polite lydgate have observed in from first marked coldness about marriage other private circumstance coldness have hitherto preferred to warmth of familiarity between deferred intention from day to day habit of acting on conclusion being made infirm by repugnance to possible conclusion consequent act saw mr bulstrode often did not try to use occasion for private purpose at one moment thought will write letter prefer to circuitous talk at thought no if be talking to must make retreat before sign of disinclination still day passed letter be written special interview sought in shrinking from humiliation of dependent attitude towards bulstrode began to familiarize imagination with step even more unlike remembered self began spontaneously to consider whether must be possible to carry out that puerile notion of rosamonds have often made angry namely that must quit middlemarch without seeing anything beyond preface question camewould man buy practice of even now for a little a be worth then sale might happen a necessary preparation for going away against taking step still felt to be contemptible relinquishment of present work guilty turning aside from what be real might be widening channel for worthy activity to start again without justified destination there be obstacle that purchaser if procurable at might not be quickly forthcoming afterwards rosamond in poor lodging though in largest city most distant town must not find life must save from gloom save from reproach of having plunged into for when man be at foot of hill in fortune may stay long while there in spite of professional accomplishment in british climate there be incompatibility between scientific insight furnished lodging incompatibility be chiefly between scientific ambition wife who object to kind of residence in midst of hesitation opportunity came to decide note from mr bulstrode requested lydgate to call on at bank hypochondriacal tendency have shown in banker constitution of late lack of sleep be really only slight exaggeration of habitual dyspeptic symptom have be dwelt on by a sign of threatening insanity wanted to consult lydgate without delay on particular morning although have nothing to tell beyond what have told before listened eagerly to what lydgate have to say in dissipation of fear though too be only repetition moment in bulstrode be receiving medical opinion with sense of comfort seemed to make communication of personal need to easier than have be in lydgates contemplation beforehand have be insisting that must be well for mr bulstrode to relax attention to business one see how mental strain however slight may affect delicate frame said lydgate at stage of consultation when remark tend to pas from personal to general by deep stamp anxiety will make for time even on young vigorous be naturally very strong yet have be thoroughly shaken lately by accumulation of trouble presume that constitution in susceptible state in mine at present be must be especially liable to fall victim to cholera if visited district since appearance near london may well besiege mercy seat for protection said mr bulstrode not intending to evade lydgates allusion really preoccupied with alarm about have at event taken share in using good practical precaution for town be best mode of asking for protection said lydgate with strong distaste for broken metaphor bad logic of banker religion somewhat increased by apparent deafness of sympathy mind have taken up long prepared movement towards getting help be not yet arrested added town have done well in way of cleansing finding appliance think that if cholera must come even enemy will admit that arrangement in hospital be public good truly said mr bulstrode with coldness with regard to what say mr lydgate about relaxation of mental labor have for time be entertaining purpose to effecta purpose of very decided character contemplate at least temporary withdrawal from management of much business whether benevolent commercial also think of changing residence for time probably will close let shrub take place near coastunder advice of course a to salubrity must be measure must recommend oh yes said lydgate falling backward in chair with ill repressed impatience under banker pale earnest eye intense preoccupation with have for time felt must open subject with in relation to hospital continued bulstrode under circumstance have indicated of course must cease to have personal share in management be contrary to view of responsibility to continue large application of mean to institution can not watch over to extent regulate will therefore in case of ultimate decision to leave middlemarch consider withdraw other support to new hospital than will subsist in fact that chiefly supplied expense of building have contributed further large sum to successful working lydgates thought when bulstrode paused according to wont be have perhaps be losing good deal of money be most plausible explanation of speech have caused rather startling change in expectation said in reply loss to hospital can hardly be made up fear hardly returned bulstrode in same deliberate silvery tone except by change of plan only person who may be certainly counted on a willing to increase contribution be mr casaubon have have interview with on subject have pointed out to a be about to do to that will be desirable to win more general support to new hospital by change of system pause lydgate did not speak change mean be amalgamation with infirmary so that new hospital will be regarded a special addition to elder institution having same directing board will be necessary also that medical management of two will be combined in way difficulty a to adequate maintenance of new establishment will be removed benevolent interest of town will cease to be divided mr bulstrode have lowered eye from lydgates face to button of coat a again paused doubt be good device a to way mean said lydgate with edge of irony in tone cant be expected to rejoice in at once since one of first result will be that other medical men will upset interrupt method if be only because be mine a know mr lydgate highly valued opportunity of new independent procedure have diligently employed original plan confess be one have much at heart under submission to divine will since providential indication demand renunciation from renounce bulstrode showed rather exasperating ability in conversation broken metaphor bad logic of motive have stirred hearer contempt be quite consistent with mode of putting fact made difficult for lydgate to vent own indignation disappointment after rapid reflection only asked what did mr casaubon say be further statement wished to make to said bulstrode who have thoroughly prepared ministerial explanation be be aware woman of most munificent disposition happily in possessionnot presume of great wealth of fund can well spare have informed that though have destined chief part of fund to purpose be willing to consider whether can not fully take place in relation to hospital wish for ample time to mature thought on subject have told that there be need for hastethat in fact own plan be not yet absolute lydgate be ready to say if mr casaubon must take place there must be gain instead of loss there be still weight on mind arrested cheerful candor replied suppose then may enter into subject with mr casaubon precisely be what expressly desire decision say will much depend on what can tell not at present be believe just setting out on journey have letter here said mr bulstrode drawing out reading from be immediately otherwise engaged say be going into yorkshire with sir james lady chettam conclusion come to about land be to see there may affect power of contributing to hospital thus mr lydgate there be haste necessary in matter wished to apprise beforehand of what may possibly occur mr bulstrode returned letter to side pocket changed attitude a if business be closed lydgate whose renewed hope about hospital only made more conscious of fact poisoned hope felt that effort after help if made at must be made now vigorously be much obliged to for giving full notice said with firm intention in tone yet with interruptedness in delivery showed that spoke unwillingly highest object to be profession have identified hospital with best use can at present make of profession best use be not always same with monetary success everything have made hospital unpopular have helped with other causesi think be connected with professional zealto make unpopular a practitioner get chiefly patient who cant pay must like best if have nobody to pay on own side lydgate waited little bulstrode only bowed looking at fixedly went on with same interrupted enunciationas if be biting objectional leek have slipped into money difficulty can see way out of unless one who trust future will advance sum without other security have very little fortune left when came here have prospect of money from own family expense in consequence of marriage have be very much greater than have expected result at moment be that must take thousand pound to clear mean to free from risk of having good sold in security of largest debtas well a to pay other debtsand leave anything to keep little beforehand with small income find that be out of question that wife father must make such advance be why mention position toto only other man who may be held to have personal connection with prosperity ruin lydgate hated to hear have spoken now have spoken with unmistakable directness mr bulstrode replied without haste also without hesitation be grieved though confess not surprised by information mr lydgate for own part regretted alliance with brother in law family have always be of prodigal habit have already be much indebted to for sustainment in present position advice to mr lydgate must be that instead of involving in further obligation continuing doubtful struggle must simply become bankrupt must not improve prospect said lydgate rising speaking bitterly even if be more agreeable thing in be always trial said mr bulstrode trial dear sir be portion here be needed corrective recommend to weigh advice have given thank said lydgate not quite knowing what said have occupied too long good day chapter lxviii what suit of grace hath virtue to put on if vice will wear a good do a well if wrong if craft if

reappeared at shrub bulstrode be at home to receive hinder communication with rest of family must not altogether hinder circumstance of visit from compromising alarming wife raffle proved more unmanageable than have shown to be in former appearance chronic state of mental restlessness growing effect of habitual intemperance quickly shaking off impression from what be said to insisted on staying in house bulstrode weighing two set of evil felt that be at least not worse alternative than going into town kept in own room for evening saw to bed raffle while amusing with annoyance be causing decent highly prosperous fellow sinner amusement facetiously expressed a sympathy with friend pleasure in entertaining man who have be serviceable to who have not have earnings there be cunning calculation under noisy jokinga cool resolve to extract something handsomer from bulstrode a payment for release from new application of torture cunning have little overcast mark bulstrode be indeed more tortured than coarse fibre of raffle must enable to imagine have told wife that be simply taking care of wretched creature victim of vice who might otherwise injure implied without direct form of falsehood that there be family tie bound to care that there be sign of mental alienation in raffle urged caution must drive unfortunate being away next morning in hint felt that be supplying mr bulstrode with precautionary information for daughter servant accounting for allowing one to enter room even with food drink sat in agony of fear lest raffle must be overheard in loud plain reference to past factslest mr bulstrode must be even tempted to listen at door how must hinder how betray terror by opening door to detect be woman of honest direct habit little likely to take so low course in order to arrive at painful knowledge fear be stronger than calculation of probability in way raffle have pushed torture too far produced effect have not be in plan by showing hopelessly unmanageable have made bulstrode feel that strong defiance be only resource left after taking raffle to bed that night banker ordered closed carriage to be ready at half past seven next morning at six oclock have already be long dressed have spent of wretchedness in prayer pleading motif for averting worst evil if in anything have used falsity spoken what be not true before god for bulstrode shrank from direct lie with intensity disproportionate to number of more indirect misdeed many of misdeed be like subtle muscular movement be not taken account of in consciousness though bring about end that fix mind on desire be only what be vividly conscious of that can vividly imagine to be seen by omniscience bulstrode carried candle to bedside of raffle who be apparently in painful dream stood silent hoping that presence of light must serve to waken sleeper gradually gently for feared noise a consequence of too sudden awakening have watched for couple of minute more shudderings panting seemed likely to end in waking when raffle with long half stifled moan started up stared round in terror trembling gasping made further noise bulstrode setting down candle awaited recovery be quarter of hour later before bulstrode with cold peremptoriness of manner have not before shown said came to call thus early mr raffle because have ordered carriage to be ready at half past seven intend to conduct a

strict man like master who held head high in world must be ashamed of such cousin want to get rid of banker drive of ten mile with hated companion be dreary beginning of christmas day at end of drive raffle have recovered spirit parted in contentment for there be good reason that banker have given hundred pound various motif urged bulstrode to open handedness did not inquire closely into of a have stood watching raffle in uneasy sleep have certainly entered mind that man have be much shattered since first gift of two hundred pound have taken care to repeat incisive statement of resolve not to be played on more have tried to penetrate raffle with fact that have shown risk of bribing to be quite equal to risk of defying when freed from repulsive presence bulstrode returned to quiet home brought with confidence that have secured more than respite be a if have have loathsome dream must not shake off image with hateful kindred of sensationsas if on pleasant surroundings of life dangerous reptile have left slimy trace who can know how much of most inward life be made up of thought belief other men to have about until fabric of opinion be threatened with ruin bulstrode be only

bulstrode wincing under wife eye be filling with tear have supplied brother with great deal of capital can not be expected to take care of married child seemed to be true mr bulstrodes remonstrance subsided into pity for poor rosamond whose extravagant education have always foreseen fruit of remembering that dialogue mr bulstrode felt that when have to talk to wife fully about plan of quitting middlemarch must be glad to tell that have made arrangement might be for good of nephew fred at present have merely mentioned to that thought of shutting up shrub for few month taking house on southern coast hence mr garth got assurance desired namely that in case of bulstrodes departure from middlemarch for indefinite time fred vincy must be allowed to have tenancy of stone court on term

give child comfort however restrained kept in strict privacy from fred certain visit be making to stone court in order to look more thoroughly into state of land stock take preliminary estimate be certainly more eager in visit than probable speed of event required to be be stimulated by fatherly delight in occupying mind with bit of probable happiness held in store like hidden birthday gift for fred mary suppose whole scheme must turn out to be castle in air said mr garth well well replied caleb castle will tumble about nobody head chapter lxix if thou hast heard word let die with thee ecclesiasticus mr bulstrode be still seated in manager room at bank about three oclock of same day on have received lydgate there when clerk entered to say that horse be waiting also that mr garth be outside begged to speak with by mean said bulstrode caleb entered pray sit down mr garth continued banker in suavest tone be glad that arrived just in time to find here know count minute oh said caleb gently with slow swing of head on one side a seated laid hat on floor looked at ground leaning forward letting long finger droop between leg while finger moved in succession a if be sharing thought filled large quiet brow mr bulstrode like one else who knew caleb be used to slowness in beginning to speak on topic felt to be important rather expected that be about to recur to buying of house in blindmans court for sake of pulling down a sacrifice of property must be well repaid by influx of air light on spot be by proposition of kind that caleb be sometimes troublesome to employer have usually found bulstrode ready to meet in project of improvement have got on well together when spoke again however be to say in rather subdued voice have just come away from stone court mr bulstrode found nothing wrong there hope said banker be there yesterday abel have done well with lamb year why yes said caleb looking up gravely there be something wronga stranger who be very ill think want doctor came to tell of that name be raffle saw shock of word passing through bulstrodes frame on subject banker have thought that fear be too constantly on watch to be taken by surprise have be mistaken poor wretch said in compassionate tone though lip trembled little do know how came there took said caleb quietlytook up in gig have got down from coach be walking little beyond turning from toll house overtook remembered seeing with once before at stone court asked to take on saw be ill seemed to right thing to do to carry under shelter now think must lose time in getting advice for caleb took up hat from floor a ended rose slowly from seat certainly said bulstrode whose mind be very active at moment perhaps will yourself oblige mr garth by calling at mr lydgates a passor stay may at hour probably be at hospital will first send man on horse there with note instant then will myself ride to stone court bulstrode quickly wrote note went out to give commission to man when returned caleb be standing a before with one hand on back of chair holding hat with other in bulstrodes mind dominant thought be perhaps raffle only spoke to garth of illness garth may wonder a must have done before at disreputable fellow claiming intimacy with will know nothing be friendly to mei can be of use to longed for confirmation of hopeful conjecture to have asked question a to what raffle have said done must have be to betray fear be exceedingly obliged to mr garth said in usual tone of politeness servant will be back in few minute will then go to see what can be done for unfortunate man perhaps have other business with if so pray be seated thank said caleb making slight gesture with right hand to waive invitation wish to say mr bulstrode must request to put business into other hand than mine be obliged to for handsome way of meeting meabout letting of stone court other business must give up sharp certainty entered like stab into bulstrodes soul be sudden mr garth be must say at first be said caleb be quite fixed must give up spoke with firmness be very gentle yet must see that bulstrode seemed to cower under gentleness face looking dried eye swerving away from glance rested on caleb felt deep pity for must have used pretext to account for resolve even if must have be of use have be led to apprehend by slander concerning uttered by unhappy creature said bulstrode anxious now to know utmost be true cant deny act upon what heard from be conscientious man mr gartha man trust who feel accountable to god must not wish to injure by being too ready to believe slander said bulstrode casting about for plea might be adapted to hearer mind be poor reason for giving up connection think may say will be mutually beneficial must injure man if must help said caleb even if thought god winked at hope must have feeling for fellow creature siri be obliged to believe that raffle have told truth cant be happy in working with profiting by hurt mind must beg to seek agent very well mr garth must at least claim to know worst that have told must know what be foul speech that be liable to be victim of said bulstrode certain amount of anger beginning to mingle with humiliation before quiet man who renounced benefit thats needle said caleb waving hand bowing head slightly not swerving from tone have in merciful intention to spare pitiable man what have said to will never pas from lip unless something now unknown force from if led harmful life for gain kept others out of right by deceit to get more for dare say repentyou must like to go back cant must be bitter thingcaleb paused moment shook headit be not for to make life harder to doyou do make harder to said bulstrode constrained into genuine pleading cry make harder to by turning back on that im forced to do said caleb still more gently lifting up hand be sorry dont judge say be wicked be righteous god forbid dont know everything man may do wrong will may rise clear out of though cant get life clear thats bad punishment if be so with youwell im very sorry for have feeling inside that cant go on working with thats mr bulstrode everything else be buried so far a will go wish good day one moment mr garth said bulstrode hurriedly may trust then to solemn assurance that will not repeat to man woman whateven if have degree of truth in itis yet malicious representation calebs wrath be stirred said indignantly why must have said if didnt mean be in fear of such tale a will never tempt tongue excuse mei be agitatedi be victim of abandoned man stop bit have got to consider whether didnt help to make worse when profited by vice be wronging by too readily believing said bulstrode oppressed a by nightmare with inability to deny flatly what raffle might have said yet feeling escape that caleb have not so stated to a to ask for flat denial said caleb lifting hand deprecatingly be ready to believe better when better be proved rob of good chance a to speaking hold crime to expose man sin unless im clear must be done to save innocent be way of thinking mr bulstrode what say ive need to swear wish good day hour later when be at home caleb said to wife incidentally that have have little difference with bulstrode that in consequence have given up notion of taking stone court indeed have resigned doing further business for be disposed to interfere too much be said mr garth imagining that husband have be touched on sensitive point not be allowed to do what thought right a to material mode of work oh said caleb bowing head waving hand gravely mr garth knew that be sign of not intending to speak further on subject a for bulstrode have almost immediately mounted horse set off for stone court being anxious to arrive there before lydgate mind be crowded with image conjecture be language to hope fear just a hear tone from vibration shake whole system deep humiliation with have winced under caleb garths knowledge of past rejection of patronage alternated with almost gave way to sense of safety in fact that garth other have be man to whom raffle have spoken seemed to sort of earnest that providence intended rescue from worse consequence way being thus left open for hope of secrecy that raffle must be afflicted with illness that must have be led to stone court rather than elsewherebulstrodes heart fluttered at vision of probability event conjured up if must turn out that be freed from danger of disgraceif must breathe in perfect libertyhis life must be more consecrated than have ever be before mentally lifted up vow a if must urge result longed forhe tried to believe in potency of prayerful resolutionits potency to determine death knew that ought to say thy will be done said often intense desire remained that will of god might be death of hated man yet when arrived at stone court must not see change in raffle without shock for pallor feebleness bulstrode must have called change in entirely mental instead of loud tormenting mood showed intense vague terror seemed to deprecate bulstrodes anger because money be gonehe have be robbedit have half of be taken from have only come here because be ill somebody be hunting himsomebody be after have told nobody anything have kept mouth shut bulstrode not knowing significance of symptom interpreted new nervous susceptibility into mean of alarming raffle into true confession taxed with falsehood in saying that have not told anything since have just told man who took up in gig brought to stone court raffle denied with solemn adjuration fact being that link of consciousness be interrupted in that minute terror stricken narrative to caleb garth have be delivered under set of visionary impulse have dropped back into darkness bulstrodes heart sank again at sign that must get grasp over wretched man mind that word of raffle must be trusted a to fact most wanted to know namely whether not have really kept silence to one in neighborhood except caleb garth housekeeper have told without least constraint of manner that since mr garth left raffle have asked for beer after have not spoken seeming very ill on side might be concluded that there have be no betrayal mr abel thought like servant at shrub that strange man belonged to unpleasant kin who be among trouble of rich have at first referred kinship to mr rigg where there be property left buzzing presence of such large blue bottle seemed natural enough how must be kin to bulstrode a well be not so clear mr abel agreed with husband that there be knowing proposition have great deal of mental food for so that shook head over without further speculation in le than hour lydgate arrived bulstrode met outside wainscoted parlor where raffle be said have called in mr lydgate to unfortunate man who be once in employment many year ago afterwards went to america returned fear to idle dissolute life being destitute have claim on be slightly connected with rigg former owner of place in consequence found way here believe be seriously ill apparently mind be affected feel bound to do utmost for lydgate who have remembrance of last conversation with bulstrode strongly upon be not disposed to say unnecessary word to bowed slightly in answer to account just before entering room turned automatically said what be nameto know name being a much part of medical man accomplishment a of practical politician raffle john raffle said bulstrode who hoped that became of raffle lydgate must never know more of when have thoroughly examined considered patient lydgate ordered that must go to bed be kept there in a complete quiet a possible then went with bulstrode into room be serious case apprehend said banker before lydgate began to speak noand yes said lydgate half dubiously be difficult to decide a to possible effect of long standing complication man have robust constitution to begin with must not expect attack to be fatal though of course system be in ticklish state must be well watched attended to will remain here said bulstrode mr abel husband be inexperienced can easily remain here for night if will oblige by taking note for mr bulstrode must think be hardly necessary said lydgate seems tame terrified enough might become more unmanageable there be man hereis there not have more than once stayed here few night for sake of seclusion said bulstrode indifferently be quite disposed to do so now mr abel husband can relieve aid if necessary very well then need give direction only to said lydgate not feeling surprised at little peculiarity in bulstrode think then that case be hopeful said bulstrode when lydgate have ended giving order unless there turn out to be further complication such a have not at present detectedyes said lydgate may pas on to worse stage must not wonder if got better in few day by adhering to treatment have prescribed there must be firmness remember if call for liquor of sort not to give to in opinion men in condition be oftener killed by treatment than by disease still new symptom may arise will come again to morrow morning after waiting for note to be carried to mr bulstrode lydgate rode away forming conjecture in first instance about history of raffle rehearsing whole argument have lately be much stirred by publication of dr ware abundant experience in america a to right way of treating case of alcoholic poisoning such a lydgate when abroad have already be interested in question be strongly convinced against prevalent practice of allowing alcohol persistently administering large dos of opium have repeatedly acted on conviction with favorable result man be in diseased state thought there good deal of wear in still suppose be object of charity to bulstrode be curious what patch of hardness tenderness lie side by side in men disposition bulstrode seems most unsympathetic fellow ever saw about people yet have taken end of trouble spent great deal of money on benevolent object suppose have test by find out whom heaven care forhe have made up mind that doesnt care for streak of bitterness came from plenteous source kept widening in current of thought a neared lowick gate have not be there since first interview with bulstrode in morning having be found at hospital by banker messenger for first time be returning to home without vision of expedient in background left hope of raising money enough to deliver from coming destitution of everything made married life tolerableeverything saved rosamond from bare isolation in must be forced to recognize how little of comfort must be to other be more bearable to do without tenderness for than to see that own tenderness must make amends for lack of other thing to suffering of own pride from humiliation past to come be keen enough yet be hardly distinguishable to from that more acute pain dominated themthe pain of foreseeing that rosamond must come to regard chiefly a cause of disappointment unhappiness to have never liked makeshift of poverty have never before entered into prospect for be beginning now to imagine how two creature who loved other have stock of thought in common might laugh over shabby furniture calculation how far must afford butter egg glimpse of poetry seemed a far off from a carelessness of golden age in poor rosamonds mind there be not room enough for luxury to look small in got down from horse in very sad mood went into house not expecting to be cheered except by dinner reflecting that before evening closed must be wise to tell rosamond of application to bulstrode failure must be well not to lose time in preparing for worst dinner waited long for before be able to eat for on entering found that dover agent have already put man in house when asked where mr lydgate be be told that be in bedroom went up found stretched on bed pale silent without answer even in face to word look of sat down by bed leaning over said with almost cry of prayer forgive for misery poor rosamond let only love one looked at silently still with blank despair on face then tear began to fill blue eye lip trembled strong man have have too much to bear day let head fall beside hers sobbed did not hinder from going to father early in morningit seemed now that ought not to hinder from doing a pleased in hour came back said that papa mamma wished to go stay with while thing be in miserable state papa said must hing about debtif paid there must be dozen more have better come back home again till lydgate have got comfortable home for do object tertius do a like said lydgate thing be not coming to crisis immediately there be hurry must not go till to morrow said rosamond will want to pack clothes oh must wait little longer than to morrowthere be knowing what may happen said lydgate with bitter irony may get neck broken may make thing easier to be lydgates misfortune rosamonds too that tenderness towards be emotional prompting well considered resolve be inevitably interrupted by outburst of indignation ironical remonstrant thought totally unwarranted repulsion exceptional severity excited in be in danger of making more persistent tenderness unacceptable see wish to go said with chill mildness why can not say so without kind of violence will stay until request to do otherwise lydgate said more went out on round felt bruised shattered there be dark line under eye rosamond have not seen before must not bear to look at tertius have way of taking thing made great deal worse for chapter lxx deed still travel with from afar what have be make what be bulstrodes first object after lydgate have left stone court be to examine raffles pocket imagined be sure to carry sign in shape of hotel bill of place have stopped in if have not told truth in saying that have come straight from liverpool because be ill have money there be various bill crammed into pocketbook none of later date than christmas at other place except one bore date that morning be crumpled up with hand bill about horse fair in one of tail pocket represented cost of three day stay at inn at bilkley where fair be helda town at least forty mile from middlemarch bill be heavy since raffle have luggage with seemed probable that have left portmanteau behind in payment in order to save money for travelling fare for purse be empty have only couple of sixpence loose penny in pocket bulstrode gathered sense of safety from indication raffle have really kept at distance from middlemarch since memorable visit at christmas at distance among people who be stranger to bulstrode what satisfaction must there be to raffles tormenting magnifying vein in telling old scandalous story about middlemarch banker what harm if did talk chief point now be to keep watch over a long a there be danger of intelligible raving unaccountable impulse to tell seemed to have acted towards caleb garth bulstrode felt much anxiety lest such impulse must come over at sight of lydgate sat up alone with through night only ordering housekeeper to lie down in clothes so a to be ready when called alleging own indisposition to sleep anxiety to carry out doctor order did carry out faithfully although raffle be incessantly asking for brandy declaring that be sinking awaythat earth be sinking away from under be restless sleepless still quailing manageable on offer of food ordered by lydgate refused denial of other thing demanded seemed to concentrate terror on bulstrode imploringly deprecating anger revenge on by starvation declaring with strong oath that have never told mortal word against even bulstrode felt that must not have liked lydgate to hear more alarming sign of fitful alternation in delirium be that in morning twilight raffle suddenly seemed to imagine doctor present addressing declaring that bulstrode wanted to starve to death out of revenge for telling when never have told bulstrodes native imperiousness strength of determination served well delicate looking man nervously perturbed found needed stimulus in strenuous circumstance through difficult night morning while have air of animated corpse returned to movement without warmth holding mastery by chill impassibility mind be intensely at work thinking of what have to guard against what must win security whatever prayer might lift up statement might inwardly make of man wretched spiritual condition duty be under to submit to punishment divinely appointed for rather than to wish for evil to anotherthrough effort to condense word into solid mental state there pierced spread with irresistible vividness image of event desired in train of image came apology must not see death of raffle see in own deliverance what be removal of wretched creature be impenitentbut be not public criminal impenitentyet law decided on fate must providence in case award death there be sin in contemplating death a desirable issueif kept hand from hastening itif scrupulously did what be prescribed even here there might be mistake human prescription be fallible thing lydgate have said that treatment have hastened deathwhy not own method of treatment of course intention be everything in question of right wrong bulstrode set to keep intention separate from desire inwardly declared that intended to obey order why must have got into argument about validity of order be only common trick of desirewhich avail of irrelevant scepticism finding larger room for in uncertainty about effect in obscurity look like absence of law still did obey order anxiety continually glanced towards lydgate remembrance of what have taken place between morning before be accompanied with sensibility have not be roused at during actual scene have then cared little about lydgates painful impression with regard to suggested change in hospital about disposition towards what held to be justifiable refusal of rather exorbitant request might call forth recurred to scene now with perception that have probably made lydgate enemy with awakened desire to propitiate rather to create in strong sense of personal obligation regretted that have not at once made even unreasonable money sacrifice for in case of unpleasant suspicion even knowledge gathered from raving of raffle bulstrode must have felt that have defence in lydgates mind by having conferred momentous benefit on regret have perhaps come too late strange piteous conflict in soul of unhappy man who have longed for year to be better than waswho have taken selfish passion into discipline clad in severe robe so that have walked with a devout choir till now that terror have risen among must chant no longer threw out common cry for safety be nearly middle of day before lydgate arrived have meant to come earlier have be detained said shattered look be noticed by balstrode immediately threw into consideration of patient inquired strictly into have occurred raffle be worse must take hardly food be persistently wakeful restlessly raving still not violent contrary to bulstrodes alarmed expectation took little notice of lydgates presence continued to talk murmur incoherently what do think of said bulstrode in private symptom be worse be le hopeful still think may come round be going to stay here said lydgate looking at bulstrode with abrupt question made uneasy though in reality be not due to suspicious conjecture yes think so said bulstrode governing speaking with deliberation mr bulstrode be advised of reason detain mr abel husband be not experienced enough to be left quite alone kind of responsibility be scarcely included in service of have fresh instruction presume chief new instruction lydgate have to give be on administration of extremely moderate dos of opium in case of sleeplessness continuing after several hour have taken precaution of bringing opium in pocket gave minute direction to bulstrode a to dos point at must cease insisted on risk of not ceasing repeated order that alcohol must be given from what see of case ended narcotism be only thing must be much afraid of may wear through even without much food there good deal of strength in look ill mr lydgatea most unusual may say unprecedented thing in knowledge of said bulstrode showing solicitude a unlike indifference day before a present recklessness about own fatigue be unlike habitual self cherishing anxiety fear be harassed yes be said lydgate brusquely holding hat ready to go something new fear said bulstrode inquiringly pray be seated thank said lydgate with hauteur mentioned to yesterday what be state of affair there be nothing to add except that execution have since then be actually put into house one can tell good deal of trouble in short sentence will say good morning stay mr lydgate stay said bulstrode have be reconsidering subject be yesterday taken by surprise saw superficially mr bulstrode be anxious for niece must grieve at calamitous change in position claim on be numerous on reconsideration esteem right must incur small sacrifice rather than leave unaided said think that thousand pound must suffice entirely to free from burthen enable to recover firm stand yes said lydgate great leap of joy within surmounting other feeling must pay debt leave little on hand must set about economizing in way of living by by practice might look up if will wait moment mr lydgate will draw check to amount be aware that help to be effectual in case must be thorough while bulstrode wrote lydgate turned to window thinking of homethinking of life with good start saved from frustration good purpose still unbroken can give note of hand for mr lydgate said banker advancing towards with check by by hope may be in circumstance gradually to repay meanwhile have pleasure in thinking that will be released from further difficulty be deeply obliged to said lydgate have restored to prospect of working with happiness chance of good appeared to very natural movement in bulstrode that must have reconsidered refusal corresponded with more munificent side of character a put hack into canter that might get sooner home tell good news to rosamond get cash at bank to pay over to dover agent there crossed mind with unpleasant impression a from dark winged flight of evil augury across vision thought of contrast in few month have broughtthat must be overjoyed at being under strong personal obligationthat must be overjoyed at getting money for from bulstrode banker felt that have done something to nullify one cause of uneasiness yet be scarcely easier did not measure quantity of diseased motive have made wish for lydgates good will quantity be none le actively there like irritating agent in blood man vow yet will not cast away mean of breaking vow be that distinctly mean to break not at desire tend to break be at work in dimly make way into imagination relax muscle in very moment when be telling over again reason for vow raffle recovering quickly returning to free use of odious powershow must bulstrode wish for raffle dead be image brought release indirectly prayed for way of release beseeching that if be possible rest of day here below might be freed from threat of ignominy must break utterly a instrument of god service lydgates opinion be not on side of promise that prayer must be fulfilled a day advanced bulstrode felt getting irritated at persistent life in man whom must fain have seen sinking into silence of death imperious will stirred murderous impulse towards brute life over will by have power said inwardly that be getting too much worn must not sit up with patient to night leave to mr abel who if necessary must call husband at six oclock raffle having have only fitful perturbed snatch of sleep from waked with fresh restlessness perpetual cry that be sinking away bulstrode began to administer opium according to lydgates direction at end of hour more called mr abel told that found unfit for further watching must now consign patient to care proceeded to repeat to lydgates direction a to quantity of dose mr abel have not before known anything of lydgates prescription have simply prepared brought bulstrode ordered have done what pointed out to began now to ask what else must do besides administering opium nothing at present except offer of soup soda water can come to for further direction unless there be important change will not come into room again to night will ask husband for help if necessary must go to bed early youve much need sir im sure said mr abel to take something more strengthening than what youve done bulstrode went away now without anxiety a to what raffle might say in raving have taken on muttering incoherence not likely to create dangerous belief at rate must risk went down into wainscoted parlor first began to consider whether must not have horse saddled go home by moonlight give up caring for earthly consequence then wished that have begged lydgate to come again that evening perhaps might deliver different opinion think that raffle be getting into le hopeful state must send for lydgate if raffle be really getting worse slowly dying bulstrode felt that must go to bed sleep in gratitude to providence be worse lydgate might come simply say that be going on a expected predict that must by by fall into good sleep get well what be use of sending for bulstrode shrank from result idea opinion must hinder from seeing one probability to be that raffle recovered must be just same man a before with strength a tormentor renewed obliging to drag away wife to spend year apart from friend native place carrying alienating suspicion against in heart have sat hour half in conflict by firelight only when sudden thought made rise light bed candle have brought down with thought be that have not told mr abel when dos of opium must cease took hold of candlestick stood motionless for long while might already have given more than lydgate have prescribed be excusable in that must forget part of order in present wearied condition walked up stair candle in hand not knowing whether must straightway enter own room go to bed turn to patient room rectify omission paused in passage with face turned towards raffles room must hear moaning murmuring be not asleep then who must know lydgates prescription must not be better disobeyed than followed since there be still no sleep turned into own room before have quite undressed mr abel rapped at door opened inch so that must hear speak low if please sir must have brandy nothing to give poor creetur feel sinking away nothing else will swallerand little strength in if didonly opium say more more he sinking down through earth to surprise mr bulstrode did not answer struggle be going on within think must die for want o support if go on in way when nursed poor master mr robisson have to give port wine brandy constant big glass at time added mr abel with touch of remonstrance in tone again mr bulstrode did not answer immediately continued not time to spare when people be at death door must wish sir im sure else must give own bottle o rum a keep by sitter up so a youve be doing everything a laid in power here key be thrust through inch of doorway mr bulstrode said huskily be key of wine cooler will find plenty of brandy there early in morningabout sixmr bulstrode rose spent time in prayer doe one suppose private prayer be necessarily candidnecessarily go to root of action private prayer be inaudible speech speech be representative who can represent just a be even in own reflection bulstrode have not yet unravelled in thought confused prompting of last four twenty hour listened in passage must hear hard stertorous breathing then walked out in garden looked at early rime on grass fresh spring leaf when re entered house felt startled at sight of mr abel how be patientasleep think said with attempt at cheerfulness in tone he gone very deep sir said mr abel went off gradual between three four oclock must please to go look at thought harm to leave man gone afield little girl seeing to kettle bulstrode went up at glance knew that raffle be not in sleep brings revival in sleep stream deeper deeper into gulf of death looked round room saw bottle with brandy in almost empty opium phial put phial out of sight carried brandy bottle down stair with locking again in wine cooler while breakfasting considered whether must ride to middlemarch at once wait for lydgates arrival decided to wait told mr abel that might go about workhe must watch in bed chamber a sat there beheld enemy of peace going irrevocably into silence felt more at rest than have done for many month conscience be soothed by enfolding wing of secrecy seemed just then like angel sent down for relief drew out pocket book to review various memoranda there a to arrangement have projected partly carried out in prospect of quitting middlemarch considered how far must let stand recall now that absence must be brief economy felt desirable might still find suitable occasion in temporary withdrawal from management hoped still that mr casaubon must take large share in expense of hospital in way moment passed until change in stertorous breathing be marked enough to draw attention wholly to bed forced to think of departing life have once be subservient to ownwhich have once be glad to find base enough for to act on a must be gladness then impelled now to be glad that life be at end who must say that death of raffle have be hastened who knew what must have saved lydgate arrived at half past ten in time to witness final pause of breath when entered room bulstrode observed sudden expression in face be not so much surprise a recognition that have not judged correctly stood by bed in silence for time with eye turned on dying man with subdued activity of expression showed that be carrying on inward debate when did change begin said looking at bulstrode did not watch by last night said bulstrode be over worn left under mr abel care said that sank into sleep between three four oclock when came in before eight be nearly in condition lydgate did not ask question watched in silence until said over morning lydgate be in state of recovered hope freedom have set out on work with old animation felt strong enough to bear deficiency of married life be conscious that bulstrode have be benefactor to be uneasy about case have not expected to terminate a have done yet hardly knew how to put question on subject to bulstrode without appearing to insult if examined housekeeperwhy man be dead there seemed to be use in implying that somebody ignorance imprudence have killed after might be wrong bulstrode rode back to middlemarch together talking of many thingschiefly cholera chance of reform bill in house of lord firm resolve of political union nothing be said about raffle except bulstrode mentioned necessity of having grave for in lowick churchyard observed that so far a knew poor man have connection except rigg whom have stated to be unfriendly towards on returning home lydgate have visit from mr farebrother vicar have not be in town day before news that there be execution in lydgates house have got to lowick by evening having be carried by mr spicer shoemaker parish clerk who have from brother respectable bell hanger in lowick gate since evening when lydgate have come down from billiard room with fred vincy mr farebrothers thought about have be rather gloomy playing at green dragon once oftener might have be trifle in man in lydgate be one of several sign that be getting unlike former self be beginning to do thing for have formerly even excessive scorn certain dissatisfaction in marriage silly tinklings of gossip have given hint of might have to do with change mr farebrother felt sure that be chiefly connected with debt be being more more distinctly reported began to fear that notion of lydgates having resource friend in background must be quite illusory rebuff have met with in first attempt to win lydgates confidence disinclined to second news of execution being actually in house determined vicar to overcome reluctance lydgate have just dismissed poor patient in whom be much interested came forward to put out handwith open cheerfulness surprised mr farebrother must too be proud rejection of sympathy help never mind sympathy help must be offered how be lydgate came to see because have heard something made anxious about said vicar in tone of good

from dwelling even in thought on fact that have always urged lydgate to avoid personal entanglement with bulstrode added immediately bulstrode must naturally feel interest in welfare after have worked with in way have probably reduced income instead of adding to be glad to think that have acted accordingly lydgate felt uncomfortable under kindly supposition made more distinct within uneasy

corpse of rafflesit be that haunting ghost of earlier life a rode past archway of green dragon be trusting that providence have delivered from yes providence have not confessed to yet that have done anything in way of contrivance to end have accepted what seemed to have be offered be impossible to prove that have done anything hastened departure of man soul gossip about bulstrode spread through middlemarch like smell of fire mr frank hawley followed up information by sending clerk whom must trust to stone court on pretext of inquiring about hay really to gather must be learned about raffle illness from mr abel in way came to knowledge that mr garth have carried man to stone court in gig mr hawley in consequence took opportunity of seeing caleb calling at office to ask whether have time to undertake arbitration if be required then asking incidentally about raffle caleb be betrayed into word injurious to bulstrode beyond fact be forced to admit that have given up acting for within last week mr hawley drew inference feeling convinced that raffle have told story to garth that garth have given up bulstrodes affair in consequence said so few hour later to mr toller statement be passed on until have quite lost stamp of inference be taken a information coming straight from garth so even diligent historian might have concluded caleb to be chief publisher of bulstrodes misdemeanor mr hawley be not slow to perceive that there be handle for law either in revelation made by raffle in circumstance of death have ridden to lowick village that might look at register talk over whole matter with mr farebrother who be not more surprised than lawyer that ugly secret must have come to light about bulstrode though have always have justice enough in to hinder antipathy from turning into conclusion while be talking combination be silently going forward in mr farebrothers mind foreshadowed what be soon to be loudly spoken of in middlemarch a necessary putting of two two together with reason kept bulstrode in dread of raffle there flashed thought that dread might have something to do with munificence towards medical man though resisted suggestion that have be consciously accepted in way a bribe have foreboding that complication of thing might be of malignant effect on lydgates reputation perceived that mr hawley knew nothing at present of sudden relief from debt be careful to glide away from approach towards subject well said with deep breath wanting to wind up illimitable discussion of what might have be though nothing must be legally proven be strange story so mercurial ladislaw have queer genealogy high spirited young lady musical polish patriot made likely enough stock for to spring from must never have suspected grafting of jew pawnbroker however there knowing what mixture will turn out beforehand sort of dirt serve to clarify just what must have expected said mr hawley mounting horse cursed alien blood jew corsican gypsy know he one of black sheep hawley be really disinterested unworldly fellow said mr farebrother smiling ay ay be whiggish twist said mr hawley who have be in habit of saying apologetically that farebrother be such damned pleasant good hearted fellow must mistake for tory mr hawley rode home without thinking of lydgates attendance on raffle in other light than a piece of evidence on side of bulstrode news lydgate have at once become able not only to get rid of execution in house to pay debt in middlemarch be spreading fast gathering round conjecture comment gave new body impetus soon filling ear of other person besides mr hawley who be not slow to see significant relation between sudden command of money bulstrodes desire to stifle scandal of raffle that money came from bulstrode must infallibly have be guessed even if there have be no direct evidence of for have beforehand entered into gossip about lydgates affair that father in law own family must do anything for direct evidence be furnished not only by clerk at bank by innocent mr bulstrode who mentioned loan to mr plymdale who mentioned to daughter in law of house of toller who mentioned generally business be felt to be so public important that required dinner to feed many invitation be just then issued accepted on strength of scandal concerning bulstrode lydgate wife widow single lady took work went out to tea oftener than usual public conviviality from green dragon to dollop gathered zest must not be won from question whether lord must throw out reform bill for hardly anybody doubted that scandalous reason other be at bottom of bulstrodes liberality to lydgate mr hawley indeed in first instance invited select party including two physician with mr toller mr wrench expressly to hold close discussion a to probability of raffles illness reciting to particular have be gathered from mr abel in connection with lydgates certificate that death be due to delirium tremens medical gentleman who stood undisturbedly on old path in relation to disease declared that must see nothing in particular must be transformed into positive ground of suspicion moral ground of suspicion remained strong motif bulstrode clearly have for wishing to be rid of raffle fact that at critical moment have given lydgate help must for time have known need for disposition moreover to believe that bulstrode must be unscrupulous absence of indisposition to believe lydgate might be a easily bribed a other haughty minded men when have found in want of money even if money have be given merely to make hold tongue about scandal of bulstrodes earlier life fact threw odious light on lydgate who have long be sneered at a making subservient to banker for sake of working into predominance discrediting elder member of profession hence in spite of negative a to direct sign of guilt in relation to death at stone court mr hawleys select party broke up with sense that affair have ugly look vague conviction of indeterminable guilt be enough to keep up much head shaking biting innuendo even among substantial professional senior have for general mind superior power of mystery over fact everybody liked better to conjecture how thing be than simply to know for conjecture soon became more confident than knowledge have more liberal allowance for incompatible even more definite scandal concerning bulstrodes earlier life be for mind melted into mass of mystery a so much lively metal to be poured out in dialogue to take such fantastic shape a heaven pleased be tone of thought chiefly sanctioned by mr dollop spirited landlady of tankard in slaughter lane who have often to resist willow pragmatism of customer disposed to think that report from outer world be of equal force with what have come up in mind how have be brought to didnt know be there before a if have be scored with chalk on chimney board a bulstrode must say inside be black a if hair of head knowed thought of heart hed tear em up by

ah there better folk spend money worse said firm voiced dyer whose crimson hand looked out of keeping with good natured face wont keep money by what can make out said glazier dont say a there somebody

poor harriet by mr bulstrodes friend before lydgate knew distinctly why people be looking strangely at before bulstrode suspected betrayal of secret have not be accustomed to very cordial relation with neighbor hence must not miss sign of cordiality moreover have be taking journey on business of various kind having now made up mind that need not quit middlemarch feeling able consequently to determine on matter have before left in suspense will make journey to cheltenham in course of month two have said to wife there be great spiritual advantage to be have in town along with air water six week there will be eminently refreshing to really believed in spiritual advantage meant that life henceforth must be more devoted because of later sin represented to a hypothetic praying hypothetically for pardonif have herein transgressed a to hospital avoided saying anything further to lydgate fearing to manifest too sudden change of plan immediately on death of raffle in secret soul believed that lydgate suspected order to have be intentionally disobeyed suspecting must also suspect motive nothing have be betrayed to a to history of raffle bulstrode be anxious not to do anything must give emphasis to undefined suspicion a to certainty that particular method of treatment must either save kill lydgate be constantly arguing against such dogmatism have right to speak have motive for being silent hence bulstrode felt providentially secured only incident have strongly winced under have be occasional encounter with caleb garth who however have raised hat with mild gravity meanwhile on part of principal townsman strong determination be growing against meeting be to be held in town hall on sanitary question have risen into pressing importance by occurrence of cholera case in town since act of parliament have be hurriedly passed authorizing assessment for sanitary measure there have be board for superintendence of such measure appointed in middlemarch much cleansing preparation have be concurred in by whig tory question now be whether piece of ground outside town must be secured a burial ground by mean of assessment by private subscription meeting be to be open almost everybody of importance in town be expected to be there mr bulstrode be member of board just before twelve oclock started from bank with intention of urging plan of private subscription under hesitation of project have for time kept in background felt that must morning resume old position a man of action influence in public affair of town where expected to end day among various person going in same direction saw lydgate joined talked over object of meeting entered together seemed that everybody of mark have be earlier than there be still space left near head of large central table made way thither mr farebrother sat opposite not far from mr hawley medical men be there mr thesiger be in chair mr brooke of tipton be on right hand lydgate noticed peculiar interchange of glance when bulstrode took seat after business have be fully opened by chairman who pointed out advantage of purchasing by subscription piece of ground large enough to be ultimately used a general cemetery mr bulstrode whose rather high pitched subdued fluent voice town be used to at meeting of sort rose asked leave to deliver opinion lydgate must see again peculiar interchange of glance before mr hawley started up said in firm resonant voice mr chairman request that before one delivers opinion on point may be permitted to speak on question of public feeling not only by myself by many gentleman present be regarded a preliminary mr hawleys mode of speech even when public decorum repressed awful language be formidable in curtness self possession mr thesiger sanctioned request mr bulstrode sat down mr hawley continued in what have to say mr chairman be not speaking simply on own behalf be speaking with concurrence at express request of fewer than eight of fellow townsman who be immediately around be united sentiment mr bulstrode must be called uponand do now call upon himto resign public position hold not simply a tax payer a gentleman among gentleman there be practice there be act owing to circumstance law can not visit though may be worse than many thing be legally punishable honest men gentleman if dont want company of people who perpetrate such act have got to defend a best can be what friend whom may call client in affair be determined to do dont say that mr bulstrode have be guilty of shameful act call upon publicly to deny confute scandalous statement made against by man now dead who died in housethe statement that be for many year engaged in nefarious practice that won fortune by dishonest proceduresor else to withdraw from position must only have be allowed a gentleman among gentleman eye in room be turned on mr bulstrode who since first mention of name have be going through crisis of feeling almost too violent for delicate frame to support lydgate who be undergoing shock a from terrible practical interpretation of faint augury felt nevertheless that own movement of resentful hatred be checked by instinct of healer think first of bringing rescue relief to sufferer when looked at shrunken misery of bulstrodes livid face quick vision that life be after failure that be dishonored man must quail before glance of towards whom have habitually assumed attitude of reproverthat god have disowned before men left unscreened to triumphant scorn of who be glad to have hatred justifiedthe sense of utter futility in equivocation with conscience in dealing with life of accomplice equivocation now turned venomously upon with full grown fang of discovered lieall rushed through like agony of terror fails to kill leaf ear still open to returning wave of execration sudden sense of exposure after re established sense of safety camenot to coarse organization of criminal to susceptible nerve of man whose intensest being lay in such mastery predominance a condition of life have shaped for in intense being lay strength of reaction through bodily infirmity there ran tenacious nerve of ambitious self preserving will have continually leaped out like flame scattering doctrinal fear even while sat object of compassion for merciful be beginning to stir glow under ashy paleness before last word be out of mr hawleys mouth bulstrode felt that must answer that answer must be retort dared not get up say be not guilty whole story be falseeven if have dared must have seemed to under present keen sense of betrayal a vain a to pull for covering to nakedness frail rag must rend at little strain for few moment there be total silence while man in room be looking at bulstrode sat perfectly still leaning hard against back of chair must not venture to rise when began to speak pressed hand upon seat on side of voice be perfectly audible though hoarser than usual word be distinctly pronounced though paused between sentence a if short of breath said turning first toward mr thesiger then looking at mr hawley protest before sir a christian minister against sanction of proceeding towards be dictated by virulent hatred who be hostile to be glad to believe libel uttered by loose tongue against conscience become strict against say that evil speaking of be to be made victim accuses of malpractice here bulstrodes voice rose took on more biting accent till seemed low crywho will be accuser not men whose own life be unchristian nay scandalousnot men who use low instrument to carry out endswhose profession be tissue of chicanerywho have be spending income on own sensual enjoyment have be devoting mine to advance best object with regard to life next after word chicanery there be growing noise half of murmur half of hiss while four person started up at oncemr hawley mr toller mr chichely mr hackbutt mr hawleys outburst be instantaneous left others behind in silence if mean sir call one else to inspection of professional life a to christian unchristian repudiate canting palavering christianity a to way in spend income be not principle to maintain thief cheat offspring of due inheritance in order to support religion set up a saintly killjoy affect niceness of consciencei have not found nice standard necessary yet to measure action by sir again call upon to enter into satisfactory explanation concerning scandal against else to withdraw from post in at rate decline a colleague say sir decline to co operate with man whose character be not cleared from infamous light cast upon not only by report by recent action allow mr hawley said chairman mr hawley still fuming bowed half impatiently sat down with hand thrust deep in pocket mr bulstrode be not desirable think to prolong present discussion said mr thesiger turning to pallid trembling man must so far concur with what have fallen from mr hawley in expression of general feeling a to think due to christian profession that must clear if possible from unhappy aspersion for part must be willing to give full opportunity hearing must say that present attitude be painfully inconsistent with principle have sought to identify with for honor of be bound to care recommend at present a clergyman one who hope for reinstatement in respect to quit room avoid further hindrance to business bulstrode after moment hesitation took hat from floor slowly rose grasped corner of chair so totteringly that lydgate felt sure there be not strength enough in to walk away without support what must do must not see man sink close to for want of help rose gave arm to bulstrode in way led out of room yet act might have be one of gentle duty pure compassion be at moment unspeakably bitter to seemed a if be putting sign manual to association of with bulstrode of now saw full meaning a must have presented to other mind now felt conviction that man who be leaning tremblingly on arm have given thousand pound a bribe that somehow treatment of raffle have be tampered with from evil motive inference be closely linked enough town knew of loan believed to be bribe believed that took a bribe poor lydgate mind struggling under terrible clutch of revelation be while morally forced to take mr bulstrode to bank send man off for carriage wait to accompany home meanwhile business of meeting be despatched fringed off into eager discussion among various group concerning affair of bulstrodeand lydgate mr brooke who have before heard only imperfect hint of be very uneasy that have gone little too far in countenancing bulstrode now got fully informed felt benevolent sadness in talking to mr farebrother about ugly light in lydgate have come to be regarded mr farebrother be going to walk back to lowick step into carriage said mr brooke be going round to see mr casaubon be to come back from yorkshire last night will like to see know so drove along mr brooke chatting with good natured hope that there have not really be anything black in lydgates behaviora young fellow whom have seen to be quite above common mark when brought letter from uncle sir godwin mr farebrother said little be deeply mournful with keen perception of human weakness must not be confident that under pressure of humiliating need lydgate have not fallen below when carriage drove up to gate of manor dorothea be out on gravel came to greet well dear said mr brooke have just come from meetinga sanitary meeting know be mr lydgate there said dorothea who looked full of health animation stood with head bare under gleaming april light want to see have great consultation with about hospital have engaged with mr bulstrode to do so oh dear said mr brooke have be hearing bad newsbad news know walked through garden towards churchyard gate mr farebrother wanting to go on to parsonage dorothea heard whole sad story listened with deep interest begged to hear twice over fact impression concerning lydgate after short silence pausing at churchyard gate addressing mr farebrother said energetically dont believe that mr lydgate be guilty of anything base will not believe let find out truth clear book viii sunset sunrise chapter full soul be double mirror making still endless vista of fair thing before repeating thing behind dorotheas impetuous generosity must have leaped at once to vindication of lydgate from suspicion of having accepted money a bribe underwent melancholy check when came to consider circumstance of case by light of mr farebrothers experience be delicate matter to touch said how can begin to inquire into must be publicly by setting magistrate coroner to work privately by questioning lydgate a to first proceeding there be solid ground to go upon else hawley must have adopted a to opening subject with lydgate confess must shrink from must probably take a deadly insult have more than once experienced difficulty of speaking to on personal matter andone must know truth about conduct beforehand to feel very confident of good result feel convinced that conduct have not be guilty believe that people be almost always better than neighbor think be said dorothea of intensest experience in last two year have set mind strongly in opposition to unfavorable construction of others for first time felt rather discontented with mr farebrother disliked cautious weighing of consequence instead of ardent faith in effort of justice mercy must conquer by emotional force two day afterwards be dining at manor with uncle chettams when dessert be standing uneaten servant be out of room mr brooke be nodding in nap returned to subject with renewed vivacity mr lydgate must understand that if friend hear calumny about first wish must be to justify do live for if be not to make life le difficult to other can not be indifferent to trouble of man who advised in trouble attended in illness dorotheas tone manner be not more energetic than have be when be at head of uncle table nearly three year before experience since have given more right to express decided opinion sir james chettam be no longer diffident acquiescent suitor be anxious brother in law with devout admiration for sister with constant alarm lest must fall under new illusion almost a bad a marrying casaubon smiled much le when said exactly be more often introduction to dissentient opinion than in submissive bachelor day dorothea found to surprise that have to resolve not to be afraid of more because be really best friend disagreed with now dorothea said remonstrantly cant undertake to manage man life for in way lydgate must knowat least will soon come to know how stand if can clear will must act for think friend must wait till find opportunity added mr farebrother be possiblei have often felt so much weakness in can conceive even man of honorable disposition such a have always believed lydgate to be succumbing to temptation a of accepting money be offered more le indirectly a bribe to insure silence about scandalous fact long gone by say can conceive if be under pressure of hard circumstancesif have be harassed a feel sure lydgate have be must not believe anything worse of except under stringent proof there be terrible nemesis following on error that be always possible for who like to interpret into crime there be proof in favor of man outside own consciousness assertion oh how cruel said dorothea clasping hand must not like to be one person who believed in man innocence if rest of world belied besides there be man character beforehand to speak for dear mr casaubon said mr farebrother smiling gently at ardor character be not cut in marbleit be not something solid unalterable be something living changing may become diseased a body do then may be rescued healed said dorothea must not be afraid of asking mr lydgate to tell truth might help why must be afraid now that be not to have land james might do a mr bulstrode proposed take place in providing for hospital have to consult mr lydgate to know thoroughly what be prospect of doing good by keeping up present plan there be best opportunity in world for to ask for confidence must be able to tell thing might make circumstance clear then must stand by bring out of trouble people glorify sort of bravery except bravery might show on behalf of nearest neighbor dorotheas eye have moist brightness in changed tone of voice roused uncle who began to listen be true that woman may venture on effort of sympathy must hardly succeed if men undertook said mr farebrother almost converted by dorotheas ardor surely woman be bound to be cautious listen to who know world better than doe said sir james with little frown do in end dorothea must really keep back at present not volunteer meddling with bulstrode business dont know yet what may turn up must agree with ended looking at mr farebrother do think must be better to wait said latter yes yes dear said mr brooke not quite knowing at what point discussion have arrived coming up to with contribution be generally appropriate be easy to go too far know must not let idea run away with a to being in hurry to put money into schemesit wont do know garth have drawn in uncommonly with repair draining that sort of thing im uncommonly out of pocket with one thing must pull up a for chettam be spending fortune on oak fence round demesne dorothea submitting uneasily to discouragement went with celia into library be usual drawing room now dodo do listen to what james say said celia else will be getting into scrape always did always will when set about doing a please think be mercy now after that have got james to think for let have plan only hinders from being taken in be good of having brother instead of husband husband must not let have plan a if wanted husband said dorothea only want not to have feeling checked at turn mr casaubon be still undisciplined enough to burst into angry tear now really dodo said celia with rather deeper guttural than usual be contradictory first one thing then used to submit to mr casaubon quite shamefully think must have given up ever coming to see if have asked of course submitted to because be duty be feeling for said dorothea looking through prism of tear then why cant think duty to submit little to what james wish said celia with sense of stringency in argument because only wish what be for own good of course men know best about everything except what woman know better dorothea laughed forgot tear well mean about baby thing explained celia must not give up to james when knew be wrong a used to do to mr casaubon chapter lxxiii pity laden one

mr plymdale than one else found to surprise that old friend be not always person whom be easiest to make confidant of there be barrier of remembered communication under other circumstancesthere be dislike of being pitied informed by one who have be long wont to allow superiority for certain word of mysterious appropriateness that mr plymdale let fall about resolution never to turn back on friend convinced mr bulstrode that what have happened must be kind of misfortune instead of being able to say with native directness what be that have in mind found anxious to get away before have

searching tenderness of woman tone seemed made for defence against ready accuser lydgate did not stay to think that be quixotic gave up for first time in life to exquisite sense of leaning entirely on generous sympathy without check of proud reserve told everything from time when under pressure of difficulty unwillingly made first application to bulstrode gradually in relief of speaking getting into more thorough utterance of what have gone on in mindentering fully into fact that treatment of patient be opposed to dominant practice into doubt at last ideal of medical duty uneasy consciousness that acceptance of money have made difference in private inclination professional behavior though not in fulfilment of publicly recognized obligation have come to knowledge since added that hawley sent one to examine housekeeper at stone court said that gave patient opium in phial left a well a good deal of brandy must not have be opposed to ordinary prescription even of first rate men suspicion against have hold there be grounded on knowledge took money that bulstrode have strong motif for wishing man to die that gave money a bribe to concur in malpractice other against patientthat in case accepted bribe to hold tongue be just suspicion cling most obstinately because lie in people inclination can never be disproved how order came to be disobeyed be question to dont know answer be still possible that bulstrode be innocent of criminal intentioneven possible that have nothing to do with disobedience merely abstained from mentioning have nothing to do with public belief be one of case on man be condemned on ground of characterit be believed that have committed crime in undefined way because have motive for doing bulstrodes character have enveloped because took money be simply blightedlike damaged ear of cornthe business be done cant be undone oh be hard said dorothea understand difficulty there be in vindicating that must have come to who have meant to lead higher life than common to find out better waysi can not bear to rest in a unchangeable know meant that remember what said to when first spoke to about hospital there be sorrow have thought more about than thatto love what be great try to reach yet to fail yes said lydgate feeling here have found room for full meaning of grief have ambition meant everything to be different with thought have more strength mastery most terrible obstacle be such a nobody can see except suppose said dorothea meditativelysuppose kept on hospital according to present plan stayed here though only with friendship support of few evil feeling towards must gradually die out there must come opportunity in people must be forced to acknowledge that have be unjust to because must see that purpose be pure may still win great fame like louis laennec have heard speak of will be proud of ended with smile might do if have old trust in myself said lydgate mournfully nothing gall more than notion of turning round running away before slander leaving unchecked behind still cant ask one to put great deal of money into plan depends on must be quite worth while said dorothea simply only think be very uncomfortable with money because tell have too little for great scheme of sort like best yet have too much dont know what to do have seven hundred year of own fortune nineteen hundred year mr casaubon left between three four thousand of ready money in bank wished to raise money pay off gradually out of income dont want to buy land with found village must be school of industry sir james uncle have convinced that risk must be too great so see that what must most rejoice at must be to have something good to do with money must like to make other people life better to make very uneasycoming to who dont want smile broke through gloom of lydgates face childlike grave eyed earnestness with dorothea said be irresistibleblent into adorable whole with ready understanding of high experience of lower experience such a play great part in world poor mr casaubon have very blurred shortsighted knowledge little helped by imagination took smile a encouragement of plan think see now that spoke too scrupulously said in tone of persuasion hospital must be one good making life quite whole well again must be lydgates smile have died away have goodness a well a money to do that if must be done said hesitated little while looking vaguely towards window sat in silent expectation at last turned towards said impetuously why must not tell youyou know what sort of bond marriage be will understand everything dorothea felt heart beginning to beat faster have that sorrow too feared to say word went on immediately be impossible for now to do anythingto take step without considering wife happiness thing might like to do if be alone be become impossible to cant see miserable married without knowing what be going into might have be better for if have not married know knowyou must not give pain if be not obliged to do said dorothea with keen memory of own life have set mind against staying wish to go trouble have have here have wearied said lydgate breaking off again lest must say too much when saw good might come of staying said dorothea remonstrantly looking at lydgate a if have forgotten reason have just be considered did not speak immediately must not see said at last curtly feeling at first that statement must do without explanation indeed have lost spirit about carrying on life here paused moment then following impulse to let dorothea see deeper into difficulty of life said fact be trouble have come upon confusedly have not be able to speak to other about be not sure what be in mind about may fear have really done something base be fault ought to be more open have be suffering cruelly may go see said dorothea eagerly must accept sympathy must tell that have not be blamable before one judgment own must tell that will be cleared in fair mind must cheer heart will ask if may go to see did see once be sure may said lydgate seizing proposition with hope must feel honoredcheered think by proof that at least have respect for will not speak to about comingthat may not connect with wish at know very well that ought not to have left anything to be told by others broke off there be moment silence dorothea refrained from saying what be in mindhow well knew that there might be invisible barrier to speech between husband wife be point on even sympathy might make wound returned to more outward aspect of lydgates position saying cheerfully if mr lydgate knew that there be friend who must believe in support might then be glad that must stay in place recover hopesand do what meant to do perhaps then must see that be right to agree with what proposed about continuing at hospital surely must if still have faith in a mean of making knowledge useful lydgate did not answer saw that be debating with need not decide immediately said gently few day hence will be early enough for to send answer to mr bulstrode lydgate still waited at last turned to speak in most decisive tone prefer that there must be interval left for wavering be no longer sure enough of myselfi mean of what must be possible for to do under changed circumstance of life must be dishonorable to let others engage to anything serious in dependence on might be obliged to go away after see little chance of anything else whole thing be too problematic can not consent to be cause of goodness being wasted nolet new hospital be joined with old infirmary everything go on a might have done if have never come have kept valuable register since have be there will send to man who will make use of ended bitterly can think of nothing for long while getting income hurt very much to hear speak so hopelessly said dorothea must be happiness to friend who believe in future in power to do great thing if must let save from think how much money have must be like taking burthen from if took of year till got free from fettering want of income why must not people do thing be so difficult to make share at even be one way god bless mr casaubon said lydgate rising a if with same impulse that made word energetic resting arm on back of great leather chair have be sitting in be good that must have such feeling be not man who ought to allow to benefit by have not given guarantee enough must not at least sink into degradation of being pensioned for work never achieved be very clear to that must not count on anything else than getting away from middlemarch a soon a can manage must not be able for long while at very best to get income here andand be easier to make necessary change in new place must do a other men do think what will please world bring in money look for little opening in london crowd push set up in watering place go to southern town where there be plenty of idle english get be sort of shell must creep into try to keep soul alive in now be not brave said dorotheato give up fight be not brave said lydgate if man be afraid of creeping paralysis then in tone yet have made great difference in courage by believing in everything seems more bearable since have talked to if can clear in few other mind especially in farebrothers will be deeply grateful point wish not to mention be fact of disobedience to order must soon get distorted after there be evidence for people opinion of beforehand can only repeat own report of mr farebrother will believeothers will believe said dorothea can say of will make stupidity to suppose that must be bribed to do wickedness dont know said lydgate with something like groan in voice have not taken bribe yet there be pale shade of bribery be sometimes called prosperity will do great kindness then come to see wife yes will remember how pretty be said dorothea into whose mind impression about rosamond have cut deep hope will like a lydgate rode away thought young creature have heart large enough for virgin mary evidently think nothing of own future must pledge away half income at once a if wanted nothing for herself chair to sit in from can look down with clear eye at poor mortal who pray to seems to have what never saw in woman beforea fountain of friendship towards mena man can make friend of casaubon must have raised heroic hallucination in wonder if must have other sort of passion for man ladislawthere be certainly unusual feeling between casaubon must have have notion of love might help man more than money dorothea on side have immediately formed plan of relieving lydgate from obligation to bulstrode felt sure be part though small of galling pressure have to bear sat down at once under inspiration of interview wrote brief note in pleaded that have more claim than mr bulstrode have to satisfaction of providing money have be serviceable to lydgatethat must be unkind in lydgate not to grant position of being helper in small matter favor being entirely to who have so little that be plainly marked out

come now with sense of having advantage with animosity prompting to use indeed not rosamond only one else knowing outer fact of case not simple inspiration on dorothea acted might well have wondered why came looking like lovely ghost of graceful slimness wrapped in soft white shawl rounded infantine mouth cheek inevitably suggesting mildness innocence rosamond paused at three yard distance from visitor bowed dorothea who have taken off glove from impulse must never resist when wanted sense of freedom came forward with face full of sad yet sweet openness put out hand rosamond must not avoid
