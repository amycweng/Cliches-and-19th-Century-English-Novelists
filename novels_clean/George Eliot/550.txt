wheel of polished oakthere might be seen in district far away among lane deep in bosom of hill certain pallid undersized men who by side of brawny country folk looked like remnant of disinherited race shepherd dog barked fiercely when one of alien looking men appeared on upland dark against early winter sunset for what dog like figure bent under heavy bagand pale men rarely stirred abroad without

weaver named silas marner worked at vocation in stone cottage stood among nutty hedgerow near village of raveloe not far from edge of deserted stone pit questionable sound of silass loom so unlike natural cheerful trotting of winnowing machine simpler rhythm of flail have half fearful fascination for raveloe boy who must often leave off nutting bird nesting to peep in at window of stone cottage counterbalancing certain awe at mysterious action of loom by pleasant sense of scornful superiority drawn from mockery of alternating noise along with bent tread mill attitude of weaver sometimes happened that marner pausing to adjust irregularity in thread became aware of small scoundrel though chary of time liked intrusion so ill that must descend from loom opening door must fix on gaze be always enough to make take to leg in terror for how be possible to believe that large brown protuberant eye in silas marners pale face really saw nothing very distinctly be not close to not rather that dreadful stare must dart cramp rickets wry mouth at boy who happened to be in rear have perhaps heard father mother hint that silas marner must cure folk rheumatism if have mind add still more darkly that if must only speak devil fair enough might save cost of doctor such strange lingering echo of old demon worship might perhaps even now be caught by diligent listener among grey haired peasantry for rude mind with difficulty associate idea of power benignity shadowy conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain from inflicting harm be shape most easily taken

snug well wooded hollow quite hour journey on horseback from turnpike where be never reached by vibration of coach horn of public opinion be important looking village with fine old church large churchyard in heart of two three large brick stone homestead with well walled orchard ornamental weathercock standing close upon road lifting more imposing front than rectory peeped from among tree on other side of churchyarda village showed at once summit of social life told practised eye that there be great park manor house in vicinity that there be several chief in raveloe who must farm badly quite at ease drawing enough money from bad farming in war time to live in rollicking fashion keep jolly christmas whitsun easter tide be fifteen year since silas marner have first come to raveloe be then simply pallid young man with prominent short sighted brown eye whose appearance must have have nothing strange for people of average culture experience for villager near whom have come to settle have mysterious peculiarity corresponded with exceptional nature of occupation advent from unknown region called northard so have way of lifehe invited comer to step across door sill never strolled into village to drink pint at rainbow to gossip at wheelwright sought man woman save for purpose of calling in order to supply with necessary be soon clear to raveloe lass that must never urge one of to accept against willquite a if have heard declare that must never marry dead man come to life again view of marners personality be not without ground than pale face unexampled eye for jem rodney mole catcher averred that one evening a be returning homeward saw silas marner leaning against stile with heavy bag on back instead of resting bag on stile a man in sens must have done that on coming up to saw that marners eye be set like dead man spoke to shook limb be stiff hand clutched bag a if theyd be made of iron just a have made up mind that weaver be dead came all right again like a might say in winking of eye said good night walked off jem swore have seen more by token that be very day have be mole catching on squire ca land down by old saw pit said marner must have be in fit word

cured sally oates made sleep like baby when heart have be beating enough to burst body for two month more while have be under doctor care might cure more folk if must be worth speaking fair if be only to keep from doing mischief be partly to vague fear that marner be indebted for protecting from persecution that singularity might have drawn upon still more to fact that old linen weaver in neighbouring parish of tarley being dead handicraft made highly welcome settler to richer housewife of district even to more provident cottager who have little stock of yarn at year end sense of usefulness must have counteracted repugnance suspicion be not confirmed by deficiency in quality tale of cloth wove for year have rolled on without producing change in impression of neighbour concerning marner except change from novelty to habit at end of fifteen year raveloe men said just same thing about silas marner a at beginning did not say quite so often believed much more strongly when did say there be only one important addition year have brought be that master marner have laid by fine sight of money somewhere that must buy up bigger men than while opinion concerning have remained nearly stationary daily habit have presented scarcely visible change marners inward life have be history metamorphosis a of fervid nature must be when have fled be condemned to solitude life

believed to be young man of exemplary life ardent faith peculiar interest have be centred in ever since have fallen at prayer meeting into mysterious rigidity suspension of consciousness lasting for hour more have be mistaken for death to have sought medical explanation for phenomenon must have be held by silas a well a by minister fellow member wilful self exclusion from spiritual significance might lie therein silas be evidently brother selected for peculiar discipline though effort to interpret discipline be discouraged by absence on part of spiritual vision during outward trance yet be believed by others that effect be seen in accession of light fervour le truthful man than might have be tempted into subsequent creation of vision in form of resurgent memory le sane man might have believed in such creation silas be sane honest though a with many honest fervent men culture have not defined channel for sense of mystery so spread over proper pathway of inquiry knowledge have inherited from mother acquaintance with medicinal herb preparationa little store of wisdom have imparted to a solemn bequestbut of late year have have doubt about lawfulness of applying knowledge believing that herb must have efficacy without prayer prayer might suffice without herb so that inherited delight have in wandering in field in search of foxglove dandelion coltsfoot began to wear to character of temptation among member of church there be one young man little older than with whom have long lived in such close friendship that be custom of lantern yard brother to call david jonathan real name of friend be william dane too be regarded a shining instance of youthful piety though somewhat given to over severity towards weaker brother to be so dazzled by own light a to hold wiser than teacher blemish others might discern in william to friend mind be faultless for marner have one of impressible self doubting nature at inexperienced age admire imperativeness lean on contradiction expression of trusting simplicity in marners face heightened by absence of special observation that defenceless deer like gaze belongs to large prominent eye be strongly contrasted by self complacent suppression of inward triumph lurked in narrow slanting eye compressed lip of william dane one of most frequent topic of conversation between two friend be assurance of salvation silas confessed that must never arrive at anything higher than hope mingled with fear listened with longing wonder when william declared that have possessed unshaken assurance ever since in period of conversion have dreamed that saw word calling election sure standing by on white page in open bible such colloquy have occupied many pair of pale faced weaver whose unnurtured soul have be like young winged thing fluttering forsaken in twilight have seemed to unsuspecting silas that friendship have suffered chill even from formation of attachment of closer kind for month have be engaged to young servant woman waiting only for little increase to mutual saving in order to marriage be great delight to that sarah did not object to williams occasional presence in sunday interview be at point in history that silass cataleptic fit occurred during prayer meeting amidst various query expression of interest addressed to by fellow member williams suggestion alone jarred with general sympathy towards brother thus singled out for special dealing observed that to trance looked more like visitation of satan than proof of divine favour exhorted friend to see that hid accursed thing within soul silas feeling bound to accept rebuke admonition a brotherly office felt resentment only pain at friend doubt concerning to be soon added anxiety at perception that sarah manner towards began to exhibit strange fluctuation between effort at increased manifestation of regard involuntary sign of shrinking dislike asked if wished to break off engagement denied engagement be known to church have be recognized in prayer meeting must not be broken off without strict investigation sarah must render reason must be sanctioned by feeling of community at time senior deacon be taken dangerously ill being childless widower be tended night day by of younger brother sister silas frequently took turn in night watching with one relieving other at two in morning old man contrary to expectation seemed to be on way to recovery when one night silas sitting up by bedside observed that usual audible breathing have ceased candle be burning low have to lift to see patient face distinctly examination convinced that deacon be deadhad be dead time for limb be rigid silas asked if have be asleep looked at clock be already four in morning how be that william have not come in much anxiety went to seek for help soon there be several friend assembled in house minister among while silas went away to work wishing must have met william to know reason of non appearance at six oclock a be thinking of going to seek friend william came with minister came to summon to lantern yard to meet church member there to inquiry concerning cause of summons only reply be will hear nothing further be said until silas be seated in vestry in front of minister with eye of who to represented god people fixed solemnly upon then minister taking out pocket knife showed to silas asked if knew where have left that knife silas said did not know that have left anywhere out of own pocketbut be trembling at strange interrogation be then exhorted not to hide sin to confess repent knife have be found in bureau by departed deacon bedsidefound in place where little bag of church money have minister have seen day before hand have removed that bag whose hand must be if not that of man to whom knife belonged for time silas be mute with astonishment then said god will clear know nothing about knife being there money being gone search dwelling will find nothing three pound five of own saving william dane know have have six month at william groaned minister said proof be heavy against brother marner money be taken in night last past man be with departed brother for william dane declares to that be hindered by sudden sickness from going to take place a usual said that have not come moreover neglected dead body must have slept said silas then after pause added must have have visitation like have seen under so that thief must have come gone while be not in body out of body say again search dwelling for have be nowhere else search be made endedin william dane finding well known bag empty tucked behind chest of drawer in silass chamber on william exhorted friend to confess not to hide sin longer silas turned look of keen reproach on said william for nine year that have gone in out together have ever known tell lie god will clear brother said william how do know what may have done in secret chamber of heart to give satan advantage over silas be still looking at friend suddenly deep flush came over face be about to speak impetuously when seemed checked again by inward shock sent flush back made tremble at last spoke feebly looking at william remember nowthe knife wasnt in pocket william said know nothing of what mean other person present however began to inquire where silas meant to say that knife be must give further explanation only said be sore stricken can say nothing god will clear on return to vestry there be further deliberation resort to legal measure for ascertaining culprit be contrary to principle of church in lantern yard according to prosecution be forbidden to christian even have case held le scandal to community member be bound to take other measure for finding out truth resolved on praying drawing lot resolution can be ground of surprise only to who be unacquainted with obscure religious life have gone on in alley of town silas knelt with brother relying on own innocence being certified by immediate divine interference feeling that there be sorrow mourning behind for even thenthat trust in man have be cruelly bruised lot declared that silas marner be guilty be solemnly suspended from church membership called upon to render up stolen money only on confession a sign of repentance must be received once more within fold of church marner listened in silence at last when everyone rose to depart went towards william dane said in voice shaken by agitation last time remember using knife be when took out to cut strap for dont remember putting in pocket again stole money have woven plot to lay sin at door may prosper for that there be just god governs earth righteously god of lie bear witness against innocent there be general shudder at blasphemy william said meekly leave brother to judge whether be voice of satan not can hing pray for silas poor marner went out with despair in soulthat shaken trust in god man be little short of madness to loving nature in bitterness of wounded spirit said to will cast off too reflected that if did not believe testimony against whole faith must be upset a be to people accustomed to reason about form in religious feeling have incorporated be difficult to enter into simple untaught state of mind in form feeling have never be severed by act of reflection be apt to think inevitable that man in marners position must have begun to question validity of appeal to divine judgment by drawing lot to must have be effort of independent thought such a have never known must have made effort at moment when energy be turned into anguish of disappointed faith if there be angel who record sorrow of men a well a sin know how many deep be sorrow spring from false idea for man be culpable marner went home for whole day sat alone stunned by despair without impulse to go to sarah attempt to win belief in innocence second day took refuge from benumbing unbelief by getting into loom working away a usual before many hour be past minister one of deacon came to with message from sarah that held engagement to at end silas received message mutely then turned away from messenger to work at loom again in little more than month from time sarah be married to william dane not long afterwards be known to brother in lantern yard silas marner have departed from town chapter ii even people whose life have be made various by learning sometimes find hard to keep fast hold on habitual view of life on faith

human life have other form than on soul have be nourished mind have be unhinged from old faith love have perhaps sought lethean influence of exile in past becomes dreamy because symbol have vanished present too be dreamy because be linked with memory even experience may hardly enable thoroughly to imagine what be effect on simple weaver like silas marner when left own country people came to settle in raveloe nothing must be more unlike native town set within sight of widespread hillside than low wooded region where felt hidden even from heaven by screening tree hedgerow there be nothing

voice in song thing have be channel of divine influence to marnerthey be fostering home of religious emotionsthey be christianity god kingdom upon earth weaver who find hard word in hymn book know nothing of abstraction a little child know nothing of parental love only know one face one lap towards stretch arm for refuge nurture what must be more unlike lantern yard world than world in raveloeorchards looking lazy with neglected plenty large church in wide churchyard men gazed at lounging at own door in service time purple faced farmer jogging along lane turning in at rainbow homestead where men supped heavily slept in light of evening hearth where woman seemed to be laying up stock of linen for life to come there be lip in raveloe from word must fall must stir silas marners benumbed faith to sense of pain in early age of world know be believed that territory be inhabited ruled by own divinity so that man must cross bordering height be out of reach of native god whose presence be confined to stream grove hill among have lived from birth poor silas be vaguely conscious of something not unlike feeling of primitive men when fled thus in fear in sullenness from face of unpropitious deity seemed to that power have vainly trusted in among street at prayer meeting be very far away from land in have taken refuge where men lived in careless abundance knowing needing nothing of trust for have be turned to bitterness little light possessed spread beam so narrowly that frustrated belief be curtain broad enough to create for blackness of night first movement after shock have be to work in loom went on with unremittingly never asking why now be come to raveloe worked far on into night to finish tale of mr osgoods table linen sooner than expectedwithout contemplating beforehand money must put into hand for work seemed to weave like spider from pure impulse without reflection man work pursued steadily tends in way to become end in so to bridge over loveless chasm of life silass hand satisfied with throwing shuttle eye with seeing little square in cloth complete under effort then there be call of hunger silas in solitude have to provide own breakfast dinner supper to fetch own water from well put own kettle on fire immediate prompting helped along with weaving to reduce life to unquestioning activity of spinning insect hated thought of

full breadth for twenty year mysterious money have stood to a symbol of earthly good immediate object of toil have seemed to love little in year when penny have purpose for for loved purpose then now when purpose be gone that habit of looking towards money grasping with sense of fulfilled effort made loam be deep enough for seed of desire a silas walked homeward across field in twilight drew out money thought be brighter in gathering gloom about time incident happened seemed to open possibility of fellowship with neighbour one day taking pair of shoe to be mended saw cobbler wife seated by fire suffering from terrible symptom of heart disease dropsy have witnessed a precursor of mother death felt rush of pity at mingled sight remembrance recalling relief mother have found from simple preparation of foxglove promised sally oates to bring something must ease since doctor did good in office of charity silas felt for first time since have come to raveloe sense of unity between past

in consequence have never have idiot child a ann coulter have silas marner must very likely do a much more now be clear how must have come from unknown part be so comical looking sally oates must mind not tell doctor for must be sure to set face against marner be always angry about wise woman used to threaten who went to that must have none of help more silas now found cottage suddenly beset by

saving by probably inside flock bed rustic neighbour though not of a honest a ancestor in day of king alfred have not imagination bold enough to lay plan of burglary how must have spent money in own village without betraying must be obliged to run awaya course a dark dubious a balloon journey so year after year silas marner have lived in solitude guinea rising in iron pot life narrowing hardening more more into mere pulsation of desire satisfaction have relation to other being life have reduced to function of weaving hoarding without contemplation of end towards function tended same sort of process have perhaps be undergone by wiser men when have be cut off from faith loveonly instead of loom heap of guinea have have erudite research ingenious project well knit theory strangely marners

more opportunity remained for to snatch strange gratification of seeing nancy gathering faint indication of lingering regard towards gratification be impelled fitfully now then after having passed week in have avoided a far off bright winged prize that only made spring forward find chain more galling one of fit of yearning be on now must have be strong enough to have persuaded to trust wildfire to dunstan rather than disappoint yearning even if have not have reason for disinclination towards morrow hunt that other reason be fact that morning meet be near batherley market town where unhappy woman lived whose image became more odious to day to thought whole vicinage be haunted by yoke man creates for by wrong doing will breed hate in kindliest nature good humoured affectionate hearted godfrey ca be fast becoming bitter man visited by cruel wish seemed to enter depart enter again like demon who have found in ready garnished home what be to do evening to pas time might a well go to rainbow hear talk about cock fighting everybody be there what else be there to be done though for own part did not care button for cock fighting snuff brown spaniel who have placed in front of have be watching for time now jumped up in impatience for expected caress godfrey thrust away without looking at left room followed humbly by unresenting snuffperhaps because saw other career open to chapter iv dunstan ca setting off in raw morning at judiciously quiet pace of man who be obliged to ride to cover on hunter have to take way along lane at farther extremity passed by piece of unenclosed ground called stone pit where stood cottage once stone cutter shed now for fifteen year inhabited by silas marner spot looked very dreary at season with moist trodden clay about red muddy water high up in deserted quarry be dunstans first thought a approached second be that old fool of weaver whose loom heard rattling already have great deal of money hidden somewhere how be that dunstan ca who have often heard talk of marners miserliness have never thought of suggesting to godfrey that must frighten persuade old fellow into lending money on excellent security of young squire prospect resource occurred to now a so easy agreeable especially a marners hoard be likely to be large enough to leave godfrey handsome surplus beyond immediate need enable to accommodate faithful brother that have almost turned horse head towards home again godfrey must be ready enough to accept suggestion must snatch eagerly at plan might save from parting with wildfire when dunstans meditation reached point inclination to go on grew strong prevailed didnt want to give godfrey that pleasure preferred that master godfrey must be vexed moreover dunstan enjoyed self important consciousness of having horse to sell opportunity of driving bargain swaggering possibly taking somebody in might have satisfaction attendant on selling brother horse not le have further satisfaction of setting godfrey to borrow marners money so rode on to cover bryce keating be there a dunstan be quite sure must behe be such lucky fellow heyday said bryce who have long have eye on wildfire youre on brother horse to day hows oh ive swopped with said dunstan whose delight in lying grandly independent of utility be not to be diminished by likelihood that hearer must not believe himwildfires mine now what have swopped with for big boned hack of yours said bryce quite aware that must get lie in answer oh there be little account between said dunsey carelessly wildfire made even accommodated by taking horse though be against will for id got itch for mare o jortinsas rare bit o blood a ever threw leg across will keep wildfire now ive got though id bid of hundred fifty for other day from man over at flittonhes buying for lord cromlecka fellow with cast in eye green waistcoat mean to stick to wildfire shant get better at fence in hurry mare got more blood shes bit too weak in hind quarter bryce of course divined that dunstan wanted to sell horse dunstan knew that divined horse dealing be only one of many human transaction carried on in ingenious manner considered that bargain be in first stage when bryce replied ironically wonder at now wonder mean to keep for never heard of man who didnt want to sell horse getting bid of half a much again a horse be worth youll be lucky if get hundred keating rode up now transaction became more complicated ended in purchase of horse by bryce for hundred twenty to be paid on delivery of wildfire safe sound at batherley stable did occur to dunsey that might be wise for to give up day hunting proceed at once to batherley having waited for bryces return hire horse to carry home with money in pocket inclination for run encouraged by confidence in luck by draught of brandy from pocket pistol at conclusion of bargain be not easy to overcome especially with horse under must take fence to admiration of field dunstan however took one fence too many got horse pierced with hedge stake own ill favoured person be quite unmarketable escaped without injury poor wildfire unconscious of price turned on flank painfully panted last happened that dunstan short time before having have to get down to arrange stirrup have muttered good many curse at interruption have thrown in rear of hunt near moment of glory under exasperation have taken fence more blindly must soon have be up with hound again when fatal accident happened hence be between eager rider in advance not troubling about what happened behind far off straggler who be a likely a not to pas quite aloof from line of road in wildfire have fallen dunstan whose nature be to care more for immediate annoyance than for remote consequence sooner recovered leg saw that be over with wildfire than felt satisfaction at absence of witness to position swaggering must make enviable reinforcing after shake with little brandy much swearing walked a fast a must to coppice on right hand through occurred to that must make way to batherley without danger of encountering member of hunt first intention be to hire horse there ride home forthwith for to walk many mile without gun in hand along ordinary road be a much out of question to a to other spirited young men of kind did not much mind about taking bad news to godfrey for have to offer at same time resource of marners money if godfrey kicked a always did at notion of making fresh debt from got smallest share of advantage why wouldnt kick long dunstan felt sure must worry godfrey into anything idea of marners money kept growing in vividness now want of have become immediate prospect of having to make appearance with muddy boot of pedestrian at batherley to encounter grinning query of stableman stood unpleasantly in way of impatience to be back at raveloe carry out felicitous plan casual visitation of waistcoat pocket a be ruminating awakened memory to fact that two three small coin forefinger encountered there be of too pale colour to cover that small debt without payment of stable keeper have declared must never do more business with dunsey ca after according to direction in run have brought be not so very much farther from home than be from batherley dunsey not being remarkable for clearness of head be only led to conclusion by gradual perception that there be other reason for choosing unprecedented course of walking home be now nearly four oclock mist be gathering sooner got into road better remembered having crossed road seen finger post only little while before wildfire broke down so buttoning coat twisting lash of hunting whip compactly round handle rapping top of boot with self possessed air a if to assure that be not at taken by surprise set off with sense that be undertaking remarkable feat of bodily exertion somehow at time must be able to dress up magnify to admiration of select circle at rainbow when young gentleman like dunsey be reduced to so exceptional mode of locomotion a walking whip in hand be desirable corrective to too bewildering dreamy sense of unwontedness in position dunstan a went along through gathering mist be always rapping whip somewhere be godfreys whip have chosen to take without leave because have gold handle of course one must see when dunstan held that name godfrey ca be cut in deep letter on gold handlethey must only see that be very handsome whip dunsey be not without fear that might meet acquaintance in whose eye must cut pitiable figure for mist be screen when people get close to other when at last found in well known raveloe lane without having met soul silently remarked that be part of usual good luck now mist helped by evening darkness be more of screen than desired for hid rut into foot be liable to sliphid everything so that have to guide step by dragging whip along low bush in advance of hedgerow must soon thought be getting near opening at stone pit must find out by break in hedgerow found out however by circumstance have not expectednamely by certain gleam of light presently guessed to proceed from silas marners cottage cottage money hidden within have be in mind continually during walk have be imagining way of cajoling tempting weaver to part with immediate possession of money for sake of receiving interest dunstan felt a if there must be little frightening added to cajolery for own arithmetical conviction be not clear enough to afford forcible demonstration a to advantage of interest a for security regarded vaguely a mean of cheating man by making believe that must be paid altogether operation on miser mind be task godfrey must be sure to hand over to more daring cunning brother dunstan have made up mind to by time saw light gleaming through chink of marners shutter idea of dialogue with weaver have become so familiar to that occurred to a quite natural thing to make acquaintance forthwith there might be several convenience attending course weaver have possibly got lantern dunstan be tired of feeling way be still nearly three quarter of mile from home lane be becoming unpleasantly slippery for mist be passing into rain turned up bank not without fear lest might miss right way since be not certain whether light be in front on side of cottage felt ground before cautiously with whip handle at last arrived safely at door knocked loudly rather enjoying idea that old fellow must be frightened at sudden noise heard movement in reply be silence in cottage be weaver gone to bed then if so why have left light be strange forgetfulness in miser dunstan knocked still more loudly without pausing for reply pushed finger through latch hole intending to shake door pull latch string up down not doubting that door be fastened to surprise at double motion door opened found in front of bright fire lit up corner of cottagethe bed loom three chair tableand showed that marner be not there nothing at moment must be much more inviting to dunsey than bright fire on brick hearth walked in seated by at once there be something in front of fire too must have be inviting to hungry man if have be in different stage of cooking be small bit of pork suspended from kettle hanger by string passed through large door key in way known to primitive housekeeper unpossessed of jack pork have be hung at farthest extremity of hanger apparently to prevent roasting from proceeding too rapidly during owner absence old staring simpleton have hot meat for supper then thought dunstan people have always said lived on mouldy bread on purpose to check appetite where must be at time on such evening leaving supper in stage of preparation door unfastened dunstans own recent difficulty in making way suggested to that weaver have perhaps gone outside cottage to fetch in fuel for such brief purpose have slipped into stone pit be interesting idea to dunstan carrying consequence of entire novelty if weaver be dead who have right to money who must know where money be hidden who must know that anybody have come to take away went farther into subtlety of evidence pressing question where be money now took such entire possession of a to make quite forget that weaver death be not certainty dull mind once arriving at inference flatters desire be rarely able to retain impression that notion from inference started be purely problematic dunstans mind be a dull a mind of possible felon usually be there be only three hiding place where have ever heard of cottager hoard being found thatch bed hole in floor marners cottage have thatch dunstans first act after train of thought made rapid by stimulus of cupidity be to go up to bed while did so eye travelled eagerly over floor where brick distinct in fire light be discernible under sprinkling of sand not everywhere for there be one spot one only be quite covered with sand sand showing mark of finger have apparently be careful to spread over given space be near treddles of loom in instant dunstan darted to spot swept away sand with whip inserting thin end of hook between brick found that be loose in haste lifted up two brick saw what have doubt be object of search for what must there be money in two leathern bag from weight must be filled with guinea dunstan felt round hole to be certain that held no more then hastily replaced brick spread sand over hardly more than five minute have passed since entered cottage seemed to dunstan like long while though be without distinct recognition of possibility that marner might be alive might re enter cottage at moment felt undefinable dread laying hold on a rose to foot with bag in hand must hasten out into darkness then consider what must do with bag closed door behind immediately that might shut in stream of light few step must be enough to carry beyond betrayal by gleam from shutter chink latch hole rain darkness have got thicker be glad of though be awkward walking with hand filled so that be a much a must do to grasp whip along with one of bag when have gone yard two might take time so stepped forward into darkness chapter v when dunstan ca turned back on cottage silas marner be not more than hundred yard away from plodding along from village with sack thrown round shoulder a overcoat with horn lantern in hand leg be weary mind be at ease free from presentiment of change sense of security more frequently spring from habit than from conviction for reason often subsists after such change in condition a might have be expected to suggest alarm lapse of time during given event have not happened be in logic of habit constantly alleged a reason why event must never happen even when lapse of time be precisely added condition make event imminent man will tell that have worked in mine for forty year unhurt by accident a reason why must apprehend danger though roof be beginning to sink be often observable that older man get more difficult be to to retain believing conception of own death influence of habit be necessarily strong in man whose life be so monotonous a marnerswho saw new people heard of new event to keep alive in idea of unexpected changeful explains simply enough why mind must be at ease though have left house treasure more defenceless than usual silas be thinking with double complacency of supper first because must be hot savoury secondly because must cost nothing for little bit of pork be present from excellent housewife miss priscilla lammeter to whom have day carried home handsome piece of linen be only on occasion of present like silas indulged with roast meat supper be favourite meal because came at time of revelry when heart warmed over gold whenever have roast meat always chose to have for supper evening have sooner ingeniously knotted string fast round bit of pork twisted string according to rule over door key passed through handle made fast on hanger than remembered that piece of very fine twine be indispensable to setting up new piece of work in loom early in morning have slipped memory because in coming from mr lammeters have not have to pas through village to lose time by going on errand in morning be out of question be nasty fog to turn out into there be thing silas loved better than own comfort so drawing pork to extremity of hanger arming with lantern old sack set out on what in ordinary weather must have be twenty minute errand must not have locked door without undoing well knotted string retarding supper be not worth while to make sacrifice what thief must find way to stone pit on night a why must come on particular night when have never come through fifteen year

ghoses want to believe in em let em leave off skulking dark lone placeslet em come where there company candle a if ghoses ud want to be believed in by anybody so ignirant said mr macey in deep disgust at farrier crass incompetence to apprehend condition of ghostly phenomenon chapter vii yet next moment there seemed to be evidence that ghost have more condescending disposition than mr macey attributed to for pale thin figure of silas marner be suddenly seen standing in warm light uttering word looking round at company with strange unearthly eye long pipe gave simultaneous movement like antenna of startled insect man present not excepting even sceptical farrier have impression that saw not silas marner in flesh apparition for door by silas have entered be hidden by high screened seat one have noticed approach mr macey sitting long way off ghost might be supposed to have felt argumentative triumph must tend to neutralize share of general alarm have not always said that when silas marner be in strange trance of soul went loose from body here be demonstration nevertheless on whole must have be a well contented without for few moment there be dead silence marners want of breath agitation not allowing to speak landlord under habitual sense that be bound to keep house open to company confident in protection of unbroken neutrality at last took on task of adjuring ghost master marner said in conciliatory tone whats lacking to whats business here robbed said silas gaspingly ive be robbed want constableand justiceand squire cassand mr crackenthorp lay hold on jem rodney said landlord idea of ghost subsiding he off head doubt he wet through jem rodney be outermost man sat conveniently near marners standing place declined to give service come lay hold on mr snell if mind said jem rather sullenly he be robbed murdered too for what know added in muttering tone jem rodney said silas turning fixing strange eye on suspected man aye master marner what do want wi said jem trembling little seizing drinking can a defensive weapon if be stole money said silas clasping hand entreatingly raising voice to cry give backand wont meddle with wont set constable on give back ill let youill let have guinea stole money said jem angrily ill pitch can at eye if talk o stealing money come come master marner said landlord now rising resolutely seizing marner by shoulder if youve got information to lay speak out sensible show a youre in right mind if expect anybody to listen to youre a wet a drownded rat sit down dry yourself speak straight forrard ah to be sure man said farrier who began to feel that have not be quite on par with occasion let have more staring screaming else well have strapped for madman be why didnt speak at firstthinks man run mad aye aye make sit down said several voice at once well pleased that reality of ghost remained still open question landlord forced marner to take off coat then to sit down on chair aloof from one else in centre of circle in direct ray of fire weaver too feeble to have distinct purpose beyond of getting help to recover money submitted unresistingly transient fear of company be now forgotten in strong curiosity face be turned towards silas when landlord having seated again said now then master marner whats youve got to sayas youve be robbed speak out hed better not say again a be robbed cried jem rodney hastily what must have done with money must a easy steal parson surplice wear hold tongue jem let hear what he got to say said landlord now then master marner silas now told story under frequent questioning a mysterious character of robbery became evident strangely novel situation of opening trouble to raveloe neighbour of sitting in warmth of hearth not own feeling presence of face voice be nearest promise of help have influence on marner in spite of passionate preoccupation with loss consciousness rarely register beginning of growth within more than without there have be many circulation of sap before detect smallest sign of bud slight suspicion with hearer at first listened to gradually melted away before convincing simplicity of distress be impossible for neighbour to doubt that marner be telling truth not because be capable of arguing at once from nature of statement to absence of motive for making falsely because a mr macey observed folk a have devil to back em be not likely to be so mushed a poor silas be rather from strange fact that robber have left trace have happened to know nick of time utterly incalculable by mortal agent when silas must go away from home without locking door more probable conclusion seemed to be that disreputable intimacy in quarter if ever existed have be broken up that in consequence ill turn have be done to marner by somebody be quite in vain to set constable after why preternatural felon must be obliged to wait till door be left unlocked be question did not present isnt jem rodney a have done work master marner said landlord mustnt be casting eye at poor jem there may be bit of reckoning against jem for matter of hare so if anybody be bound to keep eye staring open niver to wink jem be sitting here drinking can like decentest man parish since before left house master marner by own account aye aye said mr macey let have accusing o innicent isnt law there must be folk to swear again man before can be taen up let have accusing o innicent master marner memory be not so utterly torpid in silas that must not be awakened by word with movement of compunction a new strange to a everything else within last hour started from chair went close up to jem looking at a if wanted to assure of expression in face be wrong saidyes yesi ought to have thought there nothing to witness against jem only youd be into house oftener than anybody else so came into head dont accuse youi wont accuse anybodyonly added lifting up hand to head turning away with bewildered misery tryi try to think where guinea can be aye aye theyre gone where hot enough to melt em doubt said mr macey tchuh said farrier then asked with cross examining air how much money might there be in bag master marner two hundred seventy two pound twelve sixpence last night when counted said silas seating again with groan pooh why theyd be none so heavy to carry tramp be in thats a for footmark brick sand being rightwhy eye be pretty much like insect master marner theyre obliged to look so close cant see much at time opinion a if id be youd be mefor come to same thingyou wouldnt have thought youd found everything a left what vote be a two of sensiblest o company must go with to master kench constableshes ill bed know muchand get to appoint one of deppity for thats law dont think anybody ull take upon to contradick there isnt much of walk to kenchs then if a be deppity ill go back with master marner examine premise if anybodys got fault to find with ill thank to stand up say out like man by pregnant speech farrier have re established self complacency waited with confidence to hear named a one of superlatively sensible men let see how night be though said landlord who also considered personally concerned in proposition why rain heavy still said returning from door well im not man to be afraid o rain said farrier for itll look bad when justice malam hears a respectable men like have information laid before em took step landlord agreed with view after taking sense of company duly rehearsing small ceremony known in high ecclesiastical life a nolo episcopari consented to take on chill dignity of going to kenchs to farrier strong disgust mr macey now started objection to proposing a deputy constable for oracular old gentleman claiming to know law stated a fact delivered to by father that doctor must be constable youre doctor reckon though youre only cow doctorfor fly fly though may be ho fly concluded mr macey wondering little at own cuteness there be hot debate upon farrier being of course indisposed to renounce quality of doctor contending that doctor must be constable if likedthe law meant neednt be one if didnt like mr macey thought be nonsense since law be not likely to be fonder of doctor than of other folk moreover if be in nature of doctor more than of other men not to like being constable how came mr dowlas to be so eager to act in capacity dont want to act constable said farrier driven into corner by merciless reasoning there man can say of if hed tell truth if there to be jealousy envying about going to kenchs in rain let go a like ityou wont get to go can tell by landlord intervention however dispute be accommodated mr dowlas consented to go a second person disinclined to act officially so poor silas furnished with old covering turned out with two companion into rain again thinking of long night hour before not a do who long to rest a who expect to watch for morning chapter viii when godfrey ca returned from mr osgoods party at midnight be not much surprised to learn that dunsey have not come home perhaps have not sold wildfire be waiting for chanceperhaps on foggy afternoon have preferred housing at red lion at batherley for night if run have kept in neighbourhood for be not likely to feel much concern about leaving brother in suspense godfreys mind be too full of nancy lammeters look behaviour too full of exasperation against lot sight of always produced in for to give much thought to wildfire to probability of dunstans conduct next morning whole village be excited by story of robbery godfrey like one else be occupied in gathering discussing news about in visiting stone pit rain have washed away possibility of distinguishing foot mark close investigation of spot have disclosed in direction opposite to village tinder box with flint steel half sunk in mud be not silass tinder box for only one have ever have be still standing on shelf inference generally accepted be that tinder box in ditch be somehow connected with robbery small minority shook head intimated opinion that be not robbery to have much light thrown on by tinder box master marners tale have queer look with that such thing have be known a man doing mischief then setting justice to look for doer when questioned closely a to ground for opinion what master marner have to gain by such false pretence only shook head a before observed that there be knowing what folk counted gain moreover that everybody have right to own opinion ground ground that weaver a everybody knew be partly crazy mr macey though joined in defence of marner against suspicion of deceit also pooh poohed tinder box indeed repudiated a rather impious suggestion tending to imply that everything must be done by human hand that there be power must make away with guinea without moving brick nevertheless turned round rather sharply on mr tookey when zealous deputy feeling that be view of case peculiarly suited to parish clerk carried still farther doubted whether be right to inquire into robbery at when circumstance be so mysterious a if concluded mr tookeyas if there be nothing what must be made out by justice constable now dont be for overshooting mark tookey said mr macey nodding head aside admonishingly thats what youre allays at if throw stone hit think there summat better than hitting try to throw stone beyond what said be against tinder box said nothing against justice constable for theyre o king george making ud be ill becoming man in parish office to fly out again king george while discussion be going on amongst group outside rainbow higher consultation be being carried on within under presidency of mr crackenthorp rector assisted by squire ca other substantial parishioner have just occurred to mr snell landlordhe being a observed man accustomed to put two two togetherto connect with tinder box a deputy constable have have honourable distinction of finding certain recollection of pedlar who have called to drink at house about month before have actually stated that carried tinder box about with to light pipe here surely be clue to be followed out a memory when duly impregnated with ascertained fact be sometimes surprisingly fertile mr snell gradually recovered vivid impression of effect produced on by pedlar countenance conversation have look with eye fell unpleasantly on mr snells sensitive organism to be sure didnt say anything particularno except about tinder boxbut isnt what man say way say moreover have swarthy foreignness of complexion boded little honesty did wear ear ring mr crackenthorp wished to know having acquaintance with foreign custom wellstaylet see said mr snell like docile clairvoyante who must really not make mistake if must help after stretching corner of mouth contracting eye a if be trying to see ear ring appeared to give up effort said well hed got ear ring in box to sell so natral to suppose might wear em called at house amost in village there somebody else mayhap saw em in ear though cant take upon rightly to say mr snell be correct in surmise that somebody else must remember pedlar ear ring for on spread of inquiry among villager be stated with gathering emphasis that parson have wanted to know whether pedlar wore ear ring in ear impression be created that great deal depended on eliciting of fact of course one who heard question not having distinct image of pedlar a without ear ring immediately have image of with ear ring larger smaller a case might be image be presently taken for vivid recollection so that glazier wife well intentioned woman not given to lying whose house be among cleanest in village be ready to declare a sure a ever meant to take sacrament very next christmas be ever coming that have seen big ear ring in shape of young moon in pedlar two ear while jinny oates cobbler daughter being more imaginative person stated not only that have seen too that have made blood creep a did at very moment while there stood also by way of throwing further light on clue of tinder box collection be made of article purchased from pedlar at various house carried to rainbow to be exhibited there in fact there be general feeling in village for clearing up of robbery there must be great deal done at rainbow that man need offer wife excuse for going there while be scene of severe public duty disappointment be felt perhaps little indignation also when became known that silas marner on being questioned by squire parson have retained no other recollection of pedlar than that have called at door have not entered house having turned away at once when silas holding door ajar have said that wanted nothing have be silass testimony though clutched strongly at idea of pedlar being culprit if only because gave definite image of whereabout for gold after have be taken away from hiding place must see now in pedlar box be observed with irritation in village that anybody blind creatur like marner must have seen man prowling about for how came to leave tinder box in ditch close by if hadnt be lingering there doubtless have made observation when saw marner at door anybody might knowand only look at himthat weaver be half crazy miser be wonder pedlar hadnt murdered men of sort with ring in ear have be known for murderer often often there have be one tried at size not so long ago what there be people living who remembered godfrey ca indeed entering rainbow during one of mr snells frequently repeated recital of testimony have treated lightly stating that have bought pen knife of pedlar thought merry grinning fellow enough be nonsense said about man evil look be spoken of in village a random talk of youth a if be only mr snell who have seen something odd about pedlar on contrary there be at least dozen who be ready to go before justice malam give in much more striking testimony than landlord must furnish be to be hoped mr godfrey must not go to tarley throw cold water on what mr snell said there so prevent justice from drawing up warrant be suspected of intending when after mid day be seen setting off on horseback in direction of tarley by time godfreys interest in robbery have faded before growing anxiety about dunstan wildfire be going not to tarley to batherley unable to rest in uncertainty about longer possibility that dunstan have played ugly trick of riding away with wildfire to return at end of month when have gambled away otherwise squandered price of horse be fear that urged upon more even than thought of accidental injury now that dance at mr osgoods be past be irritated with that have trusted horse to dunstan instead of trying to still fear encouraged with superstitious impression cling to that if expect evil very strongly be le likely to come when heard horse approaching at trot saw hat rising above hedge beyond angle of lane felt a if conjuration have succeeded sooner did horse come within sight than heart sank again be not wildfire in few moment more discerned that rider be not dunstan bryce who pulled up to speak with face implied something disagreeable well mr godfrey thats lucky brother of yours master dunsey isnt what do mean said godfrey hastily why hasnt be home yet said bryce home have happened be quick what have done with horse ah thought be yours though pretended have parted with to have thrown down broken knee said godfrey flushed with exasperation worse than said bryce see id made bargain with to buy horse for hundred twentya swinging price always liked horse what doe do go stake himfly at hedge with stake in atop of bank with ditch before horse have be dead pretty good while when be found so hasnt be home since have home said godfrey hed better keep away confound for fool might have known must be end of well to tell truth said bryce after id bargained for horse did come into head that might be riding selling horse without knowledge for didnt believe be own knew master dunsey be up to trick sometimes where can be gone he never be seen at batherley couldnt have be hurt for must have walked off hurt said godfrey bitterly hell never be hurthes made to hurt other people so did give leave to sell horse eh said bryce yes wanted to part with horsehe be always little too hard in mouth for said godfrey pride making wince under idea bryce guessed sale to be matter of necessity be going to see after himi thought mischief have happened ill go back now added turning horse head wishing must get rid of bryce for felt that long dreaded crisis in life be close upon youre coming on to raveloe arent well not now said bryce be coming round there for have to go to flitton thought might a well take in way just let know knew about horse suppose master dunsey didnt like to show till ill news have blown over bit he perhaps gone to pay visit at three crown by whitbridgei know he fond of house perhaps be said godfrey rather absently then rousing said with effort at carelessness will hear of soon enough ill be bound well here turning said bryce not surprised to perceive godfrey be rather down so ill bid good day wish may bring better news time godfrey rode along slowly representing to scene of confession to father from felt that there be now no longer escape revelation about money must be made very next morning if withheld rest dunstan must be sure to come back shortly finding that must bear brunt of father anger must tell whole story out of spite even though have nothing to gain by there be one step perhaps by might still win dunstans silence put off evil day might tell father that have spent money paid to by fowler a have never be guilty of such offence before affair must blow over after little storming godfrey must not bend to felt that in letting dunstan have money have already be guilty of breach of trust hardly le culpable than of spending money directly for own behoof yet there be distinction between two act made feel that one be so much more blackening than other a to be intolerable to dont pretend to be good fellow said to im not scoundrelat least ill stop short somewhere ill bear consequence of what have done sooner than make believe ive done what never must have done id never have spent money for own pleasurei be tortured into through remainder of day godfrey with only occasional fluctuation kept will bent in direction of complete avowal to father withheld story of wildfire loss till next morning that might serve a introduction to heavier matter old squire be accustomed to son frequent absence from home thought neither dunstans wildfire non appearance matter calling for remark godfrey said to again again that if let slip one opportunity of confession might never have revelation might be made even in more odious way than by dunstans malignity might come a have threatened to do then tried to make scene easier to by rehearsal made up mind how must pas from admission of weakness in letting dunstan have money to fact that dunstan have hold on have be unable to shake off how must work up father to expect something very bad before told fact old squire be implacable man made resolution in violent anger be not to be moved from after anger have subsidedas fiery volcanic matter cool harden into rock like many violent implacable men allowed evil to grow under favour of own heedlessness till pressed upon with exasperating force then turned round with fierce severity became unrelentingly hard be system with tenant allowed to get into arrears neglect fence reduce stock sell straw otherwise go wrong wayand then when became short of money in consequence of indulgence took hardest measure must listen to appeal godfrey knew felt with greater force because have constantly suffered annoyance from witnessing father sudden fit of unrelentingness for own habitual irresolution deprived of sympathy be not critical on faulty indulgence preceded fit seemed to natural enough still there be just chance godfrey thought that father pride might see marriage in light must induce to hush up rather than turn son out make family talk of country for ten mile round be view of case godfrey managed to keep before pretty closely till midnight went to sleep thinking that have done with inward debating when awoke in still morning darkness found impossible to reawaken evening thought be a if have be tired out be not to be roused to further work instead of argument for confession must now feel presence of nothing evil consequence old dread of disgrace came backthe old shrinking from thought of raising hopeless barrier between nancythe old disposition to rely on chance might be favourable to save from betrayal why after must cut off hope of by own act have seen matter in wrong light yesterday have be in rage with dunstan have thought of nothing thorough break up of mutual understanding what must be really wisest for to do be to try soften father anger against dunsey keep thing a nearly a possible in old condition if dunsey did not come back for few day godfrey did not know that rascal have enough money in pocket to enable to keep away still longer everything might blow over chapter ix godfrey rose took own breakfast earlier than usual lingered in wainscoted parlour till younger brother have finished meal gone out awaiting father who always took walk with managing man before breakfast one breakfasted at different hour in red house squire be always latest giving long chance to rather feeble morning appetite before tried table have be spread with substantial eatable nearly two hour before presented himselfa tall stout man of sixty with face in knit brow rather hard glance seemed contradicted by slack feeble mouth person showed mark of habitual neglect dress be slovenly yet there be something in presence of old squire distinguishable from of ordinary farmer in parish who be perhaps whit a refined a having slouched way through life with consciousness of being in vicinity of better wanted that self possession authoritativeness of voice carriage belonged to man who thought of superior a remote existence with whom have personally little more to do than with america star squire have be used to parish homage life used to presupposition that family tankard everything be be oldest best a never associated with gentry higher than opinion be not disturbed by comparison glanced at son a entered room said what sir havent have breakfast yet there be pleasant morning greeting between not because of unfriendliness because sweet flower of courtesy be not growth of such home a red house yes sir said godfrey ive have breakfast be waiting to speak to ah well said squire throwing indifferently into chair speaking in ponderous coughing fashion be felt in raveloe to be sort of privilege of rank while cut piece of beef held up before deer hound have come in with ring bell for ale will youngster business be own pleasure mostly there hurry about for anybody yourselves squire life be quite a idle a son be fiction kept up by contemporary in raveloe that youth be exclusively period of folly that aged wisdom be constantly in state of endurance mitigated by sarcasm godfrey waited before spoke again until ale have be brought door closedan interval during fleet deer hound have consumed enough bit of beef to make poor man holiday dinner there be cursed piece of ill luck with wildfire began happened day before yesterday what broke knee said squire after taking draught of ale thought knew how to ride better than sir never threw horse down in life if have might have whistled for for father wasnt quite so ready to unstring a other father know of must turn over new leafthey must what with mortgage arrears im a short o cash a roadside pauper that fool kimble say newspaper talking about peace why country have leg to stand on price ud run down like jack must never get arrears not if sold fellow up there damned fowler wont put up with longer ive told winthrop to go to cox very day lying scoundrel told hed be sure to pay hundred last month take advantage because he on outlying farm think will forget squire have delivered speech in coughing interrupted manner with pause long enough for godfrey to make pretext for taking up word again felt that father meant to ward off request for money on ground of misfortune with wildfire that emphasis have thus be led to lay on shortness of cash arrears be likely to produce attitude of mind utmost unfavourable for own disclosure must go on now have begun worse than breaking horse kneeshes be staked killed said a soon a father be silent have begun to cut meat wasnt thinking of asking to buy horse be only thinking id lost mean of paying with price of wildfire a id meant to do dunsey took to hunt to sell for other day after hed made bargain for hundred twenty with bryce went after hound took fool leap other did for horse at once if hadnt be for must have paid hundred pound morning squire have laid down knife fork be staring at son in amazement not being sufficiently quick of brain to form probable guess a to what must have caused so strange inversion of paternal filial relation a proposition of son to pay hundred pound truth be sirim very sorryi be quite to blame said godfrey fowler did pay hundred pound paid to when be over there one day last month dunsey bothered for money let have because hoped must be able to pay before squire be purple with anger before son have done speaking found utterance difficult let dunsey have sir how long have be so thick with dunsey that must collogue with to embezzle money be turning out scamp tell wont have ill turn whole pack of out of house together marry again id have to remember sir property got entail on itsince grandfather time ca can do a like with land remember that sir let dunsey have money why must let dunsey have money there lie at

shant brave go fetch dunsey isnt come back sir what did break own neck then said squire with disgust at idea that in case must not fulfil threat wasnt hurt believe for horse be found dead dunsey must have walked off daresay will see again by by dont know where be what must be letting have money for answer said squire attacking godfrey again since dunsey be not within reach well sir dont know said godfrey hesitatingly be feeble evasion godfrey be not fond of lying not being sufficiently aware that sort of duplicity can long flourish without help of vocal falsehood be quite unprepared with invented motif dont know tell what be sir youve be up to trick youve be bribing not to tell said squire with sudden acuteness startled godfrey who felt heart beat violently at nearness of father guess sudden alarm pushed on to take next stepa very slight impulse suffices for on downward road why sir said trying to speak with careless ease be little affair between dunsey matter to anybody else hardly worth while to pry into young men foolery have made difference to sir if id not have bad luck to lose wildfire must have paid money foolery time youd done with foolery id have know sir must have done with em said squire frowning casting angry glance at son going on be not what will find money for longer there grandfather have stable full o horse kept good house too in worse time by what can make out so might if hadnt four good for nothing fellow to hang on like horse leech ive be too good father to allthats what be will pull up sir godfrey be silent be not likely to be very penetrating in judgment have always have sense that father indulgence have not be kindness have have vague longing for discipline must have checked own errant weakness helped better will squire ate bread meat hastily took deep draught of ale then turned chair from table began to speak again itll be worse for knowyoud need try help keep thing together well sir ive often offered to take management of thing know youve taken ill always seemed to think wanted to push out of place know nothing o offering o taking ill said squire whose memory consisted in certain strong impression unmodified by

must perhaps have preferred in moment when be free from self consciousness certainly bloom on cheek be at highest point of contrast with surrounding drab when arrived at door of red house saw mr godfrey ca ready to lift from pillion wished sister priscilla have come up at same time behind servant for then must have contrived that mr godfrey must have lifted off priscilla first in meantime must have persuaded father to go round to horse block instead of alighting at door step be very painful when have made quite clear to young man that be determined not to marry however much might wish that must still continue to pay marked attention besides why didnt always show same attention if meant sincerely instead of being so strange a mr godfrey ca be sometimes behaving a if didnt want to

to father so that somehow under cover of noise seemed to find concealment for confusion neglect of suitably formal behaviour while be being lifted from pillion by strong arm seemed to find ridiculously small light there be best reason for hastening into house at once since snow be beginning to fall again threatening unpleasant journey for such guest a be still on road be small minority for already afternoon be beginning to decline there must not be too much time for lady who came from distance to attire in readiness for early tea be to inspirit for dance there be buzz of voice through house a miss nancy entered mingled with scrape of fiddle preluding in kitchen lammeters be guest whose arrival have evidently be thought of so much that have be watched for from window for mr kimble who did honour at red house on great occasion came forward to meet miss nancy in hall conduct up stair mr kimble be squire sister a well a doctor wifea double dignity with diameter be in direct proportion so that journey up stair being rather fatiguing to did not oppose miss nancy request to be allowed to find way alone to blue room where miss lammeters bandbox have be deposited on arrival

tightest skirt shortest waist gazed at by miss ladbrook of old pasture with shyness not unsustained by inward criticism partly miss ladbrook felt that own skirt must be regarded a unduly lax by miss gunns partly that be pity miss gunns did not show that judgment must show if be in place by stopping little on side of fashion on other hand mr ladbrook be standing in skull cap front with turban in hand curtsying smiling blandly saying after maam to lady in similar circumstance who have politely offered precedence at looking glass miss nancy have sooner made curtsy than elderly lady came forward whose full white muslin kerchief mob cap round curl of smooth grey hair be in daring contrast with puffed yellow satin top knotted cap of neighbour approached miss nancy with much primness said with slow treble suavity niece hope see well in health miss nancy kissed aunt cheek dutifully answered with same sort of amiable primness quite well thank aunt hope see same thank niece keep health for present how be brother in law dutiful question answer be continued until be ascertained in detail that lammeters be a well a usual osgoods likewise also that niece priscilla must certainly arrive

must put on when took off joseph miss nancy whose thought be always conducted with propriety moderation conspicuous in manner remarked to herself that miss gunns be rather hard featured than otherwise that such very low dress a wore might have be attributed to vanity if shoulder have be pretty being a be be not reasonable to suppose that showed neck from love of display rather from obligation not inconsistent with sense modesty felt convinced a opened box that must be aunt osgoods opinion for miss nancy mind resembled aunt to degree that everybody said be surprising considering kinship be on mr osgoods side though might not have supposed from formality of greeting there be devoted attachment mutual admiration between aunt niece even miss nancy refusal of cousin gilbert osgood on ground

for giving hint a arent enough in hurry to hear play bob called out to third long legged son who be at other end of room open door tell solomon to come in will give tune here bob obeyed solomon walked in fiddling a walked for must on account break off in middle of tune here solomon said squire with loud patronage round here man ah knew be flaxen headed ploughboy there finer tune solomon macey small hale old man with abundant crop of long white hair reaching nearly to shoulder advanced to indicated spot bowing reverently while fiddled a much a to say that respected company though respected key note more a soon a have repeated tune lowered fiddle bowed again to squire rector said hope see honour reverence well wishing health long life happy new year wishing same to mr lammeter sir to other gentleman madam young lass a solomon uttered last word bowed in direction solicitously lest must be wanting in due respect thereupon immediately began to prelude fell into tune knew must be taken a special compliment by mr lammeter thank ye solomon thank ye said mr lammeter when fiddle paused again thats over hill far away that be father used to say to whenever heard that tune ah lad come from over hill far away there many tune dont make head tail of that speaks to like blackbird whistle suppose name there deal in name of tune solomon be already impatient to prelude again presently broke with much spirit into sir roger de coverley at there be sound of chair pushed back laughing voice aye aye solomon know what mean said squire rising time to begin dance eh lead way then well follow so solomon holding white head on one side playing vigorously marched forward at head of gay procession into white parlour where mistletoe bough be hung multitudinous tallow candle made rather brilliant effect gleaming from among berried holly bough reflected in old fashioned oval mirror fastened in panel of white wainscot quaint procession old solomon in seedy clothes long white lock seemed to be luring decent company by magic scream of fiddleluring discreet matron in turban shaped cap nay mr crackenthorp summit of whose perpendicular feather be on level with squire shoulderluring fair lass complacently conscious of very short waist skirt blameless of front foldsluring burly father in large variegated waistcoat ruddy son for most part shy sheepish in short nether garment very long coat

have formed for dance squire led off with mr crackenthorp joining hand with rector mr osgood be a must bethat be what everybody have be used toand charter of raveloe seemed to be renewed by ceremony be not thought of a unbecoming levity for old middle aged people to dance little before sitting down to card rather a part of social duty for what be if not to be merry at appropriate time interchanging visit poultry with due frequency paying other old established compliment in sound traditional phrase passing well tried personal joke urging guest to eat drink too much out of hospitality eating drinking too much in neighbour house to show that liked cheer parson naturally set example in social duty for must not have be possible for raveloe mind without peculiar revelation to know that clergyman must be pale faced memento of solemnity instead of reasonably faulty man whose exclusive authority to read prayer preach to christen marry bury necessarily coexisted with right to sell ground to be buried in to take tithe in kind on last point of course there be little grumbling not to extent of irreligionnot of deeper significance than grumbling at rain be by mean accompanied with spirit of impious defiance with desire that prayer for fine weather might be read forthwith there be reason then why rector dancing must not be received a part of fitness of thing quite a much a squire why on other hand mr maceys official respect must restrain from subjecting parson performance to criticism with mind of extraordinary acuteness must necessarily contemplate doings of fallible fellow men squire pretty springe considering weight said mr macey stamp uncommon well mr lammeter beat em for shape see hold head like sodger isnt so cushiony a most o oldish gentlefolksthey run fat in general he got fine leg parson nimble enough hasnt got much of leg bit too thick downard knee might be bit nearer wiout damage might do worse might do worse though hasnt

rightfuller for theyd make fine match can find nothing against master godfreys shape macey ill bet penny mr macey screwed up mouth leaned head further on one side twirled thumb with presto movement a eye followed godfrey up dance at last summed up opinion pretty well downard bit too round shoulder blade a for coat a get from flitton tailor theyre poor cut to pay double money for ah mr macey be two folk said ben slightly indignant at carping when ive got pot o good ale like to swaller do inside good istead o smelling staring at to see if cant find faut wi brewing must like to pick out finer

for master godfrey doesnt look so down hearted to night see he for taking away to sit down now theyre at end o dance look like sweethearting doe reason why godfrey nancy have left dance be not so tender a ben imagined in close press of couple slight accident have happened to nancy dress while be short enough to show neat ankle in front be long enough behind to be caught under stately stamp of squire foot so a to rend certain stitch at waist cause much sisterly agitation in priscillas mind a well a serious concern in nancy one thought may be much occupied with love struggle hardly so a to be insensible to disorder in general framework of thing nancy have sooner completed duty in figure be dancing than said to godfrey with deep blush that must go sit down till priscilla must come to for sister have already exchanged short whisper open eyed glance full of meaning reason le urgent than must have prevailed on nancy to give godfrey opportunity of sitting apart with a for godfrey be feeling so happy oblivious under long charm of country dance with nancy that got rather bold on strength of confusion be capable of leading straight away without leave asked into adjoining small parlour where card table be set oh thank said nancy coldly a soon a perceived where be going not in there ill wait here till priscillas ready to come to im sorry to bring out of dance make troublesome why youll be more comfortable here by said artful godfrey ill leave here till sister can come spoke in indifferent tone be agreeable proposition just what nancy desired why then be little hurt that mr godfrey must make entered seated on chair against one of card table a stiffest most unapproachable position must choose thank sir said immediately neednt give more trouble im sorry youve have unlucky partner thats very ill natured of said godfrey standing by without sign of intended departure to be sorry youve danced with oh sir dont mean to say whats ill natured at said nancy looking distractingly prim pretty when gentleman have so many pleasure one dance can matter very little know that isnt true know one dance with matter more to than other pleasure in world be long long while since godfrey have said anything so direct a nancy be startled instinctive dignity repugnance to show of emotion made sit perfectly still only throw little more decision into voice a said indeed mr godfrey thats not known to have very good reason for thinking different if true dont wish to hear must never forgive then nancynever think well of let what must happenwould never think present made amends for past not if turned good fellow gave up everything didnt like godfrey be half conscious that sudden opportunity of speaking to nancy alone have driven beside blind feeling have got mastery of tongue nancy really felt much agitated by possibility godfreys word suggested very pressure of emotion that be in danger of finding too strong for roused power of self command must be glad to see good change in anybody mr godfrey answered with slightest discernible difference of tone ud be better if change be wanted youre very hard hearted nancy said godfrey pettishly might encourage to be better fellow im very miserablebut youve feeling think have least feeling act wrong to begin with said nancy sending out flash in spite of godfrey be delighted with little flash must have liked to go on make quarrel with nancy be so exasperatingly quiet firm be not indifferent to yet though entrance of priscilla bustling forward saying dear heart alive child let look at gown cut off godfreys hope of quarrel suppose must go now said to priscilla matter to whether go stay said that frank lady searching for something in pocket with preoccupied brow do want to go said godfrey looking at nancy who be now standing up by priscillas order a like said nancy trying to recover former coldness looking down carefully at hem of gown then like to stay said godfrey with reckless determination to get a much of joy a must to night think nothing of morrow chapter xii while godfrey ca be taking draught of forgetfulness from sweet presence of nancy willingly losing sense of hidden bond at other moment galled fretted so a to mingle irritation with very sunshine godfreys wife be walking with slow uncertain step through snow covered raveloe lane carrying child in arm journey on new year eve be premeditated act of vengeance have kept in heart ever since godfrey in fit of passion have told must sooner die than acknowledge a wife there must be great party at red house on new year eve knew husband must be smiling smiled upon hiding existence in darkest corner of heart must mar pleasure must go in dingy rag with faded face once a handsome a best with little child have father hair eye

to whom be enslaved body soul except in lingering mother tenderness that refused to give hungry child knew well yet in moment of wretched unbenumbed consciousness sense of want degradation transformed continually into bitterness towards godfrey be well off if have right must be well off too belief that repented marriage suffered from only aggravated vindictiveness just reproving thought come to too thickly even in purest air with best lesson of heaven earth how must white winged delicate messenger make way to molly poisoned chamber inhabited by higher memory than of barmaid paradise of pink ribbon gentleman joke have set out at early hour have lingered on road inclined by indolence to believe that if waited under warm shed snow must cease to fall have waited longer than knew now that found belated in snow hidden ruggedness of long lane even animation of vindictive purpose must not keep spirit from failing be seven oclock by time be not very far from raveloe be not familiar enough with monotonous lane to know how near be to journey end needed comfort knew one comforterthe familiar demon in bosom hesitated moment after drawing out black remnant before raised to lip in moment mother love pleaded for painful consciousness rather than oblivionpleaded to be left in aching weariness rather than to have encircling arm benumbed so that must not feel dear burden in moment molly have flung something away be not black remnantit be empty phial walked on again under breaking cloud from there came now then light of quickly veiled star for freezing wind have sprung up since snowing have ceased walked always more more drowsily clutched more more automatically sleeping child at bosom slowly demon be working will cold weariness be helper soon felt nothing supreme immediate longing curtained off futuritythe longing to lie down sleep have arrived at spot where footstep be no longer checked by hedgerow have wandered vaguely unable to distinguish object notwithstanding wide whiteness around growing starlight sank down against straggling furze bush easy pillow enough bed of snow too be soft did not feel that bed be cold did not heed whether child must wake cry for arm have not yet relaxed instinctive clutch little one slumbered on a gently a if have be rocked in lace trimmed cradle complete torpor came at last finger lost tension arm unbent then little head fell away from bosom blue eye opened wide on cold starlight at first there be little peevish cry of mammy effort to regain pillowing arm bosom mammy ear be deaf pillow seemed to be slipping away backward suddenly a child rolled downward on mother knee wet with snow eye be caught by bright glancing light on white ground with ready transition of infancy be immediately absorbed in watching bright living thing running towards yet never arriving that bright living thing must be caught in instant child have slipped on four held out one little hand to catch gleam gleam must not be caught in way now head be held up to see where cunning gleam came from came from very bright place little one rising on leg toddled through snow old grimy shawl in be wrapped trailing behind queer little bonnet dangling at backtoddled on to open door of silas marners cottage right up to warm hearth where there be bright fire of log stick have thoroughly warmed old sack silass greatcoat spread out on brick to dry little one accustomed to be left to for long hour without notice from mother squatted down on sack spread tiny hand towards blaze in perfect contentment gurgling making many inarticulate communication to cheerful fire like new hatched gosling beginning to find comfortable presently warmth have lulling effect little golden head sank down on old sack blue eye be veiled by delicate half transparent lid where be silas marner while strange visitor have come to hearth be in cottage did not see child during last few week since have lost money have contracted habit of opening door looking out from time to time a if thought that money might be somehow coming back to that trace news of might be mysteriously on road be caught by listening ear straining eye be chiefly at night when be not occupied in loom that fell into repetition of act for must have assigned definite purpose can hardly be understood except by who have undergone bewildering separation from supremely loved object in evening twilight later whenever night be not dark silas looked out on narrow prospect round stone pit listening gazing not with hope with mere yearning unrest morning have be told by of neighbour that be new year eve that must sit up hear old year rung out new rung in because be good luck might bring money back again be only friendly raveloe way of jesting with half crazy oddity of miser have perhaps helped to throw silas into more than usually excited state since on coming of twilight have opened door again again though only to shut immediately at seeing distance veiled by falling snow last time opened snow have ceased cloud be parting here there stood listened gazed for long whilethere be really something on road coming towards then caught sign of stillness wide trackless snow seemed to narrow solitude touched yearning with chill of despair went in again put right hand on latch of door to close itbut did not close be arrested a have be already since loss by invisible wand of catalepsy stood like graven image with wide sightless eye holding open door powerless to resist either good evil might enter there when marners sensibility returned continued action have be arrested closed door unaware of chasm in consciousness unaware of intermediate change except that light have grown dim that be chilled faint thought have be too long standing at door looking out turning towards hearth where two log have fallen apart sent forth only red uncertain glimmer seated on fireside chair be stooping to push log together when to blurred vision seemed a if there be gold on floor in front of hearth goldhis own goldbrought back to a mysteriously a have be taken away felt heart begin to beat violently for few moment be unable to stretch out hand grasp restored treasure heap of gold seemed to glow get larger beneath agitated gaze leaned forward at last stretched forth hand instead of hard coin with familiar resisting outline finger encountered soft warm curl in utter amazement silas fell on knee bent head low to examine marvel be sleeping childa round fair thing with soft yellow ring over head must be little sister come back to in dreamhis little sister whom have carried about in arm for year before died when be small boy without shoe stocking be first thought darted across silass blank wonderment be dream rose to foot again pushed log together throwing on dried leaf stick raised flame flame did not disperse visionit only lit up more distinctly little round form of child shabby clothing be very much like little sister silas sank into chair powerless under double presence of inexplicable surprise hurrying influx of memory how when have child come in without knowledge have never be beyond door along with question almost thrusting away there be vision of old home old street leading to lantern yardand within vision of thought have be present with in far off scene thought be strange to now like old friendship impossible to revive yet have dreamy feeling that child be somehow message come to from that far off life stirred fibre have never be moved in raveloeold quivering of tendernessold impression of awe at presentiment of power presiding over life for imagination have not yet extricated from sense of mystery in child sudden presence have formed no conjecture of ordinary natural mean by event must have be brought about there be cry on hearth child have awaked marner stooped to lift on knee clung round neck burst louder louder into mingling of inarticulate cry with mammy by little child express bewilderment of waking silas pressed to almost unconsciously uttered sound of hushing tenderness while bethought that of porridge have got cool by dying fire must do to feed child with if be only warmed up little have plenty to do through next hour porridge sweetened with dry brown sugar from old store have refrained from using for stopped cry of little one made lift blue eye with wide quiet gaze at silas a put spoon into mouth presently slipped from knee began to toddle about with pretty stagger that made silas jump up follow lest must fall against anything must hurt only fell in sitting posture on ground began to pull at boot looking up at with cry face a if boot hurt took on knee again be time before occurred to silass dull bachelor mind that wet boot be grievance pressing on warm ankle got off with difficulty baby be at once happily occupied with primary mystery of own toe inviting silas with much chuckling to consider mystery too wet boot have at last suggested to silas that child have be walking on snow roused from entire oblivion of ordinary mean by must have entered be brought into house under prompting of new idea without waiting to form conjecture raised child in arm went to door a soon a have opened there be cry of mammy again silas have not heard since child first hungry waking bending forward must just discern mark made by little foot on virgin snow followed track to furze bush little one cried again again stretching forward so a almost to escape from silass arm before be aware that there be something more than bush before himthat there be human body with head sunk low in furze half covered with shaken snow chapter xiii be after early supper time at red house entertainment be in stage when bashfulness have passed into easy jollity when gentleman conscious of unusual accomplishment must at length be prevailed on to dance hornpipe when squire preferred talking loudly scattering snuff patting visitor back to sitting longer at whist tablea choice exasperating to uncle kimble who being always volatile in sober business hour became intense bitter over card brandy shuffled before adversary deal with glare of suspicion turned up mean trump card with air of inexpressible disgust a if in world where such thing must happen one might a well enter on course of reckless profligacy when evening have advanced to pitch of freedom enjoyment be usual for servant heavy duty of supper being well over to get share of amusement by coming to look on at dancing so that back region of house be left in solitude there be two door by white parlour be entered from hall be standing open for sake of air lower one be crowded with servant villager only upper doorway be left free bob ca be figuring in hornpipe father very proud of lithe son whom repeatedly declared to be just like in young day in tone implied to be very highest stamp of juvenile merit be centre of group who have placed opposite performer not far from upper door godfrey be standing little way off not to admire brother dancing to keep sight of nancy who be seated in group near father stood aloof because wished to avoid suggesting a subject for squire fatherly joke in connection with matrimony miss

suspense about what be going on in cottage effect of alternative on future lot not quite unconscious of everything else deeper down half smothered by passionate desire dread there be sense that ought not to be waiting on alternative that ought to accept consequence of deed own miserable wife fulfil claim of helpless child have not moral courage enough to contemplate active renunciation of nancy a possible for have only conscience heart enough to make for ever uneasy under weakness forbade renunciation at moment mind leaped away from restraint toward sudden prospect of deliverance from long bondage be dead said voice predominated over other within if be may marry nancy then will be good fellow in future have secret childwill be taken care of somehow across vision came other

sat lulling child be perfectly quiet now not asleeponly soothed by sweet porridge warmth into wide gazing calm make older human being with inward turmoil feel certain awe in presence of little child such a feel before quiet majesty beauty in earth skybefore steady glowing planet full flowered eglantine bending tree over silent pathway wide open blue eye looked up at godfreys without uneasiness sign of recognition child must make visible audible claim on father father felt strange mixture of feeling conflict of regret joy that pulse of little heart have response for half jealous yearning in

in requisition scissors owing to especial warning of dolly have be kept carefully out of eppies reach click of have have peculiar attraction for ear watching result of click have derived philosophic lesson that same cause must produce same effect silas have seated in loom noise of weaving have begun have left scissors on ledge eppies arm be long enough to reach now like small mouse watching opportunity stole quietly from corner secured scissors toddled to bed again setting up back a mode of concealing fact have distinct intention a to use of scissors having cut linen strip in jagged

resolution for first time determined to try coal holea small closet near hearth naughty naughty eppie suddenly began holding on knee pointing to muddy foot clothesnaughty to cut with scissors run away eppie must go into coal hole for being naughty daddy must put in coal hole half expected that must be shock enough eppie must begin to cry instead of began to shake on knee a if proposition opened pleasing novelty seeing that must proceed to extremity put into coal hole held door closed with trembling sense that be using strong measure for moment there be silence then came little cry opy opy silas let out again saying now eppie ull never be naughty again else must go in coal holea black naughty place weaving must stand still long while morning for now eppie must be washed have clean clothes on be to be hoped that punishment must have lasting effect save time in futurethough perhaps must have be better if eppie have cried more in hour be clean again silas having turned back to see what must do with linen band threw down again with reflection that eppie must be good without fastening for rest of morning turned round again be going to place in little chair near loom when peeped

mr macey now very feeble old man of fourscore six never seen except in chimney corner sitting in sunshine at door sill be of opinion that when man have done what silas have done by orphan child be sign that money must come to light again leastwise that robber must be made to answer for itfor a mr macey observed of faculty be a strong a ever silas sat down now watched eppie with satisfied gaze a spread clean cloth set on potato pie warmed up slowly in safe sunday fashion by being put into dry pot over slowly dying fire a best substitute for oven for silas must not consent to have grate oven added to convenience loved old brick hearth a have loved brown potand be not there when have found eppie god of hearth exist for still let new faith be tolerant of fetishism lest bruise own root silas ate dinner more silently than usual soon laying down knife fork watching half abstractedly eppies play with snap cat by own dining be made rather lengthy business yet be sight might well arrest wandering thought eppie with rippling radiance of hair whiteness of rounded chin throat set off by dark blue cotton gown laughing merrily a kitten held on with four claw to one shoulder like design for jug handle while snap on right hand pus on other put up paw towards morsel held out of reach of bothsnap occasionally desisting in order to remonstrate with cat by cogent worrying growl on greediness futility of conduct till eppie relented caressed divided morsel between at last eppie glancing at clock checked play said o daddy youre wanting to go into sunshine to smoke pipe must clear away first so a house may be tidy when godmother come ill make hastei wont be long silas have taken to smoking pipe daily during last two year having be strongly urged to by sage of raveloe a practice

mistake have thrown that dark shadow over day of best year a grew more more easy to to open mind to dolly winthrop gradually communicated to must describe of early life communication be necessarily slow difficult process for silass meagre power of explanation be not aided by readiness of interpretation in dolly whose narrow outward experience gave key to strange custom made novelty source of wonder arrested at step of narrative be only by fragment at interval left dolly time to revolve what have heard till acquired familiarity for silas at last arrived at climax of sad storythe drawing of lot false testimony concerning have to be repeated in several interview under new question on part a to nature of plan for detecting guilty clearing innocent yourns same bible youre sure o that master marnerthe bible a brought wi from that countryits same a what theyve got at church what eppies learning to read in yes said silas bit same there drawing o lot in bible mind added in lower tone oh dear

little contemplative farming in leisurely walk nancy seldom accompanied for woman of generationunless like priscilla took to outdoor managementwere not given to much walking beyond own house garden finding sufficient exercise in domestic duty so when priscilla be not with usually sat with mants bible before after following text with eye for little while must gradually permit to wander a thought

element in nancy character have made habit with to scrutinize past feeling action with self questioning solicitude mind not being courted by great variety of subject filled vacant moment by living inwardly again again through remembered experience especially through fifteen year of married time in life significance have be doubled recalled small detail word tone look in critical scene have opened new epoch for by giving deeper insight into relation trial of life have called on for little effort of forbearance of painful adherence to imagined real dutyasking continually whether have be in respect blamable excessive rumination self questioning be perhaps morbid habit inevitable to mind of much moral sensibility when shut out from due share of outward activity of practical claim on affectionsinevitable to noble hearted childless woman when lot be narrow can do so littlehave done well be perpetually recurring thought there be voice calling away from soliloquy peremptory demand to divert energy from vain regret superfluous scruple there be one main thread of painful experience in nancy married life on hung certain deeply felt scene be oftenest revived in retrospect short dialogue with priscilla in garden have determined current of retrospect in frequent direction particular sunday afternoon first wandering of thought from text still attempted dutifully to follow with eye silent lip be into imaginary enlargement of defence have set up for husband against priscillas implied blame vindication of loved object be best balm affection can find for woundsa man must have so much on mind be belief by wife often support cheerful face under rough answer unfeeling word nancy deepest wound have come from perception that absence of child from hearth be dwelt on in husband

trivial fill mind of loving woman when expects to become mother be there not drawer filled with neat work of hand unworn untouched just a have arranged there fourteen year agojust for one little dress

reached point in meditationstrying with predetermined sympathy to see everything a godfrey saw itthere came renewal of self questioning have done everything in power to lighten godfreys privation have really be right in resistance have cost so much pain six year ago again four year agothe resistance to husband wish that must adopt child adoption be more remote from idea habit of time than of own still nancy have opinion on be a necessary to mind to have opinion on topic not exclusively masculine that have come under notice a for to have precisely marked place for article of personal property opinion be always principle to be unwaveringly acted on be firm not because of basis because held with tenacity inseparable from mental action on duty propriety of life from filial behaviour to

most unobtrusive way rooted in mind grew there a quietly a grass year ago know insisted on dressing like priscilla because be right for sister to dress alike because must do what be right if wore gown dyed with cheese colouring be trivial typical instance of mode in nancy life be regulated be one of rigid principle petty egoistic feeling have be ground of nancy difficult resistance to husband wish to adopt child because child of own have be denied be to try choose lot in spite of providence adopted child be convinced must never turn out well must be curse to who have wilfully rebelliously sought what be clear that for high reason be better without when saw thing be not meant to be said nancy be bounden duty to leave off so much a wishing for so far perhaps wisest of men must scarcely make more than verbal improvement in principle condition under held apparent that thing be not meant to be depended on more peculiar mode of thinking must have given up making purchase at particular place if on three successive time rain other cause of heaven sending have formed obstacle must have anticipated broken limb other heavy misfortune to one who persisted in spite of such indication why must think child must turn out ill said godfrey in remonstrance have thriven a well a child can do with weaver adopted there isnt pretty little girl anywhere else in parish one fitter for station must give where can be likelihood of being curse to anybody yes dear godfrey said nancy who be sitting with hand tightly clasped together with yearning regretful affection in eye child may not turn out ill with weaver then didnt go to seek a must be doing will be wrong feel sure will dont remember what that lady met at royston bath told about child sister adopted be only adopting ever heard of child be transported when be twenty three dear godfrey dont ask to do what know be wrong must never be happy again know very hard for youits easier for mebut will of providence might seem singular that nancywith religious theory pieced together out of narrow social tradition fragment of church doctrine imperfectly understood girlish reasoning on small experienceshould have arrived by at way of thinking so nearly akin to of many devout people whose belief be held in shape of system quite remote from knowledgesingular if did not know that human belief like other natural growth elude barrier of system godfrey have from first specified eppie then about twelve year old a child suitable for to adopt have never occurred to that silas must rather part with life than with eppie surely weaver must wish best to child have taken so much trouble with must be glad that such good fortune must happen to must always be very grateful to must be well provided for to end of lifeprovided for a excellent part have done by child deserved be not appropriate thing for people in higher station to take charge off hand of man in lower seemed eminently appropriate thing to godfrey for reason be known only to by common fallacy imagined measure must be easy because have private motif for desiring be rather coarse mode of estimating silass relation to eppie must remember that many of impression godfrey be likely to gather concerning labouring people around must favour idea deep affection can hardly go along with callous palm scant mean have not have opportunity even if have have power of entering intimately into be exceptional in weaver experience be only want of adequate knowledge must have made possible for godfrey deliberately to entertain unfeeling project natural kindness have outlived that blighting time of cruel wish nancy praise of a husband be not founded entirely on wilful illusion be right said to herself when have recalled scene of discussioni feel be right to say nay though hurt more than anything how good godfrey have be about many men must have be very angry with for standing out against wish might have thrown out that theyd have ill luck in marrying have never be man to say unkind word only what cant hide everything seems so blank to know landwhat difference ud make to when go to see after thing if hed child growing up that be doing for wont murmur perhaps if hed married woman whod have have child shed have vexed in other way possibility be nancy chief comfort to give greater strength laboured to make impossible that other wife must have have more perfect tenderness have be forced to vex by one denial godfrey be not insensible to loving effort did nancy injustice a to motif of obstinacy be impossible to have lived with fifteen year not be aware that unselfish clinging to right sincerity clear a flower born dew be main characteristic indeed godfrey felt so strongly that own more wavering nature too averse to facing difficulty to be unvaryingly simple truthful be kept in certain awe of gentle wife who watched look with yearning to obey seemed to impossible that must ever confess to truth about eppie must never recover from repulsion story of earlier marriage must create told to now after long concealment child too thought must become object of repulsion very sight of must be painful shock to nancy mingled pride ignorance of world evil might even be too much for delicate frame since have married with secret on heart must keep there to last whatever else did must not make irreparable breach between long loved wife meanwhile why must not make up mind to absence of child from hearth brightened by such wife why did mind fly uneasily to void a if be sole reason why life be not thoroughly joyous to suppose be way with men woman who reach middle age without clear perception that life never can be thoroughly joyous under vague dullness of grey hour dissatisfaction seek definite object find in privation of untried good dissatisfaction seated musingly on childless hearth think with envy of father whose return be greeted by young voicesseated at meal where little head rise one above like nursery plant see black care hovering behind one of think impulse by men abandon freedom seek for tie be surely nothing brief madness in godfreys case there be further reason why thought must be continually solicited by one point in lot conscience never thoroughly easy about eppie now gave childless home aspect of retribution a time passed on under nancy refusal to adopt retrieval of error became more more difficult on sunday afternoon be already four year since there have be allusion to subject between nancy supposed that be for ever buried wonder if hell mind le more a get older thought im afraid more aged people feel miss of child must father do without priscilla if die godfrey will be very lonelynot holding together with brother much wont be over anxious trying to make thing out beforehand must do best for present with last thought nancy roused from reverie turned eye again towards forsaken page have be forsaken longer than imagined for be presently surprised by appearance of servant with tea thing be in fact little before usual time for tea jane have reason be master come into yard jane no m isnt said jane with slight emphasis of however mistress took notice dont know whether youve

anything for tree hope nobody hurt thats oh daresay there nothing much matter said perhaps mr snells bull got out again a did before wish maynt gore anybody then thats said jane not altogether despising hypothesis covered few imaginary calamity that girl be always terrifying thought nancy wish godfrey must come in went to front window looked a far a must see along road with uneasiness felt to be childish for there be now such sign of excitement a jane have spoken of godfrey must not be likely to return by village road by field continued to stand however looking at placid churchyard with long shadow of gravestone across bright green hillock at glowing autumn colour of rectory tree beyond before such calm external beauty presence of vague fear be more distinctly feltlike raven flapping slow wing across sunny air nancy wished more more that godfrey must come in chapter one opened door at other end of room nancy felt that be husband turned from window with gladness in eye for wife chief dread be stilled dear im so thankful youre come said going towards began to get paused abruptly for godfrey be laying down hat with trembling hand turned towards with pale face strange unanswering glance a if saw indeed saw a part of scene invisible to herself laid hand on arm not daring to speak again left touch unnoticed threw into chair jane be already at door with hissing urn tell to keep away will said godfrey when door be closed again exerted to speak more distinctly sit down nancythere said pointing to chair opposite came back a soon a must to hinder anybodys telling

stone there watch seal there gold handled hunting whip with name on took away without knowing day went hunting on wildfire last time be seen godfrey paused be not so easy to say what came next do think drowned said nancy almost wondering that husband must be so deeply shaken by what have happened year ago to unloved brother of whom worse thing have be augured no fell in said godfrey in low distinct voice a if felt deep meaning in fact presently added dunstan be man robbed silas marner blood rushed to nancy face neck at surprise shame for have be bred up to regard even distant kinship with crime a dishonour o godfrey said with compassion in tone for have immediately reflected that dishonour must be felt still more keenly by husband there be money in pit continuedall weaver money everythings be gathered up theyre taking skeleton to rainbow came back to tell there be hindering must know be silent looking on ground for two long minute nancy must have said word of comfort under disgrace refrained from instinctive sense that there be something behindthat godfrey have something else to tell presently lifted eye to face kept fixed on a said everything come to light nancy sooner later when god almighty will secret be found out ive lived with secret on mind ill keep from no longer wouldnt have know by somebody else not by mei wouldnt have find out after im dead ill tell now be

from yousomething ought to have told that woman marner found dead in snoweppies wretched womanwas wife eppie be child paused dreading effect of confession nancy sat quite still only that eye dropped ceased to meet be pale quiet a meditative statue clasping hand on lap youll never think same of again said godfrey after little while with tremor in voice be silent oughtnt to have left child unowned oughtnt to have kept from couldnt bear to give up nancy be led away into marrying heri suffered for still nancy be silent looking down almost expected that must presently get up say must go to father how must have mercy for fault must seem so black to with simple severe notion at last lifted up eye to again spoke there be indignation in voiceonly deep regret godfrey if have told six year ago must have done of duty by child do think id have refused to take in if id known be yours at moment godfrey felt bitterness of error be not simply futile have defeated own end have not measured wife with

little baby dying life might have be more like what used to think ud be tear fell nancy ceased to speak wouldnt have married then nancy if id told said godfrey urged in bitterness of self reproach to prove to that conduct have not be utter folly may think must now wouldnt then with pride father youd have hated having anything to do with after talk thered have be cant say what must have done about

have naturally lingered behind one else to leave alone with child excitement have not passed away have only reached that stage when keenness of susceptibility make external stimulus intolerablewhen there be sense of weariness rather intensity of inward life under sleep be impossibility one who have watched such moment in other men remembers brightness of eye strange definiteness come over coarse feature from transient influence be a if new fineness of ear for spiritual voice have sent wonder working vibration through heavy mortal frameas if beauty born of murmuring sound have passed into face of listener silass face showed that sort of transfiguration a sat in arm chair looked at eppie have drawn own chair towards knee leaned forward holding hand while looked up at on table near lit by candle lay recovered goldthe old long loved gold ranged in orderly heap a silas used to range in day when be only joy have be telling how used to count night how soul be utterly desolate till be sent
