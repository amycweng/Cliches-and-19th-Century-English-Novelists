looking satellite be spotty globe a milton have irreverently called moon on contrary head face must look more sleek healthy expressionwhich be chiefly confined to pair of round ruddy cheek slight knot interruption forming nose eye being scarcely worth mentionwas one of jolly contentment only tempered by sense of personal dignity usually made felt in attitude bearing sense of dignity must hardly be considered excessive in man who have be butler to family for fifteen year who in present high position be necessarily very much in contact with inferior how to reconcile dignity with satisfaction of curiosity by walking towards green be problem mr casson have be revolving in mind for last five minute when have partly solved by taking hand out of pocket thrusting into armhole of waistcoat by

contrast presented by group of villager with knot of methodist near maple perhaps yet more curiosity to see young female preacher proved too much for anxiety to get to end of journey paused green lay at extremity of village from road branched off in two direction one leading farther up hill by church other winding gently down towards valley on side of green led towards church broken line of thatched cottage be continued nearly to churchyard gate on opposite northwestern side there be nothing to obstruct view of gently swelling meadow wooded valley dark mass of distant hill rich undulating district of loamshire to hayslope belonged lie close to grim outskirt of stonyshire overlooked by barren hill a pretty blooming sister may sometimes be seen linked in arm of rugged tall swarthy brother in two three hour ride traveller might exchange bleak treeless region intersected by line of cold grey stone for one where road wound under shelter of wood up swelling hill muffled with hedgerow long meadow grass thick corn where at turn came upon fine old country seat nestled in valley crowning slope homestead with long length of barn cluster of golden rick grey steeple looking out from pretty confusion of tree thatch dark red tile be just such picture a last that hayslope church have made to traveller a began to mount gentle slope leading to pleasant upland now from station near green have before in one view nearly other typical feature of pleasant land high up against horizon be huge conical mass of hill like giant mound intended to fortify region of corn grass against keen hungry wind of north not distant enough to be clothed in purple mystery with sombre greenish side visibly specked with sheep whose motion be only revealed by memory not detected by sight wooed from day to day by changing hour responding with change in themselvesleft for ever grim sullen after flush of morning winged gleam of april noonday parting crimson glory of ripening summer sun directly below eye rested on more advanced line of hanging wood divided by bright patch of pasture furrowed crop not yet deepened into uniform leafy curtain of high summer still showing warm tint of young oak tender green of ash lime then came valley where wood grew thicker a if have rolled down hurried together from patch left smooth on slope that might take better care of tall mansion lifted parapet sent faint blue summer smoke among doubtless there be large sweep of park broad glassy pool in front of mansion swelling slope of meadow must not let traveller see from village green saw instead foreground be just a lovelythe level sunlight lying like transparent gold among gently curving stem of feathered grass tall red sorrel white ambels of hemlock lining bushy hedgerow be that moment in summer when sound of scythe being whetted make cast more lingering look at flower sprinkled tress of meadow might have seen other beauty in landscape if have turned little in saddle looked eastward beyond jonathan burges pasture woodyard towards green corn field walnut tree of hall farm apparently there be more interest for in living group close at hand generation in village be there from old feyther taft in brown worsted night cap who be bent nearly double seemed tough enough to keep on leg long while leaning on short stick down to baby with little round head lolling forward in quilted linen cap now then there be new arrival perhaps slouching labourer who having eaten supper came out to look at unusual scene with slow bovine gaze willing to hear what one have to say in explanation of by mean excited enough to ask question took care not to join methodist on green identify in way with expectant audience for there be not one of must not have disclaimed imputation of

farther off when interest of dialogue culminates so group in vicinity of blacksmith door be by mean close one formed screen in front of chad cranage blacksmith who stood with black brawny arm folded leaning against door post occasionally sending forth bellowing laugh at own joke giving marked preference over sarcasm of wiry ben who have renounced pleasure of holly bush for sake of seeing life under new form style of wit be treated with equal contempt by mr joshua rann mr ranns leathern apron subdued griminess can leave one in doubt that be village shoemaker thrusting out of chin stomach twirling of thumb be more subtle indication intended to prepare unwary stranger for discovery that be in presence of parish clerk old joshway a be irreverently called by neighbour be in state of simmering indignation have not yet opened lip except to say in resounding bass undertone like tuning of violoncello sehon king of amorites for mercy endureth for ever og king of basan for mercy endureth for evera quotation may seem to have slight bearing on present occasion a with other anomaly adequate knowledge will show to be natural sequence mr rann be inwardly maintaining dignity of church in face of scandalous irruption of methodism a dignity be bound up with own sonorous utterance of response argument naturally suggested quotation from psalm have read last sunday afternoon stronger curiosity of woman have drawn quite to edge of green where must examine more closely quakerlike costume odd deportment of female methodist underneath maple there be small cart have be brought

wealth grandeur immeasurablethose be warm ray set poor hettys heart vibrating playing little foolish tune over over again hear that memnons statue gave forth melody at under rushing of mightiest wind in response to other influence divine human than certain short lived sunbeam of morning must learn to accommodate ourselves to discovery that of cunningly fashioned instrument called human soul have only very limited range of music will not vibrate in least under touch fill others with tremulous rapture quivering agony hetty be quite used to thought people liked to look at be not blind to fact that young luke britton of broxton came to hayslope church on sunday afternoon on purpose that might see that must have made much more decided advance if uncle poyser thinking lightly of young man whose father land be so foul a old luke brittons have not forbidden aunt to encourage by civility be aware too that mr craig gardener at chase be over head ear in love with have lately made unmistakable avowal in luscious strawberry hyperbolical pea knew still better that adam upright clever brave adam bedewho carried such authority with people round about whom uncle be always delighted to see of evening saying that adam knew fine sight more o natur o thing than a thought bettersshe knew that adam who be often rather stern to other people not much given to run after lass must be made to turn pale red day by word look from hettys sphere of comparison be not large couldnt help perceiving that adam be something like man always knew what to say about thing must tell uncle how to prop hovel have mended churn in time knew with only looking at value of chestnut tree be blown down why damp came in wall what must do to stop rat wrote beautiful hand that must read off must do figure in heada degree of accomplishment totally unknown among richest farmer of countryside not at like slouching luke britton who when once walked with way from broxton to hayslope have only broken silence to remark that grey goose have begun to lay a for mr craig gardener be sensible man enough to be sure be knock kneed have queer sort of sing song in talk moreover on most charitable supposition must be far on way to forty hetty be quite certain uncle wanted to encourage adam must be pleased for to marry for be time when there be rigid demarcation of rank between farmer respectable artisan on home hearth a well a in public house might be seen taking jug of ale together farmer having latent sense of capital of weight in parish affair sustained under conspicuous inferiority in conversation martin poyser be not frequenter of public house liked friendly chat over own home brewed though be pleasant to lay down law to stupid neighbour who have notion how to make best of farm be also agreeable variety to learn something from clever fellow like adam bede accordingly for last three yearsever since have superintended building of new barnadam have always be made welcome at hall farm especially of winter evening when whole family in patriarchal fashion master mistress child servant be assembled in glorious kitchen at well graduated distance from blazing fire for last two year at least hetty have be in habit of hearing uncle say adam bede may be working for wage now hell be master man day a sure a sit in chair mester burge be in right ont to want to go partner marry daughter if true what say woman a marries ull have good take bet lady day michaelmas remark mr poyser always followed up with cordial assent ah must say very fine having ready made rich man mayhappen hell be ready made fool use filling pocket full o money if youve got hole in corner itll do no good to sit in spring cart o own if youve got soft to drive hell soon turn over into ditch allays said id never marry man a have got no brain for wheres use of woman having brain of own if shes tackled to geck a everybodys laughing at might a well dress fine to sit backards on donkey expression though figurative sufficiently indicated bent of mr poysers mind with regard to adam though husband might have viewed subject differently if hetty have be daughter of own be clear that must have welcomed match with adam for penniless niece for what must hetty have be servant elsewhere if uncle have not taken in brought up a domestic help to aunt whose health since birth of totty have not be equal to more positive labour than superintendence of servant child hetty have never given adam steady encouragement even in moment when be most thoroughly conscious of superiority to other admirer have never brought to think of accepting liked to feel that strong skilful keen eyed man be in power must have be indignant if have shown least sign of slipping from under yoke of coquettish tyranny attaching to gentle mary burge who must have be grateful enough for most trifling notice from mary burge indeed such sallow faced girl if put on bit of pink ribbon looked a yellow a crow flower hair be a straight a hank of cotton always when adam stayed away for several week from hall farm otherwise made show of resistance to passion a foolish one hetty took care to entice back into net by little air of meekness timidity a if be in trouble at neglect a to marrying adam be very different affair there be nothing in world to tempt to do that cheek never grew shade deeper when name be mentioned felt thrill when saw passing along causeway by window advancing towards unexpectedly in footpath across meadow felt nothing when eye rested on cold triumph of knowing that loved must not care to look at mary burge must no more stir in emotion make sweet intoxication of young love than mere picture of sun can stir spring sap in subtle fibre of plant saw a wasa poor man with old parent to keep who must not be able for long while to come to give even such luxury a shared in uncle house hettys dream be of luxury to sit in carpeted parlour always wear white stocking to have large beautiful ear ring such a be fashion to have nottingham lace round top of gown something to make handkerchief smell nice like miss lydia donnithornes when drew out at church not to be obliged to get up early be scolded by anybody thought if adam have be rich must have given thing loved well enough to marry for last few week new influence have come over hettyvague atmospheric shaping into self confessed hope prospect producing pleasant narcotic effect making tread ground go about work in sort of dream unconscious of weight effort showing thing through soft liquid veil a if be living not in solid world of brick stone in beatified world such a sun light up for in water hetty have become aware that mr arthur donnithorne must take good deal of trouble for chance of seeing that always placed at church so a to have fullest view of sitting standing that be constantly finding reason for calling at hall farm always must contrive to say something for sake of making speak to look at poor child more conceived at present idea that young squire must ever be lover than baker pretty daughter in crowd whom young emperor distinguishes by imperial admiring smile conceives that will be made empress baker daughter go home dream of handsome young emperor perhaps weighs flour amiss while be thinking what heavenly lot must be to have for husband so poor hetty have got face presence haunting waking sleeping dream bright soft glance have penetrated suffused life with strange happy languor eye shed glance be really not so fine a adam sometimes looked at with sad beseeching tenderness have found ready medium in hettys little silly imagination whereas adam must get entrance through atmosphere for three week at least inward life have consisted of little else than living through in memory look word arthur have directed towards herof little else than recalling sensation with heard voice outside house saw enter became conscious that eye be fixed on then became conscious that tall figure looking down on with eye seemed to touch be coming nearer in clothes of beautiful texture with odour like of flower garden borne on evening breeze foolish thought happened must remember nearly sixty year ago hetty be quite uneducateda simple farmer girl to whom gentleman with white hand be dazzling a olympian god until to day have never looked farther into future than to next time captain donnithorne must come to farm next sunday when must see at church now thought perhaps must try to meet when went to chase to morrowand if must speak to walk little way when nobody be by have never happened yet now imagination instead of retracing past be busy fashioning what must happen to morrowwhereabout in chase must see coming towards how must put new rose coloured ribbon on have never seen what must say to to make return glancea glance must be living through in memory over over again rest of day in state of mind how must hetty give feeling to adam trouble think much about poor old thias being drowned young soul in such pleasant delirium a hers be a unsympathetic a butterfly sipping nectar be isolated from appeal by barrier of dreamsby invisible look impalpable arm while hettys hand be busy packing up butter head filled with picture of morrow arthur donnithorne riding by mr irwines side towards valley of willow brook have also certain indistinct anticipation running a undercurrent in mind while be listening to mr irwines account of dinahindistinct yet strong enough to make feel rather conscious when mr irwine suddenly said what fascinated so in mr poysers dairy arthur have become amateur of damp quarry skimming dish arthur knew rector too well to suppose that clever invention must be of use so said with accustomed frankness went to look at pretty butter maker hetty sorrel shes perfect hebe if be artist must paint amazing what pretty girl one see among farmer daughter when men be such clown common round red face one see sometimes in menall cheek feature like martin poyserscomes out in woman of family a most charming phiz imaginable well have objection to contemplating hetty in artistic light must not have feeding vanity filling little noddle with notion shes great beauty attractive to fine gentleman will spoil for poor man wifehonest craigs for example whom have seen bestowing soft glance on little pus seems already to have air enough to make husband a miserable a law of nature for quiet man to be when marries beauty apropos of marrying hope friend adam will get settled now poor old man gone will only have mother to keep in future ive notion there kindness between that nice modest girl mary burge from something fell from old jonathan one day when be talking to when mentioned subject to adam looked uneasy turned conversation suppose love making doesnt run smooth perhaps adam hang back till he in better position have independence of spirit enough for two menrather excess of pride if anything must be capital match for adam must slip into old burges shoe make fine thing of building business ill answer for must like to see well settled in parish must be ready then to act a grand vizier when wanted one must plan end of repair improvement together ive never seen girl though thinkat least ive never looked at look at next sunday at churchshe sits with father on left of reading desk neednt look quite so much at hetty sorrel then when ive made up mind that cant afford to buy tempting dog take notice of because if took strong fancy to looked lovingly at struggle between arithmetic inclination might become unpleasantly severe pique on wisdom there arthur

of mode in must best be touched softened into willingness to receive word of spiritual consolation warning a dinah expressed be never left to be always given when to keep silence when to speak do not agree to call rapid thought noble impulse by name of inspiration after subtlest analysis of mental process must still say a dinah did that highest thought best deed be given to so there be earnest prayerthere be faith love hope pouring forth that evening in little kitchen poor aged fretful lisbeth without grasping distinct idea without going through course of religious emotion felt vague sense of goodness love of something right lying underneath beyond sorrowing life couldnt understand sorrow for moment under subduing influence of dinahs spirit felt that must be patient still chapter xi in cottage be half past four next morning when dinah tired of lying awake listening to bird watching growing light through little window in garret roof rose began to dress very quietly lest must disturb lisbeth already one else be astir in house have gone downstairs preceded by gyp dog pattering step be sure sign that be adam who went down dinah be not aware of thought be more likely to be seth for have told how adam have stayed up working night before seth however have only just awakened at sound of opening door exciting influence of previous day heightened at last by dinahs unexpected presence have not be counteracted by bodily weariness for have not done ordinary amount of hard work so when went to bed be not till have tired with hour of tossing wakefulness that drowsiness came led on heavier morning sleep than be usual with adam have be refreshed by long rest with habitual impatience of mere passivity be eager to begin new day subdue sadness by strong will strong arm white mist lay in valley be going to be bright warm day must start to work again when have have breakfast there nothing whats bearable a long a man can work said to natur o thing doesnt change though seems a if one own life be nothing change square o four be sixteen must lengthen lever in proportion to weight be a true when man miserable a when he happy best o working be give grip hold o thing outside own

ear detected light rapid foot on stairscertainly not mother have be in bed asleep when dinah have come in in evening now wondered whose step must be foolish thought came moved strangely a if must be hetty be last person likely to be in house yet felt reluctant to go look have clear proof that be one else stood leaning on plank have taken hold of listening to sound imagination interpreted for so pleasantly that keen strong face became suffused with timid tenderness light footstep moved about kitchen followed by sound of sweeping brush hardly making so much noise a lightest breeze chase autumn leaf along dusty path adam imagination saw dimpled face with dark bright eye roguish smile looking backward at brush rounded figure just leaning little to clasp handle very foolish thoughtit must not be hetty only way of dismissing such nonsense from head be to go see who be for fancy only got nearer nearer to belief while stood there listening loosed plank went to kitchen door how do do adam bede said dinah in calm treble pausing from sweeping fixing mild grave eye upon trust feel rested strengthened again to bear burden heat of day be like dreaming of sunshine awaking in moonlight adam have seen dinah several time always at hall farm where be not very vividly conscious of woman presence except hettys have only in last day two begun to suspect that seth be in love with so that attention have not hitherto be drawn towards for brother sake now slim figure plain black gown pale serene face impressed with force belongs to reality contrasted with preoccupying fancy for first moment two made answer looked at with concentrated examining glance man give to object in have suddenly begun to be interested dinah for first time in life felt painful self consciousness there be something in dark penetrating glance of strong man so different from mildness timidity of brother seth faint blush came deepened a wondered at blush recalled adam from forgetfulness be quite taken by surprise be very good of to come see mother in trouble said in gentle grateful tone for quick mind told at once how came to be there hope mother be thankful to have added wondering rather anxiously what have be dinahs reception yes said dinah resuming work seemed greatly comforted after while shes have good deal of rest in night by time be fast asleep when left who be took news to hall farm said adam thought reverting to one there wondered whether have felt anything about be mr irwine clergyman told aunt be grieved for mother when heard wanted to come so be uncle im sure now he heard be gone out to rosseter yesterday theyll look for there a soon a youve got time to go for there nobody round that hearth whats glad to see dinah with sympathetic divination knew quite well that adam be longing to hear if hetty have said anything about trouble be too rigorously truthful for benevolent invention have contrived to say something in hetty be tacitly included love have way of cheating consciously like child who play at solitary hide seek be pleased with assurance that while disbelief adam liked what dinah have said so much that mind be directly full of next visit must pay to hall farm when hetty must perhaps behave more kindly to than have ever done before wont be there longer said to dinah go back to snowfield on saturday will have to set out to treddleston early to be in time for oakbourne carrier so must go back to farm to night may have last day with aunt child can stay here to day if mother must like heart seemed inclined towards last night ah then shes sure to want to day if mother take to people at beginning shes sure to get fond of em shes strange way of not liking young woman though to be sure adam went on smiling not liking other young woman be reason why shouldnt like hitherto gyp have be assisting at conversation in motionless silence seated on haunch alternately looking up in master face to watch expression observing dinahs movement about kitchen kind smile with adam uttered last word be apparently decisive with gyp of light in stranger be to be regarded a turned round after putting aside sweeping brush trotted towards put up muzzle against hand in friendly way see gyp bid welcome said adam he very slow to welcome stranger poor dog said dinah patting rough grey coat ive strange feeling about dumb thing a if wanted to speak be trouble to em because couldnt cant help being sorry for dog always though perhaps there need may well have more in than know how to make understand for cant say half what feel with word seth came down now be pleased to find adam talking with dinah wanted adam to know how much better be than other woman after few word of greeting adam drew into workshop to consult about coffin dinah went on with cleaning by six oclock be at breakfast with lisbeth in kitchen a clean a must have made window door be open morning air brought with mingled scent of southernwood thyme sweet briar from patch of garden by side of cottage dinah did not sit down at first moved about serving others with warm porridge toasted oat cake have got ready in usual way for have asked seth to tell just what mother gave for breakfast

wood same thursday morning a arthur donnithorne be moving about in dressing room seeing well looking british person reflected in old fashioned mirror stared at from dingy olive green piece of tapestry by pharaoh daughter maiden who ought to have be minding infant moses be holding discussion with by time valet be tying black silk sling over shoulder have issued in distinct practical resolution mean to go to eagledale fish for week so said aloud will take with pym set off morning so be ready by half past eleven low whistle have assisted in arriving at resolution here broke out into loudest ringing tenor corridor a hurried along echoed to favourite song from beggar opera when heart of man be oppressed with care not heroic strain nevertheless arthur felt very heroic a strode towards stable to give order about horse own approbation be necessary to be not approbation to be enjoyed quite gratuitously must be won by fair amount of merit have never yet forfeited that approbation have considerable reliance on own virtue young man must confess fault more candidly candour be one of favourite virtue how can man candour be seen in lustre unless have few failing to talk of have agreeable confidence that fault be of generous kindimpetuous warm blooded leonine never crawling crafty reptilian be not possible for arthur donnithorne to do anything mean dastardly cruel im devil of fellow for getting into hobble always take care load will fall on own shoulder unhappily there be inherent poetical justice in hobble will sometimes obstinately refuse to inflict worst consequence on prime offender in spite of loudly expressed wish be entirely owing to deficiency in scheme of thing arthur have ever brought one into trouble besides be nothing if not good natured picture of future when must come into estate be made up of prosperous contented tenantry adoring landlord who must be model of english gentlemanmansion in first rate order elegance high tastejolly housekeeping finest stud in loamshirepurse open to public objectsin short everything a different a possible from what be now associated with name of donnithorne one of first good action must perform in future must be to increase irwines income for vicarage of hayslope so that might keep carriage for mother sister hearty affection for rector dated from age of frock trouser be affection partly filial partly fraternalfraternal enough to make like irwines company better than of most younger men filial enough to make shrink strongly from incurring irwines disapprobation perceive that arthur donnithorne be good fellowall college friend thought such couldnt bear to see one uncomfortable must have be sorry even in angriest mood for harm to happen to grandfather aunt lydia have benefit of soft heartedness bore towards whole sex whether must have self mastery enough to be always a harmless purely beneficent a good nature led to desire be question that one have yet decided against be twenty one remember dont inquire too closely into character in case of handsome generous young fellow who will have property enough to support numerous peccadilloeswho if must unfortunately break man leg in rash driving will be able to pension handsomely if must happen to spoil woman existence for will make up to with expensive bon bons packed up directed by own hand must be ridiculous to be prying analytic in such case a if one be inquiring into character of confidential clerk use round general gentlemanly epithet about young man of birth fortune lady with fine intuition be distinguishing attribute of sex see at once that be nice chance be that will go through life without scandalizing one seaworthy vessel that one must refuse to insure ship certainly be liable to casualty sometimes make terribly evident flaw in construction must never have be discoverable in smooth water many good fellow through disastrous combination of circumstance have undergone like betrayal have fair ground for entertaining unfavourable augury concerning arthur donnithorne who morning prof capable of prudent resolution founded on conscience one thing be clear nature have taken care that will never go far astray with perfect comfort satisfaction to will never get beyond border land of sin where will be perpetually harassed by assault from other side of boundary will never be courtier of vice wear order in button hole be about ten oclock sun be shining brilliantly everything be looking lovelier for yesterday rain be pleasant thing on morning to walk along well rolled gravel on one way to stable meditating excursion scent of stable in natural state of thing ought to be among soothing influence of man life always brought with irritation to arthur there be having own way in stable everything be managed in stingiest fashion grandfather persisted in retaining a head groom old dolt whom sort of lever must move out of old habit who be allowed to hire succession of raw loamshire lad a subordinate one of whom have lately tested new pair of shear by clipping oblong patch on arthur bay mare state of thing be naturally embittering one can put up with annoyance in house to have stable made scene of vexation disgust be point beyond what human flesh blood can be expected to endure long together without danger of misanthropy old john wooden deep wrinkled face be first object that met arthur eye a entered stable yard quite poisoned for bark of two bloodhound kept watch there must never speak quite patiently to old blockhead must have meg saddled for brought to door at half past eleven will want rattler saddled for pym at same time do hear yes hear hear capn said old john very deliberately following young master into stable john considered young master a natural enemy of old servant young people in general a poor contrivance for carrying on world arthur went in for sake of patting meg declining a far a possible to see anything in stable lest must lose temper before breakfast pretty creature be in one of inner stable turned mild head a master came beside little trot tiny spaniel inseparable companion in stable be comfortably curled up on back well meg pretty girl said arthur patting neck well have glorious canter morning nay honour donna see a can be said john not be why not why shes got lamed lamed confound what do mean why th lad took too close to dalton ho one on em flung out at shes got shank bruised o near foreleg judicious historian abstains from narrating precisely what ensued understand that there be great deal of strong language mingled with soothing who ho while leg be examined that john stood by with quite a much emotion a if have be cunningly carved crab tree walking stick that arthur donnithorne presently repassed iron gate of pleasure ground without singing a went considered thoroughly disappointed annoyed there be not mount in stable for servant besides meg rattler be vexatious just when wanted to get out of way for week two seemed culpable in providence to allow combination of circumstance to be shut up at chase with broken arm when other fellow in regiment be enjoying at windsorshut up with grandfather who have same sort of affection for a for parchment deed to be disgusted at turn with management of house estate in such circumstance man necessarily get in ill humour work off irritation by excess other salkeld must have drunk bottle of port day muttered to im not well seasoned enough for well since cant go to eagledale ill have gallop on rattler to norburne morning lunch with gawaine behind explicit resolution there lay implicit one if lunched with gawaine lingered chatting must not reach chase again till nearly five when hetty must be safe out of sight in housekeeper room when set out to go home must be lazy time after dinner so must keep out of way altogether there really must have be harm in being kind to little thing be worth dancing with dozen ballroom belle only to look at hetty for hour perhaps have better not take more notice of might put notion into head a irwine have hinted though arthur for part thought girl be not by mean so soft easily bruised indeed have generally found twice a cool cunning a be a for real harm in hettys case be out of question arthur donnithorne accepted own bond for with perfect confidence so twelve oclock sun saw galloping towards norburne by good fortune halsell common lay in road gave fine leap for rattler nothing like taking few bush ditch for exorcising demon be really astonishing that centaur with immense advantage in way have left so bad reputation in history after will perhaps be surprised to hear that although gawaine be at home hand of dial in courtyard have scarcely cleared last stroke of three when arthur returned through entrance gate got down from panting rattler went into house to take hasty luncheon believe there have be men since day who have ridden long way to avoid rencontre then galloped hastily back lest must miss be favourite stratagem of passion to sham retreat to turn sharp round upon at moment have made up mind that day be own capns be ridin devil own pace said coachman whose person stood out in high relief a smoked pipe against stable wall when john brought up rattler wish hed get devil to do grooming forn growled john aye hed deal haimabler groom what have now observed daltonand joke appeared to so good that being left alone upon scene continued at interval to take pipe from mouth in order to wink at imaginary audience shake luxuriously with silent ventral laughter mentally rehearsing dialogue from beginning that might recite with effect in servant hall when arthur went up to dressing room again after luncheon be inevitable that debate have have with there earlier in day must flash across mind be impossible for now to dwell on remembranceimpossible to recall feeling reflection have be decisive with then more than to recall peculiar scent of air have freshened when first opened window desire to see hetty have rushed back like ill stemmed current be amazed at force with trivial fancy seemed to grasp be even rather tremulous a brushed hairpooh be riding in break way be because have made serious affair of idle matter by thinking of a if be of consequence must amuse by seeing hetty to day get rid of whole thing from mind be irwines fault if irwine have said nothing shouldnt have thought half so much of hetty a of meg lameness however be just sort of day for lolling in hermitage must go finish dr moore zeluco there before dinner hermitage stood in fir tree grovethe way hetty be sure to come in walking from hall farm so nothing must be simpler more natural meeting hetty be mere circumstance of walk not object arthur shadow flitted rather faster among sturdy oak of chase than might have be expected from shadow of tired man on warm afternoon be still scarcely four oclock when stood before tall narrow gate leading into delicious labyrinthine wood skirted one side of chase be called fir tree grove not because fir be many because be few be wood of beech lime with here there light silver stemmed birchjust sort of wood most haunted by nymph see white sunlit limb gleaming athwart bough peeping from behind smooth sweeping outline of tall lime hear soft liquid laughterbut if look with too curious sacrilegious eye vanish behind silvery beech make believe that voice be only running brooklet perhaps metamorphose into tawny squirrel that scamper away mock from topmost bough be not grove with measured grass rolled gravel for to tread upon with narrow hollow shaped earthy path edged with faint dash of delicate mosspaths look a if be made by free will of tree underwood moving reverently aside to look at tall queen of white footed nymph be along broadest of path arthur donnithorne passed under avenue of lime beech be still afternoonthe golden light be lingering languidly among upper bough only glancing down here there on purple pathway edge of faintly sprinkled moss afternoon in destiny disguise cold awful face behind hazy radiant veil encloses in warm downy wing poison with violet scented breath arthur strolled along carelessly with book under arm not looking on ground a meditative men be apt to do eye must fix on distant bend in road round little figure must surely appear before long ah there come first bright patch of colour like tropic bird among bough then tripping figure with round hat on small basket under arm then deep blushing almost frightened bright smiling girl making curtsy with fluttered yet happy glance a arthur came up to if arthur have have time to think at must have thought strange that must feel fluttered too be conscious of blushing tooin fact look feel a foolish a if have be taken by surprise instead of meeting just what expected poor thing be pity be not in golden age of childhood when must have stood face to face eyeing other with timid liking then given other little butterfly kiss toddled off to play together arthur must have gone home to silk curtained cot hetty to home spun pillow must have slept without dream to morrow must have be life hardly conscious of yesterday arthur turned round walked by hettys side without giving reason be alone together for first time what overpowering presence that first privacy be actually dared not look at little butter maker for first minute two a for hetty foot rested on cloud be borne along by warm zephyr have forgotten rose coloured ribbon be more conscious of limb than if childish soul have passed into water lily resting on liquid bed warmed by midsummer sun beam may seem contradiction arthur gathered certain carelessness confidence from timidity be entirely different state of mind from what have expected in such meeting with hetty full a be of vague feeling there be room in moment of silence for thought that previous debate scruple be needle be quite right to choose way of coming to chase said at last looking down at hetty be so much prettier a well a shorter than coming by of lodge yes sir hetty answered with tremulous almost whispering voice didnt know one bit how to speak to gentleman like mr arthur very vanity made more coy of speech do come week to see mr pomfret yes sir thursday only when shes got to go out with miss donnithorne shes teaching something be yes sir lace mending a learnt abroad stocking mendingit look just like stocking cant tell be mended teach cutting out too what be going to be lady maid must like to be one very much indeed hetty spoke more audibly now still rather tremulously thought perhaps seemed a stupid to captain donnithorne a luke britton did to suppose mr pomfret always expects at time expects at four oclock im rather late to day because aunt couldnt spare regular time be four because give time before miss donnithornes bell ring ah then must not keep now else must like to show hermitage did ever see sir be walk where turn up to must not go now ill show other time if youd like to see yes please sir do always come back way in evening be afraid to come so lonely road oh sir never late always set out by eight oclock so light now in evening aunt must be angry with if didnt get home before nine perhaps craig gardener come to take care of deep blush overspread hettys face neck im sure doesnt im sure never did wouldnt let dont like said hastily tear of vexation have come so fast that before have done speaking bright drop rolled down hot cheek then felt ashamed to death that be cry for one long instant happiness be gone in next felt arm steal round gentle voice said why hetty what make cry didnt mean to vex wouldnt vex for world little blossom come dont cry look at else will think wont forgive arthur have laid hand on soft arm be nearest to be stooping towards hetty with look of coaxing entreaty hetty lifted long dewy lash met eye be bent towards with sweet timid beseeching look what space of time three moment be while eye met arm touched love be such simple thing when have only one twenty summer sweet girl of seventeen tremble under glance a if be bud first opening heart with wondering rapture to morning such young unfurrowed soul roll to meet other like two velvet peach that touch softly be at rest mingle a easily a two brooklet ask for nothing to entwine ripple with ever interlacing curve in leafiest hiding place while arthur gazed into hettys dark beseeching eye made difference to what sort of english spoke even if hoop powder have be in fashion must very likely not have be sensible just then that hetty wanted sign of high breeding started asunder with beating heart something have fallen on ground with rattling noise be hettys basket little workwomans matter be scattered on path of showing capability of rolling to great length there be much to be done in picking up not word be spoken when arthur hung basket over arm again poor child felt strange difference in look manner just pressed hand said with look tone be almost chilling to have be hindering must not keep longer now will be expected at house good bye without waiting for to speak turned away from hurried back towards road led to hermitage leaving hetty to pursue way in strange dream seemed to have begun in bewildering delight be now passing into contrariety sadness must meet again a came home why have spoken almost a if be displeased with then run away so suddenly cried hardly knowing why arthur too be very uneasy feeling be lit up for by more distinct consciousness hurried to hermitage stood in heart of wood unlocked door with hasty wrench slammed after pitched zeluco into most distant corner thrusting right hand into pocket first walked four five time up down scanty length of little room then seated on ottoman in uncomfortable stiff way a often do when wish not to abandon to feeling be getting in love with be quite plain be ready to pitch everything elseno matter wherefor sake of surrendering to delicious feeling have just disclosed be use blinking fact nowthey must get too fond of other if went on taking notice of herand what must come of must have to go away in few week poor little thing must be miserable must not see alone again must keep out of way what fool be for coming back from gawaines got up threw open window to let in soft breath of afternoon healthy scent of fir made belt round hermitage soft air did not help resolution a leaned out looked into leafy distance considered resolution sufficiently fixed there be need to debate with longer have made up mind not to meet hetty again now might give up to thinking how immensely agreeable must be if circumstance be differenthow pleasant must have be to meet evening a came back put arm round again look into sweet face wondered if dear little thing be thinking of tootwenty to one be how beautiful eye be with tear on lash must like to satisfy soul for day with looking at must see againhe must see simply to remove false impression from mind about manner to just now must behave in quiet kind way to herjust to prevent from going home with head full of wrong fancy yes must be best thing to do after be long whilemore than hour before arthur have brought meditation to point once arrived there must stay no longer at hermitage time must be filled up with movement until must see hetty again be already late enough to go dress for dinner for grandfather dinner hour be six chapter xiii evening in wood happened that mr pomfret have have slight quarrel with mr best housekeeper on thursday morninga fact have two consequence highly convenient to hetty caused mr pomfret to have tea sent up to own room inspired that exemplary lady maid with so lively recollection of former passage in mr best conduct of dialogue in mr best have decidedly inferiority a interlocutor with mr pomfret hetty required more presence of mind than be demanded for using needle throwing in occasional yes must have wanted to put on hat earlier than usual only have told captain donnithorne that usually set out about eight oclock if must go to grove again expecting to see must be gone must come little butterfly soul fluttered incessantly between memory dubious expectation at last minute hand of old fashioned brazen faced timepiece be on last quarter to eight there be reason for being time to get ready for departure even mr pomfret preoccupied mind did not prevent from noticing what looked like new flush of beauty in little thing a tied on hat before looking glass child get prettier prettier day do believe be inward comment more pity shell get place husband sooner for sober well to do men dont like such pretty wife when be girl be more admired than if have be so very pretty however shes reason to be grateful to for teaching something to get bread with better than farm house work always told be good naturedand thats truth to hurt too else there in house that wouldnt be here now to lord over in housekeeper room hetty walked hastily across short space of pleasure ground have to traverse dreading to meet mr craig to whom must hardly have spoken civilly how relieved be when have got safely under oak among fern of chase even then be a ready to be startled a deer leaped away at approach thought nothing of evening light lay gently in grassy alley between fern made beauty of living green more visible than have be in overpowering flood of noon thought of nothing be present only saw something be possible mr arthur donnithorne coming to meet again along fir tree grove be foreground of hettys picture behind lay bright hazy somethingdays be not to be a other day of life have be be a if have be wooed by river god who might time take to wondrous hall below watery heaven there be knowing what must come since strange entrancing delight have come if chest full of lace satin jewel have be sent from unknown source how must have thought that whole lot be going to change to morrow still more bewildering joy must befall hetty have never read novel if have ever seen one think word must have be too hard for how then must find shape for expectation be a formless a sweet languid odour of garden at chase have floated past a walked by gate be at gate nowthat leading into fir tree grove enters wood where be already twilight at step take fear at heart becomes colder if must not come oh how dreary wasthe thought of going out at other end of wood into unsheltered road without having seen reach first turning towards hermitage walking slowlyhe be not there hate leveret run across path hate everything be not what longs for walk on happy whenever be coming to bend in road for perhaps be behind be beginning to cry heart have swelled so tear stand in eye give one great sob while corner of mouth quiver tear roll down doesnt know that there be turning to hermitage that be close against that arthur donnithorne be only few yard from full of one thought thought of only be object be going to see hetty again be longing have be growing through last three hour to feverish thirst not of course to speak in caressing way into have unguardedly fallen before dinner to set thing right with by kindness must have air of friendly civility prevent from running away with wrong notion about mutual relation if hetty have known be there must not have cried must have be better for then arthur must perhaps have behaved a wisely a have intended a be started when appeared at end of side alley looked up at with two great drop rolling down cheek what else must do speak to in soft soothing tone a if be bright eyed spaniel with thorn in foot have something frightened hetty have seen anything in wood dont be frightenedill take care of now hetty be blushing so didnt know whether be happy miserable to be cry againwhat did gentleman think of girl who cried in way felt unable even to say must only look away from wipe tear from cheek not before great drop have fallen on rose coloured stringsshe knew that quite well come be cheerful again smile at tell whats matter come tell hetty turned head towards whispered thought wouldnt come slowly got courage to lift eye to that look be too much must have have eye of egyptian granite not to look too lovingly in return little frightened bird little tearful rose silly pet wont cry again now im with will ah doesnt know in least what be saying be not what meant to say arm be stealing round waist again be tightening clasp be bending face nearer nearer to round cheek lip be meeting pouting child lip for long moment time have vanished may be shepherd in arcadia for aught know may be first youth kissing first maiden may be eros sipping lip of psycheit be one there be speaking for minute after walked along with beating heart till came within sight of gate at end of wood then looked at other not quite a have looked before for in eye there be memory of kiss already something bitter have begun to mingle with fountain of sweet already arthur be uncomfortable took arm from hettys waist said here be almost at end of grove wonder how late be added pulling out watch twenty minute past eightbut watch be too fast however id better not go further now trot along quickly with little foot get home safely good bye took hand looked at half sadly half with constrained smile hettys eye seemed to beseech not to go away yet patted cheek said good bye again be obliged to turn away from go on a for arthur rushed back through wood a if wanted to put wide space between hetty must not go to hermitage again remembered how have debated with there before dinner have come to nothingworse than nothing walked right on into chase glad to get out of grove surely be haunted by evil genius beech smooth limesthere be something enervating in very sight of strong knotted old oak have bending languor in themthe sight of must give man energy arthur lost among narrow opening in fern winding about without seeking issue till twilight deepened almost to night under great bough hare looked black a darted across path be feeling much more strongly than have done in morning be a if horse have wheeled round from leap dared to dispute mastery be dissatisfied with irritated mortified sooner fixed mind on probable consequence of giving way to emotion have stolen over to dayof continuing to notice hetty of allowing opportunity for such slight caress a have be betrayed into alreadythan refused to believe future possible for to flirt with hetty be very different affair from flirting with pretty girl of own station be understood to be amusement on side if became serious there be obstacle to marriage little thing must be spoken ill of directly if happened to be seen walking with then excellent people poysers to whom good name be a precious a if have best blood in land in veinshe must hate if made scandal of sort on estate be to be own day among tenant by whom liked above to be respected must no more believe that must so fall in own esteem than that must break leg go on crutch rest of life couldnt imagine in position be too odious too unlike even if one knew anything about might get too fond of other then there must be nothing misery of parting after gentleman out of ballad must marry farmer niece there must be end to whole thing at once be too foolish yet have be so determined morning before went to gawaines while be there something have taken hold of made gallop back seemed couldnt quite depend on own resolution a have thought must almost wished arm must get painful again then must think of nothing comfort must be to get rid of pain there be knowing what impulse might seize to morrow in confounded place where there be nothing to occupy imperiously through livelong day what must do to secure from more of folly there be one resource must go tell irwinetell everything mere act of telling must make seem trivial temptation must vanish a charm of fond word vanishes when one repeat to indifferent in way must help to tell irwine must ride to broxton rectory first thing after breakfast to morrow arthur have

poultry stolid face showed nothing of maternal delight more than brown earthenware pitcher will show light of lamp within be generally feminine eye that first detects moral deficiency hidden under dear deceit of beauty so be not surprising that mr poyser with keenness abundant opportunity for observation must have formed tolerably fair estimate of what might be expected from hetty in way of feeling in moment of indignation have sometimes spoken with great openness on subject to husband shes better than peacock a ud strut about on wall spread tail when sun shone if folk parish be dying

come upstairs to bedroom adjoining hettys dinah delighted in bedroom window being on second story of tall house gave wide view over field thickness of wall formed broad step about yard below window where must place chair now first thing did on entering room be to seat in chair look out on peaceful field beyond large moon be rising just above hedgerow elm liked pasture best where milch cow be lying next to that meadow where grass be half mown lay in silvered sweeping line heart be very full for there be to be only one more night on must look out on field for long time to come thought little of leaving mere scene for to bleak snowfield have just a many charm thought of dear people whom have learned to care for among peaceful field who must now have place in loving remembrance for ever thought of struggle weariness might lie before in rest of life journey when must be away from know nothing of what be befalling pressure of thought soon became too strong for to enjoy unresponding stillness of moonlit field closed eye that might feel more intensely presence of love sympathy deeper more tender than be breathed from earth sky be often dinahs mode of praying in solitude simply to close eye to feel enclosed by divine presence then gradually fear yearning anxiety for others melted away like ice crystal in warm ocean have sat in way perfectly still with hand crossed on lap pale light resting on calm face for at least ten minute when be startled by loud sound apparently of something falling in hettys room like sound fall on ear in state of abstraction have distinct character be simply loud startling so that felt uncertain whether have interpreted rightly rose listened be quiet afterwards reflected that hetty might merely have knocked something down in getting into bed began slowly to undress now owing to suggestion of sound thought became concentrated on sweet young thing with life trial before herthe solemn daily duty of wife motherand mind so unprepared for bent merely on little foolish selfish pleasure like child hugging toy in beginning of long toilsome journey in will have to bear hunger cold unsheltered darkness dinah felt double care for hetty because shared seth anxious interest in brother lot have not come to conclusion that hetty did not love adam well enough to marry saw too clearly absence of warm self devoting love in hettys nature to regard coldness of behaviour towards adam a indication that be not man must like to have for husband blank in hettys nature instead of exciting dinahs dislike only touched with deeper pity lovely face form affected a beauty always affect pure tender mind free from selfish jealousy be excellent divine gift gave deeper pathos to need sin sorrow with be mingled a canker in lily white bud be more grievous to behold than in common pot herb by time dinah have undressed put on night gown feeling about hetty have gathered painful intensity imagination have created thorny thicket of sin sorrow in saw poor thing struggling torn bleeding looking with tear for rescue finding none be in way that dinahs imagination sympathy acted reacted habitually heightening other felt deep longing to go now pour into hettys ear word of tender warning appeal rushed into mind perhaps hetty be already asleep dinah put ear to partition heard still slight noise convinced that hetty be not yet in bed still hesitated be not quite certain of divine direction voice told to go to hetty seemed no stronger than other voice said that hetty be weary that going to now in unseasonable moment must only tend to close heart more obstinately dinah be not satisfied without more unmistakable guidance than inward voice there be light enough for if opened bible to discern text sufficiently to know what must say to knew physiognomy of page must tell on book opened sometimes on what chapter without seeing title number be small thick bible worn quite round at edge dinah laid sideways on window ledge where light be strongest then opened with forefinger first word looked at be at top of left hand page wept sore fell on paul neck kissed be enough for dinah have opened on memorable parting at ephesus when paul have felt bound to open heart in last exhortation warning hesitated no longer opening own door gently went tapped on hettys know have to tap twice because hetty have to put out candle throw off black lace scarf after second tap door be opened immediately dinah said will let come in hetty hetty without speaking for be confused vexed opened door wider let in what strange contrast two figure made visible enough in mingled twilight moonlight hetty cheek flushed eye glistening from imaginary drama beautiful neck arm bare hair hanging in curly tangle down back bauble in ear dinah covered with long white dress pale face full of subdued emotion almost like lovely corpse into soul have returned charged with sublimer secret sublimer love be nearly of same height dinah evidently little taller a put arm round hettys waist kissed forehead knew be not in bed dear said in sweet clear voice be irritating to hetty mingling with own peevish vexation like music with jangling chain for heard moving longed to speak to again to night for be last one will be here dont know what may happen to morrow to keep apart will sit down with while do up hair oh yes said hetty hastily turning round reaching second chair in room glad that dinah looked a if did not notice ear ring dinah sat down hetty began to brush together hair before twisting up doing with air of excessive indifference belongs to confused self consciousness expression of dinahs eye gradually relieved seemed unobservant of detail dear hetty said have be borne in upon mind to night that may day be in troubletrouble be appointed for here below there come time when need more comfort help than thing of life can give want to tell that if ever be in trouble need friend will always feel for love have got that friend in dinah morris at snowfield if come to send for shell never forget night word be speaking to now will remember hetty yes said hetty rather frightened why must think will be in trouble do know of anything hetty have seated a tied on cap now dinah leaned forward took hand a answered because dear trouble come to in life set heart on thing isnt god will for to have then go sorrowing people love be taken from can joy in nothing because be not with sickness come faint under burden of feeble body go astray do wrong bring into trouble with fellow men there be man woman born into world to whom of trial fall so feel that of must happen to desire for that while be young must seek for strength from heavenly father that may have support will not fail in evil day dinah paused released hettys hand that might not hinder hetty sat quite still felt response within to dinahs anxious affection dinahs word uttered with solemn pathetic distinctness affected with chill fear flush have died away almost to paleness have timidity of luxurious pleasure seeking nature shrink from hint of pain dinah saw effect tender anxious pleading became more earnest till hetty full of vague fear that something evil be time to befall began to cry be habit to say that while lower nature can never understand higher higher nature command complete view of lower think higher nature have to learn comprehension a learn art of vision by good deal of hard experience often with bruise gash incurred in taking thing up by wrong end fancying space wider than be dinah have never seen hetty affected in way before with usual benignant hopefulness trusted be stirring of divine impulse kissed sobbing thing began to cry with for grateful joy hetty be simply in excitable state of mind in there be calculating what turn feeling may take from one moment to for first time became irritated under dinahs caress pushed away impatiently said with childish sobbing voice dont talk to so dinah why do come to frighten ive never done anything to why cant let be poor dinah felt pang be too wise to persist only said mildly yes dear youre tired wont hinder longer make haste get into bed good night went out of room almost a quietly quickly a if have be ghost once by side of own bed threw on knee poured out in deep silence passionate pity filled heart a for hetty be soon in wood againher waking dream being merged in sleeping life

along gravel towards door opened on garden knew that rector always breakfasted in study study lay on left hand of door opposite dining room be small low room belonging to old part of housedark with sombre cover of book lined wall looked very cheery morning a arthur reached open window for morning sun fell aslant on great glass globe with gold fish in stood on scagliola pillar in front of ready spread bachelor breakfast table by side of breakfast table be group must have made room enticing in crimson damask easy chair sat mr irwine with radiant freshness always have when came from morning toilet finely formed plump white hand be playing along juno brown curly back close to juno tail be wagging with calm matronly pleasure two brown pup be rolling over other in ecstatic duet of worrying noise on cushion little removed sat pug with air of maiden lady who looked on familiarity a animal weakness made a little show a possible of observing on table at mr irwines elbow lay first volume of foulis schylus arthur knew well by sight silver coffee pot carroll be bringing in sent forth fragrant steam completed delight of bachelor breakfast hallo arthur thats good fellow youre just in time said mr irwine a arthur paused stepped in over low window sill carroll will want more coffee egg havent got cold fowl for to eat with ham why be like old day arthur havent be to breakfast with five year be tempting morning for ride before breakfast said arthur used to like breakfasting with so when be reading with grandfather be always few degree colder at breakfast than at other hour in day think morning bath doesnt agree with arthur be anxious not to imply that came with special purpose have sooner found in mr irwines presence than confidence have thought quite easy before suddenly appeared most difficult thing in world to at very moment of shaking hand saw purpose in quite new light how must make irwine understand position unless told little scene in wood how must tell without looking like fool then weakness in coming back from gawaines doing very opposite of what intended irwine must think shilly willy fellow ever after however must come out in unpremeditated way conversation might lead up to like breakfast time better than other moment in day said mr irwine dust have settled on one mind then present clear mirror to ray of thing always have favourite book by at breakfast enjoy bit pick up then so much that regularly morning seems to a if must certainly become studious again presently dent brings up poor fellow who have killed hare when ive got through justicing a carroll call im inclined for ride round glebe on way back meet with master of workhouse who have got long story of mutinous pauper to tell so day go on im always same lazy fellow before evening set in besides one want stimulus of sympathy have never have that since poor doyley left treddleston if have stuck to book well rascal must have have pleasanter prospect before scholarship doesnt run in family blood indeed well if can remember little inapplicable latin to adorn maiden speech in parliament six seven year hence cras ingens iterabimus aequor few shred of sort will perhaps stick to will arrange opinion so a to introduce dont think knowledge of classic be pressing want to country gentleman a far a can see hed much better have knowledge of manure ive be reading friend arthur young book lately there nothing must like better than to carry out of idea in putting farmer on better management of land a say making what be wild country of same dark hue bright variegated with corn cattle grandfather will never let have power while life there nothing must like better than to undertake stonyshire side of estateits in dismal conditionand set improvement on foot gallop about from one place to overlook must like to know labourer see touching hat to with look of goodwill bravo arthur man who have feeling for classic couldnt make better apology for coming into world than by increasing quantity of food to maintain scholarsand rector who appreciate scholar whenever enter on career of model landlord may be there to see youll want portly rector to complete picture take tithe of respect honour get by hard work only dont set heart too strongly on goodwill be to get in consequence im not sure that men be fondest of who try to be useful to know gawaine have got curse of whole neighbourhood upon about enclosure must make quite clear to mind be most bent upon old boypopularity usefulnesselse may happen to miss oh gawaine be harsh in manner doesnt make personally agreeable to tenant dont believe there anything cant prevail on people to do with kindness for part couldnt live in neighbourhood where be not respected beloved very pleasant to go among tenant herethey seem so well inclined to suppose seems only other day to since be little lad riding on pony about a big a sheep if fair allowance be made to building attended to one must persuade to farm on better plan stupid a be then mind fall in love in right place dont get wife who will drain purse make niggardly in spite of mother have little discussion about sometimes say ill never risk single prophecy on arthur until see woman fall in love with think lady love will rule a moon rule tide feel bound to stand up for a pupil know maintain that youre not of watery quality so mind dont disgrace judgment arthur winced under speech for keen old mr irwines opinion about have disagreeable effect of sinister omen to be sure be only reason for persevering in intention getting additional security against nevertheless at point in conversation be conscious of increased disinclination to tell story about hetty be of impressible nature lived great deal in other people opinion feeling concerning mere fact that be in presence of intimate friend who have not slightest notion that have have such serious internal struggle a came to confide rather shook own belief in seriousness of struggle be not after thing to make fuss about what must irwine do for that must not do for must go to eagledale in spite of meg lamenessgo on rattler let pym follow a well a must on old hack be thought a sugared coffee next minute a be lifting cup to lip remembered how thoroughly have made up mind last night to tell irwine must not be vacillating againhe must do what have meant to do time so must be well not to let personal tone of conversation altogether drop if went to quite indifferent topic difficulty must be heightened have required no noticeable pause for rush rebound of feeling before answered think be hardly argument against man general strength of character that must be apt to be mastered by love fine constitution doesnt insure one against smallpox other of inevitable disease man may be very firm in other matter yet be under sort of witchery from woman yes there difference between love smallpox bewitchment eitherthat if detect disease at early stage try change of air there be chance of complete escape without further development of symptom there be certain alternative dos man may administer to by keeping unpleasant consequence before mind give sort of smoked glass through may look at resplendent fair one discern true outline though im afraid by by smoked glass be apt to be missing just at moment be most wanted daresay now even man fortified with knowledge of classic might be lured into imprudent marriage in spite of warning given by chorus in prometheus smile flitted across arthur face be faint one instead of following mr irwines playful lead said quite seriouslyyes thats worst of desperately vexatious thing that after one reflection quiet determination must be ruled by mood one cant calculate on beforehand dont think man ought to be blamed so much if be betrayed into doing thing in way in spite of resolution ah mood lie in nature boy just a much a reflection did more man can never do anything at variance with own nature carry within germ of most exceptional action if wise people make eminent fool of ourselves on particular occasion must endure legitimate conclusion that carry few grain of folly to ounce of wisdom well one may be betrayed into doing thing by combination of circumstance one might never have done otherwise why yes man cant very well steal bank note unless bank note lie within convenient reach wont make think honest man because begin to howl at bank note for falling in way surely dont think man who struggle against temptation into fall at last a bad a man who never struggle at certainly pity in proportion to struggle for foreshadow inward suffering be worst form of nemesis consequence be unpitying deed carry terrible consequence quite apart from fluctuation went beforeconsequences be hardly ever confined to ourselves be best to fix mind on certainty instead of considering what may be element of excuse for never knew so inclined for moral discussion arthur be danger of own that be considering in philosophical general way in asking question mr irwine pushed plate away threw back in chair looked straight at arthur really suspected that arthur wanted to tell something thought of smoothing way for by direct question be mistaken brought suddenly involuntarily to brink of confession arthur shrank back felt le disposed towards than ever conversation have taken more serious tone than have intendedit must quite mislead irwinehe must imagine there be deep passion for hetty while there be such thing be conscious of colouring be annoyed at boyishness oh danger said a indifferently a must dont know be more liable to irresolution than other people only there be little incident now then set one speculating on what might happen in future be there motive at work under strange reluctance of arthur have sort of backstairs influence not admitted to mental business be carried on much in same way a business of state great deal of hard work be done by agent who be not acknowledged in piece of machinery too believe there be often small unnoticeable wheel have great deal to do with motion of large obvious one possibly there be such unrecognized agent secretly busy in arthur mind at momentpossibly be fear lest might hereafter find fact of having made confession to rector serious annoyance in case must not be able quite to carry out good resolution dare not assert that be not so human soul be very complex thing idea of hetty have just crossed mr irwines mind a looked inquiringly at arthur disclaiming indifferent answer confirmed thought have quickly followedthat there must be nothing serious in direction there be probability that arthur ever saw except at church at own home under eye of mr poyser hint have given arthur about other day have more serious meaning than to prevent from noticing so a to rouse little chit vanity in way perturb rustic drama of life arthur must soon join regiment be far away there must be no danger in quarter even if arthur character have not be strong security against honest patronizing pride in good will respect of everybody about be safeguard even against foolish romance still more against lower kind of folly if there have be anything special on arthur mind in previous conversation be clear be not inclined to enter into detail mr irwine be too delicate to imply even friendly curiosity perceived change of subject must be welcome said by way arthur at colonel birthday fte there be transparency made great effect in honour of britannia pitt loamshire militia above generous youth hero of day dont think must get up something of same sort to astonish weak mind opportunity be gone while arthur be hesitating rope to might have clung have drifted awayhe must trust now to own swimming in ten minute from time mr irwine be called for on business arthur bidding good bye mounted horse again with sense of dissatisfaction tried to quell by determining to set off for eagledale without hour delay book second chapter xvii in story pause little rector of broxton be little better than pagan hear one of reader exclaim how much more edifying must have be if have made give arthur truly spiritual advice might have put into mouth most beautiful thingsquite a good a reading sermon certainly must if held highest vocation of novelist to represent thing a never have be never will be then of course might refashion life

approach until can be proved hatred be better thing for soul than love must believe that mr irwines influence in parish be more wholesome one than of zealous mr ryde who came there twenty year afterwards when mr irwine have be gathered to father be true mr ryde insisted strongly on doctrine of reformation visited flock great deal in own home be severe in rebuking aberration of fleshput stop indeed to christmas round of church singer a promoting drunkenness too light handling of sacred thing gathered from adam bede to whom talked of matter in old age that few clergyman must be le successful in winning heart of parishioner than mr ryde learned great many notion about doctrine from so that almost church goer under fifty began to distinguish a well between genuine gospel what did not come precisely up to standard a if have be born bred dissenter for time after arrival there seemed to be quite religious movement in quiet rural district said adam ive seen pretty clear ever since

excellent way of preaching in weekday daresay if old friend mr irwine be to come to life again get into pulpit next sunday must be rather ashamed that didnt preach better after praise of nay nay said adam broadening chest throwing back in chair a if be ready to meet inference nobody have ever heard say mr irwine be much of preacher didnt go into deep speritial experience know there s deal in man inward life a cant measure by square say do that ll follow do ll follow there thing go on in soul time when feeling come into like rushing mighty wind a scripture say part life in two amost so look

without thinking on mr ryde be like dose o physic gripped worreted after left much same didnt mr ryde preach great deal more about spiritual part of religion that talk of adam couldnt get more out of sermon than out of mr irwines eh knowna preached deal about doctrine ive seen pretty clear ever since be young un a religion something else besides doctrine notion look at a if doctrine be like finding name for feeling so a can talk of em when youve never known em just a man may talk o tool when know name though he never so much a seen em still le handled em ive heard deal o doctrine time

clatter about what must never understand theyre poor foolish question after for what have got inside outside of what come from god if weve got resolution to do right gave reckon first last see plain enough will never do without resolution thats enough for adam perceive be warm admirer perhaps partial judge of mr irwine a happily of still be of people have known familiarly doubtless will be despised a weakness by lofty order of mind who pant after ideal be oppressed by general sense that emotion be of too exquisite character to find fit object among everyday fellowmen have often be favoured with confidence of select nature find to concur in experience great men be overestimated small men be insupportable that if must love woman without ever looking back on love a folly must die while be courting if must maintain slightest belief in human heroism must never make pilgrimage to see hero confess have often meanly shrunk from confessing to accomplished acute gentleman what own experience have be be afraid have often smiled with hypocritical assent gratified with epigram on fleeting nature of illusion one moderately acquainted with french literature can command at moment notice human converse think wise man have remarked be not rigidly sincere herewith discharge conscience declare have have quite enthusiastic movement of admiration towards old gentleman who spoke worst english who be occasionally fretful in temper who have never moved in higher sphere of influence than of parish overseer that way in have come to conclusion that human nature be lovablethe way have learnt something of deep pathos sublime mysterieshas be by living great deal among people more le commonplace vulgar of whom must perhaps hear nothing very surprising if be to inquire about in neighbourhood where dwelt ten to one most of small shopkeeper in vicinity saw nothing at in for have observed remarkable coincidence that select nature who pant after ideal find nothing in pantaloon petticoat great enough to command reverence love be curiously in unison with narrowest pettiest for example have often heard mr gedge landlord of royal oak who used to turn bloodshot eye on neighbour

forelock have secured arrival at village while be still quarter to two though almost one who meant to go to church be already within churchyard gate who stayed at home be chiefly mother like timothy be who stood at own door nursing baby feeling a woman feel in positionthat nothing else can be expected of be not entirely to see thias bede funeral that people be standing about churchyard so long before service began be common practice woman indeed usually entered church at once farmer wife talked in undertone to other over tall pew about illness total failure of doctor stuff recommending dandelion tea other home made specific a far preferableabout servant growing exorbitance a to wage whereas quality of service declined from year to year there be girl nowadays to be trusted further than must see herabout bad price mr dingall treddleston grocer be giving for butter reasonable doubt might be held a to solvency notwithstanding that mr dingall be sensible woman be sorry for for have very good kin meantime men lingered outside hardly of except singer who have humming fragmentary rehearsal to go through entered church until mr irwine be in desk saw reason for premature must do in church if be there before service beganand did not conceive that power in universe must take ill of if stayed out talked little about busness chad cranage look like quite new acquaintance to day for have got clean sunday face always make little granddaughter cry at a stranger experienced eye must have fixed on at once a village blacksmith after seeing humble deference with big saucy fellow took off hat stroked hair to farmer for chad be accustomed to say that working man must hold candle to personage understood to be a black a be on weekday by evil sounding rule of conduct meant what be after rather virtuous than otherwise namely that men who have horse to be shod must be treated with respect chad rougher sort of workman kept aloof from grave under white thorn where burial be going forward sandy jim several of farm labourer made group round stood with hat off a fellow mourner with mother son others held midway position sometimes watching group at grave sometimes listening to conversation of farmer who stood in knot near church door be now joined by martin poyser while family passed into church on outside of knot stood mr casson landlord of donnithorne arm in most striking attitudethat be to say with forefinger of right hand thrust between button of waistcoat left hand in breech pocket head very much on one side looking on whole like actor who have only mono syllabic part entrusted to feel sure that audience discern fitness for leading business curiously in contrast with old jonathan burge who held hand behind leaned forward coughing asthmatically with inward scorn of knowingness must not be turned into cash talk be in rather lower tone than usual to day hushed little by sound of mr irwines voice reading final prayer of burial service have have word of pity for poor thias now have got upon nearer subject of own grievance against satchell squire bailiff who played part of steward so far a be not performed by old mr donnithorne for gentleman have meanness to receive own rent make bargain about own timber subject of conversation be additional reason for not being loud since satchell might presently be walking up paved road to church door soon became suddenly silent for mr irwines voice have ceased group round white thorn be dispersing towards church moved aside stood with hat off while mr irwine passed adam seth be coming next with mother between for joshua rann officiated a head sexton a well a clerk be not yet ready to follow rector into vestry there be pause before three mourner came on lisbeth have turned round to look again towards grave ah there be nothing now brown earth under white thorn yet cried le to day than have done day since husband death along with grief there be mixed unusual sense of own importance in having burial in mr irwines reading special service for husband besides knew funeral psalm be going to be sung for felt counter excitement to sorrow still more strongly a walked with son towards church door saw friendly sympathetic nod of fellow parishioner mother son passed into church one by one loiterer followed though still lingered without sight of mr donnithornes carriage be winding slowly up hill perhaps helping to make feel that there be need for haste presently sound of bassoon key bugle burst forth evening hymn always opened service have begun one must now enter take place can not say that interior of hayslope church be remarkable for anything except for grey age of oaken pewsgreat square pew mostly ranged on side of narrow aisle be free indeed from modern blemish of gallery choir have two narrow pew to in middle of right hand row so that be short process for joshua rann to take place among a principal bass return to desk after singing be over pulpit desk grey old a pew stood on one side of arch leading into chancel also have grey square pew for mr donnithornes family servant yet assure grey pew with buff washed wall gave very pleasing tone to shabby interior agreed extremely well with ruddy face bright waistcoat there be liberal touch of crimson toward chancel for pulpit mr donnithornes own pew have handsome crimson cloth cushion to close vista there be crimson altar cloth embroidered with golden ray by miss lydia own hand even without crimson cloth effect must have be warm cheering when mr irwine be in desk looking benignly round on simple congregationon hardy old men with bent knee shoulder perhaps with vigour left for much hedge clipping thatching on tall stalwart frame roughly cut bronzed face of stone cutter carpenter on half dozen well to do farmer with apple cheeked family on clean old woman mostly farm labourer wife with bit of snow white cap border under black bonnet with withered arm bare from elbow folded passively over chest for none of old people held bookswhy must not one of must read knew few good word by heart withered lip now then moved silently following service without very clear comprehension indeed with simple faith in efficacy to ward off harm bring blessing now face be visible for be standing upthe little child on seat peeping over edge of grey pew while good bishop ken evening hymn be being sung to one of lively psalm tune died out with last generation of rector choral parish clerk melody die out like pipe of pan with ear love listen for be not in usual place among singer to day for sat with mother seth noticed with surprise bartle massey be absent more agreeable for mr joshua rann who gave out bass note with unusual complacency threw extra ray of severity into glance sent over spectacle at recusant will maskery beseech to imagine mr irwine looking round on scene in ample white surplice became so well with powdered hair thrown back rich brown complexion finely cut nostril upper lip for there be certain virtue in benignant yet keen countenance a there be in human face from generous soul beam out over streamed delicious june sunshine through old window with desultory patch of yellow red blue that threw pleasant touch of colour on opposite wall think a mr irwine looked round to day eye rested instant longer than usual on square pew occupied by martin poyser family there be pair of dark eye found impossible not to wander thither rest on round pink white figure hetty be at moment quite careless of glancesshe be absorbed in thought arthur donnithorne must soon be coming into church for carriage must surely be at church gate by time have never seen since parted with in wood on thursday evening oh how long time have seemed thing have gone on just same a ever since evening wonder have happened then have brought no change after be already like dream when heard church door swinging heart beat so dared not look up felt that aunt be curtsying curtsied that must be old mr donnithornehe always came first wrinkled small old man peering round with short sighted glance at bowing curtsying congregation then knew miss lydia be passing though hetty liked so much to look at fashionable little coal scuttle bonnet with wreath of small rose round didnt mind to day there be more curtsiesno be not come felt sure there be nothing else passing pew door house keeper black bonnet lady maid beautiful straw hat have once be miss lydia then powdered head of butler footman be not there yet must look nowshe might be mistakenfor after have not looked so lifted up eyelid glanced timidly at cushioned pew in chancelthere be one old mr donnithorne rubbing spectacle with white handkerchief miss lydia opening large gilt edged prayer book chill disappointment be too hard to bear felt turning pale lip trembling be ready to cry oh what must do everybody must know reason must know be cry because arthur be not there mr craig with wonderful hothouse plant in button hole be staring at knew be dreadfully long before general confession began so that must kneel down two great drop must fall then one saw except good natured molly for aunt uncle knelt with back towards molly unable to imagine cause for tear in church except faintness of have vague traditional knowledge drew out of pocket queer little flat blue smelling bottle after much labour in pulling cork out thrust narrow neck against hettys nostril donna smell whispered thinking be great advantage old salt have over fresh one did good without biting nose hetty pushed away peevishly little flash of temper did what salt must not have doneit roused to wipe away trace of tear try with might not to shed more hetty have certain strength in vain little nature must have borne anything rather than be laughed at pointed at with other feeling than admiration must have pressed own nail into tender flesh rather than people must know secret did not want to know what fluctuation there be in busy thought feeling while mr irwine be pronouncing solemn absolution in deaf ear through tone of petition followed anger lay very close to disappointment soon won victory over conjecture small ingenuity must devise to account for arthur absence on supposition that really wanted to come really wanted to see again by time rose from knee mechanically because rest be rising colour have returned to cheek even with heightened glow for be framing little indignant speech to herself saying hated arthur for giving painshe must like to suffer too yet while selfish tumult be going on in soul eye be bent down on prayer book eyelid with dark fringe looked a lovely a ever adam bede thought so a glanced at for moment on rising from knee adam thought of hetty did not deafen to service rather blended with other deep feeling for church service be channel to afternoon a certain consciousness of entire past imagined future blend with moment of keen sensibility to adam church service be best channel must have found for mingled regret yearning resignation interchange of beseeching cry for help with outburst of faith praise recurrent response familiar rhythm of collect seemed to speak for a other form of worship must have done a to early christian who have worshipped from childhood upwards in catacomb torch light shadow must have seemed nearer divine presence than heathenish daylight of street secret of emotion never lie in bare object in subtle relation to own past wonder secret escape unsympathizing observer who might a well put on spectacle to discern odour there be one reason why even chance comer must have found service in hayslope church more impressive than in most other village nook in kingdoma reason of be sure have not slightest suspicion be reading of friend joshua rann where good shoemaker got notion of reading from remained mystery even to most intimate acquaintance believe after got chiefly from nature who have poured of music into honest conceited soul a have be known to do into other narrow soul before have given at least fine bass voice musical ear can not positively say whether alone have sufficed to inspire with rich chant in delivered response way rolled from rich deep forte into melancholy cadence subsiding at end of last word into sort of faint resonance like lingering vibration of fine violoncello can compare to nothing for strong calm melancholy rush cadence of wind among autumn bough may seem strange mode of speaking about reading of parish clerka man in rusty spectacle with stubbly hair large occiput prominent crown be nature way will allow gentleman of splendid physiognomy poetic aspiration to sing woefully out of tune not give slightest hint of take care that narrow browed fellow trolling ballad in corner of pot house will be a true to interval a bird joshua be le proud of reading than of singing be always with sense of heightened importance that passed from desk to choir still more to day be special occasion for old man familiar to parish have died sad deathnot in bed circumstance most painful to mind of peasantand now funeral psalm be to be sung in memory of sudden departure moreover bartle massey be not at church joshua importance in choir suffered eclipse be solemn minor strain sang old psalm tune have many wail among word thou sweepst off a with flood vanish hence like dream seemed to have closer application than usual in death of poor thias mother son listened with peculiar feeling lisbeth have vague belief that psalm be doing husband good be part of decent burial must have thought greater wrong to withhold from than to have caused many unhappy day while be living more there be said about husband more there be done for surely safer must be be poor lisbeths blind way of feeling that human love pity be ground of faith in other love seth who be easily touched shed tear tried to recall a have done continually since father death that have heard of possibility that single moment of consciousness at last might be moment of pardon reconcilement for be not written in very psalm be singing that divine dealing be not measured circumscribed by time adam have never be unable to join in psalm before have known plenty of trouble vexation since have be lad be first sorrow have hemmed in voice strangely enough be sorrow because chief source of past trouble vexation be for ever gone out of reach have not be able to press father hand before parting say father know be all right between never forgot what owed when be lad forgive if have be too hot hasty now then adam thought little to day of hard work earnings have spent on father thought ran constantly on what old man feeling have be in moment of humiliation when have held down head before rebuke of son when indignation be borne in submissive silence be apt to feel twinge of doubt afterwards a to own generosity if not justice how much more when object of anger have gone into everlasting silence have seen face for last time in meekness of death ah be always too hard adam said to sore fault in a im so hot out o patience with people when do wrong heart get shut up against em so a cant bring to forgive em see clear enough there more pride love in soul for must sooner make thousand stroke with th hammer for father than bring to say kind word to there went plenty o pride temper to stroke a devil will be having finger in what call duty a well a sin mayhap best thing ever did in life be only doing what be easiest for allays be easier for to work to sit still real tough job for ud be to master own will temper go right against own pride seems to now if be to find father at home to night must behave different there knowingperhaps nothing ud be lesson to if didnt come too late well must feel a life reckoning cant make twice over there real making amends in world more can mend wrong subtraction by doing addition right be key note to adam thought have perpetually returned since father death solemn wail of funeral psalm be only influence brought back old thought with stronger emphasis so be sermon mr irwine have chosen with reference to thiass funeral spoke briefly simply of word in midst of life be in deathhow present moment be can call own for work of mercy of righteous dealing of family tenderness very old truthsbut what thought oldest truth becomes most startling to in week when have looked on dead face of one who have made part of own life for when men want to impress with effect of new wonderfully vivid light do not let fall on most familiar object that may measure intensity by remembering former dimness then came moment of final blessing when forever sublime word peace of god passeth understanding seemed to blend with calm afternoon sunshine fell on bowed head of congregation then quiet rising mother tying on bonnet of little maiden who have slept through sermon father collecting prayer book until streamed out through old archway into green churchyard began neighbourly talk simple civility invitation to tea for on sunday one be ready to receive guestit be day when must be in best clothes best humour mr mr poyser paused minute at church gate be waiting for adam to come up not being contented to go away without saying kind word to widow son well mr bede said mr poyser a walked on together must keep up heart husband wife must be content when theyve lived to rear child see one anothers hair grey aye aye said mr

in hand wonderful pink white hot house plant with very long namea scotch name supposed since people said mr craig gardener be scotch adam took opportunity of looking round too be sure will not require of that must feel vexation in observing pouting expression on hettys face a listened to gardener small talk yet in secret heart be glad to have by side for must perhaps learn from how be arthur have not come to church not that cared to ask question hoped information must be given spontaneously for mr craig like superior man be very fond of giving information mr craig be never aware that conversation advance be received coldly for to shift one point of view beyond certain limit be impossible to most liberal expansive mind be none of aware of impression produce on brazilian monkey of feeble understandingit be possible see hardly anything in moreover mr craig be man of sober passion be already in tenth year of hesitation a to relative advantage of matrimony bachelorhood be true now then when have be little heated by extra glass of grog have be heard to say of hetty that lass be well enough that man might do worse on convivial occasion men be apt to express strongly martin poyser held mr craig in honour a man who knew business who have great light concerning soil compost be le of favourite with mr poyser who have more than once said in confidence to husband youre mighty fond o craig for part think he welly like cock a think sun rose o purpose to hear crow for rest mr craig be estimable gardener be not without reason for having high opinion of have also high shoulder high

farther for now have reached turning in road where adam companion must say good bye gardener too must have have to turn off in same direction if have not accepted mr poysers invitation to tea mr poyser duly seconded invitation for must have held deep disgrace not to make neighbour welcome to house personal like dislike must not interfere with sacred custom moreover mr craig have always be full of civility to family at hall farm mr poyser be scrupulous in declaring that have nothing to say again ony be pity couldna be hatched oer again hatched different so adam seth with mother between wound way down to valley up again to old house where saddened memory have taken place of long long anxietywhere adam must never have to ask again a entered wheres father other family party with mr craig for company went back to pleasant bright house place at hall farmall with quiet mind except hetty who knew now where arthur be gone be only more puzzled uneasy for appeared that absence be quite voluntary need not have gonehe must not have gone if have wanted to see have sickening sense that lot must ever be pleasant to again if thursday night vision be not to be fulfilled in moment of chill bare wintry disappointment doubt looked towards possibility of being with arthur again of meeting loving glance hearing soft word with eager yearning one may call growing pain of passion chapter xix adam on working day notwithstanding mr craigs prophecy dark blue cloud dispersed without having produced threatened consequence weatheras observed next morningthe weather see s ticklish thing fool ull hit ont sometimes when wise man miss thats why almanecks get so much credit one o chancy thing a fool thrive on unreasonable behaviour of weather however must displease one else in hayslope besides mr craig hand be to be out in meadow morning a soon a dew have risen wife daughter did double work in farmhouse that maid might give help in tossing hay when adam be marching along lane with basket of tool over shoulder caught sound of jocose talk ringing laughter from behind hedge jocose talk of hay maker be best at distance like clumsy bell round cow neck have rather coarse sound when come close may even grate on ear painfully heard from far off mingles very prettily with other joyous sound of nature men muscle move better when soul be making merry music though merriment be of poor blundering sort not at like merriment of bird perhaps there be time in summer day more cheering than when warmth of sun be just beginning to triumph over freshness of morningwhen there be just lingering hint of early coolness to keep off languor under delicious influence of warmth reason adam be walking along lane at time be because work for rest of day lay at country house about three mile off be being put in repair for son of neighbouring squire have be busy since early morning with packing of panel door chimney piece in waggon be now gone on before while jonathan burge have ridden to spot on horseback to await arrival direct workman little walk be rest to adam be unconsciously under charm of moment be summer morning in heart saw hetty in sunshinea sunshine without glare with slanting ray tremble between delicate shadow of leaf thought yesterday when put out hand to a came out of church that there be touch of melancholy kindness in face such a have not seen before took a sign that have sympathy with family trouble poor fellow that touch of melancholy came from quite source how be to know look at one little woman face love a look at face of mother earth see sort of answer to own yearning be impossible for adam not to feel that what have happened in last week have brought prospect of marriage nearer to hitherto have felt keenly danger that other man might step in get possession of hettys heart hand while be still in position that made shrink from asking to accept even if have have strong hope that be fond of himand hope be far from being stronghe have be too heavily burdened with other claim to provide home for hettya home such a must expect to be content with after comfort plenty of farm like strong nature adam have confidence in ability to achieve something in future felt sure must day if lived be able to maintain family make good broad path for have too cool head not to estimate to full obstacle be to be overcome time must be so long there be hetty like bright cheeked apple hanging over orchard wall within sight of everybody everybody must long for to be sure if loved very much must be content to wait for did love hope have never risen so high that have dared to ask be clear sighted enough to be aware that uncle aunt must have looked kindly on suit indeed without encouragement must never have persevered in going to farm be impossible to come to fluctuating conclusion about hettys feeling be like kitten have same distractingly pretty look that meant nothing for everybody came near now must not help saying to that heaviest part of burden be removed that even before end of year circumstance might be brought into shape must allow to think of marrying must always be hard struggle with mother knew must be jealous of wife might choose have set mind especially against hettyperhaps for other reason than suspected hetty to be woman have chosen must never do feared for mother to live in same house with when be married yet how hard must think if asked to leave yes there be great deal of pain to be gone through with mother be case in must make feel that will be strongit must be better for in end for must have liked that must live together till seth be married might have built bit to old house made more room did not like to part wi th lad have hardly ever be separated for more than day since be born adam have sooner caught imagination leaping forward in waymaking arrangement for uncertain futurethan checked pretty building im making without brick timber im up garret aready havent so much a dug foundation whenever adam be strongly convinced of proposition took form of principle in mind be knowledge to be acted on a much a knowledge that damp will cause rust perhaps here lay secret of hardness have accused of have too little fellow feeling with weakness errs in spite of foreseen consequence without fellow feeling how be to get enough patience charity towards stumbling falling companion in long changeful journey there be one way in strong determined soul can learn itby getting heart string bound round weak erring so that must share not only outward consequence of error inward suffering be long hard lesson adam have at present only learned alphabet of in father sudden death by annihilating in instant all have stimulated indignation have sent sudden rush of thought memory over what have claimed pity tenderness be adam strength not correlative hardness influenced meditation morning have long made up mind that must be wrong a well a foolish for to marry blooming young girl so long a have other prospect than of growing poverty with growing family saving have be so constantly drawn upon besides terrible sweep of paying for seth substitute in militia that have not enough money beforehand to furnish even small cottage keep something in reserve against rainy day have good hope that must be firmer on leg by by must not be satisfied with vague confidence in arm brain must have definite plan set about at once partnership with jonathan burge be not to be thought of at presentthere be thing implicitly tacked to that must not accept adam thought that seth might carry on little business for in addition to journeyman work by buying small stock of superior wood making article of household furniture for adam have end of contrivance seth might gain more by working at separate job under adam direction than by journeyman work adam in overhours must do nice work required peculiar skill money gained in way with good wage received a foreman must soon enable to get beforehand with world so sparingly a must live now sooner have little plan shaped in mind than began to be busy with exact calculation about wood to be bought particular article of furniture must be undertaken firsta kitchen cupboard of own contrivance with ingenious arrangement of sliding door bolt such convenient nook for stowing household provender symmetrical result to eye good housewife must be in rapture with fall through gradation of melancholy longing till husband promised to buy for adam pictured to mr poyser examining with keen eye trying in vain to find out deficiency of course close to mr poyser stood hetty adam be again beguiled from calculation contrivance into dream hope yes must go see eveningit be so long since have be at hall farm must have liked to go to night school to see why bartle massey have not be at church yesterday for feared old friend be ill unless must manage visit last must be put off till to morrowthe desire to be near hetty to speak to again be too strong a made up mind to be coming very near to end of walk within sound of hammer at work on refitting of old house sound of tool to clever workman who love work be like tentative sound of orchestra to violinist who have to bear part in overture strong fibre begin accustomed thrill be moment before joy vexation ambition begin change into energy passion becomes strength when have outlet from narrow limit of personal lot in labour of right arm cunning of right hand still creative activity of thought look at adam through rest of day a stand on scaffolding with two foot ruler in hand whistling low while considers how

in little lass aye do tell to come to mother in dairy adam walked round by rick yard at present empty of rick to little wooden gate leading into gardenonce well tended kitchen garden of manor house now for handsome brick wall with stone coping that ran along one side of true farmhouse garden with hardy perennial flower unpruned fruit tree kitchen vegetable growing together in careless half neglected abundance in leafy flowery bushy time to look for one in garden be like playing at hide seek there be tall hollyhock beginning to flower dazzle eye with pink white yellow there be syringa guelder rose large disorderly for want of trimming there be leafy wall of scarlet bean late pea there be row of bushy filbert in one direction in huge apple tree making barren circle under low spreading bough what signified barren patch two garden be so large there be always superfluity of broad beansit took nine ten of adam stride to get to end of uncut grass walk that ran by side of a for other vegetable there be so much more room than be necessary for in rotation of crop large flourishing bed of groundsel be of yearly occurrence on one spot other very rose tree at adam stopped to pluck one looked a if grew wild be huddled together in bushy mass now flaunting with wide open petal almost of of streaked pink white kind doubtless dated from union of house of york lancaster adam be wise enough to choose compact provence rose that peeped out half smothered by flaunting scentless neighbour held in handhe thought must be more at ease holding something in handas walked on to far end of garden where remembered there be largest row of currant tree not far off from great yew tree arbour have not gone many step beyond rose when heard shaking of bough boy voice saying now then totty hold out pinnytheres duck voice came from bough of tall cherry tree where adam have difficulty in discerning small blue pinafored figure perched in commodious position where fruit be thickest doubtless totty be below behind screen of pea yeswith bonnet hanging down back fat face dreadfully smeared with red juice turned up towards cherry tree while held little round hole of mouth red stained pinafore to receive promised downfall be sorry to say more than cherry fell be hard yellow instead of juicy red totty spent time in useless regret be already sucking third juiciest when adam said there now totty youve got cherry run into house with em to mothershe want youshes in dairy run in minutetheres good little girl lifted up in strong arm kissed a spoke ceremony totty regarded a tiresome interruption to cherry eating when set down trotted off quite silently towards house sucking cherry a went along tommy lad take care youre not shot for little thieving bird said adam a walked on towards currant tree must see there be large basket at end of row hetty must not be far off adam already felt a if be looking at yet when turned corner be standing with back towards stooping to gather low hanging fruit strange that have not heard coming perhaps be because be making leaf rustle started when became conscious that one be nearstarted so violently that dropped basin with currant in then when saw be adam turned from pale to deep red that blush made heart beat with new happiness hetty have never blushed at seeing before frightened said with delicious sense that didnt signify what said since hetty seemed to feel a much a did let pick currant up be soon done for have only fallen in tangled mass on grass plot adam a rose gave basin again looked straight into eye with subdued tenderness belongs to first moment of hopeful love hetty did not turn away eye blush have subsided met glance with quiet sadness contented adam because be so unlike anything have seen in before there not many more currant to get said will soon have done now ill help said adam fetched large basket be nearly full of currant set close to not word more be spoken a gathered currant adam heart be too full to speak thought hetty knew be in be not indifferent to presence after have blushed when saw then there be that touch of sadness about must surely mean love since be opposite of usual manner have often impressed a indifference must glance at continually a bent over fruit while level evening sunbeam stole through thick apple tree bough rested on round cheek neck a if too be in love with be to adam time that man can least forget in after life time when belief that first woman have ever loved betrays by slight somethinga word tone glance quivering of lip eyelidthat be at least beginning to love in return sign be so slight be scarcely perceptible to ear eyehe must describe to oneit be mere feather touch yet seems to have changed whole being to have merged uneasy yearning into delicious unconsciousness of everything present moment so much of early gladness vanishes utterly from memory can never recall joy with laid head on mother bosom rode on father back in childhood doubtless that joy be wrought up into nature a sunlight of long past morning be wrought up in soft mellowness of apricot be gone for ever from imagination can only believe in joy of childhood first glad moment in first love be vision return to to last brings with thrill of feeling intense special a recurrent sensation of sweet odour breathed in far off hour of happiness be memory give more exquisite touch to tenderness feed madness of jealousy add last keenness to agony of despair hetty bending over red bunch level ray piercing screen of apple tree bough length of bushy garden beyond own emotion a looked at believed that be thinking of that there be need for to talkadam remembered to last moment of life hetty know quite well that adam be mistaken about like many other men thought sign of love for be sign of love towards when adam be approaching unseen by be absorbed a usual in thinking wondering about arthur possible return sound of man footstep must have affected just in same wayshe must have felt might be arthur before have time to see blood forsook cheek in agitation of momentary feeling must have rushed back again at sight of one else just a much a at sight of adam be not wrong in thinking that change have come over anxiety fear of first passion with be trembling have become stronger than vanity have given for first time that sense of helpless dependence on anothers feeling awakens clinging deprecating womanhood even in willowest girl can ever experience creates in sensibility to kindness found quite hard before for first time hetty felt that there be something soothing to in adam timid yet manly tenderness wanted to be treated lovinglyoh be very hard to bear blank of absence silence apparent indifference after moment of glowing love be not afraid that adam must tease with love making flattering speech like other admirer have always be so reserved to must enjoy without fear sense that strong brave man loved be near never entered into mind that adam be pitiable toothat adam too must suffer one day hetty know be not first woman have behaved more gently to man who loved in vain because have begun to love be very old story adam knew nothing about so drank in sweet delusion thatll do said hetty after little while aunt want to leave on tree ill take em in now very well came to carry basket said adam for ud have be too heavy for little arm must have carried with hand oh daresay said adam smiling be a long getting into house a little ant carrying caterpillar have ever seen tiny fellow carrying thing four time a big a said hetty indifferently not caring to know difficulty of ant life oh used to watch em often when be lad now see can carry basket with one arm a if be empty nutshell give th other arm to lean on wont such big arm a mine be made for little arm like yours to lean on hetty smiled faintly put arm within adam looked down at eye be turned dreamily towards corner of garden have ever be to eagledale said a walked slowly along yes said adam pleased to have ask question about ten year ago when be lad went with father to see about work there wonderful sightrocks cave such a never saw in life never have right notion o rock till went there how long did take to get there why took best part two day walking nothing of day journey for anybody a have got first rate nag captain ud get there in nine ten hour ill be bound he such

right thing for for ud give plenty to do hed dot well too for he so young he got better notion o thing than many man twice age spoke very handsome to th other day about lending money to set up business if thing came round that way id rather be beholding to to man world poor adam be led on to speak about arthur because thought hetty must be pleased to know that young squire be so ready to befriend fact entered into future prospect must like to seem promising in eye be true that hetty listened with interest brought new light into eye half smile upon lip how pretty rose be now adam continued pausing to look at see stole prettiest didna mean to keep think a be pink have got finer sort o green leaf be prettier than striped un dont set down basket took rose from button hole smell very sweet said striped un have smell stick in frock then can put in water after ud be pity to let fade hetty took rose smiling a did so at pleasant thought that arthur must so soon get back if liked there be flash of hope happiness in mind with sudden impulse of gaiety did what have very often done beforestuck rose in hair little above left ear tender admiration in adam face be slightly shadowed by reluctant disapproval hettys love of finery be just thing must most provoke mother disliked a much a be possible for to dislike anything belonged to ah said thats like lady in picture at chase theyve mostly got flower feather gold thing hair somehow dont like to see em allays put mind o painted woman outside show at treddleson fair what can woman have to set off better than own hair when

with own look like when man singing good tuneyou dont want t hear bell tinkling interfering wi sound took arm put within again looking down on fondly be afraid must think have lectured her imagining a be apt to do that have perceived thought have only half expressed thing dreaded most be lest cloud must come over evening happiness for world must not have spoken of love to hetty yet till commencing kindness towards must have grown into unmistakable love in imagination saw long year of future life stretching before blest with right to call hetty own must be content with very little at present so

hand on door latch must see through curtainless window that there be eight nine head bending over desk lighted by thin dip when entered reading lesson be going forward bartle massey merely nodded leaving to take place where pleased have not come for sake of lesson to night mind be too full of personal matter too full of last two hour have passed in hettys presence for to amuse with book till school be over so sat down in corner looked on with absent mind be sort of scene adam have beheld almost weekly for year knew by heart arabesque flourish in framed specimen of bartle masseys handwriting hung over schoolmaster head by way of keeping lofty ideal before mind of pupil knew back of book on shelf running along whitewashed wall above peg for slate knew exactly how many grain be gone out of ear of indian corn hung from one of rafter have long ago exhausted resource of imagination in trying to think how bunch of leathery seaweed have looked grown in native element from place where sat must make nothing of old map of england that hung against opposite wall for age have turned of fine yellow brown something like of well seasoned drama be going on be almost a familiar a scene nevertheless habit have not made indifferent to even in present self absorbed mood adam felt momentary stirring of old fellow feeling a looked at rough men painfully holding pen pencil with cramped hand humbly labouring through reading lesson reading class now seated on form in front of schoolmaster desk consisted of three most backward pupil adam must have known only by seeing bartle masseys face a looked over spectacle have shifted to ridge of nose not requiring for present purpose face wore mildest expression grizzled bushy eyebrow have taken more acute angle of compassionate kindness mouth habitually compressed with pout of lower lip be relaxed so a to be ready to speak helpful word syllable in moment gentle expression be more interesting because schoolmaster nose

tellin em one from sawyer business not being concerned with minute difference such a exist between letter with tail turned up letter with tail turned down bill have firm determination that must learn to read founded chiefly on two reason first that tom hazelow cousin must read anything right off whether be print writing tom have sent letter from twenty mile off saying how be prospering in world have got overlookers place secondly that sam phillips who sawed with have learned to read when be turned twenty what must be done by little fellow like sam phillips bill considered must be done by seeing that must pound sam into wet clay if circumstance required so here be pointing big finger towards three word at once turning head on one side that might keep better hold with eye of one word be to be discriminated out of group amount of knowledge bartle massey must posse be something so dim vast that bill imagination recoiled before must hardly have ventured to deny that schoolmaster might have something to do in bringing about regular return of daylight change in weather man seated next to bill be of very different type be methodist brickmaker who after spending thirty year of life in perfect satisfaction with ignorance have lately got religion along with desire to read bible with too learning be heavy business on way out to night have offered a usual special prayer for help seeing

casson a next broadest be to be vice owing to arrangement adam being of course at bottom of table fell under immediate observation of mr casson who too much occupied with question of precedence have

white frock sooner be little fat leg pushed down than up came again for tottys eye be too busy in staring at large dish to see where plum pudding be for to retain consciousness of leg hetty got quite out of patience at last with frown pout gathering tear said oh dear aunt wish youd speak to totty keep putting leg up so messing frock whats matter wi child can niver please said mother let come by

adam eye be fixed on thought that so sensible man a adam must be reflecting on small value of beauty in woman whose temper be bad mary be good girl not given to indulge in evil feeling said to herself that since hetty have bad temper be better adam must know be quite true that if hetty have be plain must have looked very ugly unamiable at moment one moral judgment upon must have be in least beguiled really there be something quite charming in pettishness looked so much more like innocent distress than ill humour severe adam felt movement of disapprobation only felt sort of amused pity a if have seen kitten setting up back little bird with feather ruffled must not gather what be vexing be impossible to to feel otherwise than be prettiest thing in world that if must have way nothing must ever vex more presently when totty be gone caught eye face broke into one of brightest smile a nodded to be bit of flirtationshe knew mary burge be looking at smile be like wine to adam chapter

tribute for first time arthur have felt twinge of conscience during mr poysers speech be too feeble to nullify pleasure felt in being praised did not deserve what be said of on whole if there be something in conduct that poyser wouldnt have liked if have known why man conduct will bear too close inspection poyser be not likely to know after what have done gone little too far perhaps in flirtation man in place must have acted much worse harm must comeno harm must come for next time be alone with hetty must explain to that must not think seriously of of what have passed be necessary to arthur perceive to be satisfied with uncomfortable thought must be got rid of by good intention for future can be formed so rapidly that have time to be uncomfortable to become easy again before mr

of so much older be men of experience still have interested good deal in such matter learned a much about a opportunity have allowed when course of event will place estate in hand will be first desire to afford tenant encouragement landlord can give in improving land trying to bring about better practice of husbandry will be wish to be looked on by deserving tenant a best friend nothing must make so happy a to be able to respect man on estate to be respected by in return be not place at present to enter into particular only meet good hope concerning by telling that own hope correspond to themthat what expect from desire to fulfil be quite of mr poysers opinion that when man have said what mean have better stop pleasure feel in having own health drunk by must not be perfect if did not drink health of grandfather who have filled place of parent to will say no more until have joined in drinking health on day when have wished to appear among a future representative of name family perhaps there be one present except mr irwine who thoroughly understood approved arthur graceful mode of proposing grandfather health farmer thought young squire knew well enough that hated old squire

refinement of face be much more striking than of arthur when seen in comparison with people round arthur be much commoner british face splendour of new fashioned clothes be more akin to young farmer taste in costume than mr irwines powder well brushed well worn black seemed to be chosen suit for great occasion for have mysterious secret of never wearing new looking coat be not first time by great many said that have have to thank parishioner for giving token of goodwill neighbourly kindness be among thing be more precious older get indeed pleasant meeting to day be proof when what be good come

of militia dignity a if have be elevation to premiership have not least objection to gratify in way uniform be very advantageous to figure old squire before sitting down walked round hall to greet tenant make polite speech to wife be always polite farmer have found out after long puzzling that polish be one of sign of hardness be observed that gave most elaborate civility to mr poyser to night inquiring particularly about health recommending to strengthen with cold water a did avoid drug mr poyser curtsied thanked with great self command when have passed on whispered to husband ill lay life

must let take to aunt for claim a partner wife pale cheek flushed with nervous sense of unwonted honour a arthur led to top of room mr poyser to whom extra glass have restored youthful confidence in

parish miss irwine danced with luke britton largest broxton farmer mr gawaine led out mr britton mr irwine after seating sister anne have gone to abbey gallery a have agreed with arthur beforehand to see how merriment of cottager be prospering meanwhile le distinguished couple have taken place hetty be led out by inevitable mr craig mary burge by adam now music struck up glorious country dance best of dance began pity be not boarded floor then rhythmic stamping of thick shoe must have be better than drum that merry stamping that gracious nodding of head that waving bestowal of handwhere can see now that simple dancing of well covered matron laying aside for hour care of house dairy remembering not affecting not jealous proud of young maiden by sidethat holiday sprightliness of portly husband paying little compliment to wife a if courting day be come againthose lad lass little confused awkward with partner having nothing to sayit must be pleasant variety to see sometimes instead of low dress large skirt scanning glance exploring costume languid men in lacquered boot smiling with double meaning there be one thing to mar martin poysers pleasure in dance be that be always in close contact with luke britton that slovenly farmer thought of throwing little glazed coldness into eye in crossing of hand then a miss irwine be opposite to instead of offensive luke might freeze wrong person so gave face up to hilarity unchilled by moral judgment how hettys heart beat a arthur approached have hardly looked at to day now must take hand must press must look at thought must cry if gave sign of feeling now be therehe have taken handyes be pressing hetty turned pale a looked up at for instant met eye before dance carried away that pale look came upon arthur like beginning of dull pain clung to though must dance smile joke same hetty must look so when told what have to tell must never be able to bear ithe must be fool give way again hettys look did not really mean so much a thought be only sign of struggle between desire for to notice dread lest must betray desire to others hettys face have language transcended feeling there be face nature charge with meaning pathos not belonging to single human soul that flutter beneath speaking joy sorrow of foregone generationseyes tell of deep love doubtless have be be somewhere not paired with eyesperhaps paired with pale eye can say nothing just a national language may be instinct with poetry unfelt by lip use that look of hettys oppressed arthur with dread yet have something of terrible unconfessed delight in that loved too well there be hard task before for at moment felt must have given up three year of youth for happiness of abandoning without remorse to passion for hetty be incongruous thought in mind a led poyser who be panting with fatigue secretly resolving that judge jury must force to dance dance to take quiet rest in dining room where supper be laid out for guest to come take a chose ive desired hetty to remember a shes got to dance wi sir said good innocent woman for shes so thoughtless shed be like enough to go engage herself for ivery dance so told not to promise too many thank mr poyser said arthur not without twinge now sit down in comfortable chair here be mill ready to give what must like best hurried away to seek matronly partner for due honour must be paid to married woman before asked of young one country dance stamping gracious nodding waving of hand went on joyously at last time have come for fourth dancelonged for by strong grave adam a if have be delicate handed youth of eighteen for be very much alike when be in first love adam have hardly ever touched hettys hand for more than transient greetinghad never danced with once before eye have followed eagerly to night in spite of have taken in deeper draught of love thought behaved so prettily so quietly did not seem to be flirting at smiled le than usual there be almost sweet sadness about god bless said inwardly id make life happy un if strong arm to work for heart to love must do then there stole over delicious thought of coming home from work drawing hetty to side feeling cheek softly pressed against till forgot where be music tread of foot might have be falling of rain roaring of wind for what knew now third dance be ended might go up to claim hand be at far end of hall near staircase whispering with molly who have just given sleeping totty into arm before running to fetch shawl bonnet from landing mr poyser have taken two boy away into dining room to give cake before went home in cart with grandfather molly be to follow a fast a possible let hold said adam a molly turned upstairs child be so heavy when theyre asleep hetty be glad of relief for to hold totty in arm standing be not at pleasant variety to second transfer have unfortunate effect of rousing totty who be not behind child of age in peevishness at unseasonable awaking while hetty be in act of placing in adam arm have not yet withdrawn own totty opened eye forthwith fought out with left fist at adam arm with right caught at string of brown bead round hettys neck locket leaped out from frock next moment string be broken hetty helpless saw bead locket scattered wide on floor locket locket said in loud frightened whisper to adam never mind bead adam have already seen where locket fell for have attracted glance a leaped out of frock have fallen on raised wooden dais where band sat not on stone floor a adam picked up saw glass with dark light lock of hair under have fallen that side upwards so glass be not broken turned over on hand saw enamelled gold back isnt hurt said a held towards hetty who be unable to take because hand be occupied with totty oh doesnt matter dont mind about said hetty who have be pale be now red not matter said adam gravely seemed very frightened about ill hold till youre ready to take added quietly closing hand over that might not think wanted to look at again by time molly have come with bonnet shawl a soon a have taken totty adam placed locket in hettys hand took with air of indifference put in pocket in heart vexed angry with adam because have seen determined now that must show more sign of agitation see said theyre taking place to dance let go adam assented silently puzzled alarm have taken possession of have hetty lover didnt know of for none of relation be sure must give locket like none of admirer with whom be acquainted be in position of accepted lover a giver of locket must be adam be lost in utter impossibility of finding person for fear to alight on must only feel with terrible pang that there be something in hettys life unknown to that while have be rocking in hope that must come to love be already loving pleasure of dance with hetty be gone eye when rested on have uneasy questioning expression in must think of nothing to say to too be out of temper disinclined to speak be glad when dance be ended adam be determined to stay no longer one wanted one must notice if slipped away a soon a got out of door began to walk at habitual rapid pace hurrying along without knowing why busy with painful thought that memory of day so full of honour promise to be poisoned for ever suddenly when be far on through chase stopped startled by flash of reviving hope after might be fool making great misery out of trifle hetty fond of finery a be might have bought thing looked too expensive for thatit looked like thing on white satin in great jeweller shop at rosseter adam have very imperfect notion of value of such thing thought must certainly not cost more than guinea perhaps hetty have have a much a in christmas box there be knowing might have be childish enough to spend in way be such young thing couldnt help loving finery then why have be so frightened about at first changed colour so afterwards pretended not to care oh be because be ashamed of seeing that have such smart thingshe be conscious that be wrong for to spend money on knew that adam disapproved of finery be proof cared about what liked disliked must have thought from silence gravity afterwards that be very much displeased with that be inclined to be harsh severe towards foible a walked on more quietly chewing cud of new hope only uneasiness be that have behaved in way might chill hettys feeling towards for last view of matter must be true one how must hetty have accepted lover quite unknown to be never away from uncle house for more than day must have acquaintance did not come there intimacy unknown to uncle aunt must be folly to believe that locket be given to by lover little ring of dark hair felt sure be own must form guess about light hair under for have not seen very distinctly might be bit of father mother who have died when be child must naturally put bit of own along with so adam went to bed comforted having woven for ingenious web of probabilitiesthe surest screen wise man can place between truth last waking thought melted into dream that be with hetty again at hall farm that be asking to forgive for being so cold silent while be dreaming arthur be leading hetty to dance saying to in low hurried tone will be in wood day after to morrow at seven come a early a can hettys foolish joy hope have flown away for little space scared by mere nothing now came fluttering back unconscious of real peril be happy for first time

shadow sun be hidden for moment then shone out warm again like recovered joy leaf still green be tossed off hedgerow tree by wind around farmhouse there be sound of clapping door apple fell in orchard stray horse on green side of lane on common have mane blown about face yet wind seemed only part of general gladness because sun be shining merry day for child who ran shouted to see if must top wind with voice grown up people too be in good spirit inclined to believe in yet finer day when wind have fallen if only corn be not ripe enough to be blown out of husk scattered a untimely seed yet day on

be contented with only slight remark on hettys being later than be expected while hetty who have looked out of spirit when met smiled talked waited on with unusual promptitude be last time have seen meant to make leisure for going to farm to morrow to day knew be day for going to chase to sew with lady maid so must get a much work done a possible evening that next might be clear one piece of work that adam be superintending be slight repair at chase farm have be hitherto occupied by satchell a bailiff be now rumoured that old squire be going to let to smart man in top boot who have be seen to ride over one day nothing desire to get tenant must account for squire undertaking repair though saturday evening party at mr cassons agreed over pipe that man in sens must take chase farm unless there be bit more ploughland laid to however that might be repair be ordered to be executed with dispatch adam acting for mr burge be carrying out order with usual energy to day having be occupied elsewhere have not be able to arrive at chase farm till late in afternoon then discovered that old roofing have calculated on preserving have given way there be clearly no good to be done with part of building without pulling down adam immediately saw in mind plan for building up again so a to make most convenient of cow shed calf pen with hovel for implement without great expense for material so when workman be gone sat down took out pocket book busied with sketching plan making specification of expense that might show to burge next morning set on persuading squire to consent to make good job of anything however small be always pleasure to adam sat on block with book resting on planing table whistling low now then turning head on one side with just perceptible smile of gratificationof pride too for if adam loved bit of good work loved also to think did believe only people who be free from weakness be who have work to call own be nearly seven before have finished put on jacket again on giving last look round observed that seth who have be working here to day have left basket of tool behind why th lad forgot tool thought adam he got to work up at shop to morrow there never be such chap for wool gathering hed leave head behind if be loose however lucky ive seen em ill carry home building of chase farm lay at one extremity of chase at about ten minute walking distance from abbey adam have come thither on pony intending to ride to stable put up nag on way home at stable encountered mr craig who have come to look at captain new horse on be to ride away day after to morrow mr craig detained to tell how servant be to collect at gate of courtyard to wish young squire luck a rode out so that by time adam have got into chase be striding along with basket of tool over shoulder sun be on point of setting be sending level crimson ray among great trunk of old oak touching bare patch of ground with transient glory made look like jewel dropt upon grass wind have fallen now there be only enough breeze to stir delicate stemmed leaf one who have be sitting in house day must have be glad to walk now adam have be quite enough in open air to wish to shorten way home bethought that might do so by striking across chase going through grove where have never be for year hurried on across chase stalking along narrow path between fern with gyp at heel not lingering to watch magnificent change of lighthardly once thinking of ityet feeling presence in certain calm happy awe mingled with busy working day thought how must help feeling very deer felt be more timid presently adam thought recurred to what mr craig have said about arthur donnithorne pictured going away change might take place before came back then travelled back affectionately over old scene of boyish companionship dwelt on arthur good quality adam have pride in a have in virtue of superior who honour nature like adam with great need of love reverence in depends for so much of happiness on what can believe feel about others have ideal world of dead hero knew little of life of men in past must find being to whom must cling with loving admiration among who came within speech of pleasant thought about arthur brought milder expression than usual into keen rough face perhaps be reason why when opened old green gate leading into grove paused to pat gyp say kind word to after pause strode on again along broad winding path through grove what grand beech adam delighted in fine tree of thing a fisherman sight be keenest on sea so adam perception be more at home with tree than with other object kept in memory a painter doe with fleck knot in bark curve angle of bough have often calculated height content of trunk to nicety a stood looking at wonder that not withstanding desire to get on must not help pausing to look at curious large beech have seen standing before at turning in road convince that be not two tree wedded together only one for rest of life remembered that moment when be calmly examining beech a man remembers last glimpse of home where youth be passed before road turned saw more beech stood at last turning before grove ended in archway of bough let in eastern light a adam stepped away from tree to continue walk eye fell on two figure about twenty yard before remained a motionless a statue turned almost a pale two figure be standing opposite to other with clasped hand about to part while be bending to kiss gyp who have be running among brushwood came out caught sight of gave sharp bark separated with startone hurried through gate out of grove other turning round walked slowly with sort of saunter towards adam who still stood transfixed pale clutching tighter stick with held basket of tool over shoulder looking at approaching figure with eye in amazement be fast turning to fierceness arthur donnithorne looked flushed excited have tried to make unpleasant feeling more bearable by drinking little more wine than usual at dinner to day be still enough under flattering influence to think more lightly of unwished for rencontre with adam than must otherwise have done after adam be best person who must have happened to see hetty togetherhe be sensible fellow must not babble about to other people arthur felt confident that must laugh thing off explain away so sauntered forward with elaborate carelessnesshis flushed face evening dress of fine cloth fine linen hand half thrust into waistcoat pocket shone upon by strange evening light light cloud have caught up even to zenith be now shedding down between topmost branch above adam be still motionless looking at a came up understood nowthe locket everything else have be doubtful to terrible scorching light showed hidden letter changed meaning of past if have moved muscle must inevitably have sprung upon arthur like tiger in conflicting emotion filled long moment have told that must not give loose to passion must only speak right thing stood a if petrified by unseen force force be own strong will well adam said arthur youve be looking at fine old beech eh theyre not to be come near by hatchet though be sacred grove overtook pretty little hetty sorrel a be coming to denthe hermitage there ought not to come home way so late so took care of to gate asked for kiss for pain must get back now for road be confoundedly damp good night adam will see to morrowto say good bye know arthur be too much preoccupied with part be playing to be thoroughly aware of expression in adam face did not look directly at adam glanced carelessly round at tree then lifted up one foot to look at sole of boot cared to say morehe have thrown quite dust enough into honest adam eyesand a spoke last word walked on stop bit sir said adam in hard peremptory voice without turning round ive got word to say to arthur paused in surprise susceptible person be more affected by change of tone than by unexpected word arthur have susceptibility of nature at once affectionate vain be still more surprised when saw that adam have not moved stood with back to a if summoning to return what did mean be going to make serious business of affair arthur felt temper rising patronising disposition always have meaner side in confusion of irritation alarm there entered feeling that man to whom have shown so much favour a to adam be not in position to criticize conduct yet be dominated a one who feel in wrong always be by man whose good opinion care for in spite of pride temper there be a much deprecation a anger in voice when said what do mean adam mean siranswered adam in same harsh voice still without turning roundi mean sir that dont deceive by light word be not first time youve met hetty sorrel in grove be not first time youve kissed arthur felt startled uncertainty how far adam be speaking from knowledge how far from mere inference uncertainty prevented from contriving prudent answer heightened irritation said in high sharp tone well sir what then why then instead of acting like th upright honourable man weve believed to be youve be acting part of selfish light minded scoundrel know a well a do what to lead to when gentleman like kiss make love to young woman like hetty give present a shes frightened for other folk to see say again youre acting part of selfish light minded scoundrel though cut to th heart to say so id rather have lost right hand let tell adam said arthur bridling growing anger trying to recur to careless tone youre not only devilishly impertinent youre talking nonsense pretty girl be not such fool a to suppose that when gentleman admires beauty pay little attention must mean something particular man like to flirt with pretty girl pretty girl like to be flirted with wider distance between le harm there be for then shes not likely to deceive dont know what mean by flirting said adam if mean behaving to woman a if loved yet not loving while say thats not th action of honest man what isnt honest doe come t harm im not fool youre not fool know better than what youre saying know couldnt be made public a youve behaved to hetty a y have done without losing character bringing shame trouble on relation what if meant nothing by kissing present other folk wont believe a youve meant nothing dont tell about not deceiving tell a youve filled mind so with thought of a itll mayhap poison life shell never love man a ud make good husband arthur have felt sudden relief while adam be speaking perceived that adam have positive knowledge of past that there be irrevocable damage done by evening unfortunate rencontre adam must still be deceived candid arthur have brought into position in successful lying be only hope hope allayed anger little well adam said in tone of friendly concession youre perhaps right perhaps ive gone little too far in taking notice of pretty little thing stealing kiss now then youre grave steady fellow dont understand temptation to such trifling im sure wouldnt bring trouble annoyance on good poysers on account if must help think look little too seriously at know im going away immediately so shant make more mistake of kind let say good nightarthur here turned round to walk onand talk more about matter whole thing will soon be forgotten by god adam burst out with rage must be controlled no longer throwing down basket of tool striding forward till be right in front of arthur jealousy sense of personal injury have be hitherto trying to keep under have leaped up mastered what man of in first moment of sharp agony must ever feel that fellow man who have be medium of inflicting did not mean to hurt in instinctive rebellion against pain be child again demand active will to wreak vengeance on adam at moment must only feel that have be robbed of hettyrobbed treacherously by man in whom have trustedand stood close in front of arthur with fierce eye glaring at with pale lip clenched hand hard tone in have hitherto be constraining to express more than just indignation giving way to deep agitated voice seemed to shake a spoke itll not be soon forgot a youve come in between when might have loved not soon be forgot a youve robbed o happiness while thought be best friend noble minded man a be proud to work for be kissing meaning nothing have never kissed lifebut id have worked hard for year for right to kiss make light of think little o doing what may damage other folk so a get bit o trifling a mean nothing throw back favour for youre not man took for ill never count friend more id rather youd act a enemy fight where standits th amends can make poor adam possessed by rage must find other vent began to throw off coat cap too blind with passion to notice change have taken place in arthur while be speaking arthur lip be now a pale a adam heart be beating violently discovery that adam loved hetty be shock made for moment see in light of adam indignation regard adam suffering a not merely consequence element of error word of hatred contemptthe first have ever heard in lifeseemed like scorching missile be making ineffaceable scar on screening self excuse rarely fall quite away while others respect forsook for instant stood face to face with first great irrevocable evil have ever committed be only twenty one three month agonay much laterhe have thought proudly that man must ever be able to reproach justly first impulse if there have be time for must perhaps have be to utter word of propitiation adam have sooner thrown off coat cap than became aware that arthur be standing pale motionless with hand still thrust in waistcoat pocket what said wont fight like man know wont strike while stand so go away adam said arthur dont want to fight said adam bitterly dont want to fight meyou think im common man a can injure without answering for never meant to injure said arthur with returning anger didnt know loved made love said adam youre double faced manill never believe word say again go away tell said arthur angrily will repent said adam with convulsed voice swear wont go away without fighting do want provoking more tell youre coward scoundrel despise colour have rushed back to arthur face in moment right hand be clenched dealt blow like lightning sent adam staggering backward blood be a thoroughly up a adam now two men forgetting emotion have gone before fought with instinctive fierceness of panther in deepening twilight darkened by tree delicate handed gentleman be match for workman in everything strength arthur skill enabled to protract struggle for long moment between unarmed men battle be to strong where strong be blunderer arthur must sink under well planted blow of adam a steel rod be broken by iron bar blow soon came arthur fell head lying concealed in tuft of fern so adam must only discern darkly clad body stood still in dim light waiting for arthur to rise blow have be given now towards have be straining force of nerve muscleand be good of have done by fighting only satisfied own passion only wreaked own vengeance have not rescued hetty changed pastthere be just a have be sickened at vanity of own rage why did not arthur rise be perfectly motionless time seemed long to adam good god have blow be too much for adam shuddered at thought of own strength a with oncoming of dread knelt down by arthur side lifted head from among fern there be sign of life eye teeth be set horror rushed over adam completely mastered forced upon own belief must feel nothing that death be in arthur face that be helpless before made not single movement knelt like image of despair gazing at image of death chapter xxviii dilemma be only few minute measured by clockthough adam always thought have be long whilebefore perceived gleam of consciousness in arthur face slight shiver through frame intense joy flooded soul brought back of old affection with do feel pain sir said tenderly loosening arthur cravat arthur turned eye on adam with vague stare gave way to slightly startled motion a if from shock of returning memory only shivered again said nothing do feel hurt sir adam said again with trembling in voice arthur put hand up to waistcoat button when adam have unbuttoned took longer breath lay head down said faintly get water if can adam laid head down gently on fern again emptying tool out of flag basket hurried through tree to edge of grove bordering on chase where brook ran below bank when returned with basket leaking still half full arthur looked at with more thoroughly reawakened consciousness can drink drop out o hand sir said adam kneeling down again to lift up arthur head said arthur dip cravat in souse on head water seemed to do good for presently raised little higher resting on adam arm do feel hurt inside sir adam asked again nono hurt said arthur still faintly rather done up after while said suppose fainted away when knocked down yes sir thank god said adam thought be worse what thought youd done for eh come help on leg feel terribly shaky dizzy arthur said a stood leaning on adam arm that blow of yours must have come against like battering ram dont believe can walk alone lean on sir ill get along said adam will sit down bit longer on coat here ill prop y up youll perhaps be better in minute two said arthur ill go to hermitagei think ive got brandy there there short road to little farther on near gate if youll just help on walked slowly with frequent pause without speaking again in of concentration in present have attended first moment of arthur revival have now given way to vivid recollection of previous scene be nearly dark in narrow path among tree within circle of fir tree round hermitage there be room for growing moonlight to enter in at window step be noiseless on thick carpet of fir needle outward stillness seemed to heighten inward consciousness a arthur took key out of pocket placed in adam hand for to open door adam have not known before arthur have furnished old hermitage made retreat for be surprise to when opened door to see snug room with sign of frequent habitation arthur loosed adam arm threw on ottoman youll see hunting bottle somewhere said leather case with bottle glass in adam be not long in finding case there very little brandy in sir said turning downwards over glass a held before window hardly little glassful well give that said arthur with peevishness of physical depression when have taken sip adam said better run to th house sir get more brandy can be there back pretty soon itll be stiff walk home for if dont have something to revive yesgo dont say im ill ask for man pym tell to get from mill not to say im at hermitage get water too adam be relieved to have active taskboth of be relieved to be apart from other for short time adam swift pace must not still eager pain of thinkingof living again with concentrated suffering through last wretched hour looking out from over new sad future arthur lay still for minute after adam be gone presently rose feebly from ottoman peered about slowly in broken moonlight seeking something be short bit of wax candle stood amongst confusion of writing drawing material there be more searching for mean of lighting candle when be done went cautiously round room a if wishing to assure of presence absence of something at last have found slight thing put first in pocket then on second thought took out again thrust deep down into waste paper basket be woman little pink silk neckerchief set candle on table threw down on ottoman again exhausted with effort when adam came back with supply entrance awoke arthur from doze thats right arthur said im tremendously in want of brandy vigour im glad to see youve got light sir said adam ive be thinking id better have asked for lanthorn candle will last long enoughi will soon be up to walking home now cant go before ive seen safe home sir said adam hesitatingly will be better for to staysit down adam sat down remained opposite to other in uneasy silence while arthur slowly drank brandy water with visibly renovating effect began to lie in more voluntary position looked a if be le overpowered by bodily sensation adam be keenly alive to indication a anxiety about arthur condition began to be allayed felt more of impatience one know who have have just indignation suspended by physical state of culprit yet there be one thing on mind to be done before must recur to remonstrance be to confess what have be unjust in own word perhaps longed more to make confession that indignation might be free again a saw sign of returning ease in word again again came to lip went back checked by thought that must be better to leave everything till to morrow a long a be silent did not look at other foreboding came across adam that if began to speak a though remembered pastif looked at other with full recognitionthey must take fire again so sat in silence till bit of wax candle flickered low in socket silence while becoming more irksome to adam arthur have just poured out more brandy water threw one arm behind head drew up one leg in attitude of recovered ease be irresistible temptation to adam to speak what be on mind begin to feel more again sir said a candle went out be half hidden from other in faint moonlight yes dont feel good for muchvery lazy not inclined to move ill go home when ive taken dose there be slight pause before adam said temper got better of said thing a wasnt true id no right to speak a if youd known be doing injury youd ground for knowing ive always kept what felt for a secret a must paused again before went on perhaps judged too harshim apt to be harshand may have acted out o thoughtlessness more than must have believed be possible for man with heart conscience be not put together alike may misjudge one god know joy must have now to think best of arthur wanted to go home without saying morehe be too painfully embarrassed in mind a well a too weak in body to wish for further explanation to night yet be relief to that adam reopened subject in way least difficult for to answer arthur be in wretched position of open generous man who have committed error make deception seem necessity native impulse to give truth in return for truth to meet trust with frank confession must be suppressed duty be becoming question of tactic deed be reacting upon himwas already governing tyrannously forcing into course jarred with habitual feeling only aim seemed admissible to now be to deceive adam to utmost to make adam think better of than deserved when heard word of honest retractationwhen heard sad appeal with adam endedhe be obliged to rejoice in remains of ignorant confidence implied did not answer immediately for have to be judicious not truthful say more about anger adam said at last very languidly for labour of speech be unwelcome to forgive momentary injusticeit be quite natural with exaggerated notion have in mind will be none worse friend in future hope because weve fought have best of be a must be for believe ive be most in wrong of

believe word however thing may look must be wronging hetty more than not to believe said arthur almost violently starting up from ottoman moving away threw into chair again directly saying more feebly seem to forget in suspecting be casting imputation upon nay sir adam said in calmer voice a if be half relievedfor be too straightforward to make distinction between direct falsehood indirect onenay sir thing dont lie level between hetty youre acting with eye open whatever may do how do know whats be in mind shes childas man with conscience in ought to feel bound to take care on may think know youve disturbed mind know shes be fixing heart on for there many thing clear to now a didnt understand before seem to make light o what may feelyou dont think o good god adam let alone arthur burst

loved when while meant nothing ive demand to make of youim not speaking for for ask t undeceive before go away yarent going away for ever if leave behind with notion in head o feeling about same a

youd right to do to young woman a isnt equal speak plain sir cant speak other way there nobody can take care o hetty in thing can do what think needful in matter said arthur more more irritated by mingled distress perplexity without giving promise to will take what measure think proper said adam in abrupt decided tone wont do must know what ground im treading on must be safe a youve put end to what ought never to have be begun dont forget whats owing to a gentleman in thing be man man cant give up there be answer for moment then arthur said ill see to morrow can bear more now im ill rose a spoke reached cap a if intending to go wont see again adam exclaimed with flash of recurring anger suspicion moving towards door placing back against tell can never be wifetell youve be lyingor else promise what ive said adam uttering alternative stood like terrible fate before arthur who have moved forward step two now stopped faint shaken sick in mind body seemed long to of inward struggle of arthursbefore said feebly promise let go adam moved away from door opened when arthur reached step stopped again leaned against door post youre not well enough to walk alone sir said adam take arm again arthur made answer presently walked on adam following after few step stood still again said coldly believe must trouble getting late now there may be alarm set up about at home adam gave arm walked on without uttering word till came where basket tool lay must pick up tool sir adam said theyre brother doubt theyll be rusted if youll please to wait minute arthur stood still without speaking other word passed between till be at side entrance where hoped to get in without being seen by one said then thank neednt trouble further what time will be convenent for to see to morrow sir said adam may send word that youre here at five oclock said arthur not before good night sir said adam heard reply arthur have turned into house chapter xxix next morning arthur did not pas sleepless night slept long well for sleep come to perplexedif perplexed be only weary enough at seven rang bell astonished pym by declaring be going to get up must have breakfast brought to at eight see that mare be saddled at half past eight tell grandfather when he down im better morning be gone for ride have be awake hour must rest in bed no longer in bed yesterday be too oppressive if man can only get up though be to whistle to smoke have present offer resistance to pastsensations assert against tyrannous memory if there be thing a taking average of feeling must certainly be found that in hunting shooting season regret reproach mortified pride weigh lighter on country gentleman than in late spring summer arthur felt that must be more of man on horseback even presence of pym waiting on with usual deference be reassurance to after scene of yesterday for with arthur sensitiveness to opinion loss of adam respect be shock to self contentment suffused imagination with sense that have sunk in eyesas sudden shock of fear from real peril make nervous woman afraid even to step because perception be suffused with sense of danger arthur a know be loving nature deed of kindness be a easy to a bad habit be common issue of weakness good quality of egoism sympathy didnt like to witness pain liked to have grateful eye beaming on a giver of pleasure when be lad of seven one day kicked down old gardener pitcher of broth from motive kicking impulse not reflecting that be old man dinner on learning that sad fact took favourite pencil case silver hafted knife out of pocket offered a compensation have be same arthur ever since trying to make offence forgotten in benefit if there be bitterness in nature must only show against man who refused to be conciliated by perhaps time be come for of bitterness to rise at first moment arthur have felt pure distress reproach at discovering adam happiness be involved in relation to hetty if there have be possibility of making adam tenfold amendsif deed of gift other deed must have restored adam contentment regard for a benefactor arthur must not only have executed without hesitation must have felt bound more closely to adam must never have be weary of making retribution adam must receive amends suffering must not be cancelled respect affection must not be recovered by prompt deed of atonement stood like immovable obstacle against pressure must avail embodiment of what arthur most shrank from believing inthe irrevocableness of own wrongdoing word of refusal to shake hand mastery asserted over in last conversation in hermitageabove sense of having be knocked down to man doe not very well reconcile even under most heroic circumstancespressed on with galling pain be stronger than compunction arthur must so gladly have persuaded that have done harm if one have told contrary must have persuaded so much better nemesis can seldom forge sword for out of consciencesout of suffering feel in suffering may have caused there be rarely metal enough there to make effective weapon moral sense learns manner of good society smile when others smile when rude person give rough name to action be apt to take part against so be with arthur adam judgment of adam grating word disturbed self soothing argument not that arthur have be at ease before adam discovery struggle resolve have transformed into compunction anxiety be distressed for hettys sake distressed for own that must leave behind have always both in making breaking resolution looked beyond passion seen that must speedily end in separation nature be too ardent tender for not to suffer at parting on hettys account be filled with uneasiness have found out dream in be livingthat be to be lady in silk satinsand when have first talked to about going away have asked tremblingly to let go with be married be painful knowledge of have given most exasperating sting to adam reproach have said word with purpose of deceiving vision be spun by own childish fancybut be obliged to confess to that be spun half out of own action to increase mischief on last evening have not dared to hint truth to hetty have be obliged to soothe with tender hopeful word lest must throw into violent distress felt situation acutely felt sorrow of dear thing in present thought with darker anxiety of tenacity feeling might have in future be one sharp point pressed against other must evade by hopeful self persuasion whole thing have be secret poysers have not shadow of suspicion one except adam knew anything of what have one else be likely to know for arthur have impressed on hetty that must be fatal to betray by word look that there have be least intimacy between adam who knew secret must rather help to keep than betray be unfortunate business altogether there be use in making worse than be by imaginary exaggeration foreboding of evil might never come temporary sadness for hetty be worst consequence resolutely turned away eye from bad consequence be not demonstrably inevitable butbut hetty might have have trouble in other way if not in perhaps hereafter might be able to do great deal for make up to for tear must shed about must owe advantage of care for in future year to sorrow have incurred now so good come out of evil such be beautiful arrangement of thing be inclined to ask whether can be same arthur who two month ago have that freshness of feeling delicate honour shrink from wounding even sentiment doe not contemplate more positive offence a possible for itwho thought that own self respect be higher tribunal than external opinion same assure only under different condition deed determine a much a determine deed until know have be will be peculiar combination of outward with inward fact constitutes man critical action will be better not to think wise about character there be terrible coercion in deed may first turn honest man into deceiver then reconcile to change for reasonthat second wrong present to in guise of only practicable right action before commission have be seen with blended common sense fresh untarnished feeling be healthy eye of soul be looked at afterwards with lens of apologetic ingenuity through thing men call beautiful ugly be seen to be made up of texture very much alike europe adjusts to fait accompli so doe individual characteruntil placid adjustment be disturbed by convulsive retribution man can escape vitiating effect of offence against own sentiment of right effect be stronger in arthur because of very need of self respect while conscience be still at ease be one of best safeguard accusation be too painful to himhe must not face must persuade that have not be very much to blame began even to pity for necessity be under of deceiving adamit be course so opposed to honesty of own nature then be only right thing to do well have be amiss in be miserable enough in consequence miserable about hetty miserable about letter that have promised to write seemed at one moment to be gross barbarity at perhaps greatest kindness must do to across reflection must dart now then sudden impulse of passionate defiance towards consequence must carry hetty away other consideration might go to in state of mind four wall of room made intolerable prison to seemed to hem in press down upon crowd of contradictory thought conflicting feeling of must fly away in open air have only hour two to make up mind in must get clear calm once on meg back in fresh air of fine morning must be more master of situation pretty creature arched bay neck in sunshine pawed gravel trembled with pleasure when master stroked nose patted talked to even in more caressing tone than usual loved better because knew nothing of secret meg be quite a well acquainted with master mental state a many others of sex with mental condition of nice young gentleman towards whom heart be in state of fluttering expectation arthur cantered for five mile beyond chase till be at foot of hill where there be hedge tree to hem in road then threw bridle on meg neck prepared to make up mind hetty knew that meeting yesterday must be last before arthur went awaythere be possibility of contriving without exciting suspicionand be like frightened child unable to think of anything only able to cry at mention of parting then put face up to have tear kissed away must hing comfort lull into dreaming on letter must be dreadfully abrupt way of awakening yet there be truth in what adam saidthat must save from lengthened delusion might be worse than sharp immediate pain be only way of satisfying adam who must be satisfied for more reason than one if must have seen again be impossible there be such thorny hedge of hindrance between imprudence must be fatal yet if must see again what good must do only cause to suffer more from sight of distress remembrance of away from be surrounded by motif to self control sudden dread here fell like shadow across imaginationthe dread lest must do something violent in grief close upon dread came deepened shadow shook off with force of youth hope what be ground for painting future in dark way be just a likely to be reverse arthur told did not deserve that thing must turn out badly have never meant beforehand to do anything conscience disapproved have be led on by circumstance there be sort of implicit confidence in that be really such good fellow at bottom providence must not treat harshly at event couldnt help what must come now must do be to take what seemed best course at present moment persuaded that course be to make way open between adam hetty heart might really turn to adam a said after while in case there must have be great harm done since be still adam ardent wish to make wife to be sure adam be deceiveddeceived in way that arthur must have resented a deep wrong if have be practised on be reflection marred consoling prospect arthur cheek even burned in mingled shame irritation at thought what must man do in dilemma be bound in honour to say word must injure hetty first duty be to guard must never have told acted lie on own account good god what miserable fool be to have brought into dilemma yet if ever man have excuse have pity that consequence be determined not by excuse by action well letter must be written be only mean that promised solution of difficulty tear came into arthur eye a thought of hetty reading must be almost a hard for to write be not doing anything easy to last thought helped to arrive at conclusion must never deliberately have taken step inflicted pain on left at ease even movement of jealousy at thought of giving up hetty to adam went to convince that be making sacrifice when once have come to conclusion turned meg round set off home again in canter letter must be written first thing rest of day must be filled up with other business must have time to look behind happily irwine gawaine be coming to dinner by twelve oclock next day must have left chase mile behind there be security in constant occupation against uncontrollable impulse seizing to rush to hetty thrust into hand mad proposition must undo everything faster faster went sensitive meg at slight sign from rider till canter have passed into swift gallop thought said th young mester war took ill last night said sour old john groom at dinner time in servant hall he be ridin fit to split mare two forenoon thats happen one o symptims john said facetious coachman then wish war let blood for t thats said john grimly adam have be early at chase to know how arthur be have be relieved from anxiety about effect of blow by learning that be gone out for ride at five oclock be punctually there again sent up word of arrival in few minute pym came down with letter in hand gave to adam saying that captain be too busy to see have written everything have to say letter be directed to adam went out of door again before opening contained sealed enclosure directed to hetty on inside of cover adam read in enclosed letter have written everything wish leave to to decide whether will be doing best to deliver to hetty to return to ask once more whether be not taking measure may pain more than mere silence there be need for seeing other again now will meet with better feeling month hence ad perhaps he th right on t not to see thought adam use meeting to say more hard word use meeting to shake hand say be friend again be not friend better not to pretend know forgiveness be man duty to thinking can only mean a youre to give up thought o taking revenge can never mean a youre t have old feeling back again for thats not possible he not same man to cant feel same towards god help dont know whether feel same towards anybody seem a if id be measuring work from false line have got to measure over again question about delivering letter to hetty soon absorbed adam thought arthur have procured relief to by throwing decision on adam with warning adam who be not given to hesitation hesitated here determined to feel wayto ascertain a well a must what be hettys state of mind before decided on delivering letter chapter xxx delivery of letter next sunday adam joined poysers on way out of church hoping for invitation to go home with have letter in pocket be anxious to have opportunity of talking to hetty alone must not see face at church for have changed seat when came up to to shake hand manner be doubtful constrained expected for be first time have met since have be aware that have seen with arthur in grove come youll go on with adam mr poyser said when reached turning a soon a be in field adam ventured to offer arm to hetty child soon gave opportunity of lingering behind little then adam said will contrive for to walk out in garden bit with evening if keep fine hetty ive something particlar to talk to about hetty said very well be really a anxious a adam be that must have private talk with wondered what thought of arthur must have seen kissing knew have conception of scene have taken place between arthur adam first feeling have be that adam must be very angry with perhaps must tell aunt uncle never entered mind that must dare to say anything to captain donnithorne be relief to that behaved so kindly to to day wanted to speak to alone for have trembled when found be going home with lest must mean to tell now wanted to talk to by must learn what thought what meant to do felt certain confidence that must persuade not to do anything did not want to do must perhaps even make believe that didnt care for arthur a long a adam thought there be hope of having must do just what liked knew besides must go on seeming to encourage adam lest uncle aunt must be angry suspect her of having secret lover hettys little brain be busy with combination a hung on adam arm said yes to slight observation of about many hawthorn berry there must be for bird next winter low hanging cloud must hardly hold up till morning when rejoined aunt uncle must pursue thought without interruption for mr poyser held that though young man might like to have woman be courting on arm must nevertheless be glad of little reasonable talk about business while for own part be curious to hear most recent news about chase farm so through rest of walk claimed adam conversation for hetty laid small plot imagined little scene of cunning blandishment a walked along by hedgerow on honest adam arm quite a well a if have be elegantly clad coquette alone in boudoir for if country beauty in clumsy shoe be only willow hearted enough be astonishing how closely mental process may resemble of lady in society crinoline who applies refined intellect to problem of committing indiscretion without compromising perhaps resemblance be not much le because hetty felt very unhappy while parting with arthur be double pain to hermingling with tumult of passion vanity there be dim undefined fear that future might shape in way quite unlike dream clung to comforting hopeful word arthur have uttered in last meetingi will come again at christmas then will see what can be done clung to belief that be so fond of must never be happy without still hugged secretthat great gentleman loved herwith gratified pride a superiority over girl knew uncertainty of future possibility to must give shape began to press upon like invisible weight of air be alone on little island of dream around be dark unknown water where arthur be gone must gather elation of spirit now by looking forward only by looking backward to build confidence on past word caress occasionally since thursday evening dim anxiety have be almost lost behind more definite fear that adam might betray what knew to uncle aunt sudden proposition to talk with alone have set thought to work in new way be eager not to lose evening opportunity after tea when boy be going into garden totty begged to go with hetty said with alacrity surprised mr poyser ill go with aunt did not seem at surprising that adam said must go too soon hetty be left alone together on walk by filbert tree while boy be busy elsewhere gathering large unripe nut to play at cob nut with totty be watching with puppylike air of contemplation be short timehardly two monthssince adam have have mind filled with delicious hope a stood by hettys side in garden remembrance of scene have often be with since thursday evening sunlight through apple tree bough red bunch hettys sweet blush came importunately now on sad evening with low hanging cloud tried to suppress lest emotion must impel to say more than be needful for hettys sake after what saw on thursday night hetty began wont think making too free in what im going to say if be being courted by man a ud make wife id known be fond of meant to have must have right to speak word to about when see youre being made love to by gentleman a can never marry doesna think o marrying feel bound t interfere for cant speak about to a be place o parent for might bring worse trouble thans needful adam word relieved one of hettys fear also carried meaning sickened with strengthened foreboding be pale trembling yet must have angrily contradicted adam if have dared to betray feeling be silent youre so young know hetty went on almost tenderly y havent seen much o what go on in world right for to do what can to save from getting into trouble for want o knowing where youre being led to if anybody besides knew what know about meeting gentleman having fine present from theyd speak light on youd lose character besides youll have to suffer in feeling wi giving love to man a can never marry so a might take care of life adam paused looked at hetty who be plucking leaf from filbert tree tearing up in hand little plan preconcerted speech have forsaken like ill learnt lesson under terrible agitation produced by adam word there be cruel force in calm certainty threatened to grapple crush flimsy hope fancy wanted to resist themshe wanted to throw off with angry contradictionbut determination to conceal what felt still governed be nothing more than blind prompting now for be unable to calculate effect of word youve right to say a love said faintly impetuously plucking rough leaf tearing up be very beautiful in paleness agitation with dark childish eye dilated breath shorter than usual adam heart yearned over a looked at ah if must comfort soothe save from pain if have sort of strength must enable to rescue poor troubled mind a must have rescued body in face of danger doubt must be so hetty said tenderly for canna believe youd let man kiss by yourselves give gold box with hair go walking grove to meet if didna love im not blaming for know ud begin by little little till at last youd not be able to throw off blame for stealing love way when knew must never make right amends he be trifling with making plaything of caring nothing about a man ought to care yes doe care for know better hetty burst out everything be forgotten pain anger felt at adam word nay hetty said adam if hed cared for rightly hed never have behaved so told meant nothing by kissing present wanted to make believe a thought light of em too know better that cant help thinking a youve be trusting to loving well enough to marry for he gentleman thats why must speak to about hetty for fear must be deceiving never entered head thought o marrying how do know how durst say so said hetty pausing in walk trembling terrible decision of adam tone shook with fear have presence of mind left for reflection that arthur must have reason for not telling truth to adam word look be enough to determine adam must give letter perhaps cant believe hetty because think too well of himbecause think love better than doe ive got letter pocket a wrote for to give ive not read letter say he told truth in before give letter consider hetty dont let take too much hold on wouldna have be good for if hed wanted to do mad thing a marry ud have led to happiness th end hetty said nothing felt revival of hope at mention of letter adam have not read there must be something quite different in from what thought adam took out letter held in hand still while said in tone of tender entreaty dont bear ill will hetty because im mean o bringing pain god know id have borne good deal worse for sake o sparing thinktheres nobody know about ill take care of a if be brother youre same a ever to for dont believe youve done wrong knowingly hetty have laid hand on letter adam did not loose till have done speaking took notice of what saidshe have not listened when loosed letter put into pocket without opening then began to walk more quickly a if wanted to go in youre in right not to read just yet said adam read when youre by stay out little bit longer let call child look so white ill aunt may take notice of hetty heard warning recalled to necessity of rallying native power of concealment have half given way under shock of adam word have letter in pocket be sure there be comfort in letter in spite of adam ran to find totty soon reappeared with recovered colour leading totty who be making sour face because have be obliged to throw away unripe apple that have set small teeth in hegh totty said adam come ride on shoulderever so highyoull touch top o tree what little child ever refused to be comforted by glorious sense of being seized strongly swung upward dont believe ganymede cried when eagle carried away perhaps deposited on jove shoulder at end totty smiled down complacently from secure height pleasant be sight to mother eye a stood at house door saw adam coming with small burden bless sweet face pet said mother strong love filling keen eye with mildness a totty leaned forward put out arm have eye for hetty at moment only said without looking at go draw ale gells be at cheese after ale have be drawn uncle pipe lighted there be totty to be taken to bed brought down again in night gown because must cry instead of going to sleep then there be supper to be got ready hetty must be continually in way to give help adam stayed till knew mr poyser expected to go engaging husband in talk a constantly a must for sake of leaving hetty more at ease lingered because wanted to see safely through evening be delighted to find how much self command showed knew have not have time to read letter did not know be buoyed up by secret hope that letter must contradict everything have said be hard work for to leave herhard to think that must not know for day how be bearing trouble must go at last must do be to press hand gently a said good bye hope must take that a sign that if love must ever be refuge for be there same a ever how busy thought be a walked home in devising pitying excuse for folly in referring weakness to sweet lovingness of nature in blaming arthur with le le inclination to admit that conduct might be extenuated too exasperation at hettys sufferingand also at sense that be possibly thrust for ever out of own reachdeafened to plea for miscalled friend who have wrought misery adam be clear sighted fair minded mana fine fellow indeed morally a well a physically if aristides just be ever in love jealous be at moment not perfectly magnanimous can not pretend adam in painful day felt nothing righteous indignation loving pity be bitterly jealous in proportion a love made indulgent in judgment of bitterness found vent in feeling towards arthur head be allays likely to be turned thought when gentleman with fine manner fine clothes white hand way o talking gentlefolk have came about making up to in bold way a man couldnt do be only equal much if shell ever like common man now must not help drawing own hand out of pocket looking at hard palm broken finger nail im roughish fellow altogether dont know now come to think ont what there be much for woman to like

further thought about adam happiness in matter have never yet visited strange perhaps will say rush of impulse towards course might have seemed most repugnant to present state of mind in only second night of sadness yes action of little trivial soul like hettys struggling amidst serious sad destiny of human being be strange so be motion of little vessel without ballast tossed about on stormy sea how pretty looked with parti coloured sail in sunlight moored in quiet bay let man bear loss who loosed from mooring will not save vesselthe pretty thing might have be lasting joy chapter xxxii mr

boozin with set at cassons sittin soakin in drink looking a wise a lot o cod fish wi red face be probably owing to conversation have have with husband on way from church concerning problematic stranger mr poysers thought immediately reverted to when day two afterwards a be standing at house door with knitting in eager leisure came to when afternoon cleaning be done saw old squire enter yard on black pony followed by john groom always cited afterwards a case of prevision really have something more in than own remarkable penetration that moment set eye on squire said to herself shouldna wonder if he come about man a be going to take chase farm wanting poyser to do something for without pay poysers fool if doe something unwonted must clearly be in wind for old squire visit to tenantry be rare though mr poyser have during last twelvemonth recited many imaginary speech meaning even more than met ear be quite determined to make to next time appeared within gate of hall farm speech have always remained imaginary good day mr poyser said old squire peering at with short sighted eyesa mode of looking at a mr poyser observed allays aggravated be a if be insect be going to dab finger nail on however said servant sir curtsied with air of perfect deference a advanced towards be not woman to misbehave towards better fly in face of catechism without severe provocation be husband at home mr poyser yes sir he only rick yard ill send for in minute if youll please to get down step in thank will do so want to consult about little matter be quite a much concerned in if not more must have opinion too hetty run tell uncle to come in said mr poyser a entered house old gentleman bowed low in answer to hettys curtsy while totty conscious of pinafore stained with gooseberry jam stood hiding face against clock peeping round furtively what fine old kitchen be said mr donnithorne looking round admiringly always spoke in same deliberate well chiselled polite way whether word be sugary venomous keep so exquisitely clean mr poyser like premise do know beyond on estate well sir since youre fond of em must be glad if youd let bit o repair be done to em for boarding state a be like to be eaten up wi rat mouse cellar may stan up to knee water int if like to go down perhaps youd rather believe word wont please to sit down sir not yet must see dairy have not seen for year hear on hand about fine cheese butter said squire looking politely unconscious that there must be question on mr poyser might happen to disagree think see door open there must not be surprised if cast covetous eye on cream butter dont expect that mr satchells cream butter will bear comparison with yours cant say sir im sure seldom see other folks butter though there on a one need to seethe smell enough ah now like said mr donnithorne looking round at damp temple of cleanliness keeping near door im sure must like breakfast better if knew butter cream came from dairy thank that really be pleasant sight unfortunately slight tendency to rheumatism make afraid of damp ill sit down in comfortable kitchen ah poyser how do do in midst of business see a usual ive be looking at wife beautiful dairythe best manager in parish be not mr poyser have just entered in shirt sleeve open waistcoat with face shade redder than usual from exertion of pitching a stood red rotund radiant before small wiry cool old gentleman looked like prize apple by side of withered crab will please to take chair sir said lifting father arm chair forward little youll find easy thank never sit in easy chair said old gentleman seating on small chair near door do know mr poysersit down pray of youive be far from contented for time with mr satchells dairy management think have not good method a have indeed sir cant speak to said mr poyser in hard voice rolling unrolling knitting looking icily out of window a continued to stand opposite squire poyser might sit down if liked thought wasnt going to sit down a if shed give in to such smooth tongued palaver mr poyser who looked felt reverse of icy did sit down in three cornered chair now poyser a satchell be laid up be intending to let chase farm to respectable tenant im tired of having farm on own handsnothing be made best of in such case a know satisfactory bailiff be hard to find think poyser excellent wife here can enter into little arrangement in consequence will be to mutual advantage oh said mr poyser with good natured blankness of imagination a to nature of arrangement if im called upon to speak sir said mr poyser after glancing at husband with pity at softness know better than dont see what chase farm be t usweve cumber enough wi own farm not what im glad to hear o anybody respectable coming into parish there a have be brought in a hasnt be looked on character youre likely to find mr thurle excellent neighbour assure one a will feel glad to have accommodated by little plan im going to mention especially a hope will find a much to own advantage a indeed sir if anything t advantage itll be first offer o sort ive heared on a take advantage get advantage world think folk have to wait long enough afore brought to em fact be poyser said squire ignoring mr poysers theory of worldly prosperity there be too much dairy land too little plough land on chase farm to suit thurles purposeindeed will only take farm on condition of change in wife appears be not clever dairy woman like yours now plan im thinking of be to effect little exchange if be to have hollow pasture might increase dairy must be so profitable under wife management must request mr poyser to supply house with milk cream butter at market price on other hand poyser might let have lower upper ridge really with wet season must be good riddance for there be much le risk in dairy land than corn land mr poyser be leaning forward with elbow on knee head on one side mouth screwed upapparently absorbed in making tip of finger meet so a to represent with perfect accuracy rib of ship be much too acute man not to see through whole business to foresee perfectly what must be wife view of subject disliked giving unpleasant answer unless be on point of farming practice must rather give up than have quarrel day after mattered more to wife than to so after few moment silence looked up at said mildly what dost say mr poyser have have eye fixed on husband with cold severity during silence now turned away head with toss looked icily at opposite roof of cow shed spearing knitting together with loose pin held firmly between clasped hand say why say may do a like about giving up o corn land afore lease be up wont be for year come next michaelmas ill not consent to take more dairy work into hand for love money there love money here a can see ony other folks love o theirselves money a be to go into other folks pocket know there a be born t own land a be born to sweat onthere mr poyser paused to gasp littleand know christened folks duty to submit to better a fur a flesh blood ull bear ill not make martyr o wear to skin bone worret a if be churn wi butter coming int for landlord in england not if be king george dear mr poyser certainly not said squire still confident in own power of persuasion must not overwork dont think work will rather be lessened than increased in way there be so much milk required at abbey that will have little increase of cheese butter making from addition to dairy believe selling milk be most profitable way of disposing of dairy produce be not aye thats true said mr poyser unable to repress opinion on question of farming profit forgetting that be not in case purely abstract question daresay said mr poyser bitterly turning head way towards husband looking at vacant arm chairi daresay true for men a sit th chimney corner make believe a everythings cut wi in out to fit int everything else if must make pudding wi thinking o batter ud be easy getting dinner how do know whether milk ull be wanted constant whats to

mr poysers part bethell will do regularly with cart pony oh sir begging pardon ive never be used t having gentlefolk servant coming about back place making love to gells at once keeping em with hand on hip listening to manner o gossip when must be down on knee scouring if be to go to ruin shanna be wi having back kitchen turned into public well poyser said squire shifting tactic looking a if thought mr poyser have suddenly withdrawn from proceeding left room can turn hollow into feeding land can easily make arrangement about supplying house will not forget readiness to accommodate landlord a well a neighbour know will be glad to have lease renewed for three year when present one expires otherwise daresay thurle who be man of capital must be glad to take farm a must be worked so well together dont want to part with old tenant like to be thrust out of discussion in way must have be enough to complete mr poysers exasperation even without final threat husband really alarmed at possibility of leaving old place where have be bred bornfor believed old squire have small spite enough for anythingwas beginning mild remonstrance explanatory of inconvenience must find in having to buy sell more stock with well sir think a rether hard when mr poyser burst in with desperate determination to have say out once though be to rain notice to quit only shelter be work house then sir if

two three old folk a think o saving soul by giving em bit o flannel drop o porridge may be right thinking itll take little to save soul for itll be smallest savin y iver made wi scrapin there be occasion on two servant girl waggoner may be formidable audience a squire rode away on black pony even gift of short sightedness did not prevent from being aware that molly nancy tim be grinning not far from perhaps suspected that sour old john be grinning behind himwhich be also fact meanwhile bull dog black tan terrier alicks sheep dog gander hissing at safe distance from pony heel carried out idea of mr poysers solo in impressive quartet mr poyser however have sooner seen pony move off than turned round gave two hilarious damsel look drove into back kitchen unspearing knitting began to

squire plan have be frustrated because poysers have refused to be put upon mr poysers outbreak be discussed in farm house with zest be only heightened by frequent repetition news that bony be come back from egypt be comparatively insipid repulse of french in italy be nothing to mr poysers repulse of old squire mr irwine have heard version of in parishioner house with one exception of chase since have always with marvellous skill avoided quarrel with mr donnithorne must not allow pleasure of laughing at old gentleman discomfiture with one besides mother who declared that if be rich must like to allow mr poyser pension for life wanted to invite to parsonage that might hear account of scene from mr poysers own lip mother said mr irwine be little bit of irregular justice on mr poysers part magistrate like must not countenance irregular justice there must be report spread have taken notice of quarrel else will lose little good influence have over old man well like woman even better than cream cheese said mr irwine have spirit of three men with pale face of hers say such sharp thing too sharp yes tongue be like new set razor shes quite original in talk too one of untaught wit

gentleman turn out of farm next michaelmas eh said mr irwine oh must not be poyser be such good tenant that donnithorne be likely to think twice digest spleen rather than turn out if must give notice at lady day arthur must move heaven earth to mollify such old parishioner a be must not go ah there knowing what may happen before lady day said mr irwine struck on arthur birthday that old man be little shaken he eighty three know really unconscionable age only woman who have right to live a long a when theyve got old bachelor son who must be forlorn without said mr irwine laughing kissing mother hand mr poyser too met husband occasional foreboding of notice to quit with there knowing what may happen before lady dayone of undeniable general proposition be usually intended to convey particular meaning very far from undeniable be really too hard upon human nature that must be held criminal offence to imagine death even of king when be turned eighty three be not to be believed that dullest briton can be good subject under hard condition apart from foreboding thing went on much a usual in poyser household mr poyser thought noticed surprising improvement in hetty to be sure girl got closer tempered sometimes seemed a if thered be drawing word from with cart rope thought much le about dress went after work quite eagerly without telling be wonderful how never wanted to go out nowindeed must hardly be persuaded to go bore aunt putting stop to weekly lesson in fine work at chase without least grumbling pouting must be after that have set heart on adam at last sudden freak of wanting to be lady maid must have be caused by little pique misunderstanding between have passed by for whenever adam came to hall farm hetty seemed to be in better spirit to talk more than at other time though be almost sullen when mr craig other admirer happened to pay visit there adam watched at first with trembling anxiety gave way to surprise delicious hope five day after delivering arthur letter have ventured to go to hall farm againnot without dread lest sight of might be painful to be not in house place when entered sat talking to mr mr poyser for few minute with heavy fear on heart that might presently tell hetty be ill by by there came light step that knew when mr poyser said come hetty where have be adam be obliged to turn round though be afraid to see changed look there must be in face almost started when saw smiling a if be pleased to see himlooking same a ever at first glance only that have cap on have never seen in before when came of evening still when looked at again

pleased to see himturning up lovely face towards a if meant to understand that be glad for to comeand going about work in same equable way making sign of sorrow began to believe that feeling towards

what have become of when got off coach began to walk again take cheap ride in cart get cheap meal going on on without distinct purpose yet strangely by fascination taking way have come though be determined not to go back to own country perhaps be because have fixed mind on grassy warwickshire field with bushy tree studded hedgerow that made hiding place even in leafless season went more slowly than came often getting over stile sitting for hour under hedgerow looking before with blank beautiful eye fancying at edge of hidden pool low down like in scantlands wondering if be very painful to be drowned if there must be anything worse after death than what dreaded in life religious doctrine have taken no hold on hettys mind be one of numerous people who have have godfather godmother learned catechism be confirmed gone to church sunday yet for practical result of strength in life trust in death have never appropriated single christian idea christian feeling must misunderstand thought during wretched day if imagined that be influenced either by religious fear religious hope chose to go to stratford on avon again where have gone before by mistake for remembered grassy field on former way towards itfields among thought might find just sort of pool have in mind yet took care of money still carried basket death seemed still long way off life be so strong in craved food restshe hastened towards at very moment be picturing to herself bank from must leap towards death be already five day since have left windsor for have wandered about always avoiding speech

if rained a if have happy life to cherish yet even in most self conscious moment face be sadly different from have smiled at in old specked glass smiled at others when glanced at admiringly hard even fierce look have come in eye though lash be a long a ever have dark brightness cheek be never dimpled with smile now be same rounded pouting childish prettiness with love belief in love departed from itthe sadder for beauty like wondrous medusa face with passionate passionless lip at last be among field have be dreaming of on long narrow pathway leading towards wood if there must be pool in wood must be better hidden than one in field be not wood only wild brake where there have once be gravel pit leaving mound hollow studded with brushwood small tree roamed up down thinking there be perhaps pool in hollow before came to till limb be weary sat down to rest afternoon be far advanced leaden sky be darkening a if sun be setting behind after little while hetty started up again feeling that darkness must soon come on must put off finding pool till to morrow make way to shelter for night have quite lost way in field might a well go in one direction a for aught knew walked through field after field village house be in sight there at corner of pasture there be break in hedge land seemed to dip down little two tree leaned towards other across opening hettys heart gave great beat a thought there must be pool there walked towards heavily over tufted grass with pale lip sense of trembling be a if thing be come in spite of herself instead of being object of search there be black under darkening sky motion sound near set down basket then sank down on grass trembling pool have wintry depth now by time got willow a remembered pool did at hayslope in summer one must find out that be body then there be basketshe must hide that too must throw into watermake heavy with stone first then throw in got up to look about for stone soon brought five six laid down beside basket then sat down again there be need to hurrythere be night to drown in sat leaning elbow on basket be weary hungry there be bun in basketthree have supplied with at place where ate dinner took out now ate eagerly then sat still again looking at pool soothed sensation came over from satisfaction of hunger fixed dreamy attitude brought on drowsiness presently head sank down on knee be fast asleep when awoke be deep night felt chill be frightened at darknessfrightened at long night before if must throw into water not yet began to walk about might get warm again a if must have more resolution then oh how long time be in darkness bright hearth warmth voice of home secure uprising lying down familiar field familiar people sunday holiday with simple joy of dress feastingall sweet of young life rushed before now seemed to be stretching arm towards across great gulf set teeth when thought of arthur cursed without knowing what cursing must do wished too might know desolation cold life of shame that dared not end by death horror of cold darkness solitudeout of human reachbecame greater long minute be almost a if be dead already knew that be dead longed to get back to life again be alive still have not taken dreadful leap felt strange contradictory wretchedness exultation wretchedness that did not dare to face death exultation that be still in might yet know light warmth again walked backwards forward to warm beginning to discern something of object around a eye became accustomed to nightthe darker line of hedge rapid motion of living creatureperhaps field mouserushing across grass no longer felt a if darkness hedged in thought must walk back across field get over stile then in very next field thought remembered there be hovel of furze near sheepfold if must get into hovel must be warmer must pas night there for be what alick did at hayslope in lambing time thought of hovel brought energy of new hope took up basket walked across field be time before got in right direction for stile exercise occupation of finding stile be stimulus to however lightened horror of darkness solitude there be sheep in next field startled group a set down basket got over stile sound of movement comforted for assured that impression be rightthis be field where have seen hovel for be field where sheep be right on along path must get to reached opposite gate felt way along rail rail of sheep fold till hand encountered pricking of gorsy wall delicious sensation have found shelter groped way touching prickly gorse to door pushed open be ill smelling close place warm there be straw on ground hetty sank down on straw with sense of escape tear cameshe have never shed tear before since left windsortears sob of hysterical joy that have still hold of life that be still on familiar earth with sheep near very consciousness of own limb be delight to turned up sleeve kissed arm with passionate love of life soon warmth weariness lulled in midst of sob fell continually into dozing fancying at brink of pool againfancying that have jumped into water then awaking with start wondering where be at last deep dreamless sleep came head guarded by bonnet found pillow against gorsy wall poor soul driven to fro between two equal terror found one relief be possible to itthe relief of unconsciousness ala relief seems to end moment have begun seemed to hetty a if dozen dream have only passed into dreamthat be in hovel aunt be standing over with candle in hand trembled under aunt glance opened eye there be candle there be light in hovelthe light of early morning through open door there be face looking down on be unknown face belonging to elderly man in smock frock why what do do here young woman man said roughly hetty trembled still worse under real fear shame than have done in momentary dream under aunt glance felt that be like beggar alreadyfound sleeping in place in spite of trembling be so eager to account to man for presence here that found word at once lost way said im travellingnorthard got away from road into field be overtaken by dark will tell way to nearest village got up a be speaking put hand to bonnet to adjust then laid hold of basket man looked at with slow bovine gaze without giving answer for second then turned away walked towards door of hovel be not till got there that stood still turning shoulder half round towards said aw can show way to norton if like what do do gettin out o highroad added with tone of gruff reproof yull be gettin into mischief if dooant mind yes said hetty wont do again ill keep in road if youll be so good a show how to get to why dooant keep where there finger poa folk to ax way on man said still more gruffly anybody ud think be wild woman look at yer hetty be frightened at gruff old man still more at last suggestion that looked like wild woman a followed out of hovel thought must give sixpence for telling way then must not suppose be wild a stopped to point out road to put hand in pocket to get six penny ready when be turning away without saying good morning held out to said thank will please to take something for trouble looked slowly at sixpence then said want none o money youd better take care ont else youll get from yer if go trapesin about field like mad woman thatway man left without further speech hetty held on way day have risen must wander on be use to think of drowning herselfshe must not do at least while have money left to buy food strength to journey on incident on waking morning heightened dread of time when money must be gone must have to sell basket clothes then must really look like beggar wild woman a man have said passionate joy in life have felt in night after escaping from brink of black cold death in pool be gone now life now by morning light with impression of man hard wondering look at be a full of dread a deathit be worse be dread to felt chained from shrank shrank a did from black pool yet must find refuge from took out money from purse looked at have still two twenty shilling must serve for many day more must help to get on faster to stonyshire within reach of dinah thought of dinah urged more strongly now since experience of night have driven shuddering imagination away from pool if have be only going to dinahif nobody besides dinah must ever knowhetty must have made up mind to go to soft voice pitying eye must have drawn afterwards other people must know must no more rush on shame than must rush on death must wander on on wait for lower depth of despair to give courage perhaps death must come to for be getting le le able to bear day weariness yetsuch be strange action of soul drawing by lurking desire towards very end dreadhetty when set out again from norton asked straightest road northward towards stonyshire kept day poor wandering hetty with rounded childish face hard unloving despairing soul looking out of itwith narrow heart narrow thought room in for sorrow own tasting that sorrow with more intense bitterness heart bleeds for a see toiling along on weary foot seated in cart with eye fixed vacantly on road before never thinking caring whither tends till hunger come make desire that village may be near what will be end end of objectless wandering apart from love caring for human being only through pride clinging to life only a hunted wounded brute cling to god preserve from being beginner of such misery chapter xxxviii quest first ten day after hettys departure passed a quietly a other day with family at hall farm with adam at daily work have expected hetty to stay away week ten day at least perhaps little longer if dinah came back with because there might then be something to detain at snowfield when fortnight have passed began to feel little surprise that hetty did not return must surely have found pleasanter to be with dinah than one must have supposed adam for part be getting very impatient to see resolved that if did not appear next day saturday must set out on sunday morning to fetch there be coach on sunday by setting out before be light perhaps getting lift in cart by way must arrive pretty early at snowfield bring back next daydinah too if be coming be quite time hetty came home must afford to lose monday for sake of bringing project be quite approved at farm when went there on saturday evening mr poyser desired emphatically not to come back without hetty for have be quite too long away considering thing have to get ready by middle of march week be surely enough for one to go out for health a for dinah mr poyser have small hope of bringing unless must make believe folk at hayslope be twice a miserable a folk at snowfield though said mr poyser by way of conclusion might tell shes got one aunt left shes wasted pretty nigh to shadder will prhaps be gone twenty mile farther off next michaelmas will die o broken heart among strange folk leave child fatherless motherless nay nay said mr poyser who certainly have air of man perfectly heart whole isna so bad a theet looking rarely now getting flesh day id be glad for dinah t come for shed help thee wi little un took t wonderful so at daybreak on sunday adam set off seth went with first mile two for thought of snowfield possibility that dinah might come again made restless walk with adam in cold morning air in best clothes helped to give sense of sunday calm be last morning in february with low grey sky slight hoar frost on green border of road on black hedge heard gurgling of full brooklet hurrying down hill faint twittering of early bird for walked in silence though with pleased sense of companionship good bye lad said adam laying hand on seth shoulder looking at affectionately a be about to part wish thee wast going way wi a happy a be im content addy im content said seth cheerfully ill be old bachelor belike make fuss wi thy child turned away from other seth walked leisurely homeward mentally repeating one of favourite hymnshe be very fond of hymn dark cheerless be morn unaccompanied by thee joyless be day return till thy mercy beam see till thou inward light impart glad eye warm heart visit then soul of mine pierce gloom of sin grief fill radiancy divine scatter unbelief more more thyself display shining to perfect day adam walked much faster one coming along oakbourne road at sunrise that morning must have have pleasant sight in tall broad chested man striding along with carriage a upright firm a soldier glancing with keen glad eye at dark blue hill a began to show on way seldom in adam life have face be so free from cloud of anxiety a be morning freedom from care a be usual with constructive practical mind like made more observant of object round more ready to gather suggestion from towards own favourite plan ingenious contrivance happy lovethe knowledge that step be carrying nearer nearer to hetty who be so soon to be hiswas to thought what sweet morning air be to sensation gave consciousness of well being that made activity delightful now then there be rush of more intense feeling towards chased away other image than hetty along with must come wondering thankfulness that happiness be given to himthat life of ours have such sweetness in for adam have devout mind though be perhaps rather impatient of devout word tenderness lay very close to reverence so that one must hardly be stirred without other after feeling have welled up poured out in way busy thought must come back with greater vigour morning be intent on scheme by road might be improved be so imperfect through country on picturing benefit might come from exertion of single country gentleman if must set to getting road made good in own district seemed very short walk ten mile to oakbourne pretty town within sight of blue hill where break fasted after country grew barer barer more rolling wood more wide branching tree near frequent homestead more bushy hedgerow greystone wall intersecting meagre pasture dismal wide scattered greystone house on broken land where mine have be be no longer hungry land said adam to id rather go southard where say a flat a table than come to live here though if dinah like to live in country where can be most comfort to folk shes right to live o side for must look a if shed come straight from heaven like th angel in desert to strengthen a have got nothing t eat when at last came in sight of snowfield thought looked like town be fellow to country though stream through valley where great mill stood gave pleasant greenness to lower field town lay grim stony unsheltered up side of steep hill adam did not go forward to at present for seth have told where to find dinah be at thatched cottage outside town little way from millan old cottage standing sideways towards road with little bit of potato ground before here dinah lodged with elderly couple if hetty happened to be out adam must learn where be gone when must be at home again dinah might be out on preaching errand perhaps must have left hetty at home adam must not help hoping a recognized cottage by roadside before there shone out in face that involuntary smile belongs to expectation of near joy hurried step along narrow causeway rapped at door be opened by very clean old woman with slow palsied shake of head be dinah morris at home said adam eh said old woman looking up at tall stranger with wonder made slower of speech than usual will please to come in added retiring from door a if recollecting why yere brother to young man a come afore arena ye yes said adam entering be seth bede im brother adam told to give respect to good master aye same t be gracious young man ye feature ony yere darker sit down th arm chair man isna come home from meeting adam sat down patiently not liking to hurry shaking old woman with question looking eagerly towards narrow twisting stair in one corner for thought be possible hetty might have heard voice must come down so youre come to see dinah morris said old woman standing opposite to didn know be away from home then said adam thought likely might be away seeing a sunday other young womanis at home gone along with dinah old woman looked at adam with bewildered air gone along wi said eh dinahs gone to leeds big town ye may have heared on where there many o lord people shes be gone sin friday be fortnight sent money for journey may see room here went on opening door not noticing effect of word on adam rose followed darted eager glance into little room with narrow bed portrait of wesley on wall few book lying on large bible have have irrational hope that hetty might be there must not speak in first moment after seeing that room be empty undefined fear have seized himsomething have happened to hetty on journey still old woman be so slow of speech apprehension that hetty might be at snowfield after pity ye didna know said have ye come from own country o purpose to see hettyhetty sorrel said adam abruptly where be know nobody by name said old woman wonderingly be anybody yeve heared on at snowfield did there come young woman herevery young prettyfriday be fortnight to see dinah morris nay in seen young woman think be quite sure girl eighteen year old with dark eye dark curly hair red cloak on basket on arm couldnt forget if saw nay friday be fortnightit be day a dinah went awaythere come nobody there neer be nobody asking for till come for folk about know a shes gone eh dear eh dear be there summat matter old woman have seen ghastly look of fear in adam face be not stunned confounded be thinking eagerly where must inquire about hetty yes young woman started from country to see dinah friday be fortnight came to fetch back im afraid something have happened to cant stop good bye hastened out of cottage old woman followed to gate watching sadly with shaking head a almost ran towards town be going to inquire at place where oakbourne coach stopped young woman like hetty have be seen there have accident happened to coach fortnight ago there be coach to take back to oakbourne day well must walk couldnt stay here in wretched inaction innkeeper seeing that adam be in great anxiety entering into new incident with eagerness of man who pass great deal of time with hand in pocket looking into obstinately monotonous street offered to take back to oakbourne in own taxed cart very evening be not five oclock there be plenty of time for adam to take meal yet to get to oakbourne before ten oclock innkeeper declared that really wanted to go to oakbourne might a well go to night must have monday before then adam after making ineffectual attempt to eat put food in pocket drinking draught of ale declared ready to set off a approached cottage occurred to that must do well to learn from old woman where dinah be to be found in leeds if there be trouble at hall farmhe only half admitted foreboding that there must bethe poysers might like to send for dinah dinah have not left address old woman whose memory for name be infirm must not recall name of blessed woman who be dinahs chief friend in society at leeds during long long journey in taxed cart there be time for conjecture of importunate fear struggling hope in very first shock of discovering that hetty have not be to snowfield thought of arthur have darted through adam like sharp pang tried for time to ward off return by busying with mode of accounting for alarming fact quite apart from intolerable thought accident have happened hetty have by strange chance got into wrong vehicle from oakbourne have be taken ill did not want to frighten by letting know frail fence of vague improbability be soon hurled down by rush of distinct agonizing fear hetty have be deceiving in thinking that must love marry have be loving arthur while now in desperation at nearness of marriage have run away be gone to old indignation jealousy rose again prompted suspicion that arthur have be dealing falselyhad written to hettyhad tempted to come to himbeing unwilling after that must belong to man besides perhaps whole thing have be contrived by have given direction how to follow to irelandfor adam knew that arthur have be gone thither three week ago having recently learnt at chase sad look of hettys since have be engaged to adam returned upon now with exaggeration of painful retrospect have be foolishly sanguine confident poor thing hadnt perhaps known own mind for long while have thought that must forget arthur have be momentarily drawn towards man who offered protecting faithful love couldnt bear to blame never meant to cause dreadful pain blame lay with man who have selfishly played with hearthad perhaps even deliberately lured away at oakbourne ostler at royal oak remembered young woman a adam described getting out of treddleston coach more than fortnight agowasnt likely to forget such pretty lass a in hurrywas sure have not gone on by buxton coach went through snowfield have lost sight of while went away with horse have never set eye on again adam then went straight to house from stoniton coach started stoniton be most obvious place for hetty to go to first whatever might be destination for must hardly venture on chief coach road have be noticed here too be remembered to have sat on box by coachman coachman must not be seen for man have be driving on road in stead last three four day must probably be seen at stoniton through inquiry at inn where coach put up so anxious heart stricken adam must of necessity wait try to rest till morningnay till eleven oclock when coach started at stoniton delay occurred for old coachman who have driven hetty must not be in town again till night when did come remembered hetty well remembered own joke addressed to quoting many time to adam observing with equal frequency that thought there be something more than common because hetty have not laughed when joked declared a people have done at inn that have lost sight of hetty directly got down part of next morning be consumed in inquiry at house in town from coach startedall in vain for know hetty did not start from stoniton by coach on foot in grey morningand then in walking out to first toll gate on different line of road in forlorn hope of finding recollection of there be not to be traced farther next hard task for adam be to go home carry wretched tidings to hall farm a to what must do beyond that have come to two distinct resolution amidst tumult of thought feeling be going on within while went to fro must not mention what knew of arthur donnithornes behaviour to hetty till there be clear necessity for be still possible hetty might come back disclosure might be injury offence to a soon a have be home done be necessary there to prepare for further absence must start off to ireland if found trace of hetty on road must go straight to arthur donnithorne make certain how far be acquainted with movement several time thought occurred to that must consult mr irwine must be useless unless told so betrayed secret about arthur seems strange that adam in incessant occupation of mind about hetty must never have alighted on probability that have gone to windsor ignorant that arthur be no longer there perhaps reason be that must not conceive hettys throwing on arthur uncalled imagined cause must have driven to such step after letter written in august there be two alternative in mind arthur have written to again enticed away have simply fled from approaching marriage with because found after must not love well enough yet be afraid of friend anger if retracted with last determination on mind of going straight to arthur thought that have spent two day in inquiry have proved to be almost useless be torturing to adam yet since must not tell poysers conviction a to where hetty be gone intention to follow thither must be able to say to that have traced a far a possible be after twelve oclock on tuesday night when adam reached treddleston unwilling to disturb mother seth also to encounter question at hour threw without undressing on bed at waggon overthrown slept hard from pure weariness not more than four hour however for before five oclock set out on way home in faint morning twilight always kept key of workshop door in pocket so that must let in wished to enter without awaking mother for be anxious to avoid telling new trouble by seeing seth first asking to tell when must be necessary walked gently along yard turned key gently in door a expected gyp who lay in workshop gave sharp bark subsided when saw adam holding up finger at to impose silence in dumb tailless joy must content with rubbing body against master leg adam be too heart sick to take notice of gyp fondling threw on bench stared dully at wood sign of work around wondering if must ever come to feel pleasure in again while gyp dimly aware that there be something wrong with master laid rough grey head on adam knee wrinkled brow to look up at hitherto since sunday afternoon adam have be constantly among strange people in strange place having association with detail of daily life now that by light of new morning be come back to home surrounded by familiar object seemed for ever robbed of charm realitythe hard inevitable reality of trouble pressed upon with new weight right before be unfinished chest of drawer have be making in spare moment for hettys use when home must be hers seth have not heard adam entrance have be roused by gyp bark adam heard moving about in room above dressing seth first thought be about brother must come home to day surely for business must be wanting sadly by to morrow be pleasant to think have have longer holiday than have expected must dinah come too seth felt that be greatest happiness must look forward to for though have hope left that must ever love well enough to marry have often said to be better to be dinahs friend brother than other woman husband if must be always near instead of living so far off came downstairs opened inner door leading from kitchen into workshop intending to let out gyp stood still in doorway smitten with sudden shock at sight of adam seated listlessly on bench pale unwashed with sunken blank eye almost like drunkard in morning seth felt in instant what mark meantnot drunkenness great calamity adam looked up at without speaking seth moved forward towards bench trembling so that speech did not come readily god have mercy on addy said in low voice sitting down on bench beside adam what be adam be unable to speak strong man accustomed to suppress sign of sorrow have felt heart swell like child at first approach of sympathy fell on seth neck sobbed seth be prepared for worst now for even in recollection of boyhood adam have never sobbed before be death adam be dead asked in low tone when adam raised head be recovering lad shes gonegone away from shes never be to snowfield dinahs be gone to leeds ever since last friday be fortnight very day hetty set out cant find out where went after got to stoniton seth be silent from utter astonishment knew nothing must suggest to reason for hettys going away hast notion what shes done for said at last cant have loved didnt like marriage when came

told yet must set out on journey directly after ive be to village th hall farm cant tell thee where im going thee must say to im gone on business a nobody be to know anything about ill go wash now adam moved towards door of workshop after step two turned round meeting seth eye with calm sad glance said must take money out o tin box lad if anything happens to rest ll be thine to take care o mother with seth be pale trembling felt there be terrible secret under brother said faintlyhe never called adam brother except in solemn momentsi dont believe youll do anything a cant ask god blessing on nay lad said adam dont be afraid im for doing nought whats man duty thought that if betrayed trouble to mother must only distress by word half of blundering affection half of irrepressible triumph hetty proved a unfit to be wife a have always foreseen brought back of habitual firmness self command have felt ill on journey homehe told when came downhad stayed night at tredddleston for reason bad headache still hung about morning accounted for paleness heavy eye determined to go to village in first place attend to business for hour give notice to burge of being obliged to go on journey must beg not to mention to one for wished to avoid going to hall farm near breakfast time when child servant must be in house place there must be exclamation in hearing about having returned without hetty waited until clock struck nine before left work yard at village set off through field towards farm be immense relief to a came near home close to see mr poyser advancing towards for must spare pain of going to house mr poyser be walking briskly march morning with sense of spring business on mind be going to cast master eye on shoeing of new cart horse carrying spud a useful companion by way surprise be great when caught sight of adam be not man given to presentiment of evil why adam lad ist have ye be time away not brought lass back after where be ive not brought em said adam turning round to indicate that wished to walk back with mr poyser why said martin looking with sharper attention at adam ye look bad be there anything happened yes said adam heavily sad thing happened didna

too hard to think shes wicked mr irwine have sat down again in silence be too wise to utter soothing word at present indeed sight of adam before with look of sudden age sometimes come over young face in moment of terrible emotionthe hard bloodless look of skin deep line about quivering mouth furrow in browthe sight of strong firm man shattered by invisible stroke of sorrow moved so deeply that speech be not easy adam stood motionless with eye vacantly fixed in way for minute two in short space be living through love again cant have done said still without moving eye a if be only talking to

round home ill take bit of room here where can see prison wall perhaps will get in time to bear seeing adam have not be shaken in belief that hetty be innocent of crime be charged with for mr irwine feeling that belief in guilt must be crushing addition to adam load have kept from fact left hope in own mind there be not reason for thrusting whole burden on adam at once mr irwine at parting only said if evidence must tell too strongly against adam may still hope for pardon youth other circumstance will be plea for ah right people must know how be tempted into wrong way said adam with bitter earnestness right must know be fine gentleman made love to turned head wi notion youll remember sir youve promised to tell mother seth people at farm who be a led wrong else theyll think harder of

mercifully say nothing now only that punishment be in other hand than ours mr irwine felt hard upon that must have to tell of arthur sad part in story of sin sorrowhe who cared for arthur with fatherly affection who have cared for with fatherly pride saw clearly that secret must be known before long even apart from adam determination since be scarcely to be supposed that hetty must persist to end in obstinate silence made up mind to withhold nothing from poysers to tell worst at once for there be time to rob tidings of suddenness hettys trial must come on at lent assize be to be held at stoniton next week be scarcely to be hoped that martin poyser must escape pain of being called a witness be better must know everything a long beforehand a possible before ten oclock on thursday morning home at hall farm be house of mourning for misfortune felt to be worse than death sense of family dishonour be too keen even in kind hearted martin poyser younger to leave room for compassion

alldisgrace must never be wiped out be conquering feeling in mind of father sonthe scorching sense of disgrace neutralised other sensibilityand mr irwine be struck with surprise to observe mr poyser be le severe than husband be often startled by severity of mild people on exceptional occasion reason be that mild people be most liable to be under yoke of traditional impression im willing to pay

have gone to jonathan burge who have also claim to be acquainted with what be likely to keep adam away from business for time before six oclock evening there be few people in broxton hayslope who have not heard sad news mr irwine have not mentioned arthur name to burge yet story of conduct towards hetty with dark shadow cast upon by terrible consequence be presently a well known a grandfather be dead that be come into estate for martin poyser felt motive to keep silence towards one two neighbour who ventured to come shake sorrowfully by hand on first day of trouble carroll who kept ear open to passed at rectory have framed inferential version of story found early opportunity of communicating one of neighbour who came to martin poyser shook by hand without speaking for minute be bartle massey have shut up school be on way to rectory where arrived about half past seven in evening sending duty to mr irwine begged pardon for troubling at hour have something particular on mind be shown into study where mr irwine soon joined well bartle said mr irwine putting out hand be not usual way of saluting schoolmaster trouble make treat who feel with very much alike sit down know what im come

hard work to do poor fellow might have gone into higher branch then might never have happenedmight never have happened bartle be heated by exertion of walking fast in agitated frame of mind be not able to check on first occasion of venting feeling paused now to rub moist forehead probably moist eye also youll excuse sir said when pause have given time to reflect for running on in way about own feeling like foolish dog of mine howling in storm when there nobody want to listen to came to hear speak not to talk myselfif youll take trouble to tell what poor lad doing dont put under restraint bartle said mr irwine fact be im very much in same condition a just now ive great deal thats painful on mind find hard work to be quite silent about own feeling only attend to others share concern for adam though be not only one whose suffering care for in affair intends to remain at stoniton till after trial will come on probably week to morrow have taken room there encouraged to do so because think better must be away from own home at present poor fellow still belief hetty be innocenthe want to summon up courage to see if can be unwilling to leave spot where be do think creaturs guilty then said bartle do think theyll hang im afraid will go hard with evidence be very strong one bad symptom be that denies everythingdenies that have have child in face of most positive evidence saw myself be obstinately silent to shrank up like frightened animal when saw be never so shocked in life a at change in trust in worst case may obtain pardon for sake of innocent who be involved stuff nonsense said bartle forgetting in irritation to whom be speaking beg pardon sir mean stuff nonsense for innocent to care about being hanged for own part think sooner such woman be put out o world better men help em to do mischief have better go along with em for matter what good will do by keeping such vermin alive eating victual that ud feed rational being if adam fool enough to care about dont want to suffer more thans needful be very much cut up poor fellow bartle added taking out spectacle putting on a if must assist imagination yes im afraid grief cut very deep said mr irwine look terribly shattered certain violence came over now then yesterday made wish must have remained near will go to stoniton again to morrow have confidence enough in strength of adam principle to trust that will be able to endure worst without being driven to anything rash mr irwine who be involuntarily uttering own thought rather than addressing bartle massey in last sentence have in mind possibility that spirit of vengeance towards arthur be form adam anguish be continually taking might make seek encounter be likely to end more fatally than one in grove possibility heightened anxiety with looked forward to arthur arrival bartle thought mr irwine be referring to suicide face wore new alarm ill tell have in head sir said hope youll approve of im going to shut up schoolif scholar come must go back again thats alland will go to stoniton look after adam till business be over ill pretend im come to look on at assize cant object to what do think about sir well said mr irwine rather hesitatingly there must be real advantage in honour for friendship towards bartle must be careful what say to know im afraid have too little fellow feeling in what consider weakness about hetty trust to sirtrust to know what mean ive be fool in time thats between shant thrust on only keep eye on see that get good food put in word here there then said mr irwine reassured little a to bartles discretion think youll be doing good deed will be well for to let adam mother brother know that youre going yes sir yes said bartle rising taking off spectacle ill do ill do though mother whimpering thingi dont like to come within earshot of however shes straight backed clean woman none of slattern wish good bye sir thank for time youve spared youre everybodys friend in businesseverybodys friend heavy weight youve got on shoulder good bye bartle till meet at stoniton a daresay will bartle hurried away from rectory evading carroll conversational advance saying in exasperated tone to vixen whose short leg pattered beside on gravel now will be obliged to take with good for nothing woman youd go fretting to death if left youyou know must perhaps get snapped up by tramp youll be running into bad company expect putting nose in hole corner where youve business if do anything disgraceful ill disown youmind madam mind that chapter xli eve of trial upper room in dull stoniton street with two bed in itone laid on floor be ten oclock on thursday night dark wall opposite window shuts out moonlight might have struggled with light of one dip candle by bartle massey be pretending to read while be really looking over spectacle at adam bede seated near dark window must hardly have known be adam without being told face have got thinner last week have sunken eye neglected beard of man just risen from sick bed heavy black hair hang over forehead there be active impulse in incline to push off that may be more awake to what be around have one arm over back of chair seems to be looking down at clasped hand be roused by knock at door there be said bartle massey rising hastily unfastening door be mr irwine adam rose from chair with instinctive respect a mr irwine approached took hand im late adam said sitting down on chair bartle placed for be later in setting off from broxton than intended to be have be incessantly occupied since arrived have done everything now howevereverything that can be done to night at least let sit down adam took chair again mechanically bartle for whom there be chair remaining sat on bed in background have seen sir said adam tremulously yes adam chaplain have be with evening did ask sir did say anything about yes said mr irwine with hesitation spoke of said wished to see before trial if consented a mr irwine paused adam looked at with eager questioning eye know shrink from seeing one adam be not only yousome fatal influence seems to have shut up heart against fellow creature have scarcely said anything more than to chaplain three four day ago before be mentioned to when asked if there be one of family whom must like to seeto whom must open mindshe said with violent shudder tell not to come near mei wont see of adam head be hanging down again did not speak there be silence for few minute then mr irwine said dont like to advise against own feeling adam if now urge strongly to go see to morrow morning even without consent be just possible notwithstanding appearance to contrary that interview might affect favourably grieve to say have scarcely hope of didnt seem agitated when mentioned name only said in same cold obstinate way a usual if meeting have good effect on must be pure useless suffering to yousevere suffering fear be very much changed adam started up from chair seized hat lay on table stood still then looked at mr irwine a if have question to ask be yet difficult to utter bartle massey rose quietly turned key in door put in pocket be come back said adam at last be not said mr irwine quietly lay down hat adam unless like to walk out with for little fresh air fear have not be out again to day neednt deceive sir said adam looking hard at mr irwine speaking in tone of angry suspicion neednt be afraid of only want justice want to feel what feel work be child a ud have gone t anybodys heart to look at dont care what shes done be brought to will know will feel if there just god will feel what be t have brought child like to sin misery im not deceiving adam said mr irwine arthur donnithorne be not come backwas not come back when left have left letter for will know a soon a arrives dont mind about said adam indignantly think doesnt matter a lie there in shame misery know nothing about ithe suffers nothing adam will knowhe will suffer long bitterly have heart conscience cant be entirely deceived in character be convincedi be sure didnt fall under temptation without struggle may be weak be not callous not coldly selfish be persuaded that will be shock of will feel effect life why do crave vengeance in way amount of torture that must inflict on must benefit noo god adam groaned out sinking on chair again then thats deepest curse of thats make blackness of can never be undone poor hetty can never be sweet hetty again prettiest thing god have madesmiling up at thought loved be good adam voice have be gradually sinking into hoarse undertone a if be only talking to now said abruptly looking at mr irwine isnt a guilty a say dont think be sir cant have done that perhaps can never be known with certainty adam mr irwine answered gently in case sometimes form judgment on what seems to strong evidence yet for want of knowing small fact judgment be wrong suppose worst have right to say that guilt of crime lie with that ought to bear punishment be not for men to apportion share of moral guilt retribution find impossible to avoid mistake even in determining who have committed single criminal act problem how far man be to be held responsible for unforeseen consequence of own deed be one might well make tremble to look into evil consequence may lie folded in single act of selfish indulgence be thought so awful that ought surely to awaken feeling le presumptuous than rash desire to punish have mind can understand fully adam when be calm dont suppose cant enter into anguish drive into state of revengeful hatred think of if be to obey passionfor be passion deceive in calling justiceit might be with precisely a have be with arthur nay worse passion might lead into horrible crime nonot worse said adam bitterly dont believe worseid sooner do itid sooner do wickedness a must suffer for by than have brought to do wickedness then stand by see em punish while let alone for bit o pleasure a if hed have man heart in hed have cut hand off sooner than hed have taken what if didnt foresee whats happened foresaw enough hed no right to expect anything harm shame to then wanted to smooth off wi lie notheres plenty o thing folk be hanged for not so hateful a let man do what will if know he to bear punishment isnt half so bad a mean selfish coward a make thing easy t know while punishment ll fall on somebody else there again partly deceive adam there be sort of wrong deed of man can bear punishment alone cant isolate say that evil be in will not spread men life be a thoroughly blended with other a air breathe evil spread a necessarily a disease know feel terrible extent of suffering sin of arthur have caused to others so doe sin cause suffering to others besides who commit act of vengeance on part against arthur must simply be evil added to be suffering under must not bear punishment alone must entail worst sorrow on one who love must have committed act of blind fury must leave present evil just a be add worse evil to may tell that meditate fatal act of vengeance feeling in mind be what give birth to such action a long a indulge a long a see that to fix mind on arthur punishment be revenge not justice be in danger of being led on to commission of great wrong remember what told about feeling after have given that blow to arthur in grove adam be silent last word have called up vivid image of past mr irwine left to thought while spoke to bartle massey about old mr donnithornes funeral other matter of indifferent kind at length adam turned round said in more subdued tone ive not asked about em at th hall farm sir be mr poyser coming be come be in stoniton to night must not advise to see adam own mind be in very perturbed state be best must not see till be calmer be dinah morris come to em sir seth said theyd sent for mr poyser tell be not come when left theyre afraid letter have not reached seems have exact address adam sat ruminating little while then said wonder if dinah ud have gone to see perhaps poysers must have be sorely against since wont come nigh think must for methodist be great folk for going into prison seth said thought must shed very tender way with dinah have wonder if must have done good never saw sir did yes did have conversation with hershe pleased good deal now mention wish must come for be possible that gentle mild woman like might move hetty to open heart jail chaplain be rather harsh in manner o use if doesnt come said adam sadly if id thought of earlier must have taken measure for finding out said mr irwine too late now fear well adam must go now try to get rest to night god bless ill see early to morrow morning chapter xlii morning of trial at one oclock next day adam be alone in dull upper room watch lay before on table a if be counting long minute have knowledge of what be likely to be said by witness on trial for have shrunk from particular connected with hettys arrest accusation brave active man who must have hastened towards danger toil to rescue hetty from apprehended wrong misfortune felt powerless to contemplate irremediable evil suffering susceptibility must have be impelling force where there be possibility of action became helpless anguish when be obliged to be passive else sought active outlet in thought of inflicting justice on arthur energetic nature strong for strenuous deed will often rush away from hopeless sufferer a if be hard hearted be overmastering sense of pain drive shrink by ungovernable instinct a must shrink from laceration adam have brought to think of seeing hetty if must consent to see because thought meeting might possibly be good to hermight help to melt away terrible hardness told of if saw bore ill will for what have done to might open heart to resolution have be immense efforthe trembled at thought of seeing changed face a timid woman tremble at thought of surgeon knife chose now to bear long hour of suspense rather than encounter what seemed to more intolerable agony of witnessing trial deep unspeakable suffering may well be called baptism regeneration initiation into new state yearning memory bitter regret agonized sympathy struggling appeal to invisible rightall intense emotion have filled day night of past week be compressing again like eager crowd into hour of single morning made adam look back on previous year a if have be dim sleepy existence have only now awaked to full consciousness seemed to a if have always before thought light thing that men must suffer a if that have endured called sorrow before be only moment stroke that have never left bruise doubtless great anguish may do

distrusted himselfhe have learned to dread violence of own feeling that word of mr irwinesthat must remember what have felt after giving last blow to arthur in grovehad remained with thought about arthur like thought be charged with strong feeling be continually recurring always called up image of groveof that spot under overarching bough where have caught sight of two bending figure have be possessed by sudden rage ill go see again to night for last time said itll do good itll make feel over again what felt when id knocked down felt what poor empty work be a soon a id done before began

if have have basket of tool over shoulder might have be taken with pale wasted face for spectre of adam bede who entered grove on august evening eight month ago have basket of tool be not walking with old erectness looking keenly round hand be thrust in side pocket eye rested chiefly on ground have not long entered grove now paused before beech knew that tree well be boundary mark of youththe sign to of time when of earliest strongest feeling have left felt sure must never return yet at moment there be stirring of affection at remembrance of arthur donnithorne whom have believed in before have come up to beech eight month ago be affection for dead that arthur existed no longer be disturbed by sound of approaching footstep beech stood at turning in road must not see who be coming until tall slim figure in deep mourning suddenly stood before at only two yard distance started looked at other in silence often in last fortnight adam have imagined a close to arthur a assailing with word must be a harrowing a voice of remorse forcing upon just share in misery have caused often too have told that meeting have better not be in imagining meeting have always seen arthur a have met on evening in grove florid careless light of speech figure before touched with sign of suffering adam knew what suffering washe must not lay cruel finger on bruised man felt impulse that needed to resist silence be more just than reproach arthur be first to speak adam said quietly may be good thing that have met here for wished to see must have asked to see to morrow paused adam said nothing know be painful to to meet arthur went on be not likely to happen again for year to come sir said adam coldly be what meant to write to to morrow a must be better dealing must be at end between somebody else put in place arthur felt answer keenly be not without effort that spoke again be partly on subject wished to speak to dont want to lessen indignation against ask to do anything for sake only wish to ask if will help to lessen evil consequence of past be unchangeable dont mean consequence to myself to others be little can do know know worst consequence will remain something may be done can help will listen to patiently yes sir said adam after hesitation ill hear what be if can help to mend anything will anger ull mend nothing know weve have enough o be going to hermitage said arthur will go there with sit down can talk better there hermitage have never be entered since left together for arthur have locked up key in desk now when opened door there be candle burnt out in socket there be chair in same place where adam remembered sitting there be waste paper basket full of scrap deep down in arthur felt in instant there be little pink silk handkerchief must have be painful to enter place if previous thought have be le painful sat down opposite other in old place arthur said im going away adam im going into army poor arthur felt that adam ought to be affected by announcementought to have movement of sympathy towards adam lip remained firmly closed expression of face unchanged what want to say to arthur continued be one of reason for going away be that one else may leave hayslopemay leave home on account must do anything there be sacrifice must not make to prevent further injury to others through mythrough what have happened arthur word have precisely opposite effect to that have anticipated adam thought perceived in notion of compensation for irretrievable wrong that self soothing attempt to make evil bear same fruit a good most of roused indignation be a strongly impelled to look painful fact right in face a arthur be to turn away eye from moreover have wakeful suspicious pride of poor man in presence of rich man felt old severity returning a said time past for sir man must make sacrifice to keep clear of doing wrong sacrifice wont undo when done when people feeling have got deadly wound cant be cured with favour favour said arthur passionately how can suppose meant poysersmr irwine tell poysers mean to leave place where have lived so many yearsfor generation dont see a mr irwine doe that if must be persuaded to overcome feeling drive away must be much better for in end to remain on old spot among friend neighbour who know thats true said adam coldly then sir folks feeling be not so easily overcome itll be hard for martin poyser to go to strange place among strange face when he be bred up on hall farm father before then ud be harder for man with feeling to stay dont see how thing to be made other than hard there sort o damage sir cant be made up for arthur be silent moment in spite of other feeling dominant in evening pride winced under adam mode of treating wasnt suffering be not too obliged to renounce most cherished hope be now a have be eight month agoadam be forcing arthur to feel more intensely irrevocableness of own wrong doing be presenting sort of resistance be most irritating to arthur eager ardent nature anger be subdued by same influence have subdued adam when first confronted otherby mark of suffering in long familiar face momentary struggle ended in feeling that must bear great deal from adam to whom have be occasion of bearing so much there be touch of pleading boyish vexation in tone a said people may make injury worse by unreasonable conductby giving way to anger satisfying that for moment instead of thinking what will be effect in future if be going to stay here act a landlord added presently with still more eagernessif be careless about what ive donewhat ive be cause of must have excuse adam for going away encouraging others to go must have excuse then for trying to make evil worse when tell im going away for yearswhen know what mean for how cut off plan of happiness ive ever formedit be impossible for sensible man like to believe that there be real ground for poysers refusing to remain know feeling about disgracemr irwine have told be of opinion that might be persuaded out of idea that be disgraced in eye of neighbour that cant remain on estate if must join in effortsif must stay go on managing old wood arthur paused moment then added pleadingly know thats good work to do for sake of other people besides owner dont know that may have better owner soon whom will like to work for if die cousin tradgett will have estate take name be good fellow adam must not help being moved be impossible for not to feel that be voice of honest warm hearted arthur whom have loved be proud of in old day nearer memory must not be thrust away be silent yet arthur saw answer in face that induced to go on with growing earnestness then if must talk to poysersif must talk matter over with mr irwinehe mean to see to morrowand then if must join argument to to prevail on not to go know of course that must not accept favour from mei mean nothing of kindbut im sure must suffer le in end irwine think so too mr irwine be to have chief authority on estatehe have consented to undertake that will really be under man one whom respect like must be same with adam must be nothing desire to give worse pain must incline to go arthur be silent again for little while then said with agitation in voice wouldnt act so towards know if be in place in yours must try to help to do best adam made hasty movement on chair looked on ground arthur went on perhaps youve never done anything youve have bitterly to repent of in life adam if have must be more generous must know then that worse for than for arthur rose from seat with last word went to one of window looking out turning back on adam a continued passionately havent loved too didnt see yesterday shant carry thought of about with a much a will dont think must suffer more if youd be in fault there be silence for several minute for struggle in adam mind be not easily decided facile nature whose emotion have little permanence can hardly understand how much inward resistance overcame before rose from seat turned towards arthur arthur heard movement turning round met sad softened look with adam said true what say sir im hardits in nature be too hard with father for doing wrong ive be bit hard t everybody felt a if nobody pitied enoughher suffering cut into so when thought folk at farm be too hard with said id never be hard to anybody again feeling overmuch about have perhaps made unfair to ive known what be in life to repent feel too late felt id be too harsh to father when be gone from mei feel now when think of ive right to be hard towards a have done wrong repent adam spoke word with firm distinctness of man who be resolved to leave nothing unsaid that be bound to say went on with more hesitation wouldnt shake hand with once sir when asked mebut if youre willing to do now for refused then arthur white hand be in adam large grasp in instant with action there be strong rush on side of old boyish affection adam arthur said impelled to full confession now must never have happened if id known loved must have helped to save from did struggle never meant to injure deceived afterwardsand led on to worse thought be forced upon thought be best thing must do in letter told to let know if be in trouble dont think must not have done everything must be wrong from very first horrible wrong have come of god know id give life if must undo sat down again opposite other adam said tremulously how did seem when left sir dont ask adam arthur said feel sometimes a if must go mad with thinking of look what said to then couldnt get full pardonthat couldnt save from wretched fate of being can hing for year may die under never know comfort more ah sir said adam for first time feeling own pain merged in sympathy for arthur mell often be thinking o same thing when be long way off one ill pray god to help a pray to help there sweet

gentleness be what made hang back longer see same with poysers if stay for own worldly interest look a if wed put up with anything for sake o know thats what theyll feel cant help feeling little of when folk have got honourable independent spirit dont like to do anything might make em seem base minded one who know will think that adam be not reason strong enough against course be really more generous more unselfish than other will be knownit will be made known that poysers stayed at entreaty adam dont try to make thing worse for im punished enough without sir adam said looking at arthur

by timidity during next three day interval in have opportunity of speaking to adam be too rare short to cause strong temptation in long solitary hour brooded over regretful thought about dinah till have grown very near point of unmanageable strength when thought be apt to take wing out of secret nest in startling manner on sunday morning when seth went away to chapel at treddleston dangerous opportunity came sunday morning be happiest time in week to lisbeth for a there be service at hayslope church till afternoon adam be always at home doing nothing reading occupation in must venture to

let fall again on morning when read in apocrypha of be very fond son of sirach keen edged word must bring delighted smile though also enjoyed freedom of occasionally differing from apocryphal writer for adam knew article quite well a became good churchman lisbeth in pause of attending to dinner always sat opposite to watched till must rest no longer without going up to giving caress to call attention to morning be reading gospel according to st matthew lisbeth have be standing close by for minute stroking hair be smoother than usual morning looking down at large page with silent wonderment at mystery of letter be encouraged to continue caress because when first went up to have thrown back in chair to look at affectionately say why mother thee lookst rare hearty morning eh gyp

nourishment got from remembrance of dinahs confession that sunday afternoon there be wonderful amount of sustenance in first few word of love towards middle of october resolution began to dwindle

be little too flushed exalted with first draught offer to care much about taste of second tread earth with very elastic step a walk away from make light of difficulty sort of glow dy out memory get sadly diluted with time be not strong enough to revive adam be longer so confident a have be began to fear that perhaps dinahs old life must have too strong grasp upon for new feeling to triumph if have not felt must surely have written to to give comfort appeared that held right to discourage a adam confidence waned patience waned with thought must write must ask dinah not to leave in painful doubt longer than be needful sat up late one night to write letter next morning burnt afraid of effect must be worse to have discouraging answer by letter than from own lip for presence reconciled to will perceive how be adam be hungering for sight of dinah when sort of hunger reach certain stage lover be likely to still though may have to put future in pawn what harm must do by going to snowfield dinah must not be displeased with for have not forbidden to go must surely expect that must go before long by second sunday in october view of case have become so clear to adam that be already on way

thankful over past evil have blighted crushed because have be made source of unforeseen good to ourselves adam must never cease to mourn over mystery of human sorrow have be brought so close to must never thank god for anothers misery if be capable of narrow sighted joy in adam behalf must still know be not man to feel for must have shaken head at sentiment said evil evil sorrow sorrow cant alter natur by wrapping up in other word other folk be not created for sake must think square when thing turn out well for be not ignoble to feel that fuller life sad experience have brought be worth own

thinking knew better than a belonged to thats poor sort o life when cant look to nearest to t help with bit better thought than what youve got inside aready be more than two oclock in afternoon when adam came in sight of grey town on hill side looked searchingly towards green valley below for first glimpse of old thatched roof near ugly red mill scene looked le harsh in soft october sunshine than have in eager time of early spring one grand charm possessed in common with wide stretching woodless regionsthat filled with new consciousness of overarching skyhad milder more soothing influence than usual on almost cloudless day adam doubt fear melted under influence a delicate weblike cloud have gradually melted away into clear blue above seemed to see dinahs gentle face assuring with look alone of longed to know did not expect dinah to be at home at hour got down from horse tied at little gate that might ask where be gone to day have set mind on following bringing home be gone to slomans end hamlet about three mile off over hill old woman told himhad set off directly after morning chapel to preach in cottage there a habit be anybody at town must tell way to slomans end so adam got on horse again rode to town putting up at old inn taking hasty dinner there in company of too chatty landlord from whose friendly question reminiscence be glad to escape a soon a possible set out towards slomans end with haste be nearly four oclock before must set off thought that a dinah have gone so early must perhaps already be near returning little grey desolate looking hamlet unscreened by sheltering tree lay in sight long before reached a came near must hear sound of voice singing hymn perhaps thats last hymn before come away adam thought ill walk back bit turn again to meet farther off village walked back till got nearly to top of hill again seated on loose stone against low wall to watch till must see little black figure leaving hamlet winding up hill chose spot almost at top of hill because be away from eyesno house cattle not even nibbling sheep nearno presence still light shadow great embracing sky be much longer coming than expected waited hour at least watching for thinking of while afternoon shadow lengthened light grew softer at last saw little black figure coming from between grey house gradually approaching foot of hill slowly adam thought dinah be really walking at usual pace with light quiet step now be beginning to wind along path up hill adam must not move yet must not meet too soon have set heart on meeting in assured loneliness now began to fear lest must startle too much yet thought shes not one to be overstartled shes always so calm quiet a if be prepared for anything what be thinking of a wound up hill perhaps have found complete repose without have ceased to feel need of love on verge of decision tremble hope pause with fluttering wing now at last be very near adam rose from stone wall happened that just a walked forward dinah have paused turned round to look back at villagewho doe not pause look back in mounting hill adam be glad for with fine instinct of lover felt that must be best for to hear voice before saw came within three pace of then said dinah started without looking round a if connected sound with place dinah adam said again knew quite well what be in mind be so accustomed to think of impression a purely spiritual monition that looked for material visible accompaniment of voice second time looked round what look of yearning love be that mild grey eye turned on strong dark eyed man did not start again at sight of said nothing moved towards so that arm must clasp round walked on so in silence while warm tear fell adam be content said nothing be dinah who spoke first adam said be divine will soul be so knit to yours that be divided life live without moment now be with feel that heart be filled with same love have fulness of strength to bear do heavenly father will have lost before adam paused looked into sincere eye then well never part more dinah till death part kissed other with deep joy what greater thing be there for two human soul than to feel that be joined for lifeto strengthen
