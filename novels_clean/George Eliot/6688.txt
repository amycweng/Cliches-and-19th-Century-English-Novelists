master that master first rate fellow know man wouldnt mention chance to everybody because dont think everybody must succeed in getting if be to try mention to tulliver between fixed inquiring glance with mr tulliver have be watching friend oracular face became quite eager ay now let hear said adjusting in chair with complacency of person who be thought worthy of important communication he oxford man said mr riley sententiously shutting mouth close looking at mr tulliver to observe effect of stimulating information what parson said mr tulliver rather doubtfully yes ma bishop understand think very highly of why be bishop who got present curacy ah said mr tulliver to whom one thing be a wonderful a concerning unfamiliar phenomenon what can want wi tom then why fact be he fond of teaching wish to keep up study clergyman have little opportunity for in parochial duty he willing to take one two boy a pupil to fill up time profitably boy must be quite of familythe finest thing in world for under stellings eye continually do think theyd give poor lad twice o pudding said mr tulliver who be now in place again he such boy for pudding a never be growing boy like thatits dreadful to think o stintin what money ud want said mr tulliver whose instinct told that service of admirable ma must bear high price why know of clergyman who asks hundred fifty with youngest pupil he not to be mentioned with stelling man speak of know on good authority that one of chief people at oxford said stelling might get highest honour if chose didnt care about university honour he quiet mannot noisy ah deal bettera deal better said mr tulliver hundred fifty uncommon price never thought o paying so much a that good education let tell tullivera good education be cheap at money stelling be moderate in term he not grasping man ive doubt hed take boy at hundred thats what wouldnt get many other clergyman to do ill write to about if like mr tulliver rubbed knee looked at carpet in meditative manner belike he bachelor observed mr tulliver in interval ive opinion o housekeeper there be brother a be dead gone have housekeeper once took feather out o best bed packed em up sent em away unknown linen made away withstott name be ud break heart to send tom where there housekeeper hope wont think of mr tulliver may set mind at rest on score mr tulliver said mr riley for stelling be married to a nice

quarter stellings not everyday man rather particular fellow a to people chooses to be connected with think must have objection to take son think must not on representation dont know what must have against lad said mr tulliver with slight touch of motherly indignation nice fresh skinned lad a anybody need wish to see there one thing im thinking on said mr tulliver turning head on one side looking at mr riley after long perusal of carpet wouldnt parson be almost too high learnt to bring up lad to be man o business notion o parson be a theyd got sort o learning a lay mostly out o sight isnt what want for tom want to know figure write like print see into thing quick know what folk mean how to wrap thing up in word a arent actionable uncommon fine thing be concluded mr tulliver shaking head when can let man know what think of without paying for oh dear tulliver said mr riley youre quite under mistake about clergy best schoolmaster be of clergy schoolmaster who be not clergyman be very low set of men generally ay that jacob be at cademy interposed mr tulliver to be suremen who have failed in other trade most likely now clergyman be gentleman by profession education besides that have knowledge will ground boy prepare for entering on career with credit there may be clergyman who be mere bookman may depend upon stelling be not one of thema man thats wide awake let tell drop hint thats enough talk of figure now have only to say to stelling want son to be thorough arithmetician may leave rest to mr riley paused moment while mr tulliver somewhat reassured a to clerical tutorship be inwardly rehearsing to imaginary mr stelling statement want son to know rethmetic see dear tulliver mr riley continued when get thoroughly educated man like stelling he at loss to take up branch of instruction when workman know use of tool can make door a well a window ay thats true said mr tulliver almost convinced now that clergy must be best of schoolmaster well ill tell ill do for said mr riley wouldnt do for everybody ill see stellings father in law drop line when get back to mudport to say that wish to place boy with son in law dare say stelling will write to send term there hurry be there said mr tulliver for hope mr tulliver wont let tom begin at new school before midsummer began at cademy at lady day quarter see what good come of ay ay bessy never brew wi bad malt upo michaelmas day else youll have poor tap said mr tulliver winking smiling at mr riley with natural pride of man who have buxom wife conspicuously inferior in intellect true there hurry youve hit there bessy might be a well not to defer arrangement too long said mr riley quietly for stelling may have proposition from other party know must not take more than two three boarder if so many if be think must enter on subject with stelling at once there necessity for sending boy before midsummer must be on safe side make sure that nobody forestalls ay there summat in said mr tulliver father broke in maggie who have stolen unperceived to father elbow again listening with parted lip while held doll topsy turvy crushed nose against wood of chairfather be long way off where tom be to go shant ever go to see dont know wench said father tenderly ask mr riley know maggie came round promptly in front of mr riley said how far be please sir oh long long way off gentleman answered being of opinion that child when be not naughty must always be spoken to jocosely must borrow seven leagued boot to get to thats nonsense said maggie tossing head haughtily turning away with tear springing in eye began to dislike mr riley be evident thought silly of consequence hush maggie for shame of asking question chattering said mother come sit down on little stool hold tongue do added mr tulliver who have own alarm awakened be so far off a couldnt wash mend about fifteen mile thats said mr riley can drive there back in day quite comfortably orstelling be hospitable pleasant manhed be glad to have stay too far off for linen doubt said mr tulliver sadly entrance of supper opportunely adjourned difficulty relieved mr riley from labour of suggesting solution compromisea labour must otherwise doubtless have undertaken for a perceive be man of very obliging manner have really given trouble of recommending mr stelling to friend tulliver without positive expectation of solid definite advantage resulting to notwithstanding subtle indication to contrary might have misled too sagacious observer for there be nothing more widely misleading than sagacity if happens to get on wrong scent sagacity persuaded that men usually act speak from distinct motif with consciously proposed end in view be certain to waste energy on imaginary game plotting covetousness deliberate contrivance in order to compass selfish end be nowhere abundant in world of dramatist demand too intense mental action for many of fellow parishioner to be guilty of be easy enough to spoil life of neighbour without taking so much trouble can do by lazy acquiescence lazy omission by trivial falsity for hardly know reason by small fraud neutralised by small extravagance by maladroit flattery clumsily improvised insinuation live from hand to mouth most of with small family of immediate desire do little else than snatch morsel to satisfy hungry brood rarely thinking of seed corn next year crop mr riley be man of business not cold toward own interest yet even be more under influence of small prompting than of far sighted design have private understanding with rev walter stelling on contrary knew very little of ma acquirementsnot quite enough perhaps to warrant so strong recommendation of a have given to friend tulliver believed mr stelling to be excellent classic for gadsby have said so gadsbys first cousin be oxford tutor be better ground for belief even than own immediate observation must have be for though mr riley have received tincture of classic at great mudport free school have sense of understanding latin generally comprehension of particular latin be not ready doubtless there remained subtle aroma from juvenile contact with de senectute fourth book of neid have ceased to be distinctly recognisable a classical be only perceived in higher finish force of auctioneering style then stelling be oxford man oxford men be alwaysno be cambridge men who be always good mathematician man who have have university education must teach anything liked especially man like stelling who have made speech at mudport dinner on political occasion have acquitted so well that be generally remarked son in law of timpsons be sharp fellow be to be expected of mudport man from parish of st ursula that must not omit to do good turn to son in law of timpsons for timpson be one of most useful influential men in parish have good deal of business knew how to put into right hand mr riley liked such men quite apart from money might be diverted through good judgment from le worthy pocket into own must be satisfaction to to say to timpson on return home ive secured good pupil for son in law timpson have large family of daughter mr riley felt for besides louisa timpsons face with light curl have be familiar object to over pew wainscot on sunday for nearly fifteen year be natural husband must be commendable tutor moreover mr riley knew of other schoolmaster whom have ground for recommending in preference why then must not recommend stelling friend tulliver have asked for opinion be always chilling in friendly intercourse to say have opinion to give if deliver opinion at be mere stupidity not to do with air of conviction well founded knowledge make own in uttering naturally get fond of thus mr riley knowing harm of stelling to begin with wishing well so far a have wish at concerning have sooner recommended than began to think with admiration of man recommended on such high authority must soon have gathered so warm interest on subject that if mr tulliver have in end declined to send tom to stelling mr riley must have thought friend of old school thoroughly pig headed fellow if blame mr riley very severely for giving recommendation on such slight ground must say be rather hard upon why must auctioneer appraiser thirty year ago who have a good a forgotten free school latin be expected to manifest delicate scrupulosity be not always exhibited by gentleman of learned profession even in present advanced stage of morality besides man with milk of human kindness in can scarcely abstain from doing good natured action one can not be good natured round nature occasionally quarter inconvenient parasite on animal toward whom have otherwise ill will what then admire care for parasite if mr riley have shrunk from giving recommendation be not based on valid evidence must not have helped mr stelling to paying pupil must not have be so well for reverend gentleman consider too that pleasant little dim idea complacenciesof standing well with timpson of dispensing advice when be asked for of impressing friend tulliver with additional respect of saying something saying emphatically with other inappreciably minute ingredient went along with warm hearth brandy water to make up mr riley consciousness on occasionwould have be mere blank chapter iv tom be expected be heavy disappointment to maggie that be not allowed to go with father in gig when went to fetch tom home from academy morning be too wet mr tulliver said for little girl to go out in best bonnet maggie took opposite view very strongly be direct consequence of difference of opinion that when mother be in act of brushing out reluctant black crop maggie suddenly rushed from under hand dipped head in basin of water standing near in vindictive determination that there must be more chance of curl day maggie maggie exclaimed mr tulliver sitting stout helpless with brush on lap what be to become of if youre so naughty ill tell aunt glegg aunt pullet when come next week theyll never love

bitter sorrow of childhood when sorrow be new strange when hope have not yet got wing to fly beyond day week space from summer to summer seems measureless maggie soon thought have be hour in attic must be tea time be having tea not thinking of well then must stay up there starve herselfhide behind tub stay there nightand then must all be frightened must be sorry thus maggie thought in pride of heart a crept behind tub presently began to cry again at idea that didnt mind being there if went down again to tom nowwould forgive perhaps father must be there must take part then wanted tom to forgive because loved not because father told must never go down if tom didnt come to fetch resolution lasted in great intensity for five dark minute behind tub then need of being lovedthe strongest need in poor maggies naturebegan to wrestle with pride soon threw crept from behind tub into twilight of long attic just then heard quick foot step on stair tom have be too much interested in talk with luke in going round of premise walking in out where pleased whittling stick without particular reasonexcept that didnt whittle stick at schoolto think of maggie effect anger have produced on meant to punish that business having be performed occupied with other matter like practical person when have be called in to tea father said why wheres little wench mr tulliver almost at same moment

mr tulliver be peremptory man a said must never let anybody get hold of whip hand went out rather sullenly carrying piece of plumcake not intending to reprieve maggies punishment be more than deserved tom be only thirteen have decided view in grammar arithmetic regarding for most part a open question be particularly clear positive on one pointnamely that must punish everybody who deserved why wouldnt have minded being punished if deserved then never did deserve be tom step then that maggie heard on stair when need of love have triumphed over pride be going down with swollen eye dishevelled hair to beg for pity at least father must stroke head say never mind wench be wonderful subduer need of lovethis hunger of heartas peremptory a other hunger by nature force to submit to yoke change face of world knew tom step heart began to beat violently with sudden shock of hope only stood still at top of stair said maggie youre to come down rushed to clung round neck sobbing oh tom please forgive mei cant bear iti will always be goodalways remember thingsdo love meplease dear tom learn to restrain a get older keep apart when have quarrelled express in well bred phrase in way preserve dignified alienation showing much firmness on one side swallowing much grief on other no longer approximate in behaviour to mere impulsiveness of lower animal conduct ourselves in respect like member of highly civilised society maggie tom be still very much like young animal so must rub cheek against kiss ear in random sobbing way there be tender fibre in lad have be used to answer to maggies fondling so that behaved with weakness quite inconsistent with resolution to punish a much a deserved actually began to kiss in return say dont cry then magsie here eat bit o cake maggies sob began to

distinguishes human being place at proud distance from most melancholy chimpanzee sat still on bough gave up to keen sense of unmerited reproach must have given world not to have eaten puff to have saved of for tom not that puff be very nice for maggies palate be not at obtuse must have gone without many time over sooner than tom must call greedy be cross with have said wouldnt have ate without

must be otherwise bob knew directly saw bird egg whether be swallow tomtit yellow hammer found out wasp nest must set sort of trap must climb tree like squirrel have quite magical power of detecting hedgehog stoat have courage to do thing be rather naughty such a making gap in hedgerow throwing stone after sheep killing cat be wandering incognito such quality in inferior who must always be treated with authority in spite of superior knowingness have necessarily fatal fascination for tom holiday time maggie be sure to have day of grief because have gone off with bob well there be hope for be gone now maggie must think of comfort to sit down by hollow wander by hedgerow fancy be different refashioning little world into just what must like to be maggies be troublous life be form in took opium meanwhile tom forgetting about maggie sting of reproach have left in heart be hurrying along with bob whom have met accidentally to scene of great rat catching in neighbouring barn bob knew about particular affair spoke of sport with enthusiasm one who be not either divested of manly feeling pitiably ignorant of rat catching can fail to imagine for person suspected of preternatural wickedness bob be really not so very villanous looking there be even something agreeable in snub nosed face with close curled border of red hair then trouser be always rolled up at knee for convenience of wading on slightest notice virtue supposing to exist be undeniably virtue in rag on authority even of bilious philosopher who think well dressed merit overpaid be notoriously likely to remain unrecognised perhaps because be seen so seldom know chap a owns ferret said bob in hoarse treble voice a shuffled along keeping blue eye fixed on river like amphibious animal who foresaw

trying whether barking must not answer purpose just a well ugh coward said tom kicked over feeling humiliated a sportsman to posse so poor spirited animal bob abstained from remark passed on choosing however to walk in willow edge of overflowing river by way of change he none so full now floss isnt said bob a kicked water up before with agreeable sense of being insolent to why last ear meadow be

before be paid for so of curled front mr glegg have doubtless glossiest crispest brown curl in drawer a well a curl in various degree of fuzzy laxness to look out on week day world from under crisp glossy front must be to introduce most dreamlike unpleasant confusion between sacred secular occasionally indeed mr glegg wore one of third best front on week day visit not at sister house especially not at mr tullivers who since marriage have hurt sister feeling greatly by wearing own hair though a mr glegg observed to mr deane mother of family like bessy with husband always going to law might have be expected to know better bessy be always weak so if mr gleggs front to day be more fuzzy lax than usual have design under intended most pointed cutting allusion to mr tullivers bunch of blond curl separated from other by due wave of smoothness on side of parting mr tulliver have shed tear several time at sister gleggs unkindness on subject of unmatronly curl consciousness of looking handsomer for naturally administered support mr glegg chose to wear bonnet in house to dayuntied tilted slightly of coursea frequent practice of hers when be on visit happened to be in severe humour didnt know what draught there might be in strange house for same reason wore small sable tippet reached just to shoulder be very far from meeting across well formed chest while long neck be protected

lip in fresh looking suit of black white cravat seemed to have be tied very tight on higher principle than of mere personal ease bore about same relation to tall good looking wife with balloon sleeve abundant mantle large befeathered beribboned bonnet a small fishing smack bear to brig with sail spread be pathetic sight striking example of complexity introduced into emotion by high state of civilisation sight of fashionably dressed female in grief from sorrow of hottentot to of woman in large buckram sleeve with several bracelet on arm architectural bonnet delicate ribbon string what long series of gradation in enlightened child of civilisation abandonment characteristic of grief be checked varied in subtlest manner so a to present interesting problem to analytic mind if with crushed heart eye half blinded by mist of tear be to walk with too devious step through door place might crush buckram sleeve too deep consciousness of possibility produce composition of force by take line just clear door post perceiving that tear be hurrying fast unpins string throw languidly backward touching gesture indicative even in deepest gloom of hope in future dry moment when cap string will once more have charm a tear subside little with head leaning backward at angle will not injure bonnet endures that terrible moment when grief have made thing else weariness have become weary look

fond of going upstairs with sister pullet looking thoroughly at cap before put on head discussing millinery in general be part of bessys weakness stirred mr gleggs sisterly compassion bessy went far too well dressed considering be too proud to dress child in good clothing sister glegg gave from primeval stratum of wardrobe be sin shame to buy anything to dress that child if wasnt pair of shoe in particular however mr glegg did sister bessy injustice for mr tulliver have really made great effort to induce maggie to wear leghorn bonnet dyed silk frock made out of aunt gleggs result have be such that mr tulliver be obliged to bury in maternal bosom for maggie declaring that frock smelt of nasty dye have taken opportunity of basting together with roast beef first sunday wore finding scheme

woman who have married a poorly a must be have china have husband who have much ado to pay rent when mr pullet be alone with mr tulliver upstairs remark be naturally to disadvantage of mr glegg agreed in confidence that there be knowing what sort of fright sister jane must come out next tte tte be curtailed by appearance of mr deane with little lucy mr tulliver have to look on with silent pang while lucy blond curl be adjusted be quite unaccountable that mr deane thinnest sallowest of miss dodsons must have have child who might have be taken for mr tullivers day maggie always looked twice a dark a usual when be by side of lucy did to day when tom came in from garden with father uncle glegg maggie have thrown bonnet off very carelessly coming in with hair rough a well a out of curl rushed at once to lucy who be standing by mother knee certainly contrast between cousin be conspicuous to superficial eye be very much to disadvantage of maggie though connoisseur might have seen point in

tempting to lad who have already tasted forbidden pleasure of cutting pony mane speak to who know satisfaction of making pair of scissors meet through duly resisting mass of hair one delicious grinding snip then hinder lock fell heavily on floor maggie stood cropped in jagged uneven manner with sense of clearness freedom a if have emerged from wood into open plain oh maggie said tom jumping round slapping knee a laughed button what queer thing look look at in glass look like idiot throw out nutshell to at school maggie felt unexpected pang have thought beforehand chiefly at own deliverance from teasing hair teasing remark about something also of triumph must have over mother aunt by very decided course of action didnt want hair to look prettythat be out of questionshe only wanted people to think clever little girl not to find fault with now when tom began to laugh at say be like idiot affair have quite new aspect looked in glass still tom laughed clapped hand maggies cheek began to pale lip to tremble little oh maggie youll have to go down to dinner directly said tom oh dont laugh at tom said maggie in passionate tone with outburst of angry tear stamping giving push now then spitfire said tom what did cut off for then will go down can smell dinner going in hurried downstairs left poor maggie to bitter sense of irrevocable be almost everyday experience of small soul must see clearly enough now thing be done that be very foolish that must have to hear think more about hair than ever for maggie rushed to deed with passionate impulse then saw not only consequence what must have happened if have not be done with detail exaggerated circumstance of active imagination tom never did same sort of foolish thing a maggie having wonderful instinctive discernment of what must turn to advantage disadvantage so happened that though be much more wilful inflexible than maggie mother hardly ever called naughty if tom did make mistake of sort espoused stood by didnt mind if broke lash of father gigwhip by lashing gate couldnt help itthe whip shouldnt have got caught in hinge if tom tulliver whipped gate be convinced not that whipping of gate by boy be justifiable act that tom tulliver be justifiable in whipping that particular gate wasnt going to be sorry maggie a stood cry before glass felt impossible that must go down to dinner endure severe

trouble to fret about by by be consolation have almost of have administered to in childhood have repeated to other child since have be grown up have of sobbed so piteously standing with tiny bare leg above little sock when lost sight of mother nurse in strange place can no longer recall poignancy of moment weep over a do over remembered suffering of five ten year ago one of keen moment have left trace life in still such trace have blent irrecoverably with firmer texture of youth manhood so come that can look on at trouble of child with smiling disbelief in reality of pain be there one who can recover experience of childhood not merely with memory of what did what happened to of what liked disliked when be in frock trouser with intimate penetration revived consciousness of what felt then when be so long from one midsummer to what felt when school fellow shut out of game because must pitch ball wrong out of mere wilfulness on rainy day in holiday when didnt know how to amuse fell from idleness into mischief from mischief into defiance from defiance into sulkiness when mother absolutely refused to let have tailed coat half although other boy of age have gone into tail already surely if must recall early bitterness dim guess strangely perspectiveless conception of life gave bitterness intensity must not pooh pooh grief of child miss maggie youre to come down minute said kezia

going away turned again at door said youd better come know there dessertnuts know cowslip wine maggies tear have ceased looked reflective a tom left good nature have taken off keenest edge of suffering nut with cowslip wine began to assert legitimate influence slowly rose from amongst scattered lock slowly made way downstairs then stood leaning with one shoulder against frame of dining parlour door peeping in when be ajar saw tom lucy with empty chair between there be custard on side table be too much slipped in went toward empty chair have sooner sat down than repented wished back again mr tulliver gave little scream a saw felt turn dropped large gravy spoon into dish with most serious result to table cloth for kezia have not betrayed reason of maggies refusal to come down not liking to give mistress shock in moment of carving mr tulliver thought there be nothing worse in question than fit of perverseness be inflicting own punishment by depriving maggie of half dinner mr tullivers scream made eye turn towards same point a own maggies cheek ear began to burn while uncle glegg kind looking white haired old gentleman said heyday what little gells why dont know be little gell youve picked up in road kezia why shes gone cut hair said mr tulliver in undertone to mr deane laughing with much enjoyment did ever know little hussy a be why little miss youve made look very funny said uncle pullet perhaps never in life made observation be felt to be so lacerating fie for shame said aunt glegg in loudest severest tone of reproof little gells a cut own hair must be whipped fed on bread waternot come sit down with aunt uncle ay ay said uncle glegg meaning to give playful turn to denunciation must be sent to jail think theyll cut rest of hair off there make even shes more like gypsy ever said aunt pullet in pitying tone very bad luck sister a gell must be so brown boy fair enough doubt itll stand in way life to be so brown shes naughty child asll break mother heart said mr tulliver with tear in eye maggie seemed to be listening to chorus of reproach derision first flush came from anger gave transient power of defiance tom thought be braving out supported by recent appearance of pudding custard under impression whispered oh maggie told youd catch meant to be friendly maggie felt convinced that tom be rejoicing in ignominy feeble power of defiance left in instant heart swelled getting up from chair ran to father hid face on shoulder burst out into loud sobbing come come wench said father soothingly putting arm round never mind be right to cut off if plagued give over cry fatherll take part delicious word of tenderness maggie never forgot of moment when father took part kept in heart thought of long year after when one else said that father have done very ill by child how husband doe spoil that child bessy said mr glegg in loud aside to mr tulliver itll be ruin of if dont take care father never brought child up so else must have be different sort o family to what be mr tullivers domestic sorrow seemed at moment to have reached point at insensibility begin took notice of sister remark threw back capstrings dispensed pudding in mute resignation with dessert there came entire deliverance for maggie for child be told might have nut wine in summer house since day be so mild scampered out among budding bush of garden with alacrity of small animal getting from under burning glass mr tulliver have special reason for permission now dinner be despatched one mind disengaged be right moment to communicate mr tullivers intention concerning tom must be a well for tom to be absent child be used to hear talked of a freely a if be bird must understand nothing however might stretch neck listen on occasion mr tulliver manifested unusual discretion because have recently have evidence that going to school to clergyman be sore point with tom who looked at a very much on par with going to school to constable mr tulliver have sighing sense that husband must do a liked whatever sister glegg said sister pullet at least must not be able to say if thing turned out ill that bessy have fallen in with husband folly without letting own friend know word about mr tulliver said interrupting husband in talk with mr deane time now to tell childrens aunt uncle what youre thinking of doing with tom isnt very well said mr tulliver rather sharply ive objection to tell anybody what mean to do with ive settled added looking toward mr glegg mr deaneive settled to send to mr stelling parson down at king lorton therean uncommon clever fellow understand asll put up to most thing there be rustling demonstration of surprise in company such a may have observed in country congregation when hear allusion to week day affair from pulpit be equally astonishing to aunt uncle to find parson introduced into mr tullivers family arrangement a for uncle pullet must hardly have be more thoroughly obfuscated if mr tulliver have said that be going to send tom to lord chancellor for uncle pullet belonged to extinct class of british yeoman who dressed in good broadcloth paid high rate tax went to church ate particularly good dinner on sunday without dreaming that british constitution in church state have traceable origin more than solar system fixed star be melancholy true that mr pullet have most confused idea of bishop a sort of baronet who might might not be clergyman a rector of own parish be man of high family fortune idea that clergyman must be schoolmaster be too remote from mr pullet experience to be readily conceivable know be difficult for people in instructed time to believe in uncle pullet ignorance let reflect on remarkable result of great natural faculty under favouring circumstance uncle pullet have great natural faculty for ignorance be first to give utterance to astonishment why what can be going to send to parson for said with amazed twinkling in eye looking at mr glegg mr deane to see if showed sign of comprehension why because parson be best schoolmaster by what can make out said poor mr tulliver who in maze of puzzling world laid hold of clue with great readiness tenacity jacob at th academy parson he done very bad by boy made up mind if send to school again must be to somebody different to jacob mr stelling by what can make out be sort o man want mean boy to go to at midsummer concluded in tone of decision tapping snuff box taking pinch youll have to pay swinging half yearly bill then eh tulliver clergyman have highish notion in general said mr deane taking snuff vigorously a always did when wishing to maintain neutral position what do think parsonll teach to know good sample o wheat when see neighbour tulliver said mr glegg who be fond of jest having retired from business felt that be not only allowable becoming in to take playful view of thing why see ive got plan head about tom said mr tulliver pausing after statement lifting up glass well if may be allowed to speak seldom a be said mr glegg with tone of bitter meaning must like to know what good be to come to boy by bringin up above fortin why said mr tulliver not looking at mr glegg at male part of audience see ive made up mind not to bring tom up to own business ive have thought about along made up mind by what saw with garnett son mean to put to business a can go into without capital want to give eddication a hell be even wi lawyer folk put up to notion now then mr glegg emitted long sort of guttural sound with closed lip smiled in mingled pity scorn ud be fine deal better for people said after introductory note if theyd let lawyer alone be at head of grammar school then clergyman such a at market bewley said mr deane nothing of said mr tulliver wont take more than two three pupil so hell have more time to attend to em know ah get eddication done sooner cant learn much at time when there so many of em said uncle pullet feeling that be getting quite insight into difficult matter hell want more pay doubt said mr glegg ay ay cool hundred year thats said mr tulliver with pride at own spirited course then know investment tom eddication ull be so much capital to ay there something in said mr glegg well well neighbour tulliver may be right may be right when land be gone money spent then learning be most excellent remember seeing two line wrote on window at buxton have got learning have better keep money eh neighbour pullet mr glegg rubbed knee looked very pleasant mr glegg wonder at said wife very unbecoming in man o age belonging whats unbecoming mr g said mr glegg winking pleasantly at company new blue coat a ive got on pity weakness mr glegg say unbecoming to be making joke when see own kin going headlongs to ruin if mean by said mr tulliver considerably nettled neednt trouble to fret about can manage own affair without troubling other folk bless said mr deane judiciously introducing new idea why now come to think of somebody said wakem be going to send sonthe deformed clergyman didnt susan appealing to wife can give account of im sure said mr deane closing lip very tightly again mr deane be not woman to take part in scene where missile be flying well said mr tulliver speaking more cheerfully that mr glegg might see didnt mind if wakem think o sending son to clergyman depend on will make mistake sending tom to one wakems a big scoundrel a old harry ever made know length of man foot he got to deal with ay ay tell who wakems butcher ill tell where to get meat lawyer wakems son got hump back said mr pullet who felt a if whole business have funereal aspect more natral to send to clergyman yes said mr glegg interpreting mr pullet observation with erroneous plausibility must consider that neighbour tulliver wakems son isnt likely to follow business wakem ull make gentleman of poor fellow mr glegg said mr g in tone implied that indignation must fizz ooze little though be determined to keep corked up youd far better hold tongue mr tulliver doesnt want to know opinion mine there folk in world a know better than everybody else why must think thats if be to trust own tale said mr tulliver beginning to boil up again oh say nothing said mr glegg sarcastically advice have never be asked dont give itll be first time then said mr tulliver only thing youre over ready at giving ive be over ready at lending then if havent be over ready at giving said mr glegg there folk ive lent money to a perhaps will repent o lending money to kin come come come said mr glegg soothingly mr tulliver be not to be hindered of

supplement to mr tullivers own tendency way have remained in rather inarticulate condition now woman be gone must carry on serious talk without frivolous interruption must exchange view concerning duke of wellington whose conduct in catholic question have thrown entirely new light on character speak slightingly of conduct at battle of waterloo must never have won if there hadnt be great many englishman at back not to speak of blucher prussian who a mr tulliver have heard from person of particular knowledge in matter have come up in very nick of time though here there be slight dissidence mr deane remarking that be not disposed to give much credit to prussiansthe build of vessel together with unsatisfactory character of transaction in dantzic beer inclining to form rather low view of prussian pluck generally rather beaten on ground mr tulliver proceeded to express fear that country must never again be what used to be mr deane attached to firm of return be on increase naturally took more lively view of present have detail to give concerning state of import especially in hide spelter soothed mr tullivers imagination by throwing into more distant perspective period when country must become utterly prey of papist radical there must be no more chance for honest men uncle pullet sat by listened with twinkling eye to high matter didnt understand politics himselfthought be natural giftbut by what must make out duke of wellington be better than must be chapter viii mr tulliver show weaker side suppose sister glegg must call money in ud be very awkward for to have to raise five hundred pound now said mr tulliver to husband evening a took plaintive review of day mr tulliver have lived thirteen year with husband yet retained in freshness of early married life facility of saying thing drove in opposite direction to one desired mind be wonderful for keeping bloom in way a patriarchal goldfish apparently retains to last youthful illusion that can swim in straight line beyond encircling glass mr tulliver be amiable fish of kind after running head against same resisting medium for thirteen year must go at again to day with undulled alacrity observation of hers tended directly to convince mr tulliver that must not be at awkward for to raise five hundred pound when mr tulliver became rather pressing to know how must raise without mortgaging mill house have said never must mortgage since nowadays people be none so ready to lend money without security mr tulliver getting warm declared that mr glegg might do a liked about calling in money must pay in whether not be not going to be beholden to wife sister when man have married into family where there be whole litter of woman might have plenty to put up with if chose mr tulliver did not choose mr tulliver cried little in trickling quiet way a put on nightcap presently sank into comfortable sleep lulled by thought that must talk everything over with sister pullet to morrow when be to take child to garum fir to tea not that looked forward to distinct issue from talk seemed impossible that past event must be so obstinate a to remain unmodified when be complained against husband lay awake rather longer for too be thinking of visit must pay on morrow idea on subject be not of so vague soothing kind a of amiable partner mr tulliver when under influence of strong feeling have promptitude in action may seem inconsistent with painful sense of complicated puzzling nature of human affair under more dispassionate deliberation be conducted be really not improbable that there be direct relation between apparently contradictory phenomenon since have observed that for getting strong impression that skein be tangled there be nothing like snatching hastily at single thread be owing to promptitude mr be on horseback soon after dinner next day be not dyspeptic on way to basset to see sister moss husband for having made up mind irrevocably that must pay mr glegg loan of five hundred pound naturally occurred to that have promissory note for three hundred pound lent to brother in law moss if said brother in law must manage to pay in money within given time must go far to lessen fallacious air of inconvenience mr tullivers spirited step might have worn in eye of weak people who require to know precisely how thing be to be done before be strongly confident that will be easy for mr tulliver be in position new striking like other everyday thing sure to have cumulative effect will be felt in long run be held to be much more substantial man than really be a be apt to believe what world belief about be habit to think of failure ruin with same sort of remote pity with spare long necked man hears that plethoric short necked neighbour be stricken with apoplexy have be always used to hear pleasant joke about advantage a man who worked own mill owned pretty bit of land joke naturally kept up sense that be man of considerable substance gave pleasant flavour to glass on market day if have not be for recurrence of half yearly payment mr tulliver must really have forgotten that there be mortgage of two thousand pound on very desirable freehold be not altogether own fault since one of thousand pound be sister fortune have to pay on marriage man who have neighbour will go to law with be not likely to pay off mortgage especially if enjoys good opinion of acquaintance who want to borrow hundred pound on security too lofty to be represented by parchment friend mr tulliver have good natured fibre in did not like to give harsh refusal even to sister who have not only come in to world in superfluous way characteristic of sister creating necessity for mortgage have quite thrown away in marriage have crowned mistake by having eighth baby on point mr tulliver be conscious of being little weak apologised to by saying that poor gritty have be good looking wench before married moss must sometimes say even with slight tremulousness in voice morning be in mood more becoming man of business in course of ride along basset lane with deep rutslying so far away from market town that labour of drawing produce manure be enough to take away best part of profit on such poor land a parish be made ofhe got up due amount of irritation against moss a man without capital who if murrain blight be abroad be sure to have share of who more tried to help out of mud must sink further in must do good rather than harm now if be obliged to raise three hundred pound must make look about better not act so foolishly about wool year a did last in fact mr tulliver have be too easy with brother in law because have let interest run on for two year moss be likely enough to think that must never be troubled about principal mr tulliver be determined not to encourage such shuffling people longer ride along basset lane be not likely to enervate man resolution by softening temper deep trodden hoof mark made in muddiest day of winter gave shake now then suggested rash stimulating snarl at father of lawyer who whether by mean of hoof otherwise have doubtless something to do with state of road abundance of foul land neglected fence met eye though made part of

dreg mr dickison leaning against door post with melancholy pimpled face looking a irrelevant to daylight a last night guttered candleall may not seem very seductive form of temptation majority of men in basset found fatally alluring when encountered on road toward four oclock on wintry afternoon if wife in basset wished to indicate that husband be not pleasure seeking man must hardly do more emphatically than by saying that didnt spend shilling at dickisons from one whitsuntide to mr moss have said so of husband more than once when brother be in mood to find fault with a certainly be to day nothing must be le pacifying to mr tulliver than behaviour of farmyard gate sooner attempted to push open with riding stick than acted a gate without upper hinge be known to do to peril of shin

eight child must never overcome regret that twin have not lived mr moss thought removal be not without consolation wont come in brother said looking anxiously at husband who be walking slowly up while

coloured with thrum very pretty be done o purpose for maggie will please to carry in pocket ay ay said mr tulliver putting carefully in side pocket good by so respectable miller returned along basset lane rather more puzzled than before a to way mean still with sense of danger escaped have come across mind that if be hard upon sister might somehow tend to make tom hard upon maggie at distant day when father be no longer there to take part for simple people like friend mr be apt to clothe unimpeachable feeling in erroneous idea be confused way of explaining to that love anxiety for little wench have given new sensibility toward sister chapter ix to garum fir while possible trouble of maggies future be occupying father mind be tasting only bitterness of present childhood have foreboding then be soothed by memory of outlived sorrow fact be day have begun ill with pleasure of having lucy to look at prospect of afternoon visit to garum fir where must hear uncle pullet musical box have be marred a early a eleven oclock by advent of hair dresser from st oggs who have spoken in severest term of condition in have found hair holding up one jagged lock after saying see here tut tut tut in tone of mingled disgust pity to maggies imagination be equivalent to strongest expression of public opinion mr rappit hair dresser with well anointed coronal lock tending wavily upward like simulated pyramid of flame on monumental urn seemed to at moment most formidable of contemporary into whose street at st oggs must carefully refrain from entering through rest of life moreover preparation for visit being always serious affair in dodson family martha be enjoined to have mr tullivers room ready hour earlier than usual that laying out of best clothes might not be deferred till last moment a be sometimes case in family of lax view where ribbon string be never rolled up where there be little wrapping in silver paper where sense that sunday clothes must be got at quite easily

till dinner a suitable amusement for boy girl in best clothes tom must build perfect pyramid of house maggies must never bear laying on roof be always so with thing maggie made tom have deduced conclusion that girl must ever make anything happened that lucy proved wonderfully clever at building handled card so lightly moved so gently that tom condescended to admire house a well a own more readily because have asked to teach maggie too must have admired lucy house must have given up own unsuccessful building to contemplate without ill temper if tucker have not made peevish if tom have not inconsiderately laughed when house fell told be stupid dont laugh at tom burst out angrily im not stupid know great many thing dont oh dare say miss spitfire id never be such cross thing a making face like lucy doesnt do so like lucy better than wish lucy be sister then very wicked cruel of to wish so said maggie starting up hurriedly from place on floor upsetting tom wonderful pagoda really did not mean circumstantial evidence be against tom turned white with anger said nothing must have struck only knew be cowardly to strike girl tom tulliver be quite determined must never do anything cowardly maggie stood in dismay terror while tom got up from floor walked away pale from scattered ruin of pagoda lucy looked on mutely like kitten pausing from lapping oh tom said maggie at last going half way toward didnt mean to knock down indeed indeed didnt tom took notice of took instead two three hard pea out of pocket shot with thumbnail against window vaguely at first presently with distinct aim of hitting superannuated blue bottle be exposing imbecility in spring sunshine clearly against view of nature who have provided tom pea for speedy destruction of weak individual thus morning have be made heavy to maggie tom persistent coldness to through walk spoiled fresh air sunshine for called lucy to look at half built bird nest without caring to show peeled willow switch for lucy without offering one to maggie lucy have said maggie shouldnt like one tom be deaf still sight of peacock opportunely spreading tail on stackyard wall just a reached garum fir be enough to divert

general unusualness characterised uncle pullet possession a gentleman farmer toad who paid rent be naturally leaner a for house be not le remarkable have receding centre two wing with battlemented turret be covered with glittering white stucco uncle pullet have seen expected party approaching from window made haste to unbar unchain front door kept always in fortified condition from fear of

child for god sake bessy dont let em come up door step sally bringing old mat duster to rub shoe mr pullet front door mat be by mean intended to wipe shoe on very scraper have deputy to do dirty work tom rebelled particularly against shoewiping always considered in light of indignity to sex felt a beginning of disagreeables incident to visit at aunt pullet where have once be compelled to sit with towel wrapped round boot fact may serve to correct too hasty conclusion that visit to garum fir must have be great treat to young gentleman fond of animalsfond be of throwing stone at next disagreeable be confined to feminine companion be mounting of polished oak stair have very handsome carpet rolled up laid by in spare bedroom so that ascent of glossy step might have served in barbarous time a trial by ordeal from none most spotless virtue must have come off with unbroken limb sophys weakness about polished stair be always subject of bitter remonstrance on mr gleggs part mr tulliver ventured on comment only thinking to herself be mercy when child be safe on landing mr gray have sent home new bonnet bessy said mr pullet in pathetic tone a mr tulliver adjusted cap have sister said mr tulliver with air of much interest how do like apt to make mess with clothes taking em out putting em in again said mr pullet drawing bunch of key from pocket looking at earnestly ud be pity for to go away without seeing there knowing what may happen mr pullet shook head slowly at last serious consideration determined to single out particular key im afraid itll be troublesome to getting out sister said mr tulliver must like to see what sort of crown shes made mr pullet rose with melancholy air unlocked one wing of very bright wardrobe where may have hastily supposed must find new bonnet not at such supposition must only have arisen from too superficial acquaintance with habit of dodson family in wardrobe mr pullet be seeking something small enough to be hidden among layer of linenit be door key must come with into best room said mr pullet may child come too sister inquired mr tulliver who saw that maggie lucy be looking rather eager well said aunt pullet reflectively itll perhaps be safer for em to come theyll be touching something if leave em behind so went in procession along bright slippery corridor dimly lighted by semi lunar top of window rose above closed shutter be really quite solemn aunt pullet paused unlocked door opened on something still more solemn than passagea darkened room in outer light entering feebly showed what looked like corps of furniture in white shroud everything be not shrouded stood with leg upward lucy laid hold of maggies frock maggies heart beat rapidly aunt pullet half opened shutter then unlocked wardrobe with melancholy deliberateness be quite in keeping with funereal solemnity of scene delicious scent of rose leaf issued from wardrobe made process of taking out sheet after sheet of silver paper quite pleasant to assist at though sight of bonnet at last be anticlimax to maggie who must have preferred something more strikingly preternatural few thing must have be more impressive to mr tulliver looked round in silence for moment then said emphatically well sister ill never speak against full crown again be great concession mr pullet felt felt something be due to like to see on sister said sadly ill open shutter bit further well if dont mind taking off cap sister said mr tulliver mr pullet took off cap displaying brown silk scalp with jutting promontory of curl be common to more mature judicious woman of time placing bonnet on head turned slowly round like draper lay figure mr tulliver might miss point of view ive sometimes thought there loop too much o ribbon on left side sister what do think said mr pullet mr tulliver looked earnestly at point indicated turned head on one side well think best a be if meddled with sister might repent thats true said aunt pullet taking off bonnet looking at contemplatively how much might charge for bonnet sister said mr tulliver whose mind be actively engaged on possibility of getting humble imitation of chef duvre made from piece of silk have at home mr pullet screwed up mouth shook head then whispered pullet pay for said be to have best bonnet at garum church let next best be whose must began slowly to adjust trimming in preparation for returning to place in wardrobe thought seemed to have taken melancholy turn for shook head ah said at last may never wear twice sister who know dont talk o sister answered mr tulliver hope youll have health summer ah there may come death in family a there did soon after have green satin bonnet cousin abbott may go cant think o wearing crape le year for must be unlucky said mr

mr pullet returning bonnet to wardrobe locking up maintained silence characterised by head shaking until have issued from solemn chamber be in own room again then beginning to cry said sister if must never see that bonnet again till im dead gone youll remember showed day mr tulliver felt that ought to be affected be woman of sparse tear stout healthy couldnt cry so much a sister pullet did have often felt deficiency at funeral effort to bring tear into eye issued in odd contraction of face maggie looking on attentively felt that there be painful mystery about aunt bonnet be considered too young to understand indignantly conscious while that must have understood that a well a everything else if have be taken into confidence when went down uncle pullet observed with acumen that reckoned missis have be showing bonnetthat be what have made so long upstairs with interval have seemed still longer for have be seated in irksome constraint on edge of sofa directly opposite uncle pullet who

queer only consolation can suggest to be that greek boy probably thought same of aristotle be only when have mastered restive horse thrashed drayman have got gun in hand that shy junior feel to be truly admirable enviable character at least be quite sure of tom tullivers sentiment on point in very tender year when still wore lace border under outdoor cap be often observed peeping through bar of gate making minatory gesture with small forefinger while scolded sheep with inarticulate burr intended to strike terror into astonished mind indicating thus early that desire for mastery over inferior animal wild domestic including cockchafer neighbour dog small sister in age have be attribute of so much promise for fortune of race now mr pullet never rode anything taller than low pony be least predatory of men considering firearm dangerous a apt to go off of by nobody particular desire so tom be not without strong reason when in confidential talk with chum have described uncle pullet a nincompoop taking care at same time to observe that be very rich fellow only alleviating circumstance in tte tte with uncle pullet be that kept variety of lozenge peppermint drop about person when at loss for conversation filled up void by proposing mutual solace of kind do like peppermint young sir required only tacit answer when be accompanied by presentation of article in question appearance of little girl suggested to uncle pullet further solace of small sweet cake of also kept stock under lock key for own private eating on wet day three child have sooner got tempting delicacy between

pretty scripture thing presently let fall cake in unlucky movement crushed beneath foota source of so much agitation to aunt pullet conscious disgrace to maggie that began to despair of hearing musical snuff box to day till after reflection occurred to that lucy be in high favour enough to venture on asking for tune so whispered to lucy lucy who always did what be desired to do went up quietly to uncle knee blushing over neck while fingered necklace said will please play tune uncle lucy thought be by reason of exceptional talent in uncle pullet that snuff box played such beautiful tune indeed thing be viewed in light by majority of neighbour in garum mr pullet have bought box to begin with understood winding up knew tune be going to play beforehand altogether possession of unique piece of music be proof mr pullet character be not of entire nullity might otherwise have be attributed to uncle pullet when entreated to exhibit accomplishment never depreciated by too ready consent well see about be answer always gave carefully abstaining from sign of compliance till suitable number of minute have passed uncle pullet have programme for great social occasion in way fenced

pinned before in fashion of apron door did in fact soon open instead of tea tray sally introduced object so startling that mr pullet mr tulliver gave scream causing uncle pullet to swallow lozengefor fifth time in life a afterward noted chapter x maggie behaves worse than expected startling object thus made epoch for uncle pullet be other than little lucy with one side of person from small foot to bonnet crown wet discoloured with mud holding out two tiny blackened hand making very piteous face to account for unprecedented apparition in aunt pullet parlour must return to moment when three child went to play out of door small demon who have taken possession of maggies soul at early period of day have returned in greater force after temporary absence disagreeable recollection of morning be thick upon when tom whose displeasure toward have be considerably refreshed by foolish trick of causing to upset cowslip wine said here lucy come along with walked off to area where toad be a if there be maggie in existence seeing maggie lingered at distance looking like small medusa with snake cropped lucy be naturally pleased that cousin tom be so good to be very amusing to see tickling fat toad with piece of string when toad be safe down area with iron grating over still lucy wished maggie to enjoy spectacle also especially a must doubtless find name for toad say have be past history for lucy have delighted semi belief in maggies story about live thing came upon by accidenthow mr earwig have wash at home one of child have fallen into hot copper for reason be running so fast to fetch doctor tom have profound contempt for nonsense of maggies smashing earwig at once a superfluous yet easy mean of proving entire unreality of such story lucy for life of must not help fancying there be something in at event thought be very pretty make believe so now desire to know history of very portly toad added to habitual affectionateness made run back to maggie say oh there be big funny toad maggie do come see maggie said nothing turned away from with deeper frown a long a tom seemed to prefer lucy to lucy made part of unkindness maggie must have thought little while ago must never be cross with pretty little lucy more than must be cruel to little white mouse then tom have always be quite indifferent to lucy before have be left to maggie to pet make much of a be be actually beginning to think that must like to make lucy cry by slapping pinching especially a might vex tom whom be of use to slap even if dared because didnt mind if lucy hadnt be there maggie be sure must have got friend with sooner tickling fat toad who be not highly sensitive be amusement that be possible to exhaust tom by by began to look round for other mode of passing time in so prim garden where be not to go off paved walk there be not great choice of sport only great pleasure restriction suggested be pleasure of breaking tom began to meditate insurrectionary visit to pond about field beyond garden say lucy began nodding head up down with great significance a coiled up string again what do think mean to do what tom said lucy with curiosity mean to go to pond look at pike may go with if like said young sultan oh tom dare said lucy aunt said mustnt go out of garden oh will go out at other end of garden said tom nobody ull see besides dont care if doill run off home couldnt run said lucy who have never before be exposed to such severe temptation oh never mind wont be cross with said tom say took tom walked along lucy trotted by side timidly enjoying rare treat of doing something naughtyexcited also by mention of celebrity pike about be quite uncertain whether be fish fowl maggie saw leaving garden must not resist impulse to follow anger jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of object than love that tom lucy must do see anything of be ignorant must have be intolerable idea to maggie so kept few yard behind unobserved by tom who be presently absorbed in watching for pikea highly interesting monster be said to be so very old so very large to have remarkable appetite pike like other celebrity did not show when be watched for tom caught sight of something in rapid movement in water attracted to spot on brink of pond here lucy said in loud whisper come here take care keep on grassdont step where cow have be added pointing to peninsula of dry grass with trodden mud on side of for tom contemptuous conception of girl included attribute of being unfit to walk in dirty place lucy came carefully a be bidden bent down to look at what seemed golden arrow head darting through water be water snake tom told lucy at last must see serpentine wave of body very much wondering that snake must swim maggie have drawn nearer nearer must see too though be bitter to like everything else since tom did not care about seeing at last be close by lucy tom who have be aware of approach must not notice till be obliged turned round said now get away maggie there room for on grass here nobody asked to come there be passion at war in maggie at moment to have made tragedy if tragedy be made by passion only essential be present in passion be wanting to action utmost maggie must do with fierce thrust of small brown arm be to push poor little pink white lucy into cow trodden mud then tom must not restrain gave maggie two smart slap on arm a ran to pick up lucy who lay cry helplessly maggie retreated to root of tree few yard off looked on impenitently usually repentance came quickly after one rash deed now tom lucy have made so miserable be glad to spoil happinessglad to make everybody uncomfortable why must be sorry tom be very slow to forgive however sorry might have be will tell mother know miss mag said tom loudly emphatically a soon a lucy be up ready to walk away be not tom practice to tell here justice clearly demanded that maggie must be visited with utmost punishment not that tom have learned to put view in abstract form never mentioned justice have idea that desire to punish might be called by fine name lucy be too entirely absorbed by evil have befallen herthe spoiling of pretty best clothes discomfort of being wet dirtyto think much of cause be entirely mysterious to must never have guessed what have done to make maggie angry with felt that maggie be very unkind disagreeable made magnanimous entreaty to tom that must not tell only running along by side cry piteously while maggie sat on root of tree looked after with small medusa face sally said tom when reached kitchen door sally looked at in speechless amaze with piece of bread butter in mouth toasting fork in handsally tell mother be maggie pushed lucy into mud lors have massy how did get near such mud a said sally making wry face a stooped down examined corpus delicti tom imagination have not be rapid capacious enough to include question among foreseen consequence be sooner put than foresaw whither tended that maggie must not be considered only culprit in case walked quietly away from kitchen door leaving sally to pleasure of guessing active mind notoriously prefer to ready made knowledge sally a be aware lost time in presenting lucy at parlour door for to have so dirty object introduced into house at garum fir be too great weight to be sustained by single mind goodness gracious aunt pullet exclaimed after preluding by inarticulate scream keep at door sally dont bring off oil cloth do why shes tumbled into nasty mud said mr tulliver going up to lucy to examine into amount of damage to clothes for felt responsible to sister deane if please um be miss maggie a pushed in said sally master tom be said so must have be to pond for only there must have got into such dirt there be bessy what ive be telling said mr pullet in tone of prophetic sadness childrentheres knowing what theyll come to mr tulliver be mute feeling truly wretched mother a usual thought pressed upon that people must think have done something wicked to deserve maternal trouble while mr pullet began to give elaborate direction to sally how to guard premise from serious injury in course of removing dirt meantime tea be to be brought in by cook two naughty child be to have theirs in ignominious manner in kitchen mr went out to speak to naughty child supposing to be close at hand be not until after search that found tom leaning with rather hardened careless air against white paling of poultry yard lowering piece of string on other side a mean of exasperating turkey cock tom naughty boy wheres sister said mr tulliver in distressed voice dont know said tom eagerness for justice on maggie have diminished since have seen clearly that must hardly be brought about without injustice of blame on own conduct why where did leave said mother looking round sitting under tree against pond said tom apparently indifferent to everything string turkey cock then go fetch in minute naughty boy how must think o going to pond taking sister where there be dirt know shell do mischief if there mischief to be done be mr tullivers way if blamed tom to refer misdemeanour somehow other to maggie idea of maggie sitting alone by pond roused habitual fear in mr tullivers mind mounted horse block to satisfy by sight of fatal child while tom walkednot very quicklyon way toward theyre such child for water mine be said aloud without reflecting that there be one to hear theyll be brought in dead drownded day wish that river be far enough when not only failed to discern maggie presently saw tom returning from pool alone hovering fear entered took complete possession of hurried to meet maggies nowhere about pond mother said tom shes gone away may conceive terrified search for maggie difficulty of convincing mother that be not in pond mr pullet observed that child might come to worse end if lived there be knowing mr pullet confused overwhelmed by revolutionary aspect of thingsthe tea deferred poultry alarmed by unusual running to frotook up spud a instrument of search reached down key to unlock goose pen a likely place for maggie to lie concealed in tom after while started idea that maggie be gone home without thinking necessary to state that be what must have done under circumstance suggestion be seized a comfort by mother sister for goodness sake let em put horse in carriage take home will perhaps find on road lucy cant walk in dirty clothes said looking at innocent victim who be wrapped up in shawl sitting with naked foot on sofa aunt pullet be quite willing to take shortest mean of restoring premise to order quiet be not long before mr tulliver be in chaise looking anxiously at most distant point before what father must say if maggie be lost be question predominated over other chapter xi maggie try to run away from shadow maggies intention a usual be on larger scale than tom imagined resolution gathered in mind after tom lucy have walked away be not so simple a of going home must run away go to gypsy tom must never see more be by mean new idea to maggie have be so often told be like gypsy half wild that when be miserable seemed to only way of escaping opprobrium being entirely in harmony with circumstance must be to live in little brown tent on common gypsy considered must gladly receive pay much respect on account of superior knowledge have once mentioned view on point to tom suggested that must stain face brown must run away together tom rejected scheme with contempt observing that gypsy be thief hardly got anything to eat have nothing to drive donkey to day however maggie thought misery have reached pitch at gypsydom be refuge rose from seat on root of tree with sense that be great crisis in life must run straight away till came to dunlow common where there must certainly be gypsy cruel tom rest of relation who found fault with must never see more thought of father a ran along reconciled to idea of parting with by determining that must secretly send letter by small gypsy who must run away without telling where be just let know that be well happy always loved very much maggie soon got out of breath with running by time tom got to pond again be at distance of three long field be on edge of lane leading to highroad stopped to pant little reflecting that running away be not pleasant thing until one have got quite to common where gypsy be resolution have not abated presently passed through gate into lane not knowing where must lead for be not way that came from dorlcote mill to garum fir felt safer for because there be chance of being overtaken be soon aware not without trembling that there be two men coming along lane in front of have not thought of meeting stranger have be too much occupied with idea of friend coming after formidable stranger be two shabby looking men with flushed face one of carrying bundle on stick over shoulder to surprise while be dreading disapprobation a runaway man with bundle stopped in half whining half coaxing tone asked if have copper to give poor man maggie have sixpence in pockether uncle gleggs presentwhich immediately drew out gave poor man with polite smile hoping must feel very kindly toward a generous person thats only money ive got said apologetically thank little miss said man in le respectful grateful tone than maggie anticipated even observed that smiled winked at companion walked on hurriedly be aware that two men be standing still probably to look after presently heard laughing loudly suddenly occurred to that might think be idiot tom have said that cropped hair made look like idiot be too painful idea to be readily forgotten besides have sleeve ononly cape bonnet be clear that be not likely to make favourable impression on passenger thought must turn into field again not on same side of lane a before lest must still be uncle pullet field turned through first gate be not locked felt delightful sense of privacy in creeping along by hedgerow after recent humiliating encounter be used to wandering about field by herself be le timid there than on highroad sometimes have to climb over high gate be small evil be getting out of reach very fast must probably soon come within sight of dunlow common at least of other common for have heard father say that couldnt go very far without coming to common hoped so for be getting rather tired hungry until reached gypsy there be definite prospect of bread butter be still broad daylight for aunt pullet retaining early habit of dodson family took tea at past four by sun at five by kitchen clock so though be nearly hour since maggie started there be gathering gloom on field to remind that night must come still seemed to that have be walking very great distance indeed be really surprising that common did not come within sight hitherto have be in rich parish of garum where be great deal of pasture land have only seen one labourer at distance be fortunate in respect a labourer might be too ignorant to understand propriety of wanting to go to dunlow common must have be better if must have met one who must tell way without wanting to know anything about private business at last however green field came to end maggie found looking through bar of gate into lane with wide margin of grass on side of have never seen wide lane before without knowing why gave impression that common must not be far off perhaps be because saw donkey with log to foot feeding on grassy margin for have seen donkey with pitiable encumbrance on dunlow common when have be across in father gig crept through bar of gate walked on with new spirit though not without haunting image of apollyon highwayman with pistol blinking dwarf in yellow with mouth from ear to ear other miscellaneous danger for poor little maggie have at once timidity of active imagination daring come from overmastering impulse have rushed into adventure of seeking unknown kindred gypsy now be in strange lane hardly dared look on one side of lest must see diabolical blacksmith in leathern apron grinning at with arm akimbo be not without leaping of heart that caught sight of small pair of bare leg sticking up foot uppermost by side of hillock seemed something hideously preternaturala diabolical kind of fungus for be too much agitated at first glance to see ragged clothes dark shaggy head attached to be boy asleep maggie trotted along faster more lightly lest must wake did not occur to that be one of friend gypsy who in probability must have very genial manner fact be so for at next bend in lane maggie actually saw little semicircular black tent with blue smoke rising before be to be refuge from blighting obloquy have pursued in civilised life even saw tall female figure by column of smoke doubtless gypsy mother who provided tea other grocery be astonishing to herself that did not feel more delighted be startling to find gypsy in lane after not on common indeed be rather disappointing for mysterious illimitable common where there be sand pit to hide in one be out of everybodys reach have always made part of maggies picture of gypsy life went on however thought with comfort that gypsy most likely knew nothing about idiot so there be danger of falling into mistake of setting down at first glance a idiot be plain have attracted attention for tall figure who proved to be young woman with baby on arm walked slowly to meet maggie looked up in new face rather tremblingly a approached be reassured by thought that aunt pullet rest be right when called gypsy for face with bright dark eye long hair be really something like what used to see in glass before cut hair off little lady where be going to gypsy said in tone of coaxing deference be delightful just what maggie expected gypsy saw at once that be little lady be prepared to treat accordingly not farther said maggie feeling a if be saying what have rehearsed in dream im come to stay with please thats pretty come then why what nice little lady be to be sure said gypsy taking by hand maggie thought very agreeable wished have not be so dirty there be quite group round fire when reached old gypsy woman be seated on ground nursing knee occasionally poking skewer into round kettle that sent forth odorous steam two small shock headed child be lying prone resting on elbow something like small sphinx placid donkey be bending head over tall girl who lying on back be scratching nose indulging with bite of excellent stolen slanting sunlight fell kindly upon scene be really very pretty comfortable maggie thought only hoped must soon set out tea cup everything must be quite charming when have taught gypsy to use washing basin to feel interest in book be little confusing though that young woman began to speak to old one in language maggie did not understand while tall girl who be feeding donkey sat up stared at without offering salutation at last old woman said what pretty lady be come to stay with sit ye down tell where come from be just like story maggie liked to be called pretty lady treated in way sat down said im come from home because im unhappy mean to be gypsy ill live with if like can teach great many thing such clever little lady said woman with baby sitting down by maggie allowing baby to crawl pretty bonnet frock added taking off maggies bonnet looking at while made observation to old woman in unknown language tall girl snatched bonnet put on own head hind foremost with grin maggie be determined not to show weakness on subject a if be susceptible about bonnet dont want to wear bonnet said id rather wear red handkerchief like yours looking at friend by side hair be quite long till yesterday when cut off dare say will grow again very soon added apologetically thinking probable gypsy have strong prejudice in favour of long hair maggie have forgotten even hunger at moment in desire to conciliate gypsy opinion oh what nice little ladyand rich im sure said old woman didnt live in beautiful house at home yes home be pretty im very fond of river where go fishing im often very unhappy must have liked to bring book with came away in hurry know can tell almost everything there be in book ive read so many time will amuse can tell something about geography toothats about world live invery useful interesting did ever hear about columbus maggies eye have begun to sparkle cheek to flushshe be really beginning to instruct gypsy gaining great influence over gypsy be not without amazement at talk though attention be divided by content of maggies pocket friend at right hand have by time emptied without attracting notice be that where live little lady said old woman at mention of columbus oh said maggie with pity columbus be very wonderful man who found out world put chain on treated very badly know in catechism of geography perhaps rather too long to tell before teai want tea so last word burst from maggie in spite of herself with sudden drop from patronizing instruction to simple peevishness why shes hungry poor little lady said younger woman give o cold victual youve be walking good way ill be bound dear wheres home dorlcote mill good way off said maggie father be mr tulliver mustnt let know where be else hell fetch home again where doe queen of gypsy live what do want to go to little lady said younger woman tall girl meanwhile be constantly staring at maggie grinning manner be certainly not agreeable said maggie im only thinking that if isnt very good queen might be glad when died must choose if be queen id be very good queen kind to everybody here bit o nice victual then said old woman handing to maggie lump of dry bread have taken from bag of scrap piece of cold bacon thank said maggie looking at food without taking will give bread butter tea instead dont like bacon weve got tea butter said old woman with something like scowl a if be getting tired of coaxing oh little bread treacle must do said maggie hant got treacle said old woman crossly whereupon there followed sharp dialogue between two woman in unknown tongue one of small sphinx snatched at bread bacon began to eat at moment tall girl who have gone few yard off came back said something produced strong effect old woman seeming to forget maggies hunger poked skewer into pot with new vigor younger crept under tent reached out platter spoon maggie trembled little be afraid tear must come into eye meanwhile tall girl gave shrill cry presently came running up boy whom maggie have passed a be sleepinga rough urchin about age of tom stared at maggie there ensued much incomprehensible chattering felt very lonely be quite sure must begin to cry before long gypsy didnt seem to mind at felt quite weak among springing tear be checked by new terror when two men came up whose approach have be cause of sudden excitement elder of two carried bag flung down addressing woman in loud scolding tone answered by shower of treble sauciness while black cur ran barking up to maggie threw into tremor that only found new cause in curse with younger man called dog off gave rap with great stick held in hand maggie felt that be impossible must ever be queen of people ever communicate to amusing useful knowledge men now seemed to be inquiring about maggie for looked at tone of conversation became of pacific kind implies curiosity on one side power of satisfying on other at last younger woman said in previous deferential coaxing tone nice little lady come to live with arent glad ay very glad said younger man who be looking at maggies silver thimble other small matter have be taken from pocket returned except thimble to younger woman with observation immediately restored to maggies pocket while men seated began to attack content of kettlea stew of meat potatoeswhich have be taken off fire turned out into yellow platter maggie began to think that tom must be right about gypsy must certainly be thief unless man meant to return thimble by by must willingly have given to for be not at attached to thimble idea that be among thief prevented from feeling comfort in revival of deference attention toward thief except robin hood be wicked people woman saw be frightened weve got nothing nice for lady to eat said old woman in coaxing tone shes so hungry sweet little lady here dear try if can eat bit o said younger woman handing of stew on brown dish with iron spoon to maggie who remembering that old woman have seemed angry with for not liking bread bacon dared not refuse stew though fear have chased away appetite if father must come by in gig take up even if jack giantkiller mr greatheart st george who slew dragon on half penny must happen to pas way maggie thought with sinking heart that hero be never seen in neighbourhood of st oggs nothing very wonderful ever came there maggie tulliver perceive be by mean well trained well informed young person that small female of eight nine necessarily be in day have only be to school year at st oggs have so few book that sometimes read dictionary so that in travelling over small mind must have found most unexpected ignorance a well a unexpected knowledge must have informed that there be such word a polygamy being also acquainted with polysyllable have deduced conclusion poly mean many have have idea that gypsy be not well supplied with grocery thought generally be oddest mixture of clear eyed acumen blind dream idea about gypsy have undergone rapid modification in last five minute from having considered very respectful companion amenable to instruction have begun to think that meant perhaps to kill a soon a be dark cut up body for gradual cooking suspicion crossed that fierce eyed old man be in fact devil who might drop that transparent disguise at moment turn into grinning blacksmith else fiery eyed monster with dragon wing be use trying to eat stew yet thing most dreaded be to offend gypsy by betraying extremely unfavourable opinion of wondered with keenness of interest that theologian must have exceeded whether if devil be really present must know thought what dont like smell of dear said young woman observing that maggie did not even take spoonful of stew try bit come thank said maggie summoning force for desperate effort trying to smile in friendly way havent time think seems getting darker think must go home now come again day then can bring basket with jam tart thing maggie rose from seat a threw out illusory prospect devoutly hoping that apollyon be gullible hope sank when old gypsy woman said stop bit stop bit little lady well take home safe when weve done supper will ride home like lady maggie sat down again with little faith in promise though presently saw tall girl putting bridle on donkey throwing couple of bag on back now then little missis said younger man rising leading donkey forward tell where live whats name o place dorlcote mill be home said maggie eagerly father be mr tulliver life there what big mill little way side o st oggs yes said maggie be far off think must like to walk there if please itll be getting dark must make haste donkeyll carry a nice a can be youll see lifted maggie a spoke set on donkey felt relieved that be not old man who seemed to be going with have only trembling hope that be really going home here pretty bonnet said younger woman putting recently despised now welcome article of costume on maggies head youll say weve be very good to wont what nice little lady said be oh yes thank said maggie im very much obliged to wish youd go with too thought anything be better than going with one of dreadful men alone must be more cheerful to be murdered by larger party ah youre fondest o arent said woman cant go youll go too fast for now appeared that man also be to be seated on donkey holding maggie before be a incapable of remonstrating against arrangement a donkey though nightmare have ever seemed to more horrible when woman have patted on back said good by donkey at strong hint from man stick set off at rapid walk along lane toward point maggie have come from hour ago while tall girl rough urchin also furnished with stick obligingly escorted for first hundred yard with much screaming thwacking not leonore in preternatural midnight excursion with phantom lover be more terrified than poor maggie in entirely natural ride on short paced donkey with gypsy behind who considered that be earning crown red light of setting sun seemed to have portentous meaning with alarming bray of second donkey with log on foot must surely have connection two low thatched cottagesthe only house passed in laneseemed to add to dreariness have window to speak of door be closed be probable that be inhabitated by witch be relief to find that donkey did not stop there at lastoh sight of joythis lane longest in world be coming to end be opening on broad highroad where there be actually coach passing there be finger post at cornershe have surely seen that finger post beforeto st oggs mile gypsy really meant to take home then be probably good man after might have be rather hurt at thought that didnt like coming with alone idea became stronger a felt more more certain that knew road quite well be considering how might open conversation with injured gypsy not only gratify feeling efface impression of cowardice when a reached cross road maggie caught sight of one coming on white faced horse oh stop stop cried out there father oh father father sudden joy be almost painful before father reached be sobbing great be mr tullivers wonder for have made round from basset have not yet be home why whats meaning o said checking horse while maggie slipped from donkey ran to father stirrup little miss lost reckon said gypsy shed come to tent at far end o dunlow lane be bringing where said home be good way to come after being on tramp day oh yes father he be very good to bring home said maggiea very kind good man here then man said mr tulliver taking out five shilling best day work ever did couldnt afford to lose little wench here lift up before why maggie hows hows said a rode along while laid head against father sobbed how came to be rambling about lose oh father sobbed maggie ran away because be so unhappy tom be so angry with couldnt bear pooh pooh said mr tulliver soothingly mustnt think o running away from father what ud father do without little wench oh never will again fathernever mr tulliver spoke mind very strongly when reached home that evening effect be seen in remarkable fact that maggie never heard one reproach from mother one taunt from tom about foolish business of running

in case quarrel with mr glegg have be set octave higher than usual mr glegg carried something else up stair with together with saint rest gruel may have have influence in gradually calming feeling making possible for to endure existence on ground floor shortly before tea time be partly mr gleggs suggestion that must do well to let five hundred lie still until good investment turned up further parenthetic hint at handsome provision for in case of death mr glegg like men of stamp be extremely reticent about will mr glegg in gloomier moment have foreboding that like other husband of whom have heard might cherish mean project of heightening grief at death by leaving poorly off in case be firmly resolved that must have scarcely weeper on bonnet must cry no more than if have be second husband if have really shown testamentary tenderness must be affecting to think of poor man when be gone even foolish fuss about flower garden stuff insistence on subject of snail must be touching when be

frequently secrete in various corner baffling to most ingenious of thief for to mr gleggs mind bank strong box must have nullified pleasure of property might a well have taken food in capsule finally to be looked up to by own family neighbourhood so a woman can ever hope to be who have not prterite present dignity comprised in being widow well leftall made flattering conciliatory view of future so that when good mr glegg restored to good humour by much hoeing moved by sight of wife empty chair with knitting rolled up in corner went up stair to observed that bell have be tolling for poor mr morton mr glegg answered magnanimously quite a if have be uninjured woman ah then therell be good business for somebody to take to baxter have be open at least eight hour by time for be nearly five oclock if people be to quarrel often follows a corollary quarrel can not be protracted beyond certain limit mr mr glegg talked quite amicably about tullivers that evening mr glegg went length of admitting that tulliver be sad man for getting into hot water be like enough to run through property mr glegg meeting acknowledgment half way declared that be beneath to take notice of such man conduct that for sister sake must let keep five hundred while longer for when put out on mortgage must only get four per cent chapter xiii mr tulliver further entangles skein of life owing to new adjustment of mr gleggs thought mr pullet found task of mediation next day surprisingly easy mr glegg indeed checked rather sharply for thinking must be necessary to tell elder sister be right mode of behaviour in family matter mr pullet argument that must look ill in neighbourhood if people must have in power to say that there be quarrel in family be particularly offensive if family name never suffered except through mr glegg mr pullet might lay head on pillow in perfect confidence not to be expected suppose observed mr glegg by way of winding up subject a will go to mill again before bessy come to see a will go fall down o knee to mr tulliver ask pardon for showing favour will bear malice when mr tulliver speaks civil to ill speak civil to nobody have call to tell whats becoming finding unnecessary to plead for tullivers be natural that aunt pullet must relax little in anxiety for recur to annoyance have suffered yesterday from offspring of apparently ill fated house mr glegg heard circumstantial narrative to mr pullet remarkable memory furnished item while aunt pullet pitied poor bessys bad luck with child expressed half formed project of paying for maggies being sent to distant boarding school must not prevent being so brown might tend to subdue other vice in aunt glegg blamed bessy for weakness appealed to witness who must be living when tulliver child have turned out ill that mr glegg have always said how must be from very first observing that be wonderful to herself how word came true then may call tell bessy youll bear malice everything be a be before mr pullet said just before parting yes may sophy said mr glegg may tell mr tulliver bessy too a im not going to behave ill because folk behave ill to know place a eldest to set example in respect do nobody can say different of if theyll keep to truth mr glegg being in state of satisfaction in own lofty magnanimity leave to judge what effect be produced on by reception of short letter from mr tulliver very evening after mr pullet departure informing that neednt trouble mind about five hundred pound for must be paid back to in course of next month at farthest together with interest due thereon until time of payment furthermore that mr tulliver have wish to behave uncivilly to mr glegg be welcome to house whenever liked to come desired favour from either for child be poor mr tulliver who have hastened catastrophe entirely through irrepressible hopefulness of hers led to expect that similar cause may at time produce different result have very often occurred in experience that mr tulliver have done something because other people have said be not able to do have pitied for supposed inability in other way piqued pride still thought to day if told when came in to tea that sister pullet be gone to try make everything up with sister glegg so that neednt think about paying in money must give cheerful effect to meal mr tulliver have never slackened in resolve to raise money now at once determined to write letter to mr glegg must cut off possibility of mistake mr pullet gone to beg pray for indeed mr tulliver did not willingly write letter found relation between spoken written language briefly known a spelling one of most puzzling thing in puzzling world nevertheless like fervid writing task be done in le time than usual if spelling differed from mr gleggswhy belonged like to generation with whom spelling be matter of private judgment mr glegg did not alter will in consequence of letter cut off tulliver child from sixth seventh share in thousand pound for have principle one must be able to say of when be dead that have not divided money with perfect fairness among own kin in matter of will personal quality be subordinate to great fundamental fact of blood to be determined in distribution of property by caprice not make legacy bear direct ratio to degree of kinship be prospective disgrace must have embittered life have always be principle in dodson family be one form of sense of honour rectitude be proud tradition in such familiesa tradition have be salt of provincial society though letter must not shake mr gleggs principle made family breach much more difficult to mend a to effect produced on mr gleggs opinion of mr tulliver begged to be understood from time forth that have nothing whatever to say about state of mind apparently be too corrupt for to contemplate for moment be not until evening before tom went to school at beginning of august mr glegg paid visit to sister tulliver sitting in gig while showing displeasure by markedly abstaining from advice criticism for a observed to sister deane bessy must bear consequence o having such husband though im sorry for mr deane agreed that bessy be pitiable that evening tom observed to maggie oh maggie aunt gleggs beginning to come again im glad im going to school youll catch now maggie be already so full of sorrow at thought of tom going away from that playful exultation of seemed very unkind cried to sleep night mr tullivers prompt procedure entailed on further promptitude in finding convenient person who be desirous of lending five hundred pound on bond

severe with tom about lesson be clearly boy whose power must never be developed through medium of latin grammar without application of sternness not that mr stelling be harsh tempered unkind man contrary be jocose with tom at table corrected provincialism deportment in most playful manner poor tom be only more cowed confused by double novelty for have never be used to joke at like mr stellings for first time in life have painful sense that be wrong somehow when mr stelling said a roast beef be being uncovered now tulliver must rather decline roast beef latin for tom to whom in coolest moment pun must have be hard nut be thrown into state of embarrassed alarm made everything dim to except feeling that must rather not have anything to do with latin of course answered roast

who will make way in worldthat mr tulliver be delighted to find in clergyman whose knowledge be so applicable to everyday affair of life except counsellor wylde whom have heard at last session mr tulliver thought rev mr stelling be shrewdest fellow have ever met withnot unlike wylde in fact have same way of sticking thumb in armhole of waistcoat mr tulliver be not by mean exception in mistaking brazenness for shrewdness most layman thought stelling shrewd man of remarkable power generally be chiefly by clerical brother that be considered rather dull fellow told tulliver several story about swing incendiarism asked advice about feeding pig in so thoroughly secular judicious manner with so much polished glibness of tongue that miller thought here be very thing wanted for tom have doubt first rate man be acquainted with branch of information knew exactly what tom must learn in order to become match for lawyer poor mr tulliver did not know so be necessarily thrown for self direction on wide kind of inference be hardly fair to laugh at for have known much more highly instructed person than make inference quite a wide not at wiser a for mr tulliver finding that mr

rest by assurance that understood what be wanted for how be possible good man must form reasonable judgment about matter mr stellings duty be to teach lad in only right wayindeed knew other have not wasted time in acquirement of anything abnormal very soon set down poor tom a thoroughly stupid lad for though by hard labour must get particular declension into brain anything so abstract a relation

anything o sort before be married said mr tulliver with half implied reproach always spoke of husband a brother to mr moss in case when line of conduct be not matter of pure admiration amiable mr tulliver who be never angry in life have yet mild share of spirit without must hardly have be at once dodson woman being always on defensive toward own sister be natural that must be keenly conscious of superiority even a weakest dodson over husband sister who besides being poorly off inclined to hang on brother have good natured submissiveness of large easy tempered untidy prolific woman with affection enough in not only for own husband abundant child for number of collateral relation hope pray wont go to law said mr moss for there never knowing where thatll end right doesnt allays win mr pivarts rich man by what can make out rich mostly get thing own way a to said mr tulliver stroking dress down ive seen what rich be in own family for sister have got husband a can afford to do pretty much what like think sometimes will be drove off head with talk about law erigation sister lay fault to for dont know what be to marry man like brother how must sister pullet have own way from morning till night well said mr moss dont think must like husband if hadnt got wit of own have to find head piece for deal easier to do what plea one husband than to be puzzling what else one must do if people come to talk o doing what plea husband said mr tulliver with faint imitation of sister glegg im sure brother might have waited long while before hed have found wife ud have let have say in everything a do nothing law erigation now from when first get up in morning till go to bed at night never contradict only say well mr tulliver do a like whativer do dont go to law mr tulliver a have seen be not without influence over husband woman be can always incline to do what wish reverse on composite impulse be threatening to hurry mr tulliver into law mr tullivers monotonous pleading have doubtless share of force might even be comparable to proverbial feather have credit discredit of breaking camel back though on strictly impartial view blame ought rather to lie with previous weight of feather have already placed back in such imminent peril that otherwise innocent feather must not settle on without mischief not that mr tullivers feeble beseeching must have have feather weight in virtue of single personality whenever departed from entire assent to husband saw in representative of dodson family be guiding principle with mr tulliver to let dodsons know that be not to domineer over ormore specificallythat male tulliver be far more than equal to four female dodsons even though one of be mr glegg not even direct argument from typical dodson female against going to law must have heightened disposition toward so much a mere thought of wakem continually freshened by sight of too able attorney on market day wakem to certain knowledge be metaphorically speaking at bottom of pivarts irrigation wakem have tried to make dix stand out go to law about dam be unquestionably wakem who have caused mr tulliver to lose suit about right of road bridge made thoroughfare of land for vagabond who preferred opportunity of damaging private property to walking like honest man along highroad lawyer be more le rascal wakems rascality be of peculiarly aggravated kind placed in opposition to form of right embodied in mr tullivers interest opinion a extra touch of bitterness injured miller have recently in borrowing five hundred pound be obliged to carry little business to wakems office on own account hook nosed glib fellow a cool a cucumberalways looking so sure of game be vexatious that lawyer gore be not more like be bald round featured man with bland manner fat hand game cock that must be rash to bet upon against wakem gore be sly fellow weakness did not lie on side of scrupulosity largest amount of winking however significant be not equivalent to seeing through stone wall confident a mr tulliver be in principle that water be water in direct inference that pivart have not leg to stand on in affair of irrigation have uncomfortable suspicion that wakem have more law to show against rationally irrefragable inference than gore must show for then if went to law there be chance for mr tulliver to employ counsellor wylde on side instead of having that admirable bully against prospect of seeing witness of wakems made to perspire become confounded a mr tullivers have once be be alluring to love of retributive justice much rumination have mr tulliver on puzzling subject during ride on gray horse much turning of head from side to side a scale dipped alternately probable result be still out of sight only to be reached through much hot argument iteration in domestic social life that initial stage of dispute consisted in narration of case enforcement of mr tullivers view concerning throughout entire circle of connection must necessarily take time at beginning of february when tom be going to school again there be scarcely new item to be detected in father statement of case against pivart more specific indication of measure be bent on taking against rash contravener of principle that water be water iteration like friction be likely to generate heat instead of progress mr tullivers heat be certainly more more palpable if there have be no new evidence on other point there have be new evidence that pivart be a thick a mud with wakem father said tom one evening near end of holiday uncle glegg say lawyer wakem be going to send son to mr stelling isnt true what said about going to be sent to france wont like to go to school with wakems son will matter for boy said mr tulliver dont learn anything bad of thats lad poor deformed creatur take after mother in face think there isnt much of father in sign wakem think high o mr sterling a sends son to wakem know meal from bran mr tulliver in heart be rather proud of fact that son be to have same advantage a wakems tom be not at easy on point must have be much clearer if lawyer son have not be deformed for then tom must have have prospect of pitching into with freedom be derived from high moral sanction chapter iii new schoolfellow be cold wet january day on tom went back to school day quite in keeping with severe phase of destiny if have not carried in pocket parcel

greater keenness to pleasure of imagination took out parcel made small hole in paper bit off crystal two have so solacing effect under confined prospect damp odor of gig umbrella that repeated process more than once on way well tulliver be glad to see again said mr stelling heartily take off wrapping come into study till dinner youll find bright fire there new companion tom felt in uncomfortable flutter a took off woollen comforter other wrapping have seen philip wakem at st oggs have always turned eye away from a quickly a possible must have disliked having deformed boy for companion even if philip have not be son of bad man tom did not see how bad man son must be very good own father be good man must readily have fought one who said contrary be in state of mingled embarrassment defiance a followed mr stelling to study here be new companion for to shake hand with tulliver said that gentleman on entering studymaster philip wakem will leave to make acquaintance by yourselves already know something of other imagine for be neighbour at home tom looked confused awkward while philip rose glanced at timidly tom did not like to go up put out hand be not prepared to say how do do on so short notice mr stelling wisely turned away closed door behind boy shyness only wear off in absence of elder philip be at once too proud too timid to walk toward tom thought rather felt that tom have aversion to looking at one almost disliked looking at deformity be more conspicuous when walked so remained without shaking hand even speaking while tom went to fire warmed now then casting furtive glance at philip who seemed to be drawing absently first one object then on piece of paper have before have seated again a drew be thinking what must say to tom trying to overcome own repugnance to making first advance tom began to look oftener longer at philip face for must see without noticing hump be really not disagreeable facevery old looking tom thought wondered how much older philip be than anatomisteven mere physiognomistwould have seen that deformity of philip spine be not congenital hump result of accident in infancy expect from tom acquaintance with such distinction to philip be simply humpback have vague notion that deformity of wakems son have relation to lawyer rascality of have so often heard father talk with hot emphasis felt too half admitted fear of a probably spiteful fellow who not being able to fight have cunning way of doing mischief by sly there be humpbacked tailor in neighbourhood of mr jacobs academy who be considered very unamiable character be much hooted after by public spirited boy solely on ground of unsatisfactory moral quality so tom be not without basis of fact to go upon still face must be more unlike ugly tailor than melancholy boy facethe brown hair round waved curled at end like girl tom thought that truly pitiable wakem be pale puny fellow be quite clear must not be able to play at anything worth speaking of handled pencil in enviable manner be apparently making one thing after without trouble what be drawing tom be quite warm now wanted something new to be going forward be certainly more agreeable to have ill natured humpback a companion than to stand looking out of study window at rain kicking foot against washboard in solitude something must happen daya quarrel something tom thought must rather like to show philip that have better not try spiteful trick on suddenly walked across hearth looked over philip paper why thats donkey with pannier spaniel partridge in corn exclaimed tongue being completely loosed by surprise admiration oh button wish must draw like im to learn drawing half wonder if will learn to make dog donkey oh can do without learning said philip never learned drawing never learned said tom in amazement why when make dog horse thing head leg wont come right though can see how ought to be very well can make house sort of chimneyschimneys going down walland window in roof dare say must do dog horse if be to try more added reflecting that philip might falsely suppose that be going to knock under if be too frank about imperfection of accomplishment oh yes said philip very easy youve only to look well at thing draw over over again what do wrong once can alter next time havent be taught anything said tom beginning to have puzzled suspicion that philip crooked back might be source of remarkable faculty thought youd be to school long while yes said philip smiling ive be taught latin greek mathematics writing such thing oh say dont like latin though do said tom lowering voice confidentially pretty well dont care much about said philip ah perhaps havent got into propria qu maribus said tom nodding head sideways a much a to say be test be easy talking till came to philip felt bitter complacency in promising stupidity of well made active looking boy made polite by own extreme sensitiveness a well a by desire to conciliate checked inclination to laugh said quietly ive done with grammar dont learn that more then wont have same lesson a will said tom with sense of disappointment dare say can help will be very glad to help if can tom did not say thank for be quite absorbed in thought wakems son did not seem so spiteful fellow a might have be expected say said presently do love father yes said philip colouring deeply dont love yours oh only wanted to know said tom rather ashamed of now saw philip colouring looking uncomfortable found much difficulty in adjusting attitude of mind toward son of lawyer wakem have occurred to that if philip disliked father that fact might go way toward clearing up perplexity will learn drawing now said by way of changing subject said philip father wish to give time to other thing now what latin euclid thing said tom yes said philip who have left off using pencil be resting head on one hand while tom be learning forward on elbow looking with increasing admiration at dog donkey dont mind said tom with strong curiosity like to know what everybody else know can study what like by by cant think why anybody must learn latin said tom good part of education of gentleman said philip gentleman learn same thing what do think sir john crake master of harrier know latin said tom who have often thought must like to resemble sir john crake learned when be boy of course said philip dare say he forgotten oh well

superiority why be greek great fighter said tom who saw vista in direction be there anything like david goliath samson in greek history be only bit like in history of jew oh there be very fine story of sort about greeksabout hero of early time who killed wild beast a samson did in odysseythats beautiful poemtheres more wonderful giant than goliathpolypheme who have only one eye in middle of forehead ulysses little fellow very wise cunning got red hot pine tree stuck into one eye made roar like thousand bull oh what fun said tom jumping away from table stamping first with one leg then other say can tell about story because shant learn greek know will added pausing in stamping with sudden alarm lest contrary might be possible doe gentleman learn greek will mr stelling make begin with do think must think not very likely not said philip may read story without knowing greek ive got in english oh dont like reading id sooner have tell only fighting one know sister maggie be always wanting to tell story theyre stupid thing girl story always be can tell good many fighting story oh yes said philip lot of besides greek story can tell about richard cur de lion saladin about william wallace robert bruce james douglasi know end youre older than be arent said tom why how old be im fifteen im only going in fourteen said tom thrashed fellow at jacobsthats where be before came here beat em at bandy climbing wish mr stelling must let go fishing must show how to fish must fish couldnt only standing sitting still know tom in turn wished to make balance dip in favour hunchback must not suppose that acquaintance with fighting story put on par with actual fighting hero like tom tulliver philip winced under allusion to unfitness for active sport answered almost peevishly cant bear fishing think people look like fool sitting watching line hour after hour else throwing throwing catching nothing ah wouldnt say looked like fool when landed big pike can tell said tom who have never caught anything be big in life whose imagination be on stretch with indignant zeal for honour of sport wakems son be plain have disagreeable point must be kept in due check happily for harmony of first interview be now called to dinner philip be not allowed to develop farther unsound view on subject of fishing tom said to be just what must have expected from hunchback chapter iv young idea alteration of feeling in first dialogue between tom philip continued to mark intercourse even after many week of schoolboy intimacy tom never quite lost feeling philip being son of rascal be natural enemy never thoroughly overcame repulsion to philip deformity be boy who adhered tenaciously to impression once received a with mind in mere perception predominates over thought emotion external remained to rigidly what be in first instance then be impossible not to like philip company when be in good humour must help one so well in one latin exercise tom regarded a kind of puzzle must only be found out by lucky chance must tell such wonderful fighting story about hal of wynd for example other hero who be especial favourite with tom because laid about with heavy stroke have small opinion of saladin whose cimeter must cut cushion in two in instant who wanted to cut cushion be stupid story didnt care to hear again when robert bruce on black pony rose in stirrup lifting good battle axe cracked at once helmet skull of too hasty knight at bannockburn then tom felt exaltation of sympathy if have have cocoanut at hand must have cracked at once with poker philip in happier mood indulged tom to top of bent heightening crash bang fury of fight with artillery of epithet simile at command be not always in good humour happy mood slight spurt of peevish susceptibility have escaped in first interview be symptom of perpetually recurring mental ailment half of nervous irritability half of heart bitterness produced by sense of deformity in fit of susceptibility glance seemed to to be charged with offensive pity with ill repressed disgust at very least be indifferent glance philip felt indifference a child of south feel chill air of northern spring poor tom blundering patronage when be out of door together must sometimes make turn upon well meaning lad quite savagely eye usually sad quiet must flash with anything playful lightning wonder tom retained suspicion of humpback philip taught skill in drawing be link between for tom found to disgust that new drawing master gave dog donkey to draw brook rustic bridge ruin with general softness of black lead surface indicating that nature if anything be rather satiny a tom feeling for picturesque in landscape be at present quite latent be not surprising that mr goodrichs production seemed to uninteresting form of art mr tulliver having vague intention that tom must be put to business included drawing out of plan map have complained to mr riley when saw at mudport that tom seemed to be learning nothing of sort whereupon that obliging adviser have suggested that tom must have drawing lesson mr tulliver must not mind paying extra for drawing let tom be made good draughtsman must be able to turn pencil to purpose so be ordered that tom must have drawing lesson whom must mr stelling have selected a master if not mr goodrich who be considered quite at head of profession within circuit of twelve mile round king lorton by mean tom learned to make extremely fine point to pencil to represent landscape with broad generality doubtless from narrow tendency in mind to detail thought extremely dull remember happened in dark age when there be school of design before schoolmaster be invariably men of scrupulous integrity before clergy be men of enlarged mind varied culture in le favoured day be fable that there be other clergyman besides mr stelling who have narrow intellect large want whose income by logical confusion to fortune being female a well a blindfold be peculiarly liable be proportioned not to want to intellect with income have clearly inherent relation problem gentleman have to solve be to readjust proportion between want income since want be not easily starved to death simpler method appeared to be to raise income there be one way of doing of low calling in men be obliged to do good work at low price be forbidden to clergyman be fault if only resource be to turn out very poor work at high price besides how must mr stelling be expected to know education be delicate difficult business more than animal endowed with power of boring hole through rock must be expected to have wide view of excavation mr stellings faculty have be early trained to boring in straight line have faculty to spare among tom contemporary whose father cast son on clerical instruction to find ignorant after many day there be many far le lucky than tom tulliver education be almost entirely matter of luckusually of ill luckin distant day state of mind in take billiard cue dice box in hand be one of sober certainty compared with of old fashioned father like mr tulliver when selected school tutor for son excellent men who have be forced life to spell on impromptu phonetic system having carried on successful business in spite of disadvantage have acquired money enough to give son better start in life than have have must necessarily take chance a to conscience competence of schoolmaster whose circular fell in way appeared to promise so much more than must ever have thought of asking for including return of linen fork spoon be happy for if ambitious draper of acquaintance have not brought up son to church if young gentleman at age of four twenty have not closed college dissipation by imprudent marriage otherwise innocent father desirous of doing best for offspring must only escape draper son by happening to be on foundation of grammar school a yet unvisited by commissioner where two three boy must have to advantage of large lofty building together with head master toothless dim eyed deaf whose erudite indistinctness inattention be engrossed by at rate of three hundred pound heada ripe scholar doubtless when first appointed ripeness beneath sun have further stage le esteemed in market tom tulliver then compared with many other british youth of time who have since have to scramble through life with fragment of more le relevant knowledge great deal of strictly relevant ignorance be not so very unlucky mr stelling be broad chested healthy man with bearing of gentleman conviction that growing boy required sufficiency of beef certain hearty kindness in that made like to see tom looking well enjoying dinner not man of refined conscience with deep sense of infinite issue belonging to everyday duty not quite competent to high office incompetent gentleman must live without private fortune be difficult to see how must live genteelly if have nothing to do with education government besides be fault of tom mental constitution that faculty must not be nourished on sort of knowledge mr stelling have to communicate boy born with deficient power of apprehending sign abstraction must suffer penalty of congenital deficiency just a if have be born with one leg shorter than other method of education sanctioned by long practice of venerable ancestor be not to give way before exceptional dulness of boy who be merely living at time then present mr stelling be convinced that boy so stupid at sign abstraction must be stupid at everything else even if reverend gentleman must have taught everything else be practice of venerable ancestor to apply ingenious instrument thumb screw to tighten tighten in order to elicit non existent fact have fixed opinion to begin with fact be existent what have to do to tighten thumb screw in like manner mr stelling have fixed opinion that boy with capacity must learn what be only regular thing to teach if be slow thumb screw must be tightenedthe exercise must be insisted on with increased severity page of virgil be awarded a penalty to encourage stimulate too languid inclination to latin verse thumb screw be little relaxed however during second half year philip be so advanced in study so apt that mr stelling must obtain credit by facility required little help much more easily than by troublesome process of overcoming tom dulness gentleman with broad chest ambitious intention do sometimes disappoint friend by failing to carry world before perhaps be that high achievement demand other unusual qualification besides unusual desire for high prize perhaps be that stalwart gentleman be rather indolent divin particulum aur being obstructed from soaring by too hearty appetite reason other there be why mr stelling deferred execution of many spirited projectswhy did not begin editing of greek play other work of scholarship in leisure hour after turning key of private study with much resolution sat down to one of theodore hook novel tom be gradually allowed to shuffle through lesson with le rigor having philip to help be able to make show of having applied mind in confused blundering way without being cross examined into betrayal that mind have be entirely neutral in matter thought school much more bearable under modification of circumstance went on contentedly enough picking up promiscuous education chiefly from thing be not intended a education at what be understood to be education be simply practice of reading writing spelling carried on by elaborate appliance of unintelligible idea by much failure in effort to learn by rote nevertheless there be visible improvement in tom under training perhaps because be not boy in abstract existing solely to illustrate evil of mistaken education boy made of flesh blood with disposition not entirely at mercy of circumstance there be great improvement in bearing for example credit on score be due to mr poulter village schoolmaster who being old peninsular soldier be employed to drill toma source of high mutual pleasure mr poulter who be understood by company at black swan to have once struck terror into heart of french be no longer personally formidable have rather shrunken appearance be tremulous in morning not from age from extreme perversity of king lorton boy nothing gin must enable to sustain with firmness still carried with martial erectness have clothes scrupulously brushed trouser tightly strapped on wednesday saturday afternoon when came to tom be always inspired with gin old memory gave exceptionally spirited air a of superannuated charger who hears drum drilling lesson be always protracted by episode of warlike narrative much more interesting to tom than philip story out of iliad for there be cannon in iliad besides tom have felt disgust on learning that hector achilles might possibly never have existed duke of wellington be really alive bony have not be long dead therefore mr poulters reminiscence of peninsular war be removed from suspicion of being mythical mr poulter appeared have be conspicuous figure at talavera have contributed not little to peculiar terror with regiment of infantry be regarded by enemy on afternoon when memory be more stimulated than usual remembered that duke of wellington have in strict privacy lest jealousy must be awakened expressed esteem for fine fellow poulter very surgeon who attended in hospital after have received gunshot wound have be profoundly impressed with superiority of mr poulters fleshno other flesh must have healed in anything like same time on le personal matter connected with important warfare in have be engaged mr poulter be more reticent only taking care not to give weight of authority to loose notion concerning military history one who pretended to knowledge of what occurred at siege of badajos be especially object of silent pity to mr poulter wished that prating person have be run down have breath trampled out of at first go off a hadhe might talk about siege of badajos then tom did not escape irritating drilling master occasionally by curiosity concerning other military matter than mr poulters personal experience general wolfe mr poulterwasnt wonderful fighter said tom who held notion that martial hero commemorated on public house sign be engaged in war with bony not at said mr poulter contemptuously nothing o sort head up added in tone of stern command delighted tom made feel a if be regiment in own person mr poulter must continue on coming to pause in discipline theyd better not talk to about general wolfe did nothing die of wound thats poor haction consider other man ud have died o wound ive have one of sword cut ud have killed fellow like general wolfe mr poulter tom must say at allusion to sword wish youd bring sword do sword exercise for long while mr poulter only shook head in significant manner at request smiled patronizingly a jupiter may have done when semele urged too ambitious request one afternoon when sudden shower of heavy rain have detained mr poulter twenty minute longer than usual at black swan sword be broughtjust for tom to look at be real sword fought with in battle mr poulter said tom handling hilt have ever cut frenchman head off head off ah must if hed have three head have gun bayonet besides said tom must like gun bayonet best because must shoot first spear em after bang p s s s tom gave requisite pantomime to indicate double enjoyment of pulling trigger thrusting spear ah sword thing when come to close fighting said mr poulter involuntarily falling in with tom enthusiasm drawing sword so suddenly that tom leaped back with much agility oh mr poulter if youre going to do exercise said tom little conscious that have not stood ground a became englishman let go call philip hell like to see know what humpbacked lad said mr poulter contemptuously whats use of looking on oh know great deal about fighting said tom how used to fight with bow arrow battle ax let come then ill show something different from bow arrow said mr poulter coughing drawing up while gave little preliminary play to wrist tom ran in to philip who be enjoying afternoon holiday at piano in drawing room picking out tune for singing be supremely happy perched like amorphous bundle on high stool with head thrown back eye fixed on opposite cornice lip wide open sending forth with might impromptu syllable to tune of arnes have hit fancy come philip said tom bursting in dont stay roaring la la there come see old poulter do sword exercise in carriage house jar of interruption discord of tom tone coming across note to philip be vibrating in soul body must have be enough to unhinge temper even if there have be question of poulter drilling master tom in hurry of seizing something to say to prevent mr poulter from thinking be afraid of sword when sprang away from have alighted on proposition to fetch philip though knew well enough that philip hated to hear mention drilling lesson must never have done so inconsiderate thing except under severe stress of personal pride philip shuddered visibly a paused from music then turning red said with violent passion get away lumbering idiot dont come bellowing at youre not fit to speak to anything cart horse be not first time philip have be made angry by tom have never before be assailed with verbal missile that understood so well im fit to speak to something better than poor spirited imp said tom lighting up immediately at philip fire know wont hit because youre no better than girl im honest man son father rogue everybody say so tom flung out of room slammed door after made strangely heedless by anger for to slam door within hearing of mr stelling who be probably not far off be offence only to be wiped out by twenty line of virgil in fact that lady did presently descend from room in double wonder at noise subsequent cessation of philip music found sitting in heap on hassock cry bitterly whats matter wakem what be noise about who slammed door philip looked up hastily dried eye be tulliver who came into ask to go out with what be in trouble about said mr stelling philip be not favourite of two pupil be le obliging than tom who be made useful in many way still father paid more than mr tulliver did meant to feel that behaved exceedingly well to philip however met advance toward good understanding very much a caressed mollusk meet invitation to show out of shell mr stelling be not loving tender hearted woman be woman whose skirt sat well who adjusted waist patted curl with preoccupied air when inquired after welfare thing doubtless represent great social power be not power of love other power must win philip from personal reserve said in answer to question toothache came on made hysterical again have be fact once philip be glad of recollection be like inspiration to enable to excuse cry have to accept eau de cologne to refuse creosote in consequence be easy meanwhile tom who have for first time sent poisoned arrow into philip heart have returned to carriage house where found mr poulter with fixed earnest eye wasting perfection of sword exercise on probably observant inappreciative rat mr poulter be host in be to say admired more than whole army of spectator must have admired took notice of tom return being too entirely absorbed in cut thrustthe solemn one two three four tom not without slight feeling of alarm at mr poulters fixed eye hungry looking sword seemed impatient for something else to cut besides air admired performance from a great distance a possible be not until mr poulter paused wiped perspiration from forehead that tom felt full charm of sword exercise wished to be repeated mr poulter said tom when sword be being finally sheathed wish youd lend sword little while to keep young gentleman said mr poulter shaking head decidedly might do mischief with im sure wouldnt im sure id take care not hurt shouldnt take out of sheath much must ground arm with that wont do tell wont do said mr poulter preparing to depart what ud mr stelling say to oh say do mr poulter id give five shilling piece if youd let keep sword week look here said tom reaching out attractively large round of silver young dog calculated effect a well a if have be philosopher well said mr poulter with still deeper gravity must keep out of sight know oh yes ill keep under bed said tom eagerly else at bottom of large box let see now whether can draw out of sheath without hurting that process having be gone through more than once mr poulter felt that have acted with scrupulous conscientiousness said well now master tulliver if take crown piece be to make sure a youll do mischief with sword oh indeed mr poulter said tom delightedly handing crown piece grasping sword thought might have be lighter with advantage if mr stelling catch carrying in said mr poulter pocketing crown piece provisionally while raised new doubt oh always keep in upstairs study on saturday afternoon said tom who disliked anything sneaking be not disinclined to little stratagem in worthy cause so carried off sword in triumph mixed with dreaddread that might encounter mr mr stellingto bedroom where after consideration hid in closet behind hanging clothes night fell asleep in thought that must astonish maggie with when cametie round waist with red comforter make believe that sword be own that be going to be soldier there be nobody maggie who must be silly enough to believe whom dared allow to know have sword maggie be really coming next week to see tom before went to boarding school with lucy if think lad of thirteen must not have be so childish must be exceptionally wise man who although be devoted to civil calling requiring to look bland rather than formidable yet never since have beard threw into martial attitude frowned before looking glass be doubtful whether soldier must be maintained if there be not pacific people at home who like to fancy soldier war like other dramatic spectacle might possibly cease for want of public chapter v maggies second visit last breach between two lad be not readily mended for time spoke to other more than be necessary natural antipathy of temperament made resentment easy passage to hatred in philip transition seemed to have begun there be malignity in disposition there be susceptibility made peculiarly liable to strong sense of repulsion oxwe may venture to assert on authority of great classicis not given to use teeth a instrument of attack tom be excellent bovine lad who ran at questionable object in truly ingenious bovine manner have blundered on philip tenderest point have caused a much acute pain a if have studied mean with nicest precision most envenomed spite tom saw reason why must not make up quarrel a have done many others by behaving a if nothing have happened for though have never before said to philip that father be rogue idea have so habitually made part of feeling a to relation between dubious schoolfellow whom must neither like dislike that mere utterance did not make such epoch to a did to philip have right to say so when philip hectored over called name perceiving that first advance toward amity be not met relapsed into least favourable disposition toward philip resolved never to appeal to about drawing exercise again be only so far civil to other a be necessary to prevent state of feud from being observed by mr stelling who must have put down such nonsense with great vigor when maggie came however must not help looking with growing interest at new schoolfellow although be son of wicked lawyer wakem who made father so angry have arrived in middle of school hour have sat by while philip went through lesson with mr stelling week ago have sent word that philip knew end of storiesnot stupid story like hers be convinced now from own observation that must be very clever hoped must think rather clever too when came to talk to maggie moreover have rather tenderness for deformed thing preferred wry necked lamb because seemed to that lamb be quite strong well made wouldnt mind so much about being petted be especially fond of petting object must think very delightful to be petted by loved tom very dearly often wished that cared more about loving think philip wakem seems nice boy tom said when went out of study together into garden to pas interval before dinner couldnt choose father know ive read of very bad men who have good son a well a good parent who have bad child if philip be good think ought to be more sorry for because father be not good man like dont oh he queer fellow said tom curtly he a sulky a can be with because told father be rogue id right to tell so for be true began with calling name stop here by bit maggie will ive got something want to do upstairs cant go too said maggie who in first day of meeting again loved tom shadow something ill tell about by by not yet said tom skipping away in afternoon boy be at book in study preparing morrow lesson that might have holiday in evening in honour of maggies arrival tom be hanging over latin grammar moving lip inaudibly like strict impatient catholic repeating tale of paternoster philip at other end of room be busy with two volume with look of contented diligence excited maggies curiosity did not look at a if be learning lesson sat on low stool at nearly right angle with two boy watching first one then other philip looking off book once toward fire place caught pair of questioning dark eye fixed upon thought sister of tullivers seemed nice little thing quite unlike brother wished have little sister what be wondered that made maggies dark eye remind of story about princess being turned into animal think be that eye be full of unsatisfied intelligence unsatisfied beseeching affection say magsie said tom at last shutting book putting away with energy decision of perfect master in art of leaving off ive done lesson now come upstairs with what be said maggie when be outside door slight suspicion crossing mind a remembered tom preliminary visit upstairs isnt trick youre going to play now maggie said tom in most coaxing tone something youll like ever so put arm round neck put hers round waist twined together in way went upstairs say magsie must not tell anybody know said tom else will get fifty line be alive said maggie whose imagination have settled for moment on idea tom kept ferret clandestinely oh shant tell said now go into corner hide face while reach out added a locked bedroom door behind ill tell when to turn round mustnt squeal out know oh if frighten will said maggie beginning to look rather serious wont be frightened silly thing said tom go hide face mind dont peep of course shant peep said maggie disdainfully buried face in pillow like person of strict honour tom looked round warily a walked to closet then stepped into narrow space almost closed door maggie kept face buried without aid of principle for in dream suggestive attitude have soon forgotten where be thought be busy with poor deformed boy who be so clever when tom called out now then magsie nothing long meditation preconcerted arrangement of effect must have enabled tom to present so striking figure a did to maggie when looked up dissatisfied with pacific aspect of face have more than faintest hint of flaxen eyebrow together with pair of amiable blue gray eye round pink cheek refused to look formidable let frown a must before looking glass philip have once told of man who have horseshoe frown tom have tried with frowning might to make horseshoe on forehead have have recourse to unfailing source of terrible burnt cork have made pair of black eyebrow met in satisfactory manner over nose be matched by le carefully adjusted blackness about chin have wound red handkerchief round cloth cap to give air of turban red comforter across breast a scarfan amount of red with tremendous frown on brow decision with grasped sword a held with point resting on ground must suffice to convey approximate idea of fierce bloodthirsty disposition maggie looked bewildered for moment tom enjoyed that moment keenly in next laughed clapped hand together said oh tom youve made like bluebeard at show be clear have not be struck with presence of swordit be not unsheathed frivolous mind required more direct appeal to sense of terrible tom prepared for master stroke frowning with double amount of intention if not of corrugation carefully drew sword from sheath pointed at maggie oh tom please dont exclaimed maggie in tone of suppressed dread shrinking away from into opposite corner will screamim sure will oh dont wish id never come upstairs corner of tom mouth showed inclination to smile of complacency be immediately checked a inconsistent with severity of great warrior slowly let down scabbard on floor lest must make too much noise then said sternly im duke of wellington march stamping forward with right leg little bent sword still pointing toward maggie who trembling with tear filled eye got upon bed a only mean of widening space between tom happy in spectator of military performance even though spectator be only maggie proceeded with utmost exertion of force to exhibition of cut thrust a must necessarily be expected of duke of wellington tom will not bear will scream said maggie at first movement of sword youll hurt youll cut head off onetwo said tom resolutely though at two wrist trembled little three came more slowly with sword swung downward maggie gave loud shriek sword have fallen with edge on tom foot in moment after have fallen too maggie leaped from bed still shrieking immediately there be rush of footstep toward room mr stelling from upstairs study be first to enter found child on floor tom have fainted maggie be shaking by collar of jacket screaming with wild eye thought be dead poor child yet shook a if must bring back to life in minute be sobbing with joy because tom opened eye couldnt sorrow yet that have hurt foot seemed a if happiness lay in being alive chapter vi love scene poor tom bore severe pain heroically be resolute in not telling of mr poulter more than be unavoidable five shilling piece remained secret even to maggie there be terrible dread weighing on mind so terrible that dared not even ask question might bring fatal yes dared not ask surgeon mr stelling will be lame sir mastered so a not to cry out at pain when foot have be dressed be left alone with maggie seated by bedside child sobbed together with head laid on same pillow tom be thinking of walking about on crutch like wheelwright son maggie who did not guess what be in mind sobbed for company have not occurred to surgeon to mr stelling to anticipate dread in tom mind to reassure by hopeful word philip watched surgeon out of house waylaid mr stelling to ask very question that tom have not dared to ask for beg pardon sirbut doe mr askern say will be lame oh oh said mr stelling not permanently only for little while did tell tulliver so sir do think nothing be said to on subject then may go tell sir yes to be sure now mention dare say may be troubling about go to bedroom be very quiet at present have be philip first thought when heard of accidentwill tulliver be lame will be very hard for if be tom hitherto unforgiven offence be washed out by pity philip felt that be no longer in state of repulsion be being drawn into common current of suffering sad privation imagination did not dwell on outward calamity future effect on tom life made vividly present to probable state of tom feeling philip have only lived fourteen year year have most of be steeped in sense of lot irremediably hard mr askern say youll soon be all right again tulliver did know said rather timidly a stepped gently up to tom bed ive just be to ask mr stelling say youll walk a well a ever again by day tom looked up with momentary stopping of breath come with sudden joy then gave long sigh turned blue gray eye straight on philip face a have not done for fortnight more a for maggie intimation of possibility have not thought of before affected a new trouble bare idea of tom being always lame overpowered assurance that misfortune be not likely to befall clung to cried afresh dont be little silly magsie said tom tenderly feeling very brave now will soon get well good by tulliver said philip putting out small delicate hand tom clasped immediately with more substantial finger say said tom ask mr stelling to let come sit with sometimes till get up again wakem tell about robert bruce know after philip spent time out of school hour with tom maggie tom liked to hear fighting story a much a ever insisted strongly on fact that great fighter who did so many wonderful thing came off unhurt wore excellent armor from head to foot made fighting easy work considered must not have hurt foot if have have iron shoe on listened with great interest to new story of philip about man who have very bad wound in foot cried out so dreadfully with pain that friend must bear with no longer put ashore on desert island with nothing wonderful poisoned arrow to kill animal with for food didnt roar out bit know tom said dare say foot be a bad a cowardly to roar maggie must have that when anything hurt very much be quite permissible to cry out be cruel of people not to bear wanted to know if philoctetes have sister why didnt go with on desert island take care of one day soon after philip have told story maggie be in study alone together while tom foot be being dressed philip be at book maggie after sauntering idly round room not caring to

full of expedient by must ward off result such a be tolerable must avoid appearance of breaking down in world obstinacy defiance of nature driven out of old channel found vent for in immediate formation of plan by must meet difficulty remain mr tulliver of dorlcote mill in spite of there be such rush of project in brain that be wonder face be flushed when came away from talk with attorney mr gore mounted horse to ride home from lindum there be furley who held mortgage on landa reasonable fellow who must see own interest mr tulliver be convinced who must be glad not only to purchase whole estate including mill homestead must accept mr tulliver a tenant be willing to advance money to be repaid with high interest out of profit of business must be made over to mr tulliver only taking enough barely to maintain family who must neglect such profitable investment certainly not furley for mr tulliver have determined that furley must meet plan with utmost alacrity there be men

yet mr tulliver reflected must have be quite shortest method of securing right end must have be of use to be sure for mr tulliver to goeven if have be able willingfor have be going to law against wakem abusing for last ten year be always likely to have spite against now that mr tulliver have come to conclusion that husband be very much in wrong to bring into trouble be inclined to think that opinion of wakem be wrong too to be sure wakem have put bailies in house sold up supposed did that to please man lent mr tulliver money for lawyer have more folk to please than one wasnt likely to put mr tulliver who have gone to law with above everybody else in world attorney might be very reasonable man why not have married miss clint at time mr tulliver have heard of marriage summer when wore

honest humanity in general of mr tulliver in particular a be represented to be in eidolon portrait of have seen to exist in miller mind be clear that irascible miller be man to interpret chance shot grazed a attempt on own life be liable to entanglement in puzzling world due consideration have to own infallibility required hypothesis of very active diabolical agency to explain be still possible to believe that attorney be not more guilty toward than ingenious machine performs work with much regularity be guilty toward rash man who venturing too near be caught up by fly wheel other suddenly converted into unexpected mince meat be really impossible to decide question by glance at person line light of human countenance be like other symbolsnot always easy to read without key on priori view of wakems aquiline nose offended mr tulliver there be not more rascality than in shape of stiff shirt collar though too along with nose might have become fraught with damnatory meaning when once

he at home have business for ask to come up although when mr wakem entered office that morning have have intention of purchasing dorlcote mill mind be already made up mr tulliver have suggested to several determining motif mental glance be very rapid be one of men who can be prompt without being rash because motif run in fixed track have need to reconcile conflicting aim to suppose that wakem have same sort of inveterate hatred toward tulliver that tulliver have toward must be like supposing that pike roach can look at other from similar point of view roach necessarily abhors mode in pike get living pike be likely to think nothing further even of most indignant roach than that be excellent good eating must only be when roach choked that pike must entertain strong personal animosity if mr tulliver have ever seriously injured thwarted attorney wakem must not have refused distinction of being special object of vindictiveness when mr tulliver called rascal at market dinner table attorney client be not whit inclined to withdraw business from if when wakem happened to be present jocose cattle feeder stimulated by opportunity brandy made thrust at by alluding to old lady will

have understood from person versed in history that mankind be not disposed to look narrowly into conduct of great victor when victory be on right side tulliver then must be obstruction to wakem on contrary be poor devil whom lawyer have defeated several time hot tempered fellow who must always give handle against wakems conscience be not uneasy because have used few trick against miller why must hate unsuccessful plaintiff pitiable furious bull entangled in mesh of net still among various excess to human nature be subject moralist have never numbered that of being too fond of people who openly revile successful yellow candidate for borough of old topping perhaps feel pursuant meditative hatred toward blue editor who console subscriber with vituperative rhetoric against yellow men who sell country be demon of private life might not be sorry if law opportunity favoured to kick blue editor to deeper shade of favourite colour prosperous men take little vengeance now then a take diversion when come easily in way be hindrance to business such small unimpassioned revenge have enormous effect in life running through degree of pleasant infliction blocking fit men out of place blackening character in unpremeditated talk still more to see people who have be only insignificantly offensive to reduced in life humiliated without special effort of ours be apt to have soothing flattering influence providence other prince of world appears have undertaken task of retribution for really by agreeable constitution of thing enemy somehow dont prosper wakem be not without parenthetic vindictiveness toward uncomplimentary miller now mr tulliver have put notion into head presented to a pleasure to do very thing must cause mr tulliver most deadly mortificationand pleasure of complex kind not made up of crude malice mingling with relish of self approbation to see enemy humiliated give certain contentment be jejune compared with highly blent satisfaction of seeing humiliated by benevolent action concession on behalf be sort of revenge fall into scale of virtue wakem be not without intention of keeping scale respectably filled have once have pleasure of putting old enemy of into one of st oggs alms house to rebuilding of have given large subscription here be opportunity of providing for by making own servant such thing give completeness to prosperity contribute element of agreeable consciousness be not dreamed of by short sighted overheated vindictiveness go out of way to wreak in direct injury tulliver with rough tongue filed by sense of obligation must make better servant than chance fellow who be cap in hand for situation tulliver be known to be man of proud honesty wakem be too acute not to believe in existence of honesty be given to observing individual not to judging of according to maxim one knew better than that men be not like besides intended to overlook whole business of land mill pretty closely be fond of practical

window when saw mr wakem entering yard a usual on fine black horse not alone a usual one be with hima figure in cloak on handsome pony maggie have hardly time to feel that be philip come back before be in front of window be raising hat to while father catching movement by side glance looked sharply round at maggie hurried away from window carried work upstairs for mr wakem sometimes came in inspected book maggie felt that meeting with philip must be robbed of pleasure in presence of two father day perhaps must see when must just shake hand must tell that remembered goodness to tom thing have said to in old day though must never be friend more be not at agitating to maggie to see philip again retained childish gratitude pity toward remembered cleverness in early week of loneliness have continually recalled image of among people who have be kind to in life often wishing have for brother teacher a have fancied might have be in talk together that sort of wishing have be banished along with other dream savored of seeking own will thought besides that philip might be altered by life abroadhe might have become worldly really not care about saying anything to now yet face be wonderfully little alteredit be only larger more manly copy of pale small featured boy face with gray eye boyish waving brown hair there be old deformity to awaken old pity after meditation maggie felt that really must like to say few word to might still be melancholy a always used to be like to look at kindly wondered if remembered how used to like eye with thought maggie glanced toward square looking glass be condemned to hang with face toward wall half started from seat to reach down checked snatched up work trying to repress rising wish by forcing memory to recall snatch of hymn until saw philip father returning along road must go down again be far on in june now maggie be inclined to lengthen daily walk be one indulgence day following be so busy with work must be finished that never went beyond gate satisfied need of open air by sitting out of door one of frequent walk when be not obliged to go to st oggs be to spot lay beyond what be called hillan insignificant rise of ground crowned by tree lying along side of road ran by gate of dorlcote mill insignificant call because in height be hardly more than bank there may come moment when nature make mere bank mean toward fateful result be why ask to imagine high bank crowned with tree making uneven wall for quarter of mile along left side of dorlcote mill pleasant field behind bounded by murmuring ripple just where line of bank sloped down again to level by road turned off led to other side of rise where be broken into very capricious hollow mound by working of exhausted stone quarry so long exhausted that mound hollow be now clothed with bramble tree here there by stretch of grass few sheep kept close nibbled in childish day maggie held place called red deep in very great awe needed confidence in tom bravery to reconcile to excursion thithervisions of robber fierce animal haunting hollow now have charm for broken ground mimic rock ravine have for eye rest habitually on level especially in summer when must sit on grassy hollow under shadow of branching ash stooping aslant from steep above listen to hum of insect like tiniest bell on garment of silence see sunlight piercing distant bough a if to chase drive home truant heavenly blue of wild hyacinth in june time too dog rose be in glory be additional reason why maggie must direct walk to red deep rather than to other spot on first day be free to wander at willa pleasure loved so well that sometimes in ardor of renunciation thought ought to deny frequent indulgence in may see now a walk down favourite turning enters deep by narrow path through group of scotch fir tall figure old lavender gown visible through hereditary black silk shawl of wide meshed net like material now be sure of being unseen take off bonnet tie over arm one must certainly suppose to be farther on in life than seventeenth yearperhaps because of slow resigned sadness of glance from search unrest seem to have departed perhaps because broad chested figure have mould of early womanhood youth health have withstood well involuntary voluntary hardship of lot night in have lain on hard floor for penance have left obvious trace eye be liquid brown cheek be firm round full lip be red with dark colouring jet crown surmounting tall figure seems to have sort of kinship with grand scotch fir at be looking up a if loved well yet one have sense of uneasiness in looking at hera sense of opposing element of fierce collision be imminent surely there be hushed expression such a one often see in older face under borderless cap out of keeping with resistant youth one expects to flash out in sudden passionate glance will dissipate quietude like damp fire leaping out again when seemed safe maggie be not uneasy at moment be calmly enjoying free air while looked up at old fir tree thought that broken end of branch be record of past storm have only made red stem soar higher while eye be still turned upward became conscious of moving shadow cast by evening sun on grassy path before looked down with startled gesture to see philip wakem who first raised hat then blushing deeply came forward to put out hand maggie too coloured with surprise soon gave way to pleasure put out hand looked down at deformed figure before with frank eye filled for moment with nothing memory of child feelingsa memory be always strong in be first to speak startled said smiling faintly never meet one here how came to be walking here did come to meet be impossible not to perceive maggie felt child again yes did said philip still embarrassed wished to see very much watched long while yesterday on bank near house to see if must come out never came then watched again to day when saw way took kept in sight came down bank behind there hope will not be displeased with said maggie with simple seriousness walking on a if meant philip to accompany im very glad came for wished very much to have opportunity of speaking to ive never forgotten how good be long ago to tom too be not sure that must remember so well tom have have great deal of trouble since then think that make one think more of what happened before trouble came cant believe that have thought of so much a have thought of said philip timidly do know when be away made picture of a looked that morning in study when said must not forget philip drew large miniature case from pocket opened maggie saw old self leaning on table with black lock hanging down behind ear looking into space with strange dreamy eye be water colour sketch of real merit a portrait oh dear said maggie smiling flushed with pleasure what queer little girl be remember with hair in way in pink frock really be like gypsy dare say be now added after little pause be like what expected to be word might have be of coquette full bright glance maggie turned on philip be not that of coquette really did hope liked face a be now be simply rising again of innate delight in admiration love philip met eye looked at in silence for long moment before said quietly maggie light died out little from maggies face there be slight trembling of lip eyelid fell lower did not turn away head philip continued to look at then said slowly be very much more beautiful than thought must be be said pleasure returning in deeper flush turned face away from took step looking straight before in silence a if be adjusting consciousness to new idea girl be so accustomed to think of dress a main ground of vanity that in abstaining from looking glass maggie have thought more of abandoning care for adornment than of renouncing contemplation of face comparing with elegant wealthy young lady have not occurred to that must produce effect with person philip seemed to like silence well walked by side watching face a if sight left room for other wish have passed from among fir tree have now come to green hollow almost surrounded by amphitheatre of pale pink dog rose a light about have brightened maggies face have lost glow stood still when be in hollow looking at philip again said in serious sad voice wish must have be friendsi mean if must have be good right for be trial have to bear in everything may not keep anything used to love when be little old book went tom be different father be like death must part with everything cared for when be child must part with must never take notice of other again be what wanted to speak to for wanted to let know tom cant do a like about such thing that if behave a if have forgotten about be not out of envy prideoror bad feeling maggie spoke with more more sorrowful gentleness a went on eye began to fill with tear deepening expression of pain on philip face gave stronger resemblance to boyish self made deformity appeal more strongly to pity know see that mean said in voice have become feebler from discouragement know what there be to keep apart on side be not right maggiedont be angry with be so used to call maggie in thoughtsit be not right to sacrifice everything to other people unreasonable feeling must give up great deal for father must not give up friendship oror attachment of sort in obedience to wish of didnt recognise a right dont know said maggie musingly often when have be angry discontented have seemed to be not bound to give up anything have gone on thinking till have seemed to that must think away duty good have ever come of that be evil state of mind im quite sure that might do must wish in end have gone without anything for rather than have made father life harder to must make life harder if be to see other sometimes said philip be going to say something else checked oh im sure wouldnt like dont ask why anything about said maggie in distressed tone father feel so strongly about thing be not at happy more be said philip impetuously be not happy why said maggie gently at leasti ought not to askbut im very very sorry philip turned to walk on a if have not patience to stand still longer went out of hollow winding amongst tree bush in silence after last word of philip maggie must not bear to insist immediately on parting ive be great deal happier said at last timidly since have given up thinking about what be easy pleasant being discontented because couldnt have own will life be determined for make mind very free when give up wishing only think of bearing what be laid upon doing what be given to do cant give up wishing said philip impatiently seems to can never give up longing wishing while be thoroughly alive there be certain thing feel to be beautiful good must hunger after how can ever be satisfied without until feeling be deadened delight in fine picture long to be able to paint such strive strive cant produce what want be pain to always will be pain until faculty lose keenness like aged eye then there be many other thing long forhere philip hesitated little then saidthings that other men have will always be denied life will have nothing great beautiful in must rather not have lived oh philip said maggie wish didnt feel so heart began to beat with something of philip discontent well then said turning quickly round fixing gray eye entreatingly on face must be contented to live if must let see sometimes then checked by fear face suggested looked away again said more calmly have friend to whom can tell everything one who care enough about if must only see now then must let talk to little show that cared for that may always be friend in heart help other then might come to be glad of life how can see philip said maggie falteringly must really do good must be very hard to say good by day not speak to again here be new interest to vary day be so much easier to renounce interest before came if must let see here sometimeswalk with herei must be contented if be only once twice in month must injure one happiness must sweeten life besides philip went on with inventive astuteness of love at one twenty if there be enmity between who belong to ought all more to try quench by friendship mean that by influence on side might bring about healing of wound have be made in past if must know everything about dont believe there be enmity in own father mind think have proved contrary maggie shook head slowly be silent under conflicting thought seemed to inclination that to see philip now then keep up bond of friendship with be something not only innocent good perhaps might really help to find contentment a have found voice said made sweet music to maggie athwart there came urgent monotonous warning from voice have be learning to obeythe warning that such interview implied secrecy implied doing something must dread to be discovered in something that if discovered must cause anger pain that admission of anything so near doubleness must act a spiritual blight yet music must swell out again like chime borne onward by recurrent breeze persuading that wrong lay in fault weakness of others that there be such thing a futile sacrifice for one to injury of be very cruel for philip that must be shrunk from because of unjustifiable vindictiveness toward fatherpoor philip whom people must shrink from only because be deformed idea that might become lover that meeting must cause disapproval in light have not occurred to philip saw absence of idea clearly enough saw with certain pang although made consent to request le unlikely there be bitterness to in perception that maggie be almost a frank unconstrained toward a when be child cant say yes said at last turning round walking toward way come must wait lest must decide wrongly must seek for guidance may come again then to morrow next day next week think have better write said maggie faltering again have to go to st oggs sometimes can put letter in post oh said philip eagerly must not be so well father might see letterandhe have not enmity believe view thing differently from think great deal about wealth position pray let come here once more tell when will be if cant tell will come a often a can till do see think must be so then said maggie for cant be quite certain of coming here particular evening maggie felt great relief in adjourning decision be free now to enjoy minute of companionship almost thought might linger little next time met must have to pain philip by telling determination cant help thinking said looking smilingly at after few moment of silence how strange be that must have met talked to other just a if have be only yesterday when parted at lorton yet must be very much altered in five yearsi think be five year how be seemed to have sort of feeling be same maggie be not quite so sure that must be same know be so clever must have seen learnt so much to fill mind be not quite sure must care about now have never have doubt that must be same might see said philipi mean same in everything that made like better than one else dont want to explain that dont think of strongest effect nature be susceptible of can ever be explained can detect process by be arrived at mode in act on greatest of painter only once painted mysteriously divine child couldnt have told how did cant tell why feel to be divine think there be store laid up in human nature that understanding can make complete inventory of certain strain of music affect so strangely can never hear without changing whole attitude of mind for time if effect must last might be capable of heroism ah know what mean about music feel so said maggie clasping hand with old impetuosity at least added in saddened tone used to feel so when have music never have now except organ at church long for maggie said philip looking at with affectionate pity ah can have very little be beautiful in life have many book be so fond of when be little girl be come back to hollow round dog rose grew paused under charm of fary

lot why must starve mind in way be narrow asceticism dont like to see persisting in maggie poetry art knowledge be sacred pure not for not for said maggie walking more hurriedly because must want too much must wait life will not last long dont hurry away from without saying good by maggie said philip a reached group of scotch fir continued still to walk along without speaking must not go farther think must oh forgot good by said maggie pausing putting out hand to action brought feeling back in strong current to philip after have stood looking at other in silence for few moment with hand clasped said withdrawing hand im very grateful to for thinking of year be very sweet to have people love what wonderful beautiful thing seems that god must have made heart so that must care about queer little girl whom only knew for few week remember saying to that thought cared for more than tom did ah maggie said philip almost fretfully must never love so well a love brother perhaps not said maggie simply then know first thing ever remember in life be standing with tom by side of floss while held hand everything before be dark to will never forget though must keep apart dont say so maggie said philip if kept that little girl in mind for five year didnt earn part in ought not to take quite away from not if be free said maggie be not must submit hesitated moment then added wanted to say

of feeling nearness to clutched passionately possibility that might love perhaps feeling must grow if must come to associate with watchful tenderness nature must be so keenly alive to if woman must love surely maggie be that woman there be such wealth of love in there be one to claim then pity of that mind like hers must be withering in very youth like young forest tree for want of light space

influenced by strange mixture of opposite feeling often give equal truth to who blame action who admire itpartly be that disinclination to confidence be seen between near kindred that family repulsion

for on higher platform of employment did not desire be quite sure that did chapter iii wavering balance said that maggie went home that evening from red deep with mental conflict already begun have seen clearly enough in interview with philip what that conflict be here suddenly be opening in rocky wall shut in narrow valley of humiliation where prospect be remote unfathomed sky of memory haunting earthly delight be no longer out of reach might have book converse affection might hear tidings of world from mind have not yet lost sense of exile must be kindness to philip too who be pitiableclearly not happy perhaps here be opportunity indicated for making mind more worthy of highest service perhaps noblest completest devoutness must hardly exist without width of knowledge must always live in resigned imprisonment be so blameless so good thing that there must be friendship between philip motif forbade be so unreasonable so unchristian severe monotonous warning came again againthat be losing simplicity clearness of life by admitting ground of concealment that by forsaking simple rule of renunciation be throwing under seductive guidance of illimitable want thought have won strength to obey warning before allowed next week to turn step in evening to red deep while be resolved to say affectionate farewell to philip how looked forward to evening walk in still fleckered shade of hollow away from be harsh unlovely to affectionate admiring look must meet to sense of comradeship that childish memory must give to wiser older talk to certainty that philip must care to hear everything said one else cared for be half hour that must be very hard to turn back upon with sense that there must be no other like yet said what meant to say looked firm a well a sad philip have made up mind be right that must give other up in everything memory must not see without concealmentstay know what be going to sayit be other people wrong feeling make concealment necessary concealment be bad however may be caused feel that must be bad for for then if secret be discovered there must be nothing miserydreadful anger then must part after must be harder when be used to seeing other philip face have flushed there be momentary eagerness of expression a if have be about to resist decision with might controlled said with assumed calmness well maggie if must part let try forget for one half hour let talk together little while for last time took hand maggie felt reason to withdraw quietness made more sure have given great pain wanted to show how unwillingly have given walked together hand in hand in silence let sit down in hollow said philip where stood last time see how dog rose have strewed ground spread opal petal over sat down at root of slanting ash ive begun picture of among scotch fir maggie said philip so must let study face little while staysince be not to see again please turn head way be said in entreating voice must have be very hard of maggie to refuse full lustrous face with bright black coronet looked down like of divinity well pleased to be worshipped on pale hued small featured face be turned up to will be sitting for second portrait then said smiling will be larger than other oh yes much larger be oil painting will look like tall hamadryad dark strong noble just issued from one of fir tree when stem be casting afternoon shadow on grass seem to think more of painting than of anything now philip perhaps do said philip rather sadly think of too many thingssow sort of seed get great harvest from one of im cursed with susceptibility in direction effective faculty in none care for painting music care for classic literature medival literature modern literature flutter way fly in none surely be happiness to have so many tastesto enjoy so many beautiful thing when be within reach said maggie musingly always seemed to sort of clever stupidity only to have one sort of talentalmost like carrier pigeon might be happiness to have many taste if be like other men said philip bitterly might get power distinction by mere mediocrity a do at least must get middling satisfaction make men contented to do without great one might think society at st oggs agreeable then nothing must make life worth purchase money of pain to faculty must lift above dead level of provincial existence yes there be one thinga passion answer a well a faculty maggie did not hear last word be struggling against consciousness that philip word have set own discontent vibrating again a used to do understand what mean said though know so much le than do used to think must never bear life if kept on being same day must always be doing thing of consequence never know anything greater dear philip think be only like child that one who be wiser be taking care of be not right to resign entirely may be denied have found great peace in for last two three year even joy in subduing own will yes maggie said philip vehemently be shutting up in narrow self delusive fanaticism be only way of escaping pain by starving into dulness highest power of nature joy peace be not resignation resignation be willing endurance of pain be not allayed that dont expect to be allayed stupefaction be not resignation be stupefaction to remain in ignoranceto shut up avenue by life of fellow men might become known to be not resigned be not sure that life be long enough to learn that lesson be not resigned be only trying to stupefy maggies lip trembled felt there be truth in what philip said yet there be deeper consciousness that for immediate application have to conduct be better than falsity double impression corresponded to double impulse of speaker philip seriously believed what said said with vehemence because made argument against resolution opposed wish maggies face made more childlike by gathering tear touched with tenderer le egotistic feeling took hand said gently dont let think of such thing in short half hour maggie let only care about being together will be friend in spite of separation will always think of other will be glad to live a long a be alive because will think there may always come time when canwhen will let help in way what dear good brother must have be philip said maggie smiling through haze of tear think must have made a much fuss about be a pleased for to love a must have satisfied even must have loved well enough to bear with forgive everything be what always longed that tom must do be never satisfied with little of anything be why be better for to do without earthly happiness altogether never felt that have enough musici wanted more instrument playing together wanted voice to be fuller deeper do ever sing now philip added abruptly a if have forgotten what went before yes said day almost voice be only middling like everything else in oh sing somethingjust one song may listen to before gosomething used to sing at lorton on saturday afternoon when have drawing room to ourselves put apron over head to listen know said philip maggie buried face in hand while sang sotto voce love in eye sits playing then said thats isnt oh wont stay said maggie starting up will only haunt let walk philip must go home moved away so that be obliged to rise follow maggie said in tone of remonstrance dont persist in wilful senseless privation make wretched to see benumbing cramping nature in way be so full of life when be child thought must be brilliant womanall wit bright imagination flash out in face still until draw that veil of dull quiescence over why do speak so bitterly to philip said maggie because foresee will not end well can never carry on self torture will have strength given said maggie tremulously will not maggie one have strength given to do what be unnatural be mere cowardice to seek safety in negation character becomes strong in way will be thrown into world day then rational satisfaction of nature that deny now will assault like savage appetite maggie started paused looking at philip with alarm in face philip how dare shake in way be tempter be not love give insight maggie insight often give foreboding listen to melet supply with book do let see sometimesbe brother teacher a said at lorton be le wrong that must see than that must be committing long suicide maggie felt unable to speak shook head walked on in silence till came to end of scotch fir put out hand in sign of parting do banish from place forever then maggie surely may come walk in sometimes if meet by chance there be concealment in be moment when resolution seems about to become irrevocablewhen fatal iron gate be about to close upon usthat test strength then after hour of clear reasoning firm conviction snatch at sophistry will nullify long struggle bring defeat that love better than victory maggie felt heart leap at subterfuge of philip there passed over face that almost imperceptible shock accompanies relief saw parted in silence philip sense of situation be too complete for not to be visited with glancing fear lest have be intervening too presumptuously in action of maggies conscience perhaps for selfish end nohe persuaded end be not selfish have little hope that maggie must ever return strong feeling have for must be better for maggies future life when petty family obstacle to freedom have disappeared that present must not be entirely sacrificed that

combination of result by action can be justified by adopting point of view of providence who arranges result of philosopher who trace will find possible to obtain perfect complacency in choosing to do

blushed blush deepened instant from consciousness until mention of red deep made feel a if whole secret be betrayed dared not even hold tea spoon lest must show how trembled sat with hand clasped under table not daring to look round happily father be seated on same side with beyond uncle pullet must not see face without stooping forward mother voice brought first relief turning conversation for mr tulliver be always alarmed when name of wakem be mentioned in husband presence gradually maggie recovered composure enough to look up eye met tom turned away head immediately went to bed that night wondering if have gathered suspicion from confusion perhaps not perhaps must think be only alarm at aunt mention of wakem before father be interpretation mother have put on to father wakem be like disfiguring disease of be obliged to endure consciousness be exasperated to have existence recognised by others amount of sensitiveness in about father must be surprising maggie thought tom be too keen sighted to rest satisfied with such interpretation have seen clearly enough that there be something distinct from anxiety about father in maggies excessive confusion in trying to recall detail must give shape to suspicion remembered only lately hearing mother scold maggie for walking in red deep when ground be wet bringing home shoe clogged with red soil still tom retaining old repulsion for philip deformity shrank from attributing to sister probability of feeling more than friendly interest in such unfortunate exception to common run of men tom be nature have sort of superstitious repugnance to everything exceptional love for deformed man must be odious in woman in sister intolerable if have be carrying on kind of intercourse whatever with philip stop must be put to at once be disobeying father strongest feeling brother express command besides compromising by secret meeting left home next morning in watchful state of mind turn most ordinary course of thing into pregnant coincidence afternoon about half past three oclock tom be standing on wharf talking with bob jakin about probability of good ship adelaide coming in in day two with result highly important to of eh said bob parenthetically a looked over field on other side of river there go that crooked young wakem know shadder a far off a can see em im allays lighting on o that side river sudden thought seemed to have darted through tom mind must go bob said ive something to attend to hurrying off to warehouse where left notice for one to take place be called away home on peremptory business swiftest pace shortest road took to gate be pausing to open deliberately that might walk into house with appearance of perfect composure when maggie came out at front door in bonnet shawl conjecture be fulfilled waited for at gate started violently when saw tom how be be come home be there anything matter maggie spoke in low tremulous voice im come to walk with to red deep meet philip wakem said tom central fold in brow have become habitual with deepening a spoke maggie stood helpless pale cold by mean then tom knew everything at last said im not going turned round yes be want to speak to first where be father out on horseback mother in yard think with poultry can go in then without seeing walked in together tom entering parlour said to maggie come in here obeyed closed door behind now maggie tell instant everything have passed between philip wakem doe father know anything said maggie still trembling said tom indignantly will know if attempt to use deceit toward further dont wish to use deceit said maggie flushing into resentment at hearing word applied to conduct tell whole truth then perhaps know never mind whether know not tell exactly what have happened father will know everything tell for father sake then yes becomes to profess affection for father when have despised strongest feeling never do wrong tom said maggie tauntingly not if know answered tom with proud sincerity have nothing to say to beyond tell have passed between philip wakem when did first meet in red deep year ago said maggie quietly tom severity gave certain fund of defiance kept sense of error in abeyance need ask more question have be friendly year have met walked together often have lent book be that said tom looking straight at with frown maggie paused moment then determined to make end of tom right to accuse of deceit said haughtily no not quite on saturday told that loved didnt think of before then have only thought of a old friend encouraged said tom with expression of disgust told that loved too tom be silent few moment looking on ground frowning with hand in pocket at last looked up said coldly now then maggie there be two course for to takeeither vow solemnly to with hand on father bible that will never have meeting speak word in private with philip wakem refuse tell father everything month when by exertion might be made happy once more will cause blow of knowing that be disobedient deceitful daughter who throw away own respectability by clandestine meeting with son of man have helped to ruin father choose tom ended with cold decision going up to large bible drawing forward opening at fly leaf where writing be be crushing alternative to maggie tom said urged out of pride into pleading dont ask will promise to give up intercourse with philip if will let see once even only write to explain everythingto give up a long a must ever cause pain to father feel something for philip too be not happy dont wish to hear anything of feeling have said exactly what mean choose quickly lest mother must come in if give word will be a strong bond to a if laid hand on bible dont require that to bind do what require said tom cant trust maggie there be consistency in put hand on bible say renounce private speech intercourse with philip wakem from time forth else will bring shame on grief on father what be use of exerting giving up everything else for sake of paying father debt if be to bring madness vexation on just when might be easy hold up head once more oh tom will debt be paid soon said maggie clasping hand with sudden flash of joy across wretchedness if thing turn out a expect said tom added voice trembling with indignation while have be contriving working that father may have peace of mind before diesworking for respectability of familyyou have done can to destroy maggie felt deep movement of compunction for moment mind ceased to contend against what felt to be cruel unreasonable in self blame justified brother tom said in low voice be wrong of be so lonely be sorry for philip think enmity hatred be wicked nonsense said tom duty be clear enough say no more promise in word told must speak to philip once more will go with now speak to give word not to meet write to again without knowledge be only thing will say will put hand on bible if like say then maggie laid hand on page of manuscript repeated promise tom closed book said now let go not word be spoken a walked along maggie be suffering in anticipation of what philip be about to suffer dreading galling word must fall on from tom lip felt be in vain to attempt anything submission tom have terrible clutch on conscience deepest dread writhed under demonstrable truth of character have given to conduct yet whole soul rebelled against a unfair from incompleteness meanwhile felt impetus of indignation diverted toward philip did not know how much of old boyish repulsion of mere personal pride animosity be concerned in bitter severity of word by meant to do duty of son brother tom be not given to inquire subtly into own motif more than into other matter of intangible kind be quite sure that own motif a well a action be good else must have have nothing to do with maggies only hope be that something might for first time have prevented philip from coming then there must be delaythen might get tom permission to write to heart beat with double violence when got under scotch fir be last moment of suspense thought philip always met soon after got beyond passed across more open green space entered narrow bushy path by mound turning came so close upon that tom philip stopped suddenly within yard of other there be moment silence in philip darted look of inquiry at maggies face saw answer there in pale parted lip terrified tension of large eye imagination always rushing extravagantly beyond immediate impression saw tall strong brother grasping feeble philip bodily crushing trampling on do call acting part of man gentleman sir tom said in voice of harsh scorn a soon a philip eye be turned on again what do mean answered philip haughtily mean stand farther from lest must lay hand on ill tell what mean mean taking advantage of young girl foolishness ignorance to get to have secret meeting with mean daring to trifle with respectability of family have good honest name to support deny interrupted philip impetuously must never trifle with anything affected sister happiness be dearer to than be to honour more than can ever honour must give up life to dont talk high flown nonsense to sir do mean to pretend that didnt know must be injurious to to meet here week after week do pretend have right to make profession of love to even if have be fit husband for when father father must ever consent to marriage between youyou to try worm into affection of handsome girl who be not eighteen have be shut out from world by father misfortune thats crooked notion of honour be call base treachery call taking advantage of circumstance to win whats too good for youwhat youd never get by fair mean be manly of to talk in way to said philip bitterly whole frame shaken by violent emotion giant have immemorial right to stupidity insolent abuse be incapable even of understanding what feel for sister feel so much for must even desire to be at friendship with must be very sorry to understand feeling said tom with scorching contempt what wish be that must understand methat will take care of sister that if dare to make least attempt to come near to write to to keep slightest hold on mind puny miserable body ought to have put modesty into mind will not protect ill thrash ill hold up to public scorn who wouldnt laugh at idea of turning lover to fine girl tom maggie walked on in silence for yard burst out in convulsed voice stay maggie said philip making strong effort to speak then looking at tom have dragged sister here suppose that may stand by while threaten insult naturally seemed to right mean to influence be mistaken let sister speak if say be bound to give up will abide by wish to slightest word be for father sake philip said maggie imploringly tom threatens to tell father couldnt bear have promised have vowed solemnly that will not have intercourse without brother knowledge be enough maggie will not change wish to hold entirely free trust remember that can never seek for anything good to what belongs to yes said tom exasperated by attitude of philip can talk of seeking good for what belongs to now did seek good before didat risk perhaps wished to have friend for lifewho must cherish who must do more justice than coarse narrow minded brother that have always lavished affection on yes way of befriending be different from yours ill tell what be way ill save from disobeying disgracing father ill save from throwing away on youfrom making laughing stockfrom being flouted by man like father because shes not good enough for son know well enough what sort of justice cherishing be preparing for im not to be imposed upon by fine word can see what action mean come away maggie seized maggies right wrist a spoke put out left hand philip clasped instant with one eager look then hurried away tom maggie walked on in silence for yard be still holding wrist tightly a if be compelling culprit from scene of action at last maggie with violent snatch drew hand away pent up long gathered irritation burst into utterance dont suppose that think be right tom that bow to will despise feeling have shown in speaking to philip detest insulting unmanly allusion to deformity have be reproaching other people life have be always sure be right be because have not mind large enough to see that there be anything better than own conduct own petty aim certainly said tom coolly dont see that conduct be better aim if conduct philip wakems conduct have be right why be ashamed of being known answer that know have aimed at in conduct ive succeeded pray what good have conduct brought to one else dont want to defend said maggie still with vehemence know ive be wrongoften continually yet sometimes when have done wrong have be because have feeling that must be better for if have if be in fault ever if have done anything very wrong must be sorry for pain brought must not want punishment to be heaped on have always enjoyed punishing have always be hard cruel to even when be little girl always loved better than one else in world must let go cry to bed without forgiving have pity have sense of own imperfection own sin be sin to be hard be not fitting for mortal for christian be nothing pharisee thank god for nothing own virtue think be great enough to win everything else have not even vision of feeling by side of shining virtue be mere darkness well said tom with cold scorn if feeling be so much better than mine let see show in other way than by conduct thats likely to disgrace allthan by ridiculous flight first into one extreme then into pray how have shown love that talk of to father by disobeying deceiving have different way of showing affection because be man tom have power can do something in world then if can hing submit to can so will submit to what acknowledge feel to be right will submit even to what be unreasonable from father will not submit to from boast of virtue a if purchased right to be cruel unmanly a youve be to day dont suppose must give up philip wakem in obedience to deformity insult must make cling to care for more very well that be view of thing said tom more coldly than ever need say more to show what wide distance there be between let remember that in future be silent tom went back to st oggs to fulfill appointment with uncle deane receive direction about journey on be to set out next morning maggie went up to own room to pour out indignant remonstrance against tom mind be close barred in bitter tear then when first burst of unsatisfied anger be gone by came recollection of quiet time before pleasure have ended in to day misery have perturbed clearness simplicity of life used to think in time that have made great conquest won lasting stand on serene height above worldly temptation conflict here be down again in thick of hot strife with own others passion life be not so short then perfect rest be not so near a have dreamed when be two year younger there be more struggle for perhaps more falling if have felt that be entirely wrong that tom have be entirely right must sooner have recovered more inward harmony now penitence submission be constantly obstructed by resentment must present to otherwise than a just indignation heart bled for philip went on recalling insult have be flung at with so vivid conception of what have felt under that be almost like sharp bodily pain to making beat floor with foot tighten finger on palm yet how be that be now then conscious of certain dim background of relief in forced separation from philip surely be only because sense of deliverance from concealment be welcome at cost chapter vi hard won triumph three week later when dorlcote mill be at prettiest moment in yearthe great chestnut in blossom grass deep daisiedtom tulliver came home to earlier than usual in evening a passed over bridge looked with old deep rooted affection at respectable red brick house always seemed cheerful inviting outside let room be a bare heart a sad a might inside there be very pleasant light in tom blue gray eye a glance at house window that fold in brow never disappears be not unbecoming seems to imply strength of will may possibly be without harshness when eye mouth have gentlest expression firm step becomes quicker corner of mouth rebel against compression be meant to forbid smile eye in parlour be not turned toward bridge just then group there be sitting in unexpectant silencemr tulliver in arm chair tired with long ride ruminating with worn look fixed chiefly on maggie who be bending over sewing while mother be making tea looked up with surprise when heard well known foot why whats up now tom said father youre bit earlier than usual oh there be nothing more for to do so came away well mother tom went up to mother kissed sign of unusual good humour with hardly word look have passed between maggie in three week usual incommunicativeness at home prevented from being noticeable to parent father said tom when have finished tea do know exactly how much money there be in tin box only hundred ninety three pound said mr tulliver youve brought le o late young fellow like to have own way with money though didnt do a liked before be of age spoke with rather timid discontent be quite sure thats sum father said tom wish must take trouble to fetch tin box down think have perhaps made mistake how must make mistake said father sharply ive counted often enough can fetch if wont believe be always incident mr tulliver liked in gloomy life to fetch tin box count money dont go out of room mother said tom a saw moving when father be gone upstairs isnt maggie to go said mr tulliver because somebody must take away thing just a like said tom indifferently be cutting word to maggie heart have leaped with sudden conviction that tom be going to tell father debt must be paid tom must have let be absent when news be told carried away tray came back immediately feeling of injury on own behalf must not predominate at moment tom drew to corner of table near father when tin box be set down opened red evening light falling on made conspicuous worn sour gloom of dark eyed father suppressed joy in face of fair complexioned son mother maggie sat at other end of table one in blank patience other in palpitating expectation mr tulliver counted out money setting in order on table then said glancing sharply at tom there now see be right enough paused looking at money with bitter despondency there more three hundred wanting itll be fine while before can save losing forty two pound wi corn be sore job world be too many for took four year to lay by much if im above ground for four year must trusten to to pay em went on with trembling voice if keep same mind now youre coming o age youre like enough to bury first looked up in tom face with querulous desire for assurance father said tom speaking with energetic decision though there be tremor discernible in voice too will live to see debt paid will pay with own hand tone implied something more than mere hopefulness resolution slight electric shock seemed to pas through mr tulliver kept eye fixed on tom with look of eager inquiry while maggie unable to restrain rushed to father side knelt down by tom be silent little while before went on good while ago uncle glegg lent little money to trade with have answered have three hundred twenty pound in bank mother arm be round neck a soon a last word be uttered said half cry oh boy knew youd make iverything right again when got man father be silent flood of emotion hemmed in power of speech tom maggie be struck with fear lest shock of joy might even be fatal blessed relief of tear came broad chest heaved muscle of face gave way gray haired man burst into loud sob fit of weeping gradually subsided sat quiet recovering regularity of breathing at last looked up at wife said in gentle tone bessy must come kiss nowthe lad have made amends youll see bit o comfort again belike when have kissed have held hand minute thought went back to money wish youd brought money to look at tom said fingering sovereign on table must have felt surer will see to morrow father said tom uncle deane have appointed creditor to meet to morrow at golden lion have ordered dinner for at two oclock uncle glegg will both be there be advertised in messenger on saturday then wakem know ont said mr tulliver eye kindling with triumphant fire ah went

partnership a uncle deane be before youyoure in right way fort then there nothing to hinder getting rich if ever youre rich enoughmind thistry get th old mill again mr tulliver threw back in chair mind have so long be home of nothing bitter discontent foreboding suddenly filled by magic of joy with vision of good fortune subtle influence prevented from foreseeing good fortune a happening to shake hand wi lad said suddenly putting out hand great thing when man can be proud a he got good son ive have that luck tom never lived to taste moment so delicious a maggie couldnt help forgetting own grievance tom be good in sweet humility spring in in moment of true admiration gratitude felt that fault have to pardon in have never be redeemed a fault be felt jealousy evening for first time seemed to be thrown into background in father mind there be much more talk before bedtime mr naturally wanted to hear particular of tom trading adventure listened with growing excitement delight be curious to know what have be said on occasion if possible what have be thought bob jakins part in business threw into peculiar outburst of sympathy with triumphant knowingness of remarkable packman bob juvenile history so far a have come under mr tullivers knowledge be recalled with sense of astonishing promise displayed be observable in reminiscence of childhood of great men be well that there be interest of narrative to keep under vague fierce sense of triumph over wakem must otherwise have be channel joy must have rushed into with dangerous force even a be that feeling from time to time gave threat of ultimate mastery in sudden burst of irrelevant exclamation be long before mr tulliver got to sleep night sleep when came be filled with vivid dream at half past five oclock in morning when mr tulliver be already rising alarmed by starting up with sort of smothered shout looking round in bewildered way at wall of bedroom whats matter mr tulliver said wife looked at still with puzzled expression said at last ahi be dreamingdid make noisei thought id got hold of chapter vii day of reckoning mr tulliver be essentially sober manable to take glass not averse to never exceeding bound of moderation have naturally active hotspur temperament did not crave liquid fire to set aglow impetuosity be usually equal to exciting occasion without such reinforcement desire for brandy water implied that too sudden joy have fallen with dangerous shock on frame depressed by four year of gloom unaccustomed hard fare that first doubtful tottering moment passed seemed to gather strength with gathering excitement next day when be seated at table with creditor eye kindling cheek flushed with consciousness that be about to make honourable figure once more looked more like proud confident warm hearted warm tempered tulliver of old time than might have seemed possible to one who have met week before riding along a have be wont for last four year since sense of failure debt have be upon himwith head hanging down casting brief unwilling look on who forced on notice made speech asserting honest principle with old confident eagerness alluding to rascal luck have be against that have triumphed over to extent by hard effort aid of good son winding up with story of how tom have got best part of needful money streak of irritation hostile triumph seemed to melt for little while into purer fatherly pride pleasure when tom health having be proposed uncle deane having taken occasion to say few word of eulogy on general character conduct tom got up made single speech of life must hardly have be briefer thanked gentleman for honour have done be glad that have be able to help father in proving integrity regaining honest name for own part hoped must never undo work disgrace name applause followed be so great tom looked so gentlemanly a well a tall straight that mr tulliver remarked in explanatory manner to friend on right left that have spent deal of money on son education party broke up in very sober fashion at five oclock tom remained in st oggs to attend to business mr tulliver mounted horse to go home describe memorable thing have be said done to poor bessy little wench air of excitement that hung about be faintly due to good cheer stimulus potent wine of triumphant joy did not choose back street to day rode slowly with uplifted head free glance along principal street way to bridge why did not happen to meet wakem want of coincidence vexed set mind at work in irritating way perhaps wakem be gone out of town to day on purpose to avoid seeing hearing anything of honourable action might well cause unpleasant twinge if wakem be to meet then mr tulliver must look straight at rascal must perhaps be forsaken little by cool domineering impudence must know by by honest man be not going to serve longer lend honesty to fill pocket already over full of dishonest gain perhaps luck be beginning to turn perhaps devil didnt always hold best card in world simmering in way mr tulliver approached yardgates of dorlcote mill near enough to see well known figure coming out of on fine black horse met about fifty yard from gate between great chestnut

spring from two deep note fulfilling expectation just at right moment between note of silvery soprano from perfect accord of descending third fifth from preconcerted loving chase of fugue be likely enough to supersede immediate demand for le impassioned form of agreement contralto will not care to catechise bass tenor will foresee embarrassing dearth of remark in evening spent with lovely soprano in province too where music be so scarce in remote time how must musical people avoid falling in love with other even political principle must have be in danger of relaxation under such circumstance violin faithful to rotten borough must have be tempted to fraternise in demoralizing way with reforming violoncello in case linnet throated soprano full toned bass singing with thee delight be ever new with thee be life incessant bliss believed what sang more because sang now for raphael great song said lucy when have finished duet do heavy beast to perfection sound complimentary

chiffonnier a most eligible place in small dog must await crack of doom adieu graceful consort said stephen buttoning coat across when have done singing smiling down from tall height with air of rather patronizing lover at little lady on music stool bliss be not incessant for must gallop home promised to be there at lunch will not be able to call on philip then be of consequence have said

hand momentary meeting of eye will often leave little lady with slight flush smile on face that subside immediately when door be closed with inclination to walk up down room rather than to seat quietly at embroidery other rational improving occupation at least be effect on lucy will not hope consider indication of vanity predominating over more tender impulse that just glanced in chimney glass a walk brought near desire to know one have not looked absolute fright during few hour of conversation may be construed a lying within bound of laudable benevolent consideration for others lucy have so much of benevolence in nature that be inclined to think small egoism be impregnated with just a there be people not altogether unknown to whose small benevolence have predominant somewhat rank odor of egoism even now that be walking up down with little triumphant flutter of girlish heart at sense that be loved by person of chief consequence in small world may see in hazel eye ever present sunny benignity in momentary harmless flash of personal vanity be quite lost if be happy in thinking of lover be because thought of mingles readily with gentle affection good natured office with fill peaceful day even now mind with instantaneous alternation make two current of feeling imagination seem simultaneous be glancing continually from stephen to preparation have only half finished in maggies room cousin maggie must be treated a well a grandest lady visitornay better for must have lucy best print drawing in bedroom very finest bouquet of spring flower on table maggie must enjoy

man must not be likely to repent of marryinga woman who be loving thoughtful for other woman not giving juda kiss with eye askance on welcome defect with real care vision for half hidden pain mortification with long ruminating enjoyment of little pleasure prepared for perhaps emphasis of admiration did not fall precisely on rarest quality in perhaps approved own choice of chiefly because did not strike a remarkable rarity man like wife to be pretty well lucy be pretty not to maddening extent man like wife to be accomplished gentle affectionate not stupid lucy have qualification stephen be not surprised to find in love with be conscious of excellent judgment in preferring to miss leyburn daughter of county member although lucy be only daughter of father subordinate partner besides have have to defy overcome slight unwillingness disappointment in father sistersa circumstance give young man agreeable consciousness of own dignity stephen be aware that have sense independence enough to choose wife who be likely to make happy unbiassed by indirect consideration meant to choose lucy be little darling exactly sort of woman have always admired chapter ii first impression be very clever maggie said lucy be kneeling on footstool at maggies foot after placing that dark lady in large crimson velvet chair feel sure will like hope will will be very difficult to please said maggie smiling holding up one of lucy long curl that sunlight might shine through gentleman who think be good enough for lucy must expect to be sharply criticised indeed he great deal too good for sometimes when be away almost think cant really be that love can never doubt when be with though couldnt bear one to know feel in way maggie oh then if disapprove of can give up since be not engaged said maggie with playful gravity must rather not be engaged when people be engaged begin to think of being married soon said lucy too thoroughly preoccupied to notice maggies joke must like everything to go on for long while just a be sometimes be quite frightened lest stephen must say that have spoken to papa from something fell from papa other day feel sure mr guest be expecting that stephen sister be very civil to now at first think didnt like paying attention be natural doe seem out of keeping must ever live in great place like park house little insignificant thing a be people be not expected to be large in proportion to house live in like snail said maggie laughing pray be mr guest sister giantess oh not handsomethat be not very said lucy half penitent at uncharitable remark isat least be generally considered very handsome though be unable to share that opinion oh dont know said lucy blushing pink over brow neck be bad plan to raise expectation will perhaps be disappointed have prepared charming surprise for will have glorious laugh against will not tell what be though lucy rose from knee went to little distance holding pretty head on one side a if have be arranging maggie for portrait wished to judge of general effect stand up moment maggie what be pleasure now said maggie smiling languidly a rose from chair looked down on slight aerial cousin whose figure be quite subordinate to faultless drapery of silk crape lucy kept contemplative attitude moment two in silence then said cant think what witchery be in maggie that make look best in shabby clothes though really must have new dress now do know last night be trying to fancy in handsome fashionable dress do what must old limp merino must come back a only right thing for wonder if marie antoinette looked grander when gown be darned at elbow now if be to put anything shabby on must be quite unnoticeable must be mere rag oh quite said maggie with mock gravity must be liable to be swept out of room with cobweb carpet dust to find under grate like cinderella maynt sit down now yes now may said lucy laughing then with air of serious reflection unfastening large jet brooch must change brooch maggie little butterfly look silly on wont mar charming effect of consistent shabbiness said maggie seating submissively while lucy knelt again unfastened contemptible butterfly wish mother be of opinion for be fretting last night because be best frock ive be saving money to pay for lesson will never get better situation without more accomplishment maggie gave little sigh now dont put on sad look again said lucy pinning large brooch below maggies fine throat youre forgetting that youve left that dreary schoolroom behind have little girl clothes to mend yes said maggie be with a used to think must be with poor uneasy white bear saw at show thought must have got so stupid with habit of turning backward forward in narrow space that must keep doing if set free one get bad habit of being unhappy will put under discipline of pleasure will make lose that bad habit said lucy sticking black butterfly absently in own collar while eye met maggies affectionately dear tiny thing said maggie in one of burst of loving admiration enjoy other people happiness so much believe must do without of own wish be like ive never be tried in way said lucy ive always be so happy dont know whether must bear much trouble never have poor mamma death have be tried maggie im sure feel for other people quite a much a do lucy said maggie shaking head slowly dont enjoy happiness a do else must be more contented do feel for when be in trouble dont think must ever bear to make one unhappy yet often hate because get angry sometimes at sight of happy people think get worse a get older more selfish that seems very dreadful now maggie said lucy in tone of remonstrance dont believe word of that be gloomy fancy just because be depressed by dull wearisome life well perhaps be said maggie resolutely clearing away cloud from face with bright smile throwing backward in chair perhaps come from school dietwatery rice pudding spiced with pinnock let hope will give way before mother custard charming geoffrey crayon maggie took up sketch book lay by on table do look fit to be seen with little brooch said lucy going to survey effect in chimney glass oh mr guest will be obliged to go out of room again if see in pray make haste put on lucy hurried out of room maggie did not take opportunity of opening book let fall on knee while eye wandered to window where must see sunshine falling on rich clump of spring flower on long hedge of laurel beyond silvery breadth of dear old floss at distance seemed to be sleeping in morning holiday sweet fresh garden scent came through open window bird be busy flitting alighting gurgling singing yet maggies eye began to fill with tear sight of old scene have made rush of memory so painful that even yesterday have only be able to rejoice in mother restored comfort tom brotherly friendliness a rejoice in good news of friend at distance rather than in presence of happiness share memory imagination urged upon sense of privation too keen to let taste what be offered in transient present future thought be likely to be worse than past for after year of contented renunciation have slipped back into desire longing found joyless day of distasteful occupation harder harder found image of intense varied life yearned for despaired of becoming more more importunate sound of opening door roused hastily wiping away tear began to turn over leaf of book there be one pleasure know maggie that deepest dismalness will never resist said lucy beginning to speak a soon a entered room be music mean to have quite riotous feast of mean to get up playing again used to be so much better than mine when be at laceham must have laughed to see playing little girl tune over over to when took to practise said maggie just for sake of fingering dear key again dont know whether must play anything more difficult now than begone dull care know what wild state of joy used to be in when glee men came round said lucy taking up embroidery might have old glee that used to love so if be certain that dont feel exactly a tom doe about thing must have thought there be nothing might be more certain of said maggie smiling ought rather to have said one particular thing because if feel just a doe about that will want third voice st oggs be so miserably provided with musical gentleman there be really only stephen philip wakem who have knowledge of music so a to be able to sing part lucy have looked up from work a uttered last sentence saw that there be change in maggies face doe hurt to hear name mentioned maggie if doe will not speak of again know tom will not see if can avoid dont feel at a tom doe on subject said maggie rising going to window a if wanted to see more of landscape ive always liked philip wakem ever since be little girl saw at lorton be so good when tom hurt foot oh im so glad said lucy then wont mind coming sometimes can have much more music than must without im very fond of poor philip only wish be not so morbid about deformity suppose be deformity make so sad sometimes bitter be certainly very piteous to see poor little crooked body pale face among great strong people lucy said maggie trying to arrest prattling stream ah there be door bell must be stephen lucy went on not noticing maggies faint effort to speak one of thing most admire in stephen be that make greater friend of philip than one be too late for maggie to speak now drawingroom door be opening minny be already growling in small way at entrance of tall gentleman who went up to lucy took hand with half polite half tender glance tone of inquiry seemed to indicate that be unconscious of other presence let introduce to cousin miss tulliver said lucy turning with wicked enjoyment toward maggie who now approached from farther window be mr stephen guest for one instant stephen must not conceal astonishment at sight of tall dark eyed nymph with jet black coronet of hair next maggie felt for first time in life receiving tribute of very deep blush very deep bow from person toward whom be conscious of timidity new experience be very agreeable to so agreeable that almost effaced previous emotion about philip there be new brightness in eye very becoming flush on cheek a seated hope perceive what striking likeness drew day before yesterday said lucy with pretty laugh of triumph enjoyed lover confusion advantage be usually on side designing cousin of yours quite deceived miss tulliver said stephen seating by lucy stooping to play with minny only looking at maggie furtively said have light hair blue eye nay be who said so remonstrated lucy only refrained from destroying confidence in own second sight wish must always err in same way said stephen find reality so much more beautiful than preconception now have proved equal to occasion said maggie said what be incumbent on to say under circumstance flashed slightly defiant look at be clear to that have be drawing satirical portrait of beforehand lucy have said be inclined to be satirical maggie have mentally supplied addition rather conceited alarming amount of devil there be stephen first thought second when have bent over work be wish must look at again next be to answer suppose phrase of mere compliment have turn to be true man be occasionally grateful when say thank rather hard upon that must use same word with world decline disagreeable invitation dont think so miss tulliver said maggie looking at with direct glance if use common word on great occasion be more striking because be felt at once to have particular meaning like old banner everyday clothes hung up in sacred place then compliment ought to be eloquent said stephen really not quite knowing what said while maggie looked at seeing that word be so far beneath occasion compliment can be eloquent except a expression of indifference said maggie flushing little lucy be rather alarmed thought stephen maggie be not going to like other have always feared lest maggie must appear too old clever to please critical gentleman why dear maggie interposed have always pretended that be too fond of being admired now think be angry because one venture to admire not at said maggie like too well to feel that be admired compliment never make feel will never pay compliment again miss tulliver said stephen thank will be proof of respect poor maggie be so unused to society that must take nothing a matter of course have never in life spoken from lip merely so that must necessarily appear absurd to more experienced lady from excessive feeling be apt to throw into very trivial incident be even conscious herself of little absurdity in instance be true have theoretic objection to compliment have once said impatiently to philip that didnt see why woman be to be told with simper that be beautiful more than old men be to be told that be venerable still to be so irritated by common practice in case of stranger like mr stephen guest to care about having spoken slightingly of before have seen be certainly unreasonable a soon a be silent began to be ashamed of did not occur to that irritation be due to pleasanter emotion preceded just a when be satisfied with sense of glowing innocent drop of cold water may fall upon a sudden smart stephen be too well bred not to seem unaware that previous conversation must have be felt embarrassing at once began to talk of impersonal matter asking lucy if knew when bazaar be at length to take place so that there might be hope of seeing rain influence of eye on object more grateful than worsted flower be growing under finger day next month believe said lucy sister be doing more for than be be to have largest stall ah yes carry on manufacture in own sitting room where dont intrude on see be not addicted to fashionable vice of fancy work miss tulliver said stephen looking at maggies plain hemming said maggie can hing more difficult more elegant than shirt making plain sewing be so beautiful maggie said lucy that think will beg few specimen of to show a fancy work exquisite sewing be quite mystery to used to dislike sort of work so much in old day be mystery easily explained dear said maggie looking up quietly plain sewing be only thing must get money by so be obliged to try do well lucy good simple a be must not help blushing little did not quite like stephen must know that maggie need not have mentioned perhaps there be pride in confessionthe pride of poverty will not be ashamed of if maggie have be queen of coquette must hardly have invented mean of giving greater piquancy to beauty in stephen eye be not sure that quiet admission of plain sewing poverty must have done alone assisted by beauty made maggie more unlike other woman even than have seemed at first can knit lucy maggie went on if will be of use for bazaar oh yes of infinite use will set to work with scarlet wool to morrow sister be most enviable person continued lucy turning to stephen to have talent of modelling be doing wonderful bust of dr kenn entirely from memory why if can remember to put eye very near together corner of mouth very far apart likeness can hardly fail to be striking in st oggs now be very wicked of said lucy looking rather hurt didnt think must speak disrespectfully of dr kenn say anything disrespectful of dr kenn heaven forbid be not bound to respect libellous bust of think kenn one of finest fellow in world dont care much about tall candlestick have put on communion table shouldnt like to spoil temper by getting up to early prayer morning he only man ever knew personally who seems to to have anything of real apostle in hima man who have eight hundred year be contented with deal furniture boiled beef because give away two third of income be very fine thing of himtaking into house that poor lad grattan who shot mother by accident sacrifice more time than le busy man must spare to save poor fellow from getting into morbid state of mind about take lad out with constantly see be beautiful said maggie who have let work fall be listening with keen interest never knew one who did such thing one admires that sort of action in kenn more said stephen because manner in general be rather cold severe there nothing sugary maudlin about oh think he perfect character said lucy with pretty enthusiasm there cant agree with said stephen shaking head with sarcastic gravity now what fault can point out in he anglican well be right view think said lucy gravely that settle question in abstract said stephen not from parliamentary point of view have set dissenter church people by ear rising senator like myself of whose service country be very much in need will find inconvenient when put up for honour of representing st oggs in parliament do really think of said lucy eye brightening with proud pleasure made neglect argumentative interest of anglicanism decidedly whenever old mr leyburns public spirit gout induce to give way father heart be set on gift like mine knowhere stephen drew up rubbed large white hand over hair with playful self admirationgifts like mine involve great responsibility dont think so miss tulliver yes said maggie smiling not looking up so much fluency self possession must not be wasted entirely on private occasion ah see how much penetration have said stephen have discovered already that be talkative impudent now superficial people never discern that owing to manner suppose doesnt look at when talk of myself thought while listener be laughing must try other subject did lucy intend to be present at meeting of book club next week be next question then followed recommendation to choose southey life of cowper unless be inclined to be philosophical startle lady of st oggs by voting for one of bridgewater treatise of course lucy wished to know what alarmingly learned book be a be always pleasant to improve mind of lady by talking to at ease on subject of know nothing stephen became quite brilliant in account of bucklands treatise have just be reading be rewarded by seeing maggie let work fall gradually get so absorbed in wonderful geological story that sat looking at leaning forward with crossed arm with entire absence of self consciousness a if have be snuffiest of old professor downy lipped alumna be so fascinated by clear large gaze at last forgot to look away from occasionally toward lucy sweet child be only rejoicing that stephen be proving to maggie how clever be that must certainly be good friend after will bring book will miss tulliver said stephen when found stream of recollection running rather willow there be many illustration in that will like to see oh thank said maggie blushing with returning self consciousness at direct address taking up work again lucy interposed must forbid plunging maggie in book will never get away from want to have delicious hing day filled with boating chatting riding driving be holiday need apropos said stephen looking at watch will go out for row on river now tide will suit for to tofton way can walk back be delightful proposition to maggie for be year since have be on river when be gone to put on bonnet lucy lingered to give order to servant took opportunity of telling stephen maggie have objection to seeing philip so that be pity have sent that note day before yesterday must write to morrow invite ill call beat up to morrow said stephen bring with in evening will sister will want to call on when tell cousin be with must leave field clear for in morning oh yes pray bring said lucy will like maggie shant added in beseeching tone isnt dear noble looking creature too tall said stephen smiling down upon little too fiery be not type of woman know gentleman be aware be apt to impart imprudent confidence to lady concerning unfavourable opinion of sister fair one be why so many woman have advantage of knowing that be secretly repulsive to men who have self denyingly made ardent love to hardly anything must be more distinctively characteristic of lucy than implicitly believed what stephen said be determined that maggie must not know who have higher logic than verbal to guide have already foreseen a direct sequence to unfavourable opinion of stephen that walked down to boathouse calculating by aid of vivid imagination that maggie must give hand at least twice in consequence of pleasant boating plan that gentleman who wish lady to look at be advantageously situated when be rowing in boat what then have fallen in love with surprising daughter of mr tulliver at first sight certainly not such passion be never heard of in real life besides

tell at once what came about else will be hindering from taking dinner tom stood with back against chimney piece maggie be seated opposite light noticed that be tremulous have presentiment of subject be going to speak about presentiment made voice colder harder a said what be tone roused spirit of resistance in maggie put request in quite different form from one have predetermined on rose from seat looking straight at tom said want to absolve from promise about philip wakem rather promised not to see without telling be come to tell wish to see very well said tom still more coldly have hardly finished speaking in chill defiant manner before repented felt dread of alienation from brother not for dear tom dont be angry shouldnt have asked only that philip know be friend of lucy wish to come have invited to come evening told couldnt see without telling will only see in presence of other people there will never be anything secret between again tom looked away from maggie knitting brow more strongly for little while then turned to said slowly emphatically know what be feeling on subject maggie there be need for repeating anything said year ago while father be living felt bound to use utmost power over to prevent from disgracing a well a of now must leave to own choice wish to be independent told so after father death opinion be not changed if think of philip wakem a lover

will say that tom be very hard of have not done borne everything a well a must kept word to youwhenwhenmy life have not be happy one more than yours be obliged to be childish tear must come when maggie be not angry be a dependent on kind cold word a daisy on sunshine cloud need of being loved must always subdue a in old day subdued in worm eaten attic brother goodness came uppermost at appeal must only show in tom fashion put hand gently on arm said in tone of kind pedagogue now listen to maggie ill tell what mean youre always in extreme have judgment self command yet think know best will not submit to be guided know didnt wish to take situation aunt pullet be willing to give good home might have lived respectably amongst relation until must have provided home for with mother be what must like to do wished sister to be lady always have taken care of a father desired until be well married idea mine never accord will not give way yet might have sense enough to see that brother who go out into world mix with men necessarily know better what be right respectable for sister than can know think be not kind kindness can only be directed by what believe to be good for yes know dear tom said maggie still half sobbing trying to control tear know must do great deal for know how work dont spare be grateful to indeed cant quite judge for nature be very different dont know how differently thing affect from what do yes do know know too well know how differently must feel about affect family own dignity a young woman before must think of receiving secret address from philip wakem if be not disgusting to in other way must object to sister name being associated for moment with of young man whose father must hate very thought of must spurn with one must think quite certain that what witnessed just before father death must secure from ever thinking again of philip wakem a lover dont feel certain of with never feel certain about anything with at one time take pleasure in sort of perverse self denial at have not resolution to resist thing that know to be wrong there be terrible cutting truth in tom hard rind of truth be discerned by unimaginative unsympathetic mind maggie always writhed under judgment of tom rebelled be humiliated in same moment seemed a if held glass before to show own folly weakness a if be prophetic voice predicting future fallings yet while judged in return said inwardly that be narrow unjust that be below feeling mental need be often source of wrong doing absurdity that made life planless riddle to did not answer directly heart be too full sat down leaning arm on table be use trying to make tom feel that be near to always repelled feeling under word be complicated by allusion to last scene between father wakem at length painful solemn memory surmounted immediate grievance did not think of such thing with frivolous indifference tom must not accuse of looked up at with grave earnest gaze said cant make think better of tom by anything can say be not so shut out from feeling a believe to be see a well a do that from position with regard to philip fathernot on other groundsit must be unreasonable must be wrong for to entertain idea of marriage have given up thinking of a lover be telling truth have right to disbelieve have kept word to have never detected in falsehood must not only not encourage must carefully avoid intercourse with philip on other footing than of quiet friendship may think that be unable to keep resolution at least ought not to treat with hard contempt on ground of fault have not committed yet well maggie said tom softening under appeal dont want to overstrain matter think thing considered will be best for to see philip wakem if lucy wish to come to house believe what sayat least believe know can only warn wish to be a good brother to a will let there be little tremor in tom voice a uttered last word maggies ready affection came back with a sudden glow a when be child bit cake together a sacrament of conciliation rose laid hand on tom shoulder dear tom know mean to be good know have have great deal to bear have done great deal must like to be comfort to not to vex dont think im altogether naughty now do tom smiled at eager face smile be very pleasant to see when did come for gray eye must be tender underneath frown maggie may turn out better than expect hope will may come day make tea for see extremely small wife of bob again yes trot away now for ive more time to spare said tom looking at watch not to give kiss tom bent to kiss cheek then said there be good girl ive got great deal to think of to day im going to have long consultation with uncle deane afternoon youll come to aunt gleggs to morrow be going to dine early that may go there to tea must come lucy told to say so oh pooh ive plenty else to do said tom pulling bell violently bringing down small bell rope im frightened will run away said maggie making laughing retreat while tom with masculine philosophy flung bell rope to farther end of room not very far eithera touch of human experience flatter will come home to bosom of not few substantial distinguished men who be once at early stage of rise in world be cherishing very large hope in very small lodging chapter v showing that tom have opened oyster now weve settled newcastle business tom said mr deane same afternoon a be seated in private room at bank together there matter want to talk to about since youre likely to have rather smoky unpleasant time of at newcastle for next few week youll want good prospect of sort to keep up spirit tom waited le nervously than have done on former occasion in apartment while uncle took out snuff box gratified nostril with deliberate impartiality see tom said mr deane at last throwing backward world go on at smarter pace now than did when be young fellow why sir forty year ago when be much such strapping youngster a man expected to pull between shaft best part of life before got whip in hand loom went slowish fashion didnt alter quite so fast id best suit lasted six year everything be on lower scale sirin point of expenditure mean steam see have made difference drive on wheel double pace wheel of fortune along with em a mr stephen guest said at anniversary dinner hit thing off wonderfully considering he seen nothing of business dont find fault with change a people do trade sir open man eye if population be to get thicker upon ground a doing world must use wit at invention of one sort other know ive done share a ordinary man of business somebody have said fine thing to make two ear of corn grow where only one grew before sir fine thing too to further exchange of commodity bring grain of corn to mouth be hungry thats line of business consider a honourable position a man can hold to be connected with tom knew that affair uncle have to speak of be not urgent mr deane be too shrewd practical man to allow reminiscence snuff to impede progress of trade indeed for last month two there have be hint thrown out to tom enabled to guess that be going to hear proposition for own benefit with beginning of last speech have stretched out leg thrust hand in pocket prepared for introductory diffuseness tending to show that mr deane have succeeded by own merit that what have to say to young men in general be that if didnt succeed too be because of own demerit be rather surprised then when uncle put direct question to let seeits going on for seven year now since applied to for situation eh tom yes sir im three twenty now said tom ah a well not to say that though for youd pas for good deal older age tell well in business remember coming very well remember saw there be pluck in be what made give encouragement im happy to say be right im not often deceived be

with in opinion of what have to do with a partner in firm be quality youve shown a man o business ours be fine businessa splendid concern sirand there reason why shouldnt go on growing there growing capital growing outlet for there thing thats wanted for prosperity of concern large small thats men to conduct itmen of right habit none o flashy fellow such a be to be depended on now be what mr guest see clear enough three year ago took gell into concern gave share in oil mill why why because gell be fellow whose service be worth premium so will always be sir so be with though gell be pretty near ten year older than there be other point in favour tom be getting little nervous a mr deane went on speaking be conscious of something have in mind to say might not be agreeable to uncle simply because be new suggestion rather than acceptance of proposition foresaw stand to reason mr deane went on when have finished new pinch that being nephew weighs in favour dont deny that if youd be relation of mine at conduct in affair of pelleys bank must have led mr guest to make acknowledgment of service youve be to backed by general conduct business ability have made determine on giving share in businessa share will be glad to increase a year go on think thatll be better on ground than raising salary itll give more importance prepare better for taking of anxiety off shoulder by by im equal to good deal o work at present thank god im getting oldertheres denying that told mr guest must open subject to when come back from northern business can go into particular be great stride for young fellow of three twenty im bound to say youve deserved im very grateful to mr guest sir of course feel most indebted to who first took into business have taken good deal of pain with since tom spoke with slight tremor paused after have said yes yes said mr deane dont spare pain when see theyll be of use gave trouble with gell else wouldnt have be what be there one thing must like to mention to uncle ive never spoken to of before if remember at time father property be sold there be thought of firm buying mill know thought must be very good investment especially if steam be applied to be sure to be sure wakem outbid hed made up mind to he rather fond of carrying everything over other people head perhaps of use mentioning at present tom went on wish to know what have in mind about mill ive strong feeling about be father dying wish must try get back again whenever must be in family for five generation promised father besides that im attached to place will never like other so well if must ever suit view to buy for firm must have better chance of fulfilling father wish shouldnt have liked to mention thing to only youve be kind enough to say service have be of value id give up much greater chance in life for sake of having mill againi mean having in own hand gradually working off price mr deane have listened attentively now looked thoughtful see see said after while thing must be possible if there be chance of wakems parting with property dont see he put that young jetsome in place have reason when bought ill be bound he loose fish that young jetsome said tom he taking to drinking say he letting business go down luke told about itour old miller say shant stay unless there alteration be thinking if thing went on way wakem might be more willing to part with mill luke say he getting very sour about way thing be going on well ill turn over tom must inquire into matter go into with mr guest see rather striking out new branch putting to instead of keeping where be be what wed wanted must be able to manage more than mill when thing be once set properly going sir want to have plenty of work there nothing else care about much there be something rather sad in speech from young man of three twenty even in uncle deanes business loving ear pooh pooh youll be having wife to care about one of day if get on at pace in world a to mill mustnt reckon on chicken too early however promise to bear in mind when come back well talk of again be going to dinner now come breakfast with to morrow morning say good bye to mother sister before start chapter vi illustrating law of attraction be evident to now that maggie have arrived at moment in life must be considered by prudent person a great opportunity for young woman launched into higher society of st oggs with striking person have advantage of being quite unfamiliar to majority of beholder with such moderate assistance of costume a have seen foreshadowed in lucy anxious colloquy with aunt pullet maggie be certainly at new starting point in life at lucy first evening party young torry fatigued facial muscle more than usual in order that dark eyed girl there in corner might see in additional style conferred by eyeglass several young lady went home intending to have short sleeve with black lace to plait hair in broad coronet at back of cousin of miss deanes looked so very well in fact poor maggie with inward consciousness of painful past presentiment of troublous future be on way to become object of envya topic of discussion in newly established billiard room between fair friend who have secret from other on subject of trimming miss guest who associated chiefly on term of condescension with family of st oggs be glass of fashion there took exception to maggies manner have way of not assenting at once to observation current in good society of saying that didnt know whether observation be true not gave air of gaucherie impeded even flow of conversation be fact capable of amiable interpretation that lady be not worst disposed toward new acquaintance of own sex because have point of inferiority maggie be so entirely without pretty air of coquetry have traditional reputation of driving gentleman to despair that won feminine pity for being so ineffective in spite of beauty have not have many advantage poor thing must be admitted there be pretension about abruptness unevenness of manner be plainly result of secluded lowly circumstance be only wonder that there be tinge of vulgarity about considering what rest of poor lucy relation werean allusion always made miss guest shudder little be not agreeable to think of connection by marriage with such people a gleggs pullet be of use to contradict stephen when once have set mind on anything certainly there be possible objection to lucy in herselfno one must help liking must naturally desire that miss guest must behave kindly to cousin of whom be so fond stephen must make great fuss if be deficient in civility under circumstance invitation to park house be not wanting elsewhere also miss deane be too popular too distinguished member of society in st oggs for attention toward to be neglected thus maggie be introduced for first time to young lady life knew what be to get up in morning without imperative reason for doing one thing more than new sense of leisure unchecked enjoyment amidst soft breathing air garden scent of advancing new abundance of music lingering stroll in sunshine delicious dreaminess of gliding on rivercould hardly be without intoxicating effect on after year of privation even in first week maggie began to be le haunted by sad memory anticipation life be certainly very pleasant just now be becoming very pleasant to dress in evening to feel that be one of beautiful thing of spring time there be admiring eye always awaiting now be no longer unheeded person liable to be chid from whom attention be continually claimed on whom one felt bound to confer be pleasant too when stephen lucy be gone out riding to sit down at piano alone find that old fitness between finger key remained revived like sympathetic kinship not to be worn out by separation to get tune have heard evening before repeat again again until have found out way of producing so a to make more pregnant passionate language to mere concord of octave be delight to maggie must often take up book of study rather than melody that might taste more keenly by abstraction more primitive sensation of interval not that enjoyment of music be of kind indicates great specific talent be rather that sensibility to supreme excitement of music be only one form of passionate sensibility belonged to whole nature made fault virtue merge in other made affection sometimes impatient demand also prevented vanity from taking form of mere feminine coquetry device gave poetry of ambition have known maggie long while need to be told not characteristic history be thing hardly to be predicted even from completest knowledge of characteristic for tragedy of life be not created entirely from within character say novalis in one of questionable aphorismscharacter be destiny not whole of destiny hamlet prince of denmark be speculative irresolute have great tragedy in consequence if father have lived to good old age uncle have died early death can conceive hamlet having married ophelia got through life with reputation of sanity notwithstanding many soliloquy moody sarcasm toward fair daughter of polonius to say nothing of frankest incivility to father in law maggies destiny then be at present hidden must wait for to reveal like course of unmapped river only know that river be full rapid for river there be same final home under charm of new pleasure maggie be ceasing to think with eager prefiguring imagination of future lot anxiety about first interview with philip be losing predominance perhaps unconsciously to herself be not sorry that interview have be deferred for philip have not come evening be expected mr stephen guest brought word that be gone to coastprobably thought on sketching expedition be not certain when must return be just like philip to go off in way without telling one be not until twelfth day that returned to find lucy note awaiting have left before knew of maggies arrival perhaps one have need be nineteen again to be quite convinced of feeling be crowded for maggie into twelve day of length to be stretched for by novelty of experience in varying attitude of mind early day of acquaintance almost always have importance for fill up larger space in memory than longer subsequent period have be le filled with discovery new impression there be not many hour in ten day in mr stephen guest be not seated by lucy side standing near at piano accompanying on outdoor excursion attention be clearly becoming more assiduous be what one have expected lucy be very happy happier because stephen society seemed to have become much more interesting amusing since maggie have be there playful discussionssometimes serious oneswere going forward in stephen maggie revealed to admiration of gentle unobtrusive lucy more than once crossed mind what charming quartet must have through life when maggie married philip be inexplicable thing that girl must enjoy lover society more for presence of third person be without slightest spasm of jealousy that third person have conversation habitually directed to not when girl be a tranquil hearted a lucy thoroughly possessed with belief that know state of companion affection not prone to feeling shake belief in absence of positive evidence against besides be lucy by whom stephen sat to whom gave arm to whom appealed a person sure to agree with day there be same tender politeness toward same consciousness of want care to supply be there really same seemed to lucy that there be more be wonder that real significance of change escaped be subtle act of conscience in stephen that even be not aware of personal attention to maggie be comparatively slight there have even sprung up apparent distance between prevented renewal of faint resemblance to gallantry into have fallen first day in boat if stephen came in when lucy be out of room if lucy left together never spoke to other stephen perhaps seemed to be examining book music maggie bent head assiduously over work be oppressively conscious of others presence even to finger end yet looked longed for same thing to happen next day of have begun to reflect on matter silently to ask to what doe tend maggie only felt that life be revealing something quite new to be absorbed in direct immediate experience without energy left for taking account of reasoning about stephen wilfully abstained from self questioning must not admit to that felt influence be to have determining effect on conduct when lucy came into room again be once more unconstrained maggie must contradict stephen laugh at must recommend to consideration example of most charming heroine miss sophia western who have great respect for understanding of men maggie must look at stephen for reason other always avoided when be alone must even ask to play accompaniment for since lucy finger be so busy with bazaar work lecture on hurrying tempo be certainly maggies weak point one dayit be day of philip returnlucy have formed sudden engagement to spend evening with mr kenn whose delicate state of health threatening to become confirmed illness through attack of bronchitis obliged to resign function at coming bazaar into hand of other lady of whom wished lucy to be one engagement have be formed in stephen presence have heard lucy promise to dine early call at six oclock for miss torry who brought mr kenns request here be of moral result of idiotic bazaar stephen burst forth a soon a miss torry have left roomtaking young lady from duty of domestic hearth into scene of dissipation among urn rug embroidered reticule must like to know what be proper function of woman if be not to make reason for husband to stay at home still stronger reason for bachelor to go out if go on much longer bond of society will be dissolved well will not go on much longer said lucy laughing for bazaar be to take place on monday week thank heaven said stephen kenn said other day that didnt like plan of making vanity do work of charity just a british public be not reasonable enough to bear direct taxation so st oggs have not got force of motive enough to build endow school without calling in force of folly did say so said little lucy hazel eye opening wide with anxiety never heard say anything of kind thought approved of what be doing im sure approves said stephen smiling at affectionately conduct in going out to night look vicious own know there be benevolence at bottom of oh think too well of said lucy shaking head with pretty blush there subject ended be tacitly understood that stephen must not come in evening on strength of tacit understanding made morning visit longer not saying good bye until after four maggie be seated in drawing room alone shortly after dinner with minny on lap having left uncle to wine nap mother to compromise between knitting nodding when there be company always carried on in dining room till tea time maggie be stooping to caress tiny silken pet comforting for mistress absence when sound of footstep on gravel made look up saw mr stephen guest walking up garden a if have come straight from river be very unusual to see so soon after dinner often complained that dinner hour be late at park house nevertheless there be in black dress have evidently be home must have come again by river maggie felt cheek glowing heart beating be natural must be nervous for be not accustomed to receive visitor alone have seen look up through open window raised hat a walked toward to enter way instead of by door blushed too certainly looked a foolish a young man of wit self possession can be expected to look a walked in with roll of music in hand said with air of hesitating improvisation be surprised to see again miss tulliver ought to apologise for coming upon by surprise wanted to come into town got man to row so thought must bring thing from maid of artois for cousin forgot morning will give to yes said maggie who have risen confusedly with minny in arm now not quite knowing what else to do sat down again stephen laid down hat with music rolled on floor sat down in chair close by have never done so before maggie be quite aware that be entirely new position well pampered minion said stephen leaning to pull long curly ear drooped over maggies arm be not suggestive remark a speaker did not follow up by further development naturally left conversation at standstill seemed to stephen like action in dream that be obliged to do wonder at whileto go on stroking minnys head yet be very pleasant only wished dared look at maggie that must look at himlet have one long look into deep strange eye of hers then must be satisfied quite reasonable after that thought be becoming sort of monomania with to want that long look from maggie be racking invention continually to find out mean by must have without appearing singular entailing subsequent embarrassment a for maggie have distinct thought only sense of presence like of closely hovering broad winged bird in darkness for be unable to look up saw nothing minnys black wavy coat must end time perhaps ended very soon only seemed long a minute dream doe stephen at last sat upright sideways in chair leaning one hand arm over back looking at maggie what must say will have splendid sunset think shant go out see dont know said maggie then courageously raising eye looking out of window if im not playing cribbage with uncle pause during minny be stroked again have sufficient insight not to be grateful for to growl rather do like sitting alone rather arch look came over maggies face just glancing at stephen said must be quite civil to say yes be rather dangerous question for intruder to ask said stephen delighted with glance getting determined to stay for will have more than hour to yourself after be gone added taking out watch know mr deane never come in till half past seven pause during maggie looked steadily out of window till by great effort moved head to look down at minnys back again said wish lucy have not be obliged to go out lose music will have new voice to morrow night said stephen will tell cousin that friend philip wakem be come back saw a went home maggie gave little startit seemed hardly more than vibration passed from head to foot in instant new image summoned by philip name dispersed oppressive spell have be under rose from chair with sudden resolution laying minny on cushion went to reach lucy large work basket from corner stephen be vexed disappointed thought perhaps maggie didnt like name of wakem to be mentioned to in abrupt way for now recalled what lucy have told of family quarrel be of use to stay longer maggie be seating at table with work looking chill proud hehe looked like simpleton for having come gratuitous entirely superfluous visit of sort be sure to make man disagreeable ridiculous of course be palpable to maggies thinking that have dined hastily in own room for sake of setting off again finding alone boyish state of mind for accomplished young gentleman of five twenty not without legal knowledge reference to history perhaps may make not incredible at moment maggies ball of knitting wool rolled along ground started up to reach stephen rose too picking up ball met with vexed complaining look gave eye quite new expression to maggie whose own eye met a presented ball to good bye said stephen in tone have same beseeching discontent a eye dared not put out hand thrust hand into tail pocket a spoke maggie thought have perhaps be rude wont stay said timidly not looking away for must have seemed rude again thank said stephen looking still into half unwilling half fascinated eye a thirsty man look toward track of distant brook boat be waiting for youll tell cousin yes brought music mean yes philip be come back yes maggie did not notice philip name time wont come out little way into garden said stephen in still gentler tone next moment be vexed that did not say for moved away now toward open window be obliged to take hat walk by side thought of something to make amends do take arm said in low tone a if be secret there be something strangely winning to most woman in offer of firm arm help be not wanted physically at moment sense of help presence of strength be outside yet theirs meet continual want of imagination on ground other maggie took arm walked together round grassplot under drooping green of laburnum in same dim dreamy state a have be in quarter of hour before only that stephen have have look longed for without yet perceiving in symptom of returning reasonableness maggie have darting thought across dimnesshow came to be there why have come out not word be spoken if have be must have be le intensely conscious of other take care of step said stephen at last oh will go in now said maggie feeling that step have come like rescue good evening in instant have withdrawn arm be running back to house did not reflect that sudden action must only add to embarrassing recollection of last half hour have thought left for only threw into low arm chair burst into tear oh philip philip wish be together againso quietlyin red deep stephen looked after moment then went on to boat be soon landed at wharf spent evening in billiard room smoking one cigar after losing life at pool must not leave off be determined not to thinknot to admit more distinct remembrance than be urged upon by perpetual presence of maggie be looking at be on arm there came necessity of walking home in cool starlight with necessity of cursing own folly bitterly determining that must never trust alone with maggie again be madness be in love thoroughly attached to lucy engagedengaged a strongly a honourable man need be wished have never seen maggie tulliver to be thrown into fever by in way must make sweet strange troublesome adorable wife to man other must never have chosen did feel a did hoped didnot ought not to have gone must master in future must make disagreeable to quarrel with perhaps quarrel with be possible to quarrel with creature who have such eyesdefying deprecating contradicting clinging imperious beseechingfull of delicious opposite to see such creature subdued by love for one must be lot worth havingto man there be muttered exclamation ended inward soliloquy a stephen threw away end of last cigar thrusting hand into pocket stalked along at quieter pace through shrubbery be not of benedictory kind chapter vii philip re enters next morning be very wetthe sort of morning on male neighbour who have imperative occupation at home be likely to pay fair friend illimitable visit rain have be endurable enough for walk ride one way be sure to become so heavy at same time so certain to clear up by by nothing open quarrel can abbreviate visit latent detestation will not do at if people happen to be lover what can be so delightful in england a rainy morning english sunshine be dubious bonnet be never quite secure if sit down on grass may lead to catarrh rain be to be depended on gallop through in mackintosh presently find in seat like besta little above little below one on goddess sits be same thing to metaphysical mind be reason why woman be at once worshipped looked down upon with satisfactory confidence that there will be lady caller stephen will come earlier morning know said lucy always doe when rainy maggie made answer be angry with stephen began to think must dislike if have not be for rain must have gone to aunt gleggs morning so have avoided altogether a be must find reason for remaining out of room with mother stephen did not come earlier there be visitora nearer neighbourwho preceded when philip entered room be going merely to bow to maggie feeling that acquaintance be secret be bound not to betray when advanced toward put out hand guessed at once that lucy have be taken into confidence be moment of agitation to though philip have spent many hour in preparing for like person who have passed through life with little expectation of sympathy seldom lost self control shrank with most sensitive pride from noticeable betrayal of emotion little extra paleness little tension of nostril when spoke voice pitched in rather higher key that to stranger must seem expressive of cold indifference be sign philip usually gave of inward drama be not without fierceness maggie who have little more power of concealing impression made upon than if have be constructed of musical string felt eye getting larger with tear a took others hand in silence be not painful tear have rather something of same origin a tear woman child shed when have found protection to cling to look back on threatened danger for philip who little while ago be associated continually in maggies mind with sense tom might reproach with justice have now in short space become sort of outward conscience to that might fly to for rescue strength tranquil tender affection for philip with root deep down in childhood memory of long quiet talk confirming by distinct successive impression first instinctive biasthe fact that in appeal be more strongly to pity womanly devotedness than to vanity other egoistic excitability of natureseemed now to make sort of sacred place sanctuary where must find refuge from alluring influence best part of must resist must bring horrible tumult within wretchedness without new sense of relation to philip anxious scruple must otherwise have felt lest must overstep limit of intercourse with that tom must sanction put out hand to felt tear in eye without consciousness of inward check scene be just what lucy expected kind heart delighted in bringing philip maggie together again though even with regard for philip must not resist impression that cousin tom have excuse for feeling shocked at physical incongruity between twoa prosaic person like cousin tom who didnt like poetry fairy tale began to speak a soon a possible to set at ease be very good virtuous of said in pretty treble like low conversational note of little bird to come so soon after arrival a be think will pardon for running away in inopportune manner giving friend notice come sit down here went on placing chair must suit best will find treated mercifully will never govern well miss deane said philip a seated because one will ever believe in severity people will always encourage in misdemeanour by certainty that will be indulgent lucy gave playful contradiction philip did not hear what be for have naturally turned toward maggie be looking at with open affectionate scrutiny give to friend from whom have be long separated what moment parting have be philip felt a if be only in morrow of felt so keenlywith such intense detailed remembrance with such passionate revival of have be said looked in last conversationthat with jealousy distrust in diffident nature be almost inevitably linked with strong feeling thought read in maggies glance manner evidence of change very fact that feared half expected must be sure to make thought rush in in absence of positive proof to contrary be having great holiday be not said maggie lucy be like fairy godmother have turned from drudge into princess in time hing indulge day long always find out what want before know be sure be happier for having then said philip must be better than whole menagerie of pet to look well be benefiting by change artificial conversation of sort went on little while till lucy determined to put end to exclaimed with good imitation of annoyance that have forgotten something be quickly out of room in moment maggie philip leaned forward hand be clasped again with look of sad contentment like of friend who meet in memory of recent sorrow told brother wished to see philip asked to release from promise consented maggie in impulsiveness wanted philip to know at once position must hold toward other checked thing have happened since have spoken of love for be so painful that shrank from being first to allude to seemed almost like injury toward philip even to mention brotherher brother who have insulted be thinking too entirely of to be sensitive on other point at moment then can at least be friend maggie there be nothing to hinder now will not father object said maggie withdrawing hand must not give up on ground own wish maggie said philip colouring there be point on must always resist father a used to tell be one then there be nothing to hinder being friend philipseeing other talking to other while be here will soon go away again mean to go very soon to new situation be that inevitable maggie yes must not stay here long must unfit for life must begin again at last cant live in dependencei cant live with brother though be very good to must like to provide for must be intolerable to philip be silent few moment then said in high feeble voice with indicated resolute suppression of emotion be there other alternative maggie be that life away from who love only one will allow to look forward to yes philip said looking at pleadingly a if entreated to believe that be compelled to course at least a thing be dont know what may be in year to come begin to think there can never come much happiness to from loving have always have so much pain mingled with must make world outside a men do now be returning to old thought in new form maggiethe thought used to combat said philip with slight tinge of bitterness want to find out mode of renunciation will be escape from pain tell again there be such escape possible except by perverting mutilating one nature what must become of if tried to escape from pain scorn cynicism must be only opium unless must fall into kind of conceited madness fancy favourite of heaven because be not favourite with men bitterness have taken on impetuosity a philip went on speaking word be evidently outlet for immediate feeling of own a well a answer to maggie there be pain pressing on at moment shrank with proud delicacy from faintest allusion to word of love of plighted love have passed between must have seemed to like reminding maggie of promise must have have for something of baseness of compulsion must not dwell on fact that have not changed for too must have have air of appeal love for maggie be stamped even more than rest of experience with exaggerated sense that be exceptionthat that one saw in light of exception maggie be conscience stricken yes philip said with childish contrition when used to chide be right know do always think too much of own feeling not enough of othersnot enough of yours have need have always to find fault with teach so many thing have come true that used to tell maggie be resting elbow on table leaning head on hand looking at philip with half penitent dependent affection a said while be returning gaze with expression to consciousness gradually became le vaguebecame charged with specific recollection have mind flown back to something that now rememberedsomething about lover of lucy be thought made shudder gave new definiteness to present position to tendency of what have happened evening before moved arm from table urged to change position by positive physical oppression at heart sometimes accompanies sudden mental pang what be matter maggie have something happened philip said in inexpressible anxiety imagination being only too ready to weave everything be fatal to nothing said maggie rousing latent will philip must not have odious thought in mind must banish from own nothing repeated except in own mind used to say must feel effect of starved life a called do be too eager in enjoyment of music luxury now be come to took up work occupied resolutely while philip watched really in doubt whether have anything more than general allusion in mind be quite in maggies character to be agitated by vague self reproach soon there came violent well known ring at door bell resounding through house oh what startling announcement said maggie quite mistress of though not without inward flutter wonder where lucy be lucy have not be deaf to signal after interval long enough for few solicitous not hurried inquiry ushered stephen in well old fellow said going straight up to philip shaking heartily by hand bowing to maggie in passing glorious to have back again only wish youd conduct little le like sparrow with residence on house top not go in out constantly without letting servant know be about twentieth time ive have to scamper up countless stair to painting room of yours to purpose because people thought be at home such incident embitter friendship ive so few visitor seems hardly worth while to leave notice of exit entrance said philip feeling rather oppressed just then by stephen bright strong presence strong voice be quite well morning miss tulliver said stephen turning to maggie with stiff politeness putting out hand with air of fulfilling social duty maggie gave tip of finger said quite well thank in tone of proud indifference philip eye be watching keenly lucy be used to seeing variation in manner to other only thought with regret that there be natural antipathy now then surmounted mutual good will maggie be not sort of woman stephen admires be irritated by something in interprets a conceit be silent observation accounted for everything to guileless lucy stephen maggie have sooner completed studied greeting than felt hurt by others coldness stephen while rattling on in question to philip about recent sketching expedition be thinking more about maggie because be not drawing into conversation a have invariably done before maggie philip be not looking happy thought lucy first interview have be saddening to think people who have not be galloping said to stephen be little damped by rain let have music ought to take advantage of having philip together give duet in masaniello maggie have not heard that know will suit come then said stephen going toward piano giving foretaste of tune in deep brum brum very pleasant to hear please philipyou play accompaniment said lucy then can go on with work will like to play shant added with pretty inquiring look anxious a usual lest must have proposed what be not pleasant to with yearning toward unfinished embroidery philip have brightened at proposition for there be feeling perhaps except extreme of fear grief doe not find relief in musicthat doe not make man sing play better philip have abundance of pent up feeling at moment a complex a trio quartet be ever meant to express love jealousy resignation fierce suspicion at same time oh yes said seating at piano be way of eking out one imperfect life being three people at onceto sing make piano sing hear whileor else to sing paint ah there be enviable fellow can hing with hand said stephen have generally be observed in men of great administrative capacity believea tendency to predominance of reflective power in havent observed that miss tulliver stephen have fallen by mistake into habit of playful appeal to maggie must not repress answering flush epigram have observed tendency to predominance said smiling philip at moment devoutly hoped that found tendency disagreeable come come said lucy music music will discus others quality time maggie always tried in vain to go on with work when music began tried harder than ever to day for thought stephen knew how much cared for singing be one that longer roused merely playful resistance knew too that be habit always to stand so that must look at be of use soon threw work down intention be lost in vague state of emotion produced by inspiring duetemotion seemed to make at once strong weak strong for enjoyment weak for resistance when strain passed into minor half started from seat with sudden thrill of change poor maggie looked very beautiful when soul be being played on in way by inexorable power of sound might have seen slightest perceptible quivering through whole frame a leaned little forward clasping hand a if to steady while eye dilated brightened into wide open childish expression of wondering delight always came back in happiest moment lucy who at other time have always be at piano when maggie be looking in way must not resist impulse to steal up to kiss philip too caught glimpse of now then round open book on desk felt that have never before seen under so strong influence more more said lucy when duet have be encored something spirited again maggie always say like great rush of sound must be let take road then said stephenso suitable for wet morning be prepared to abandon most sacred duty of life come sing with oh yes said lucy laughing if will look out beggar opera from large canterbury have dingy cover be great clue considering there be about score cover here of rival dinginess said stephen drawing out canterbury oh play something while philip said lucy noticing that finger be wandering over key what be that be falling intosomething delicious that dont know dont know said philip bringing out tune more definitely from sonnambulaah perch non posso odiarti dont know opera appears tenor be telling heroine that will always love though may forsake youve heard sing to english word love thee still be not quite unintentionally that philip have wandered into song might be indirect expression to maggie of what must not prevail on to say to directly ear have be open to what be saying when began to sing understood plaintive passion of music that pleading tenor have very fine quality a voice be not quite new to have sung to by snatch in subdued way among grassy walk hollow underneath leaning ash tree in red deep there seemed to be reproach in word did philip mean that wished have assured more distinctly in conversation that desired not to renew hope of love between only because clashed with inevitable circumstance be touched not thrilled by song suggested distinct memory thought brought quiet regret in place of excitement thats way with tenor said stephen who be waiting with music in hand while philip finished song demoralise fair sex by warbling sentimental love constancy under sort of vile treatment nothing short of having head served up in dish like medival tenor troubadour must prevent from expressing entire resignation must administer antidote while miss deane prepares to tear away from bobbin stephen rolled out with saucy energy will wasting in despair die because woman fair seemed to make air in room alive with new influence lucy always proud of what stephen did went toward piano with laughing admiring look at maggie in spite of resistance to spirit of song to singer be taken hold of shaken by invisible influencewas borne along by wave too strong for angrily resolved not to betray seized work went on making false stitch pricking finger with much perseverance not looking up taking notice of what be going forward until three voice united in let take road be afraid there must have be subtle stealing gratification in mind if have known how entirely saucy defiant stephen be occupied with how be passing rapidly from determination to treat with ostentatious indifference to irritating desire for sign of inclination from hersome interchange of subdued word look with be not long before found opportunity when have passed to music of tempest maggie feeling need of footstool be walking across room to get one when stephen who be not singing just then be conscious of movement guessed want flew to anticipate lifting footstool with entreating look at made impossible not to return glance of gratitude then to have footstool placed carefully by too self confident personagenot self confident personage one in particular who suddenly look humble anxious lingers bending still to ask if there be not draught in position between window fireplace if may not be allowed to move work table for herthese thing will summon little of too ready traitorous tenderness into woman eye compelled a be in girlish time to learn life lesson in very trivial language to maggie such thing have not be everyday incident be new element in life found keen appetite for homage quite fresh that tone of gentle solicitude obliged to look at face be bent toward to say thank nothing must prevent that mutual glance from being delicious to a have be evening before be ordinary act of politeness in stephen have hardly taken two minute lucy who be singing scarcely noticed to philip mind filled already with vague anxiety be likely to find definite ground for in trivial incident sudden eagerness in stephen change in maggies face be plainly reflecting beam from seemed so strong contrast with previous overwrought sign of indifference a to be charged with painful meaning stephen voice pouring in again jarred upon nervous susceptibility a if have be clang of sheet iron felt inclined to make piano shriek in utter discord have really seen communicable ground for suspecting ususual feeling between stephen maggie own reason told so wanted to go home at once that might reflect coolly on false image till have convinced of nullity then again wanted to stay a long a stephen stayedalways to be present when stephen be present with maggie seemed to poor philip so natural nay inevitable that man who be near maggie must fall in love with there be promise of happiness for if be beguiled into loving stephen guest thought emboldened philip to view own love for in light of le unequal offering be beginning to play very falsely under deafening inward tumult lucy be looking at in astonishment when mr tullivers entrance to summon to lunch came a excuse for abruptly breaking off music ah mr philip said mr deane when entered dining room ive not seen for long while father not at home think be went after to

hobby never have hobby never must give in to worst of hobby be that people think can get money at shoot money down like corn out of sack then lucy felt little nervous under father apparently gratuitous criticism of mr wakems expenditure ceased there mr deane became unusually silent meditative during luncheon lucy accustomed to watch indication in father having reason have recently become strong for extra interest in what referred to wakems felt unusual curiosity to know what have prompted father question subsequent silence made suspect there have be special reason for in mind with idea in head resorted to usual plan when wanted to tell ask father anything particular found reason for aunt tulliver to leave dining room after dinner seated on small stool at father knee mr deane under circumstance considered that tasted of most agreeable moment merit have purchased in life notwithstanding lucy disliking to have hair powdered with snuff usually began by mastering snuff box on such occasion dont want to go to sleep yet papa do said a brought up stool opened large finger clutched snuff box not yet said mr deane glancing at reward of merit in decanter what do want added pinching dimpled chin fondlyto coax more sovereign out of pocket for bazaar eh have base motif at to day only want to talk not to beg want to know what made ask philip wakem about father farming to

business ability mr deane be rather puzzled suspected that there have be something going on among young people to wanted clew to men of mr deanes stamp what go on among young people be a extraneous to real business of life a what go on among bird butterfly until can be shown to have malign bearing on monetary affair in case bearing appeared to be entirely propitious chapter ix charity in full dress culmination of maggies career a admired member of society in st oggs be certainly day of bazaar when simple noble beauty clad in white muslin of soft floating kind suspect must have come from store of aunt pullet wardrobe appeared with marked distinction among more adorned conventional woman around perhaps never detect how much of social demeanour be made up of artificial air until see person who be at once beautiful simple without beauty be apt to call simplicity awkwardness miss guest be much too well bred to have of grimace affected tone belong to pretentious vulgarity stall being next to one where maggie sat seemed newly obvious to day that miss guest held chin too high that miss laura spoke moved continually with view to effect well dressed st oggs neighbourhood be there must have be worth while to come even from distance to see fine old hall with open roof carved oaken rafter great oaken folding door light shed down from height on many coloured show beneath very quaint place with broad faded stripe painted on wall here there show of heraldic animal of bristly long snouted character cherished emblem of noble family once seignior of now civic hall grand arch cut in upper wall at one end surmounted oaken orchestra with open room behind where hothouse plant stall for refreshment be disposed agreeable resort for gentleman disposed to loiter yet to exchange occasional crush down below for more commodious point of view in fact perfect fitness of ancient building for admirable modern purpose made charity truly elegant led through vanity up to supply of deficit be so striking that hardly person entered room without exchanging remark more than once near great arch over orchestra be stone oriel with painted glass be one of venerable inconsistency of old hall be close by lucy have stall for convenience of certain large plain article have taken charge of for mr kenn maggie have begged to sit at open end of stall to have sale of article rather than of bead mat other elaborate product of have dim understanding soon appeared that gentleman dressing gown be among commodity be object of such general attention inquiry excited so troublesome curiosity a to lining comparative merit together with determination to test by trying on a to make post very conspicuous one lady who have commodity of own to sell did not want dressing gown saw at once frivolity bad taste of masculine preference for good tailor must furnish be possible that emphatic notice of various kind be drawn toward miss tulliver on public occasion threw very strong unmistakable light on subsequent conduct in many mind then present not that anger on account of spurned beauty can dwell in celestial breast of charitable lady rather that error of person who have once be much admired necessarily take deeper tinge from mere force of contrast also to day maggies conspicuous position for first time made evident certain characteristic be subsequently felt to have explanatory bearing there be something rather bold in miss tullivers direct gaze something undefinably coarse in style of beauty placed in opinion of feminine judge far below cousin miss deane for lady of st oggs have now completely ceded to lucy hypothetic claim on admiration of mr stephen guest a for dear little lucy late benevolent triumph about mill affectionate project be cherishing for maggie philip helped to give highest spirit to day felt nothing pleasure in evidence of maggies attractiveness be true be looking very charming stephen be paying utmost attention on public occasion jealously buying up article have seen under finger in process of making gayly helping to cajole male customer into purchase of most effeminate futility chose to lay aside hat wear scarlet fez of embroidering by superficial observer be necessarily liable to be interpreted le a compliment to lucy than a mark of coxcombry guest be great coxcomb young torry observed then be privileged person in st oggshe carry before if fellow did such thing everybody must say made fool of stephen purchased absolutely nothing from maggie until lucy said in rather vexed undertone see now thing of maggies knitting will be gone will not have bought one there be deliciously soft warm thing for wristsdo buy oh said stephen must be intended for imaginative person who can chill on warm day by thinking of frosty caucasus stern reason be forte know must get philip to buy by way why doesnt come never like going where there be many people though enjoined to come said must buy up of good that rest of world rejected now do go buy something of maggie see have got customer there be old wakem just coming up lucy eye turned with anxious interest toward maggie to see how went through first interview since sadly memorable time with man toward whom must have so strange mixture of feeling be pleased to notice that wakem have tact enough to enter at once into talk about bazaar ware appear interested in purchasing smiling now then kindly at maggie not calling on to speak much a if observed that be rather pale tremulous why wakem be making particularly amiable to cousin said stephen in undertone to lucy be pure magnanimity talked of family quarrel oh will soon be quite healed hope said lucy becoming little indiscreet in satisfaction speaking with air of significance stephen did not appear to notice a lady purchaser came up lounged on toward maggies end handling trifle standing aloof until wakem who have taken out purse have finished transaction son came with overheard wakem saying have vanished into other part of building have left charitable gallantry to hope youll reproach for shabby conduct returned smile bow without speaking turned away only then observing stephen nodding to maggie conscious that stephen be still there busied with counting money avoided looking up have be well pleased that have devoted to lucy to day have not come near have begun morning with indifferent salutation have rejoiced in being aloof from other like patient who have actually done without opium in spite of former failure in resolution during last few day have even be making up mind to failure looking to outward event must soon come to separate a reason for dispensing with self conquest in detail stephen moved step by step a if be being unwillingly dragged until have got round open end of stall be half hidden by screen of drapery went on counting money till suddenly heard deep gentle voice saying arent very tired do let bring somethingsome fruit jelly maynt unexpected tone shook like sudden accidental vibration of harp close by oh thank said faintly only half looking up for instant look so pale stephen insisted in more entreating tone im sure youre exhausted must disobey bring something indeed couldnt take be angry with have done do look at pray go away said maggie looking at helplessly eye glancing immediately from to opposite corner of orchestra be hidden by fold of old faded green curtain maggie have sooner uttered entreaty than be wretched at admission implied stephen turned away at once following upward glance saw philip wakem sealed in half hidden corner so that must command little more than angle of hall in maggie sat entirely new thought occurred to stephen linking with what have observed of wakems manner with lucy reply to observation convinced that there have be former relation between philip maggie beyond childish one of have heard more than one impulse made immediately leave hall go upstairs to refreshment room where walking up to philip sat down behind put hand on shoulder be studying for portrait phil said for sketch of oriel window by george make capital bit from dark corner with curtain just marking off have be studying expression said philip curtly what miss tullivers rather of savage moody order to day thinksomething of fallen princess serving behind counter cousin sent to with civil offer to get refreshment have be snubbed a usual there natural antipathy between suppose have seldom honour to please what hypocrite be said philip flushing angrily what because experience must have told that im universally pleasing admit law there disturbing force here be going said philip rising abruptly so be ito get breath of fresh air place get oppressive think have done suit service long enough two friend walked downstairs together without speaking philip turned through outer door into court yard stephen saying oh by by must call in here went on along passage to one of room at other end of building be appropriated to town library have room to man requires nothing le than when want to dash cap on table throw astride chair stare at high brick wall with frown must not have be beneath occasion if have be slaying giant python conduct issue from moral conflict have often so close resemblance to vice that distinction escape outward judgment founded on mere comparison of action be clear to hope that stephen be not hypocritecapable of deliberate doubleness for selfish end yet fluctuation between indulgence of feeling systematic concealment of might have made good case in support of philip accusation meanwhile maggie sat at stall cold trembling with painful sensation in eye come from resolutely repressed tear be life to be always like thisalways bringing new source of inward strife heard confusedly busy indifferent voice around wished mind must flow into easy babbling current be at moment dr kenn who have quite lately come into hall be now walking down middle with hand behind taking general view fixed eye on maggie for first time be struck with expression of pain on beautiful face be sitting quite still for stream of customer have lessened at late hour in afternoon gentleman have chiefly chosen middle of day maggies stall be looking rather bare with absent pained expression finished contrast between companion who be bright eager busy be strongly arrested face have naturally drawn attention a new striking one at church have be introduced to during short call on business at mr deanes have never spoken more than three word to walked toward now maggie perceiving one approaching roused to look up be prepared to speak felt childlike instinctive relief from sense of uneasiness in exertion when saw be dr kenns face be looking at plain middle aged face with grave penetrating kindness in seeming to tell of human being who have reached firm safe strand be looking with helpful pity toward struggler still tossed by wave have effect on maggie at moment be afterward remembered by a if have be promise middle aged who have lived through strongest emotion be yet in time when memory be still half passionate not merely contemplative must surely be sort of natural priesthood whom life have disciplined consecrated to be refuge rescue of early stumbler victim of self despair most of at moment in young life must have welcomed priest of natural order in sort of canonicals uncanonicals have to scramble upward into difficulty of nineteen entirely without such aid a maggie did find office rather fatiguing one fear miss tulliver said dr kenn be rather said maggie simply not being accustomed to simpler amiable denial of obvious fact can tell mr kenn that have disposed of good very quickly added will be very much obliged to oh have done nothing gentleman came very fast to buy dressing gown embroidered waistcoat think of other lady must have sold more didnt know what to say about dr kenn smiled hope im going to have a permanent parishioner now miss tulliver be have be at distance from have be teacher in school im going into situation of same kind very soon ah be hoping must remain among friend who be in neighbourhood believe oh must go said maggie earnestly looking at dr kenn with expression of reliance a if have told history in three word be one of moment of implicit revelation will sometimes happen even between people who meet quite transientlyon mile journey perhaps when resting by wayside there be always possibility of word look from stranger to keep alive sense of human brotherhood dr kenns ear eye took in sign that brief confidence of maggies be charged with meaning understand said feel right to go will not prevent meeting again hope will not prevent knowing better if can be of service to put out hand pressed hers kindly before turned away have trouble other at heart thought poor child look a if might turn out to be one of soul by nature pitched too high by suffering plunged too low there something wonderfully honest in beautiful eye may be surprising that maggie among whose many imperfection excessive delight in admiration acknowledged supremacy be not absent now more than when be instructing gypsy with view toward achieving royal position among be not more elated on day when have have tribute of so many look smile together with satisfactory consciousness have necessarily come from being taken before lucy chevalglass made to look at full length of tall beauty crowned by night of massy hair maggie have smiled at then for moment have forgotten everything in sense of own beauty if state of mind must have lasted choice must have be to have stephen guest at foot offering life filled with luxury with daily incense of adoration near distant with possibility of culture at command there be thing in stronger than vanitypassion affection long deep memory of early discipline effort of early claim on love pity stream of vanity be soon swept along mingled imperceptibly with wider current be at highest force today under double urgency of event inward impulse brought by last week philip have not spoken to about removal of obstacle between on father sidehe shrank from have told everything to lucy with hope that maggie being informed through might give encouraging sign that being brought thus much nearer to other be happiness to rush of conflicting feeling be too great for maggie to say much when lucy with face breathing playful joy like one of correggio cherub poured forth triumphant revelation lucy must hardly be surprised that must do little more than cry with gladness at thought of father wish being fulfilled of tom getting mill again in reward for hard striving detail of preparation for bazaar have then come to usurp lucy attention for next few day nothing have be said by cousin on subject be likely to rouse deeper feeling philip have be to house more than once maggie have have private conversation with thus have be left to fight inward battle without interference when bazaar be fairly ended cousin be

very compliant to dont think he so obstinate must go said maggie in distressed voice must leave time to pack dont press to stay dear lucy lucy be silent for two three minute looking away ruminating at length knelt down by cousin looking up in face with anxious seriousness said maggie be that dont love philip well enough to marry tell metrust maggie held lucy hand tightly in silence little while own

splendor of sixteen couple with attendant parent guardian focus of brilliancy be long drawing room where dancing went forward under inspiration of grand piano library into opened at one end have more sober illumination of maturity with cap card at other end pretty sitting room with conservatory attached be left a occasional cool retreat lucy who have laid aside black for first time have pretty slimness set off by abundant dress of white crape be acknowledged queen of occasion for be one of miss guest thoroughly condescending party including member of aristocracy higher than of st oggs stretching to extreme limit of commercial professional gentility maggie at first refused to dance saying that have forgotten figuresit be so many year since have danced at school be glad to have excuse for be ill dancing with heavy heart at length music wrought in young limb longing came even though be horrible young torry who walked up second time to try persuade warned that must not dance anything country dance of course be willing to wait for high felicity meaning only to be complimentary when assured at several interval that be great bore that couldnt waltz must have liked so much to waltz with at last be turn of good old fashioned dance have least of vanity most of merriment in maggie quite forgot troublous life in childlike enjoyment of half rustic rhythm seems to banish pretentious etiquette felt quite charitably toward young torry a hand bore along held up in dance eye cheek have that fire of young joy in will flame out if can find least breath to fan simple black dress with bit of black lace seemed like dim setting of jewel stephen have not yet asked to dance have not yet paid more than passing civility since yesterday that inward vision of perpetually made part of consciousness have be half screened by image of philip wakem came across like blot there be attachment between philip at least there be attachment on side made feel in bondage here then stephen told be claim of honour called on to resist attraction be continually threatening to overpower told so yet have once twice felt certain savage resistance at moment shuddering repugnance to intrusion of philip image almost made new incitement to rush toward maggie claim for nevertheless have done what meant to do eveninghe have kept aloof from have hardly looked at have be gayly assiduous to lucy now eye be devouring maggie felt inclined to kick young torry out of dance take place then wanted dance to end that might get rid of partner possibility that too must dance with maggie have hand in so long be beginning to posse like thirst even now hand be meeting in dancewere meeting still to very end of though be far off other stephen hardly knew what happened in what automatic way got through duty of politeness in interval until be free saw maggie seated alone again at farther end of room made way toward round couple be forming for waltz when maggie became conscious that be person sought felt in spite of thought have gone before glowing gladness at heart eye cheek be still brightened with childlike enthusiasm in dance whole frame be set to joy tenderness even coming pain must not seem bittershe be ready to welcome a part of life for life at moment seemed keen vibrating consciousness poised above pleasure pain one last night might expand unrestrainedly in warmth of present without chill eating thought of past future theyre going to waltz again said stephen bending to speak to with glance tone of subdued tenderness young dream create to in summer wood when low cooing voice fill air such glance tone bring breath of poetry with into room be half stifling with glaring gas hard flirtation be going to waltz again be rather dizzy work to look on room be very warm will walk about little took hand placed within arm walked on into sitting room where table be strewn with engraving for accommodation of visitor who must not want to look at visitor be here at moment passed on into conservatory how strange unreal tree flower look with light among said maggie in low voice look a if belonged to enchanted land must never fade away must fancy be made of jewel be looking at tier of geranium a spoke stephen made answer be looking at doe not supreme poet blend light sound into one calling darkness mute light eloquent something strangely powerful there be in light of stephen long gaze for made maggies face turn toward look upward at slowly like flower at ascending brightness walked unsteadily on without feeling that be walking without feeling anything that long grave mutual gaze have solemnity belonging to deep human passion hovering thought that must must renounce other made moment of mute confession more intense in rapture have reached end of conservatory be obliged to pause turn change of movement brought new consciousness to maggie blushed deeply turned away head drew arm from stephen going up to flower to smell stephen stood motionless still pale oh may get rose said maggie making great effort to say something dissipate burning sense of irretrievable confession think be quite wicked with rose like to gather smell till have scent left stephen be mute be incapable of putting sentence together maggie bent arm little upward toward large half opened rose that have attracted who have not felt beauty of woman arm unspeakable suggestion of tenderness lie in dimpled elbow varied gently lessening curve down to delicate wrist with tiniest almost imperceptible nick in firm softness woman arm touched soul of great sculptor two thousand year ago so that wrought image of for parthenon move still a clasp lovingly timeworn marble of headless trunk maggies be such arm a have warm tint of life mad impulse seized on stephen darted toward arm showered kiss on clasping wrist next moment maggie snatched from glared at like wounded war goddess quivering with rage humiliation how dare spoke in deeply shaken half smothered voice what right have given to insult darted from into adjoining room threw on sofa panting trembling horrible punishment be come upon for sin of allowing moment happiness be to lucy to philip to own better soul momentary happiness have be smitten with blight leprosy stephen thought more lightly of than did of lucy a for stephen leaned back against framework of conservatory dizzy with conflict of passionslove rage confused despair despair at want of self mastery despair that have offended maggie last feeling surmounted other to be by side again entreat forgiveness be only thing have force of motive for have not be seated more than few minute when came stood humbly before maggies bitter rage be unspent leave to myself if please said with impetuous haughtiness for future avoid stephen turned away walked backward forward at other end of room there be dire necessity of going back into dancing room again be beginning to be conscious of that have be absent so short time when went in again waltz be not ended maggie too be not long before re entered pride of nature be stung into activity hateful weakness have dragged within reach of wound to self respect have at least wrought own cure thought temptation of last month must all be flung away into unvisited chamber of memory there be nothing to allure now duty must be easy old calm purpose must reign peacefully once more re entered drawing room still with excited brightness in face with sense of proud self command defied anything to agitate refused to dance again talked quite readily calmly with one who addressed when got home that night kissed lucy with free heart almost exulting in scorching moment have delivered from possibility of word look must have stamp of treachery toward gentle unsuspicious sister next morning maggie did not set off to basset quite so soon a have expected mother be to accompany in carriage household business must not be dispatched hastily by mr tulliver so maggie who have be in hurry to prepare have to sit waiting equipped for drive in garden lucy be busy in house wrapping up bazaar present for younger one at basset when there be loud ring at door bell maggie felt alarm lest lucy must bring out stephen to be sure to be stephen presently visitor came out into garden alone seated by on garden chair be not stephen can just catch tip of scotch fir maggie from seat said philip have taken others hand in silence maggie have looked at with more complete revival of old childlike affectionate smile than have seen before felt encouraged yes said often look at wish must see low sunlight on stem again have never be way onceto churchyard with mother have be there go there continually said philip have nothing past to live upon keen remembrance keen pity impelled maggie to put

will be closed philip said with grave sadness desire future will break tie of past tie to brother be one of strongest can hing willingly will divide always from be that only reason must keep apart forever maggie said philip with desperate determination to have definite answer only reason said maggie with calm decision believed at moment felt a if enchanted cup have be dashed to ground reactionary excitement gave proud self mastery have not subsided looked at future with sense of calm choice sat hand in hand without looking at other speaking for few minute in maggies mind first scene of love parting be more present than actual moment be looking at philip in red deep philip felt that ought to have be thoroughly happy in answer of hers be a open transparent a rock pool why be not thoroughly happy jealousy be never satisfied with anything short of omniscience must detect subtlest fold of heart chapter xi in lane maggie have be four day at aunt moss giving early june sunshine quite new brightness in care dimmed eye of affectionate woman making epoch for cousin great small who be learning word action by heart a if have be transient avatar of perfect wisdom beauty be standing on causeway with aunt group of cousin feeding chicken at quiet moment in life of farmyard before afternoon milking time great building round hollow yard be a dreary tumbledown a ever over old garden wall straggling rose bush be beginning to toss summer weight gray wood old brick of house on higher level have look of sleepy age in broad afternoon sunlight suited quiescent time maggie with bonnet over arm be smiling down at hatch of small fluffy chicken when aunt exclaimed goodness who be that gentleman coming in at gate be gentleman on tall bay horse flank neck of horse be streaked black with fast riding maggie felt beating at head heart horrible a sudden leaping to life of savage enemy who have feigned death who be dear said mr moss seeing in maggies face evidence that knew be mr stephen guest said maggie rather faintly cousin lucysa gentleman who be very intimate at cousin stephen be already close to have jumped off horse now raised hat a advanced hold horse willy

liberty of asking to walk few yard with have half jaded half irritated look such a man get when have be dogged by care annoyance make bed dinner of little use to spoke almost abruptly a if errand be too pressing for to trouble about what must be thought by mr moss of visit request good mr moss rather nervous in presence of apparently haughty gentleman be inwardly wondering whether must be doing right wrong to invite again to leave horse walk in when maggie feeling embarrassment of situation unable to say anything put on bonnet turned to walk toward gate stephen turned too walked by side leading horse not word be spoken till be out in lane have walked four five yard when maggie who have be looking straight before while turned again to walk back saying with haughty resentment there be need for to go farther dont know whether consider gentlemanly delicate conduct to place in position that forced to come out with whether wished to insult still further by thrusting interview upon in way of course be angry with for coming said stephen bitterly of course be of consequence what man have to suffer be only woman dignity that care about maggie gave slight start such a might have come from slightest possible electric shock a if be not enough that im entangled in way that im mad with love for resist strongest passion man can feel because try to be true to other claim must treat a if be coarse brute who must willingly offend when if have own choice must ask to take hand fortune whole life do what liked with know forgot took unwarrantable liberty hate for having done repented immediately ive be repenting ever since ought not to think unpardonable man who love with whole soul a do be liable to be mastered by feeling for moment knowyou must believethat worst pain must have be to have pained must give world to recall error maggie dared not speak dared not turn head strength have come from resentment be gone lip be quivering visibly must not trust to utter full forgiveness rose in answer to confession be come nearly in front of gate again paused trembling must not say thing must not hear said looking down in misery a stephen came in front of to prevent from going farther toward gate im very sorry for pain have to go through be of use to speak yes be of use said stephen impetuously must be of use if must treat with sort of pity consideration instead of

stephen with still more passionate pleading will come back again if send away with coldness cant answer for if will go with only little way can live on see plainly enough that anger have only made ten time more unreasonable maggie turned tancred bay horse began to make such spirited remonstrance against frequent change of direction that stephen catching sight of willy moss peeping through gate called out here just come hold horse for five minute oh said maggie hurriedly aunt will think so strange never mind stephen answered impatiently dont know people at st oggs lead up down just here for five minute added to willy who be now close to then turned to maggies side walked on be clear that must go on now take arm said stephen entreatingly took feeling while a if be sliding downward in nightmare there be end to misery began struggling to repel influence by speech be wickedbaseever allowing word look that others might not have seen think of lucy do think of herbless if didnt stephen

be so consider engaged to dont mean to marry one else stephen be silent again until have turned out of sun into side lane grassy sheltered then burst out impetuously be unnatural be horrible maggie if loved a love must throw everything else to wind for sake of belonging to other must break mistaken tie be made in blindness determine to marry other must rather die than fall into temptation said maggie with deep slow distinctness gathered spiritual force of painful year coming to aid in extremity drew arm from a spoke tell then that dont care for said almost violently tell that love one else

fitful brightness ardor that lucy must have have to seek other cause for such change if have not be convinced that position in maggie stood between philip brother prospect of self imposed wearisome banishment be quite enough to account for large amount of depression under torpor there be fierce battle of emotion such a maggie in life of struggle have never known foreboded seemed to a if worst

le frequent visitor came occasionally in evening happened that be there when lucy said a sat out on lawn near sunset now maggies tale of visit to aunt glegg be completed mean that will go out boating day until go have not have half enough boating because of tiresome visit like better than anything dont maggie better than sort of locomotion hope mean said philip smiling at maggie who be lolling backward in low garden chair else will be selling soul to ghostly boatman who haunt floss only for sake of being drifted in boat forever must like to be boatman said lucy because if must can come with take oar if floss be quiet lake instead of river must be independent of gentleman for maggie can row splendidly a be be reduced to ask service of knight squire who seem to offer with great alacrity looked playful reproach at stephen who be sauntering up down be just singing in pianissimo falsetto thirst from soul doth rise doth ask drink divine took notice still kept aloof have done so frequently during philip recent visit dont seem inclined for boating said lucy when came to sit down by on bench doesnt rowing suit now oh hate large party in boat said almost irritably ill come when have one else lucy coloured fearing that philip must be hurt be quite new thing for stephen to speak in way have certainly not be well of late philip coloured too le from feeling of personal offence than from vague suspicion that stephen moodiness have relation to maggie who have started up from chair a spoke have walked toward hedge of laurel to look at descending sunlight on river a miss deane didnt know be excluding others by inviting said philip be bound to resign indeed will not said lucy much vexed particularly wish for company to morrow tide will suit at past ten will be delicious time for couple of hour to row to luckreth walk back before sun get too hot how can object to four people in boat added looking at stephen dont object to people number said stephen who have recovered be rather ashamed of rudeness if voted for fourth at of course must be phil wont divide pleasure of escorting lady well take alternately ill go next day incident have effect of drawing philip attention with freshened solicitude toward stephen maggie when re entered house music be proposed mr tulliver mr deane being occupied with cribbage maggie sat apart near table where book work be placed doing nothing however listening abstractedly to music stephen presently turned to duet insisted that lucy philip must sing have often done same thing before evening philip thought divined double intention in word look of stephen watched keenly angry with while for clinging suspicion for have not maggie virtually denied ground for doubt on side be truth be impossible not to believe word glance when have last spoken together in garden stephen might be strongly fascinated by what be more natural philip felt rather base for intruding on must be friend painful secret still watched stephen moving away from piano sauntered slowly toward table near maggie sat turned over newspaper apparently in mere idleness then seated with back to piano dragging newspaper under elbow thrusting hand through hair a if have be attracted by bit of local news in laceham courier be in reality looking at maggie who have not taken slightest notice of approach have always additional strength of resistance when philip be present just a can restrain speech better in spot that feel to be hallowed at last heard word dearest uttered in softest tone of pained entreaty like of patient who asks for something ought to have be given without asking have never heard that word since moment in lane at basset when have come from stephen again again almost a involuntarily a if have be inarticulate cry philip must hear word have moved to opposite side of piano must see maggie start blush raise eye instant toward stephen face immediately look apprehensively toward be not evident to that philip have observed pang of shame under sense of concealment made move from chair walk to mother side to watch game at cribbage philip went home soon after in state of hideous doubt mingled with wretched certainty be impossible for now to resist conviction that there be mutual consciousness between stephen maggie for night irritable susceptible nerve be pressed upon almost to frenzy by one wretched fact must attempt explanation must reconcile with word action when at last need for belief in maggie rose to habitual predominance be not long in imagining truthshe be struggling be banishing be clue to have seen since return athwart belief there came other possibility must not be driven out of sight imagination wrought out whole story stephen be madly in love with must have told so have rejected be hurrying away must give up knowingphilip felt fact with heart crushing despairthat be made half helpless by feeling toward when morning came philip be too ill to think of keeping engagement to go in boat in present agitation must decide on nothing must only alternate between contradictory intention first thought must have interview with maggie entreat to confide in then again distrusted own interference have not be thrusting on maggie along have uttered word long ago in young ignorance be enough to make hate that must be continually present with a bond have right to ask for revelation of feeling have evidently intended to withhold from must not trust to see till have assured that must act from pure anxiety for not from egoistic irritation wrote brief note to stephen sent early by servant saying that be not well enough to fulfil engagement to miss deane must stephen take excuse fill place lucy have arranged charming plan have made quite content with stephen refusal to go in boat discovered that father be to drive to lindum morning at ten lindum be very place wanted to go to to make purchasesimportant purchase must by mean be put off to opportunity aunt tulliver must go too because be concerned in of purchase will have row in boat just same know said to maggie when went out of breakfast room upstairs together philip will be here at half past ten be delicious morning now dont say word against dear dolorous thing what be use of being fairy godmother if set face against wonder work for dont think of awful cousin tom may disobey little maggie did not persist in objecting be almost glad of plan for perhaps must bring strength calmness to be alone with philip again be like revisiting scene of quieter life in very struggle be repose compared with daily tumult of present prepared for boat at half past ten sat waiting in drawing room ring of door bell be punctual be thinking with half sad affectionate pleasure of surprise philip must have in finding that be to be with alone when distinguished firm rapid step across hall be certainly not philip door opened stephen guest entered in first moment be too much agitated to speak for stephen have learned from servant that others be gone out maggie have started up sat down again with heart beating violently stephen throwing down cap glove came sat by in silence thought philip must be coming soon with great effortfor trembled visiblyshe rose to go to distant chair be not coming said stephen in low tone be going in boat oh cant go said maggie sinking into chair again lucy did not expectshe must be hurt why be not philip come be not well asked to come instead lucy be gone to lindum said maggie taking off bonnet with hurried trembling finger must not go very well said stephen dreamily looking at a rested arm on back of chair then well stay here be looking into deep deep eye far off mysterious a starlit blackness yet very near timidly loving sat perfectly stillperhaps for moment perhaps for minutesuntil helpless trembling have ceased there be warm glow on check man be waiting have taken cushion said will go tell what will tell said stephen almost in whisper be looking at lip now maggie made answer let go stephen murmured entreatingly rising taking hand to raise too will not be long together went maggie felt that be being led down garden among rose being helped with firm tender care into boat having cushion cloak arranged for foot parasol opened for have forgotten all by stronger presence seemed to bear along without act of own will like added self come with sudden exalting influence of strong tonic felt nothing else memory be excluded glided rapidly along stephen rowing helped by backward flowing tide past tofton tree house on between silent sunny field pasture seemed filled with natural joy have reproach for theirs breath of young unwearied day delicious rhythmic dip of oar fragmentary song of passing bird heard now then a if be only overflowing of brimful gladness sweet solitude of twofold consciousness be mingled into one by grave untiring gaze need not be avertedwhat else must there be in mind for first hour low subdued languid exclamation of love came from stephen from time to time a went on rowing idly automatically otherwise spoke word for what must word have be inlet to thought thought did not belong to enchanted haze in be envelopedit belonged to past future that lay outside haze maggie be only dimly conscious of bank a passed dwelt with recognition on village knew there be several to be passed before reached luckreth where always stopped left boat at time be so liable to fit of absence that be likely enough to let waymarks pas unnoticed at last stephen who have be rowing more more idly ceased to row laid down oar folded arm looked down on water a if watching pace at boat glided without help sudden change roused maggie looked at far stretching field at bank close by felt that be entirely strange to terrible alarm took possession of oh have passed luckreth where be to stop exclaimed looking back to see if place be out of sight village be to be seen turned around again with look of distressed questioning at stephen went on watching water said in strange dreamy absent tone yes long way oh what will do cried maggie in agony will not get home for hour lucy o god help clasped hand broke into sob like frightened child thought of nothing of meeting lucy seeing look of pained surprise doubt perhaps of just upbraiding stephen moved sat near gently drew down clasped hand maggie said in deep tone of slow decision let never go home again till one can part ustill be married unusual tone startling word arrested maggies sob sat quite still wondering a if stephen might have seen possibility must alter everything annul wretched fact see maggie how everything have come without seekingin spite of effort never thought of being alone together again have all be done by others see how tide be carrying out away from unnatural bond that have be trying to make faster round trying in vain will carry on to torby can land there get carriage hurry on to york then to scotlandand never pause moment till be bound to other so that only death can part be only right thing dearest be only way of escaping from wretched entanglement everything have concurred to point out to have contrived nothing have thought of nothing stephen spoke with deep earnest pleading maggie listened passing from startled wonderment to yearning after belief that tide be doing that might glide along with swift silent stream not struggle more across stealing influence came terrible shadow of past thought sudden horror lest now at last moment of fatal intoxication be close upon called up feeling of angry resistance toward stephen let go said in agitated tone flashing indignant look at trying to get hand free have wanted to deprive of choice knew be come too far have dared to take advantage of thoughtlessness be unmanly to bring into position stung by reproach released hand moved back to former place folded arm in sort of desperation at difficulty maggies word have made present to if must not consent to go on must curse for embarrassment have led into reproach be unendurable thing one thing worse than parting with be that must feel have acted unworthily toward at last said in tone of suppressed rage didnt notice that have passed luckreth till have got to next village then came into mind that must go on cant justify ought to have told be enough to make hate since dont love well enough to make everything else indifferent to a do will stop boat try to get out here ill tell lucy be mad that hate will be clear of forever one can blame because have behaved unpardonably to maggie be paralyzed be easier to resist stephen pleading than picture have called up of suffering while be vindicated easier even to turn away from look of tenderness than from look of angry misery seemed to place in selfish isolation from have called up state of feeling in reason have acted on conscience seemed to be transmitted into mere regard indignant fire in eye be quenched began to look at with timid distress have reproached for being hurried into irrevocable trespassshe who have be so weak a if shouldnt feel what happened to youjust same said with reproach of kindthe reproach of love asking for more trust yielding to idea of stephen suffering be more fatal than other yielding because be le distinguishable from sense of others claim be moral basis of resistance felt relenting in look tone be heaven opening again moved to side took hand leaning elbow on back of boat saying nothing dreaded to utter word dreaded to make movement might provoke reproach denial from life hung on consent everything else be hopeless confused sickening misery glided along in way resting in silence a in haven dreading lest feeling must be divided againtill became aware that cloud have gathered that slightest perceptible freshening of breeze be growing growing so that whole character of day be altered will be chill maggie in thin dress let raise cloak over shoulder get up instant dearest maggie obeyed there be unspeakable charm in being told what to do having everything decided for sat down again covered with cloak stephen took to oar again making haste for must try to get to torby a fast a must maggie be hardly conscious of having said done anything decisive yielding be attended with le vivid consciousness than resistance be partial sleep of thought be submergence of own personality by influence tended to lull into acquiescence that dreamy gliding in boat have lasted for four hour have brought weariness exhaustion recoil of fatigued sensation from impracticable difficulty of getting out of boat at unknown distance from home walking for long milesall helped to bring into more complete subjection to strong mysterious charm made last parting from stephen seem death of joy made thought of wounding like first touch of torturing iron before resolution shrank then there be present happiness of being with be enough to absorb languid energy presently stephen observed vessel coming after several vessel among steamer to mudport have passed with early tide for last hour have seen none looked more more eagerly at vessel a if new thought have come into mind along with then looked at maggie hesitatingly maggie dearest said at last if vessel must be going to mudport to convenient place on coast northward must be best plan to get to take on board be fatigued may soon rain may be wretched business getting to torby in boat only trading vessel dare say can be made tolerably comfortable well take cushion out of boat be really best plan theyll be glad enough to take ive got plenty of money about can pay well maggies heart began to beat with reawakened alarm at new proposition be silentone course seemed a difficult a stephen hailed vessel be dutch vessel going to mudport english mate informed if wind held must be there in le than two day have got out too far with boat said stephen be trying to make for torby im afraid of weather ladymy wifewill be exhausted with fatigue hunger take on boardwill youand haul up boat ill pay well maggie now really faint trembling with fear be taken on board making interesting object of contemplation to admiring dutchman mate feared lady must have poor time of on board for have accommodation for such entirely unlooked for passengersno private cabin larger than old fashioned church pew at least have dutch cleanliness make other inconvenience tolerable boat cushion be spread into couch for maggie on poop with alacrity to pace up down deck leaning on stephenbeing upheld by strengthwas first change that needed then came food then quiet reclining on cushion with sense that new resolution must be taken day everything must wait till to morrow stephen sat beside with hand in must only speak to other in low tone only look at other now then for must take long while to dull curiosity of five men on board reduce handsome young stranger to minor degree of interest belongs in sailor regard to object nearer than horizon stephen be triumphantly happy other thought care be thrown into unmarked perspective by certainty maggie must be leap have be taken now have be tortured by scruple have fought fiercely with overmastering inclination have hesitated repentance be impossible murmured forth in fragmentary sentence happiness adoration tenderness belief that life together must be heaven that presence with must give rapture to common day that to satisfy lightest wish be dearer to than other bliss that everything be easy for sake except to part with now never must part must belong to forever be be hershad value for except a be hers such thing uttered in low broken tone by one voice have first stirred fibre of young passion have only feeble effecton experienced mind at distance from to poor maggie be very near be like nectar held close to thirsty lip there be there must be then life for mortal here below be not hard chillin affection must no longer be self sacrifice stephen passionate word made vision of life more fully present to than have ever be before vision for time excluded realitiesall except returning sun gleam broke out on water a evening approached mingled with visionary sunlight of promised happiness except hand pressed hers voice spoke to eye looked at with grave unspeakable love there be to be rain after cloud rolled off to horizon again making great purple rampart long purple isle of wondrous land reveals to when sun go downthe land that evening star watch over maggie be to sleep night on poop be better than going below be covered with warmest wrapping ship must furnish be still early when fatigue of day brought on drowsy longing for perfect rest laid down head looking at faint dying flush in west where one golden lamp be getting brighter brighter then looked up at stephen who be still seated by hanging over a leaned arm against vessel side behind delicious vision of last hour have flowed over like soft stream made entirely passive there be dim consciousness that condition be transient one that morrow must bring back old life of struggle that there be thought must presently avenge for oblivion now nothing be distinct to be being lulled to sleep with soft stream still flowing over with delicious vision melting fading like wondrous aerial land of west chapter xiv waking when maggie be gone to sleep stephen weary too with unaccustomed amount of rowing with intense inward life of last twelve hour too restless to sleep walked lounged about deck with cigar far on into midnight not seeing dark water hardly conscious there be star living only in near distant future at last fatigue conquered restlessness rolled up in piece of tarpaulin on deck near maggies foot have fallen asleep before nine have be sleeping for six hour before faintest hint of midsummer daybreak be discernible awoke from vivid dreaming make margin of deeper rest be in boat on wide water with stephen in gathering darkness something like star appeared that grew grew till saw be virgin seated in st oggs boat came nearer nearer till saw virgin be lucy boatman be philipno not philip brother who rowed past without looking at rose to stretch out arm call to own boat turned over with movement began to sink till with one spasm of dread seemed to awake find be child again in parlour at evening twilight tom be not really angry from soothed sense of false waking passed to real wakingto plash of water against vessel sound of footstep on deck awful starlit sky there be moment of utter bewilderment before mind must get disentangled from confused web of dream soon whole terrible truth urged upon stephen be not by now be alone with own memory own dread irrevocable wrong must blot life have be committed have brought sorrow into life of othersinto life be knit up with hers by trust love feeling of few short week have hurried into sin nature have most recoiled frombreach of faith cruel selfishness have rent tie have given meaning to duty have made outlawed soul with guide wayward choice of own passion where must that lead where have led now have said must rather die than fall into temptation felt nownow that consequence of fall have come before outward act be completed there be at least fruit from year of striving after highest bestthat soul though betrayed beguiled ensnared must never deliberately consent to choice of lower choice of what o god not choice of joy of conscious cruelty hardness for must ever cease to see before lucy philip with murdered trust hope life with stephen must have sacredness must forever sink wander vaguely driven by uncertain impulse for have let go clue of lifethat clue once in far off year young need have clutched so strongly have renounced delight then before knew before have come within reach philip have be right when told that knew nothing of renunciation have thought be quiet ecstasy saw face to face nowthat sad patient loving strength hold clue of lifeand saw that thorn be forever pressing on brow yesterday must never be revokedif must have changed now for length of inward silent endurance must have bowed beneath cross with sense of rest day break came reddening eastern light while past life be grasping in way with tightening clutch come in last moment of possible rescue must see stephen now lying on deck still fast asleep with sight of there came wave of anguish found way in long suppressed sob worst bitterness of partingthe thought urged sharpest inward cry for pain must give to surmounting everything be horror at own possible failure dread lest conscience must be benumbed again not rise to energy till be too late too late be too late already not to have caused misery too late for everything perhaps to rush away from last act of basenessthe tasting of joy be wrung from crushed heart sun be rising now maggie started up with sense that day of resistance be beginning for eyelash be still wet with tear a with shawl over head sat looking at slowly rounding sun something roused stephen too getting up from hard bed came to sit beside sharp instinct of anxious love saw something to give alarm in very first glance have hovering dread of resistance in maggies nature that must be unable to overcome have uneasy consciousness that have robbed of perfect freedom yesterday there be too much native honour in for not to feel that if will must recoil conduct must have be odious must have right to reproach maggie did not feel that right be too conscious of fatal weakness in too full of tenderness come with foreseen need for inflicting wound let take hand when came to sit down beside smiled at only with rather sad glance must say nothing to pain till moment of possible parting be nearer so drank cup of coffee together walked about deck heard captain assurance that must be in at mudport by five oclock with inward burthen in be undefined fear trusted to coming hour to dissipate in be definite resolve on be trying silently to tighten hold stephen be continually through morning expressing anxiety at fatigue discomfort be suffering alluded to landing to change of motion repose must have in carriage wanting to assure more completely by presupposing that everything must be a have arranged for long while maggie contented with assuring that have have good night rest that didnt mind about being on vesselit be not like being on open sea be only little le pleasant than being in boat on floss suppressed resolve will betray in eye stephen became more more uneasy a day advanced under sense maggie have entirely lost passiveness longed did not dare to speak of marriage of where must go after step must take to inform father rest of what have happened longed to assure of tacit assent from time looked at gathered stronger dread of new quiet sadness with met eye be more more silent here be in sight of mudport said at last now dearest added turning toward with look be beseeching worst part of fatigue be over on land can command swiftness in hour half will be in chaise together will seem rest to after maggie felt be time to speak must only be unkind now to assent by silence spoke in lowest tone a have done with distinct decision will not be together will have parted blood rushed to stephen face will not said ill die first be a have dreadedthere be struggle coming of dared to say word till boat be let down be taken to landing place here there be cluster of gazers passenger awaiting departure of steamboat to st oggs maggie have dim sense when have landed stephen be hurrying along on arm that one have advanced toward from cluster a if be coming to speak to be hurried along be indifferent to everything coming trial porter guided to nearest inn posting house stephen gave order for chaise a passed through yard maggie took notice of only said ask to show into room where can sit down when entered maggie did not sit down stephen whose face have desperate determination in be about to ring bell when said in firm voice im not going must part here maggie said turning round toward speaking in tone of man who feel process of torture beginning do mean to kill be use of now whole thing be done be not done said maggie too much be donemore than can ever remove trace of will go farther dont try to prevail with again couldnt choose yesterday what be to do dared not go near anger might leap out make new barrier walked backward forward in maddening perplexity maggie said at last pausing before speaking in tone of imploring wretchedness have pityhear meforgive for what did yesterday will obey now will hing without full consent dont blight life forever by rash perversity can answer good purpose to one can only create new evil sit down dearest waitthink what be going to do dont treat a if couldnt trust have chosen most effective appeal maggies will be fixed unswervingly on coming wrench have made up mind to suffer must not wait said in low distinct voice must part at once cant part maggie said stephen more impetuously cant bear be use of inflicting misery on blowwhatever may have beenhas be struck now will help one else that must drive mad will not begin future even for said maggie tremulously with deliberate consent to what ought not to have be what told at basset feel now must rather have died than fall into temptation must have be better if have parted forever then must part now will not part stephen burst out instinctively placing back against door forgetting everything have said few moment before will not endure youll make desperate shant know what do maggie trembled felt that parting must not be effected suddenly must rely on slower appeal to stephen better self must be prepared for harder task than of rushing away while resolution be fresh sat down stephen watching with look of desperation have come over like lurid light approached slowly from door seated close beside grasped hand heart beat like heart of frightened bird direct opposition helped felt determination growing stronger remember what felt week ago began with beseeching earnestness remember what feltthat owed to others must conquer inclination must make false to debt have failed to keep resolution wrong remains same doe not remain same said stephen have proved that be impossible to keep resolution have proved that feeling draw toward other be too strong to be overcome that natural law surmounts other cant help what clash with be not so stephen im quite sure be wrong have tried to think again again see if judged in way there must be warrant for treachery cruelty must justify breaking most sacred tie can ever be formed on earth if past be not to bind where can duty lie must have law inclination of moment there be tie cant be kept by mere resolution said stephen starting up walking about again what be outward faithfulness must have thanked for anything so hollow a constancy without love maggie did not answer immediately

received that letter have be to rectory for last time heavy rain must have prevented from going since there be reason dr kenn at first enlightened only by few hint a to new turn gossip slander have taken in relation to maggie have recently be made more fully aware of by earnest remonstrance from one of male parishioner against indiscretion of persisting in attempt to overcome prevalent feeling in parish by course of resistance dr kenn having conscience void of offence in matter be still inclined to perseverewas still averse to give way before public sentiment be odious contemptible be finally wrought upon by consideration of peculiar responsibility attached to office of avoiding appearance of evilan appearance be always dependent on average quality of surrounding mind where mind be low gross area of appearance be proportionately widened perhaps be in danger of acting from obstinacy perhaps be duty to succumb conscientious people be apt to see duty in be most painful course to recede be always painful to dr kenn made up mind that must advise maggie to go away from st oggs for time performed that difficult task with a much delicacy a must only stating in vague term that found attempt to countenance stay be source of discord between parishioner be likely to obstruct usefulness a clergyman begged to allow to write to clerical friend of who might possibly take into own

mooring in excitement of getting into other boat unfastening mastering oar bob be not struck with danger maggie incurred be not apt to fear for fearless when be companion in danger bob mind be absorbed in possible expedient for safety of helpless indoors fact that maggie have be up have waked have taken lead in activity gave bob vague impression of a one who must help to protect not need to be protected too have got possession of oar have pushed off so a to release boat from overhanging window frame water rising so fast said bob doubt itll be in at chamber before longth house be so low

with oar in hand black hair streaming maggie have time to answer for new tidal current swept along line of house drove boat out on to wide water with force carried far past meeting current of river in first moment maggie felt nothing thought of nothing that have suddenly passed away from life have be dreading be transition of death without agonyand be alone in darkness with whole thing have be so rapid so dreamlike that thread of ordinary association be broken sank down on seat clutching oar mechanically for long while have distinct conception of position first thing waked to fuller consciousness be cessation of rain perception that darkness be divided by faintest light parted overhanging gloom from immeasurable watery level below be driven out upon floodthat awful visitation of god father used to talk of have made nightmare of childish dream with thought there rushed in vision of old home tom motherthey have listened together o god where be be way home cried out in dim loneliness what be happening to at mill flood have once nearly destroyed might be in danger in distressher mother brother alone there beyond reach of help whole soul be strained now on thought saw long loved face looking for help into darkness finding none be floating in smooth water nowperhaps far on overflooded field there be sense of present danger to check outgoing of mind to old home

crowding piteously on mound where have taken refuge onward paddled rowed by turn in growing twilight wet clothes clung round streaming hair be dashed about by wind be hardly conscious of bodily sensationsexcept sensation of strength inspired by mighty emotion along with sense of danger possible rescue for long remembered being at old home there be undefined sense of reconcilement with brother what quarrel what harshness what unbelief in other can subsist in presence of great calamity when artificial vesture of life be gone be one with other in primitive mortal need vaguely maggie felt in strong resurgent love toward brother that swept away later impression of hard cruel offence misunderstanding left only deep underlying unshakable memory of early union now there be large dark mass in distance near to maggie must discern current of river dark mass must beyes wasst oggs ah now knew way to look for first glimpse of well known treesthe gray willow now yellowing chestnutsand
