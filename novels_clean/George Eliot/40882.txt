sleepless night be so afraid lest emotion must deprive of presence of mind necessary to due attention to particular in coming interview that continued to occupy sight touch with object have stirred

let seek to know what be if possible to declare if be really going to find face to face with man who have be annette husband who be father if wandering of from light have brought punishment of blind sacrilege a issue of conscious transgression prayed that might be able to accept consequence of pain to saw other possibility concerning claimant of book chain ignorance suspicion a to history character of annette husband made credible that have laid plan for convincing of death a mean of freeing from burdensome tie seemed equally probable that be really dead that article of property have be bequest payment even sale to present owner indeed in year there be knowing into how many hand such pretty trifle might have passed claimant might after have connection with debarrys might not come on day next there might be more time left for reflection prayer possibility must remove pressing need for difficult action mr lyon represented to have effective belief in belief went with strongest feeling in moment strongest feeling be dead trembled under weight seemed already added to own sin felt already confronted by annette husband esther father perhaps father be gentleman on visit to debarrys there be hindering pang with old man said to child will not be sorry to leave poor home will be guilty in sight be walking about among row of book when there came loud rap at outer door rap shook so that sank into chair feeling almost powerless lyddy presented here be ever such fine man from manor want to see sir dear heart dear heart will tell be too bad to see show up said mr lyon making effort to rally when christian appeared minister half rose leaning on arm of chair said be seated sir seeing nothing that tall man be entering have brought letter from mr debarry said christian in off hand manner rusty little man in dismal chamber seemed to ulysses of steward room pitiable sort of human curiosity to whom man of world must speak rather loudly in accommodation to eccentricity be likely to be accompanied with deafness one can not be eminent in everything if mr christian have dispersed faculty in study must have enabled to share unconventional point of view might have worn mistaken kind of boot be le competent to win at cart at betting in other contest suitable to person of figure a seated mr lyon opened letter held close to eye so that face be hidden at word servant must not avoid starting looking off letter toward bearer christian knowing what be in letter conjectured that old man be amazed to learn so distinguished looking personage be servant leaned forward with elbow on knee balanced cane on finger began whispering whistle minister checked finished reading of letter then slowly nervously put on spectacle to survey man between whose fate own there might be terrible collision word servant have be fresh caution to must hing rashly esther lot be deeply concerned here be seal mentioned in letter said christian mr lyon drew pocket book from desk after comparing seal with impression said be right sir deliver pocket book to held out with seal christian rose to take saying carelessly other thing chain little book be mine name then be maurice christian spasm shot through mr lyon have seemed possible that might hear name be freed from worse half of anxiety next word be not wisely chosen escaped impulsively have other name what do mean said christian sharply be so good a to reseat christian did not comply be rather in hurry sir said recovering coolness if suit to restore to small article of mine will be glad must rather leave behind than be detained have reflected that minister be simply punctilious old bore question meant nothing else mr lyon have wrought up to task of finding out then there if possible whether not be annette husband how must lay sin before god if wilfully declined to learn truth nay sir will not detain unreasonably said in firmer tone than before how long have article be property oh for more than twenty year said christian carelessly be not altogether easy under minister persistence for very reason showed more impatience have be in france in germany have be in most country on continent be so good a to write name said mr lyon dipping pen in ink holding out with piece of paper christian be much surprised not now greatly alarmed in rapid conjecture a to explanation of minister curiosity have alighted on one might carry advantage rather than inconvenience be not going to commit before oblige there sir said laying down pen looking straight at mr lyon must know exactly reason have for putting question to be stranger to excellent person dare say have concern about farther than to get from small article do still doubt that be mine wished think that must tell what locket be like have pair of hand blue flower on one side name annette round hair on other side be have to say if wish for anything more from will be good enough to tell why wish now then sir what be concern with cool stare hard challenging voice with word be uttered made fall like beating cutting chill of heavy hail on mr lyon sank back in chair in utter irresolution helplessness how be possible to lay bare sad sacred past in answer to call a dread with have thought of man coming strongly confirmed suspicion that be really annette husband intensified antipathy created by gesture glance sensitive little minister knew instinctively that word must cost effort a painful a obedient footstep of wounded bleeding hound will foreseen throe must fall on man a pressure of tender finger fall on brazen glove esther if man be father additional word might help to bring down irrevocable perhaps cruel consequence on thick mist seemed to have fallen where mr lyon be looking for track of duty difficult question how far be to care for consequence in seeking avowing truth seemed anew obscured thing like vision of coming calamity be compressed into moment of consciousness nothing must be done to day everything must be deferred answered christian in low apologetic tone be true sir have told can demand have sufficient reason for detaining property further handed note book chain to christian who have be observing narrowly now said in tone of indifference a pocketed article very good sir wish good morning good morning said mr lyon feeling while door closed behind guest that mixture of uneasiness relief procrastination of difficulty produce in mind capable of strong forecast work be still to be done have still before task of learning everything must be learned about man relation to esther christian a made way back along malthouse lane be thinking old fellow have got secret in head be not likely can know anything about must be about bycliffe bycliffe be gentleman how must ever have have anything to do with seedy old ranter a chapter xv doubt will be a lead upon foot of thy most anxious will mr lyon be careful to look in at felix a soon a possible after christian departure to tell that trust be discharged during rest of day be somewhat relieved from agitating reflection by necessity of attending to ministerial duty rebuke of rebellious singer being one of on return from monday evening prayer meeting be so overcome with weariness that went to bed without taking note of object in study when rose next morning mind once more eagerly active be arrested by philip debarry letter still lay open on desk be arrested by precisely that portion have be unheeded day before will consider doubly fortunate if at time can point out to method by may procure a lively satisfaction a be now feeling in full speedy relief from anxiety owe to considerate conduct to understand how word must carry suggestion actually have for minister in crisis of peculiar personal anxiety struggle must bear in mind that for many year have walked through life with sense of having for space be unfaithful to what esteemed highest trust ever committed to man ministerial vocation in mind of nobleness lapse into transgression against object still regarded a supreme issue in new purer devotedness chastised by humility watched over by passionate regret so be with ardent spirit animated little body of rufus lyon once in life have be blinded defeated hurried along by rebellious impulse have gone astray after own desire have let fire die out on altar a true penitent hating self besotted error asks from coming life duty instead of joy service instead of ease so rufus be perpetually on watch lest must ever again postpone to private affection great public opportunity to be equivalent to command now here be opportunity brought by combination of unexpected incalculable kind might be regarded a divine emphasis invoking especial attention to trivial event opportunity of securing what rufus lyon have often wished for a mean of honoring truth exhibiting error in character of stammering halting short breathed usurper of office dignity what be more exasperating to zealous preacher with whom copious speech be not difficulty relief who never lacked argument only combatant listener than to reflect that there be thousand on thousand of pulpit in kingdom supplied with handsome sounding board occupying advantageous position in building far larger than chapel in malthouse yard building sure to be place of resort even a market be if only from habit interest that pulpit be filled rather made vacuous by men whose privileged education in ancient centre of instruction issued in twenty minute formal reading of tepid exhortation probably infirm deduction from premise based on rotten scaffolding be in nature of exasperation gradually to concentrate sincere antipathy of dog toward cat in general necessarily take form of indignant barking at neighbor black cat make daily trespass bark at imagined cat though frequent exercise of canine mind be yet comparatively feeble mr lyon sarcasm be not without edge when dilated in general on elaborate education for teacher issued in minimum of teaching found whetstone in particular example of bad system known a rector of treby magna there be nothing positive to be said against rev augustus debarry life must not be pronounced blameworthy except for negative good rufus be too pure minded not to be glad of that have delight in vice a discrediting wicked opponent shrank from dwelling on image of cruelty grossness indignation be habitually inspired only by moral intellectual mistake darken soul injure degrade temple of body if rector have be le respectable man rufus must have more reluctantly made object of antagonism a incarnation of soul destroying error dissociated from baser sin have good repute even with worldly must be argumentative luxury to get into close quarter with fight with dialectic short sword in eye of treby world

to sincere withstander rufus lyon malthouse yard after writing letter good rufus felt that serenity elevation of mind be infallibly brought by preoccupation with wider relation of thing already be beginning to sketch course argument might most judiciously take in coming debate thought be running into sentence marking off careful exception in parenthesis have come down seated at breakfast table quite automatically without expectation of toast coffee when esther voice touch recalled to inward debate of kind in felt much weaker again there arose before image of cool hard eyed worldly man who might be dear child father one against whose right have grievously offended always a image recurred to mr lyon heart sent forth prayer for guidance definite guidance have yet made visible for must not be guidance be temptation said let matter rest seek to know more know only what be thrust upon remembrance that in time of wandering have wilfully remained in ignorance of fact might have enquired after deepened impression that be now imperative duty to seek fullest attainable knowledge enquiry might possibly issue in blessed repose by putting negative on suspicion more vividly circumstance

hoped to go to heaven be not easy to converse with on earth touching deeper secret of experience be still le able to advise a to wisest procedure in case of high delicacy with worldling who have carefully trimmed whisker fashionable costume for first time in life occurred to minister that must be glad of adviser who have more worldly than spiritual experience that might not be inconsistent with principle to seek light from one who have studied human law be thought to be paused upon not followed out rashly other guidance might intervene esther noticed that father be in fit of abstraction that seemed to swallow coffee toast quite unconsciously that vented from time to time low guttural interjection be habitual with when be absorbed by inward discussion did not disturb by remark only wondered whether anything unusual have occurred on sunday evening at last thought needful to say recollect what told yesterday father nay child what said mr lyon rousing that mr jermyn asked if must

door for yes have engagement lesson at half past twelve said esther bowing floating out like blue robed naad not without suffused blush a passed through doorway be pity room be so small harold transome thought girl ought to walk in house where there be hall corridor have soon dismissed chance preoccupation with esther for before door be closed again mr lyon have entered harold be entirely bent on have be object of visit minister though elector have considerable influence over liberal elector be part of wisdom in candidate to cement political adhesion by little personal regard if possible garstin be harsh wiry fellow seemed to suggest that sour whey say be original meaning of whig in scottish might suggest theoretic advantage of radicalism if must be associated with more generous presence what must conciliate personal regard of old mr lyon became curious problem to harold now little man made appearance canvassing make gentleman acquainted with many strange animal together with way of catching taming thus knowledge of natural history advance amongst aristocracy wealthy commoner of land be very glad to have secured opportunity of making personal acquaintance mr lyon said harold putting out hand to minister when jermyn have mentioned name be to address elector here in market place to morrow must have be sorry to do so without first paying respect privately to chief friend a there may be point on particularly wish to explain speak civilly sir reasonably said mr lyon with vague short sighted gaze in candidate appearance evidently went for nothing pray be seated gentleman be habit to stand placed at right angle with visitor worn look of intellectual eagerness slight frame rusty attire making odd contrast with flourishing person unblemished costume comfortable freedom from excitement group be fairly typical of difference between men who be animated by idea men who be expected to apply then drew forth spectacle began to rub with thin end of coat tail be inwardly exercising great self mastery suppressing thought of personal need jermyn presence tended to suggest in order that might be equal to larger duty of occasion be aware mr jermyn have told said harold what good service have done already mr lyon fact be man of intellect like be especially needed in case race be running be really against garstin only who call liberal though care for nothing understands nothing except interest of wealthy trader have be able to explain difference between liberal liberal a know be something like difference between fish fish comparison be not unapt sir said mr lyon still holding spectacle in hand at epoch when mind of nation have be strained on passing of one measure where great weight have to be moved require not so much selected instrument a abundant horse power be unavoidable evil of massive achievement that encourage coarse undiscriminatingness obstructive of more nicely wrought result exaggerated expectation inconsistent with intricacy of fallen struggling condition say not that compromise be unnecessary be evil attendant on imperfection must pray one to mark that where compromise broadens intellect conscience be thrust into narrower room wherefore have be object to show people that there be many who have helped to draw car of reform whose end be partial who forsake not ungodly principle of selfish alliance must only substitute syria for egypt thinking chiefly of own share in peacock gold ivory just so said harold who be quick at new language still quicker at translating other men generality into own special immediate purpose men who will be satisfied if can only bring in plutocracy buy up land stick old crest on new gateway now practical point to secure against false liberal at present be that elector must not divide vote a appears that many who vote for debarry be likely to split vote in favor of garstin be of first consequence that voter must give plumpers if divide vote ca keep out debarry may help to keep out feel confidence in asking to use influence in direction mr lyon candidate have to praise more than be graceful be aware that while belong by birth to class have root in tradition old loyalty experience have lain chiefly among who make own career depend on new rather than old have have advantage of considering national welfare under varied light have wider view than of mere cotton lord on question connected with religious liberty must stop short at measure be not thorough hope not sir hope not said mr lyon gravely finally putting on spectacle examining face of candidate whom be preparing to turn into catechumen for good rufus conscious of political importance a organ of persuasion felt duty to catechise little also to do part toward impressing probable legislator with sense of responsibility latter branch of duty somewhat obstructed catechising for mind be so urged by consideration held in danger of being overlooked that question answer bore very slender proportion to exposition be impossible to leave question of church rate without noting ground of injustice without brief enumeration of reason why mr lyon for own part must not present that passive resistance to legal imposition have be adopted by friend whose heroism in regard be nevertheless worthy of honor comprehensive talker be apt to be tiresome when be not athirst for information to be quite fair must admit that superior reticence be good deal due to lack of matter speech be often barren silence also doe not necessarily brood over full nest still fowl blinking at without remark may all while be sitting on one addled nest egg when take to cackling will have nothing to announce addled delusion harold transome be not at patient man in matter of business be quite awake to cue in case be perhaps easier to listen than to answer question jermyn who have plenty of work on hand took opportunity of rising saying a looked at watch must really be at office in five minute will find there mr transome have probably still many thing to say to mr lyon beseech sir said minister changing color by quick movement laying hand on jermyn arm beseech to favor with interview on private business evening if be possible mr lyon like others who be habitually occupied with impersonal subject be liable to impulsive sort of action snatched at detail of life a if be darting past a if be like ribbon at knee must never be tied day if be not tied on instant through spasmodic leap out of abstraction into real life constantly happened that suddenly took course have be subject of too much doubt with ever to have be determined on by continuous thought if jermyn have not startled by threatening to vanish just when be plunged in politics might never have made up mind to confide in worldly attorney odd man a mr muscat observed to have gift in pulpit there be one know better than do in lady who rarely felt judgment at loss be concession showed much piety jermyn be surprised at little man eagerness by mean answered quite cordially must come to office at eight o'clock for several reason must beg to come to oh very good will walk out see evening if possible will have much pleasure in being of use to jermyn felt that in eye of harold be appearing more valuable when service be thus in request went out mr lyon easily relapsed into politics for have be on brink of favorite subject on be at issue with fellow liberal at time when faith in efficacy of political change be at fever heat in ardent reformer many measure men be still discussing with little confidence on side be then talked about disposed of like property in near reversion cry abuse bloated pauper bloated pluralist other corruption hindering men from being wise happy have to be fought against slain such time be time of hope afterward when corps of monster have be held up to public wonder abhorrence yet wisdom happiness follow rather more abundant breeding of foolish unhappy come time of doubt despondency in great reform year hope be mighty prospect of reform have even served voter instead of drink in one place at least there have be dry election now speaker at reform banquet be exuberant in congratulation promise liberal clergyman of establishment toasted liberal catholic clergyman without allusion to scarlet catholic clergyman replied with like tender reserve dwelt on abolition of abuse on millennial blessedness generally others whose imagination be le suffused with exhalation of dawn insisted chiefly on ballot box now on question of ballot minister strongly took negative side pet opinion be usually place in minority of minority amongst own party very happily else poor opinion born with silver spoon in mouth how must get nourished fed so be with mr lyon objection to ballot have thrown out remark on subject be not quite clear to hearer who interpreted according to best calculation of probability have objection to ballot said harold think be not sort of thing have to work at just now must get other question be imminent then sir must vote for ballot said mr lyon stroking chin certainly if point came up have too much respect for freedom of voter to oppose anything offer chance of making freedom more complete mr lyon looked at speaker with pitying smile subdued h be m m harold took for sign of satisfaction be soon undeceived grieve sir grieve much pray to reconsider question for will take to root a think of political morality engage to show to impartial mind duly furnished with principle of public private rectitude that ballot must be pernicious that if be not pernicious must still be futile will show first that must be futile a preservative from bribery illegitimate influence secondly that must be in worst kind pernicious a shutting door against influence whereby soul of man character of citizen be duly educated for great function be not alarmed if detain sir be well worth while confound old man thought harold will never make canvassing call on preacher again unless have lost voice from cold be going to excuse a prudently a must by deferring subject till morrow inviting mr lyon to come to in committee room before time appointed for public speech be relieved by opening of door lyddy put in head to say if please sir here mr holt want to know if may come in speak to gentleman begs pardon be to say 'no if like to come nay show in at once lyddy young man mr lyon went on speaking to harold whom representative ought to know voter man of idea study be thoroughly welcome said harold truthfully enough though felt little interest in voteless man of idea except a diversion from subject of ballot have be standing for last minute two feeling le of victim in attitude more able to calculate on mean of escape mr holt sir said minister a felix entered be young friend of mine whose opinion on point hope to see altered who have zeal for public justice trust will never lose be glad to see mr holt said harold bowing perceived from way in felix bowed to turned to most distant spot in room that candidate shake of hand must not be welcome here formidable fellow thought capable of mounting cart in market place to morrow cross examining if say anything doe please mr lyon said felix have taken liberty with in asking to see mr transome when be engaged with have to speak to on matter must care to make public at present be one on be sure will back heard that mr transome be here so ventured to come hope will both excuse a business refers to electioneering measure be being taken by mr transome agent pray go on said harold expecting something unpleasant be not going to speak against treating voter said felix suppose buttered ale grease of sort to make wheel go belong to necessary humbug of representation wish to ask mr transome whether be with knowledge that agent of yours be bribing rough fellow who be voter collier navvy at sproxton with chance of extra drunkenness that may make posse on side at nomination polling certainly not said harold be aware dear sir that candidate be very much at mercy of agent a to mean by be returned especially when many year absence have made stranger to men actually conducting business be sure of fact a sure a sens can make said felix who then briefly described what have happened on sunday believed that be ignorant of mr transome ended be why thought good might be done by speaking to if not must be tempted to expose whole affair a disgrace to radical party be radical myself mean to work life long against privilege monopoly oppression must rather be livery servant proud of master title than must seem to make common cause with scoundrel who turn best hope of men into by word for cant dishonesty energetic protest be needle here sir said harold offended at what sounded like threat be certainly premature enough to be in bad taste in fact error of behavior in felix proceeded from repulsion be mutual be constant source of irritation to that public men on side be on whole not conspicuously better than public men on other side that spirit of innovation with be part of religion be in many of mouthpiece more of religion than faith in rotten borough be thus predisposed to distrust harold transome harold in turn disliked impracticable notion of loftiness purity disliked enthusiasm thought saw very troublesome vigorous incorporation of nonsense in felix must be foolish to exasperate in way if choose to accompany to jermyn office went on matter will be enquired into in presence think will agree with mr lyon that will be most satisfactory course doubtless said minister who liked candidate very well believed that must be amenable to argument must caution young friend against too great hastiness of word action david cause against saul be righteous one nevertheless not who clave unto david be righteous men more be pity sir said felix especially if winked at malpractice mr lyon smiled shook head stroked favorite arm deprecatingly be rather too much for man to keep conscience of party said harold if have lived in east a have must be more tolerant for example of active industrious selfishness such a have here though may not always be quite scrupulous must see how much better be than idle selfishness have heard said bridge be good thing worth helping to make though men who worked at be rogue oh yes said felix scornfully give handful of generality analogy will undertake to justify burke hare prove benefactor of specie will tolerate nuisance such a ca help question now be not whether can do away with nuisance in world with particular nuisance under nose then have better cut matter short a propose by going at once to jermyn said harold in case must bid good morning mr lyon must fain said minister looking uneasy must fain have have further opportunity of considering question of ballot with reason against need not be urged lengthily only require complete enumeration to prevent seeming hiatus where opposing fallacy might thrust in never fear sir said harold shaking mr lyon hand cordially there will be opportunity will not see in committee room to morrow think not said mr lyon rubbing brow with sad remembrance of personal anxiety will send if will permit brief writing on can meditate at leisure will be delighted good bye harold felix went out together minister going up to dull study asked whether under pressure of conflicting experience have faithfully discharged duty of past interview if cynical sprite be present riding on one of mote in dusty room may have made merry at illusion of little minister who brought so much conscience to bear on production of so slight effect confess to smiling being sceptical a to effect of ardent appeal nice distinction on gentleman who be got up inside out a candidate in style of period never smiled at mr lyon trustful energy without falling to penitence veneration immediately after for what call illusion be often in truth wider vision of past recent reality willing movement of man soul with larger sweep of world force movement toward more assured end than chance of single life see human heroism broken into unit say unit did little might a well not have be in way might break up great army into unit in way might break sunlight into fragment think that other might be cheaply parted with let rather raise monument to soldier whose brave heart only kept rank unbroken met death monument to faithful who be not famous who be precious a continuity of sunbeam be precious though of fall unseen on barrenness at present looking back on day at treby seem to that sadder illusion lay with harold transome who be trusting in own skill to shape success of own morrow ignorant of what many yesterday have determined for beforehand chapter xvii be good soothfast saw half roasted never will be raw dough be dried once more to meal crock new shapen by wheel ca turn curd to milk again now by wishing back to then having tasted stolen honey ca buy innocence for money jermyn be not particularly pleased that chance have apparently hindered harold transome from making other canvassing visit immediately after leaving mr lyon so have sent back to office earlier than have be expected to come inconvenient chance guessed at once to be represented by felix holt whom knew very well by trebian report to be young man with so little of ordinary christian motif a to making appearance getting on in world that presented handle to judicious respectable person who might be willing to make use of harold transome on side be great deal annoyed at being worried by felix in enquiry about electioneering detail real dignity honesty there be in made shrink from necessity of satisfying man with troublesome tongue be a if be to show indignation at discovery of one barrel with false bottom when have invested money in manufactory where larger smaller number of such barrel have always be made practical man must seek good end by only possible mean be to say if be to get into parliament must not be too particular be not disgraceful to be quixote theorist aiming to correct moral rule of world actually be might prove to be disgraceful harold held in detestation in mood pushed on unceremoniously to inner office without waiting to ask question when perceived that jermyn be not alone said with haughty quickness question about electioneering at sproxton can give attention to at once here be mr holt who have come to about business yes certainly said jermyn who a usual be more cool deliberate because be vexed be standing a turned round broad figure concealed person who be seated writing at bureau mr holt will doubtless make point of saving busy man time can speak at once gentleman here jermyn made slight backward movement of head be one of be true blue have simply to complain said felix that one of agent have be sent on bribing expedition to sproxton with what purpose sir may know better than do mr transome appears be ignorant of affair doe not approve jermyn looking gravely steadily at felix while be speaking at same time drew forth small sheaf of paper from side pocket then a turned eye slowly on harold felt in waistcoat pocket for pencil case approve of at said harold who hated jermyn calculated slowness conceit in own impenetrability be good enough to put stop to will mr holt know be excellent liberal said jermyn just inclining head to harold then alternately looking at felix docketing bill be perhaps too inexperienced to be aware that canvas can be conducted without action of able men who must be trusted not interfered with a to possibility of promising to put stop to procedure depends if have ever held coachman ribbon in hand a have in younger day must know that stopping be not always easy know very little about holding ribbon said felix saw clearly enough at once that more mischief have be done than must be well mended though believe if be heartily tried treatment might be reduced something might be done to hinder men from turning out in body to make noise might end in worse might be hindered from making noise on side said jermyn smiling be perfectly true if made noise on other must purpose be answered better sir harold be moving about in irritated manner while felix jermyn be speaking preferred leaving talk to attorney of whose talk liked to keep a clear a possible can only say answered felix that if make use of heavy fellow when drink be in must like responsibility might a well drive bull to roar on side a bribe set of collier navvy to shout groan lawyer may well envy command of language mr holt said jermyn pocketing bill again shutting up pencil must not be satisfied with accuracy of term must permit to check use of word 'bribery ' essence of bribery be that must be legally proved there be not such thing in rerum natura a unproved bribery there have be such thing a bribery at sproxton will answer for presence of body of stalwart fellow on liberal side will tend to preserve order for know that benefit club from pitchley district will show for debarry indeed gentleman who have conducted canvas at sproxton be experienced in parliamentary affair must not exceed necessary measure that rational judgment must dictate what mean man who call johnson said felix in tone of disgust before jermyn chose to answer harold broke in saying quickly peremptorily long short of be mr holt will desire insist that can be done by way of remedy will be done will satisfy see now of candidate difficulty said harold breaking into most agreeable smile hope will have pity for suppose must be content said felix not thoroughly propitiated bid good morning gentleman when be gone out have closed door behind harold turning round flashing in spite of angry look at jermyn said who be johnson alias suppose seems be fond of name jermyn turned perceptibly paler disagreeables of sort between harold have be too much in anticipation of late for to be taken by surprise turned quietly round just touched shoulder of person seated at bureau who now rose on contrary jermyn answered johnson in question be gentleman whom have pleasure of introducing to a one of most active helpmate in electioneering business mr johnson of bedford row london be comparatively novice in matter be engaged with james putty in two hardly contested election there must scarcely be better initiation putty be one of first men of country a agent on liberal side eh johnson think makepiece be not altogether match for not quite of same calibre haud consimili ingenio in tactic in experience makepiece be wonderful man so be putty said glib johnson too vain not to be pleased with opportunity of speaking even when situation be rather awkward makepiece for scheming putty for management putty know men sir went on turning to harold be thousand pity that have not have talent employed in service be beyond man for saving candidate money doe work with tongue will talk of anything from areopagus that sort of thing down to joke about 'where be going paddy ' know what mean sir 'back again say paddy ' excellent electioneering joke putty understands thing have said to 'johnson bear in mind there be two way of speaking audience will always like one be to tell what understand other be to tell what be used to will never be man to deny owe great deal to putty always say be most providential thing in mugham election last year that putty be not on tory side managed woman if will believe sir one fourth of men must never have voted if wife have driven to for good of family a for speaking be currently reported in london circle putty writes regularly for time have that kind of language need tell mr transome that be apex take mean tiptop nobody can get higher than think have belonged to political debating society have heard little language in time when mr jermyn first spoke to about having honor to assist in canvas of north loamshire here johnson played with watch seal balanced moment on toe very first thing said be 'and there be garstin have got putty whig must stand against whig ' said have putty on side hope mr transome go in for something of deeper color ' say that a general rule opinion go for much in return mr transome depends on who be in field before on skill of agent a radical moneyed radical be in fine position sir with care judgment with care judgment have be impossible to interrupt johnson before without most impolitic rudeness jermyn be not sorry that must talk even if made fool of for in solid shape exhibiting average amount of human foible seemed le of alias harold have insinuated to be have additional plausibility of lie with circumstance harold have thrown with contemptuous resignation into chair have drawn off one of buff glove be looking at hand when johnson gave iteration with slightly slackened pace harold looked up at broke in well then mr johnson will be glad if will use care judgment in putting end a well a can to sproxton affair else may turn out ugly business excuse sir must beg to look at matter little more closely will see that be impossible to take single step backward at sproxton be matter of necessity to get sproxton men else know to certainty other side must have laid hold of first now have undermined garstin people will use authority give little shabby treating have taken wind out of sail if by order mr jermyn here be to break promise with honest fellow offend chubb publican what must come of chubb must leave stone unturned against sir must egg on customer against collier navvy must be at nomination election same rather not same for must be there against instead of hustling people good humoredly by way of joke counterbalancing debarry cheer 'd help to kick cheering voting out of men instead of being let say dozen ahead of garstin 'd be dozen behind be speak plain english to mr transome though have highest respect for a gentleman of first rate talent position sir to judge of thing man must know english voter english publican must be poor tale indeed here mr johnson mouth took expression at once bitter pathetic that gentleman like to say nothing of good of country must have gone to expense trouble of canvas for nothing to find out of parliament at end of have seen again again look bad in cleverest man to have to sing small mr johnson argument be not le stringent because idiom be vulgar requires conviction resolution amounting to heroism not to wince at phrase class foreshadowed endurance among common ignominious trouble world be more likely to sneer at than to pity harold remained few minute in angry silence looking at floor with one hand on knee other on hat a if be preparing to start up a to undoing anything be be done down there said johnson throwing in observation a something into bargain must wash hand of sir must work knowingly against interest that young man who be just gone out believe that need be listened to hope chubb publican hate chubb must guess be at bottom of having treating stopped 'd set dozen of collier to duck in canal break head by mistake be experienced man sir hope have put clear enough certainly exposition befits subject said harold scornfully dislike of man johnson personality being stimulated by cause jermyn more than conjectured be damned unpleasant ravelled business that mr jermyn have knit up between have more to say then sir if have more command wish to intrude will wish good morning sir said johnson passing out quickly harold knew that be indulging temper must probably have restrained a foolish move if have thought there be great danger in be beginning to drop much of caution self mastery where jermyn be concerned under growing conviction that attorney have very strong reason for being afraid of reason must only be reinforced by action hostile to transome interest a for sneak like johnson gentleman have to pay not to please harold have smile at command in right place be not going to smile when be neither necessary agreeable be one of good humored yet energetic men who have gift of anger hatred scorn upon occasion though be too healthy contented for such feeling to get generated in without external occasion in relation to jermyn gift be coming into fine exercise pardon mr harold said jermyn speaking a soon a johnson went out be sorry must behave disobligingly to man who have in power to do much service who in fact hold many thread in hand admit that nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit a say speak for yourself said harold talk in tag of latin might be learned by school master foot boy find king english express meaning better in king english then said jermyn who must be idiomatic enough when be stung candidate must keep kick till be member oh suppose johnson will bear kick if bid be principal believe certainly thus far be london agent be man of substance will know what be if be necessary dare say must jump into carriage again have time to lose must go to hawkins at factory will go when harold be gone jermyn handsome face gathered blackness hardly ever wore worst expression in presence of others seldom when be alone for be not given to believe that game must ultimately go against luck have be good new condition might always turn up to give new chance if affair threatened to come to extremity between harold trusted to finding sure resource mean to see to bottom of everything if can be quite plain said jermyn to believe have be getting opinion have new light about annuity on estate be held in johnson name have inherited deuced faculty for business there be denying that will beg leave to tell that have propped up family know where must have be without if come to balancing know into scale gratitude ought to go not that be likely to feel can feel something else if make sign of setting dog on will make feel people named transome owe good deal more than owe in way mr jermyn inwardly appealed against unjust construction foresaw that old acquaintance law might put on certain item in history have known person who have be suspected of under valuing gratitude excluding from list of virtue on closer observation have be seen that if have never felt grateful have be for want of opportunity that far from despising gratitude regard a virtue most of incumbent on others toward chapter xviii little nameless unremembered act of kindness of love wordsworth tintern abbey jermyn did not forget to pay visit to minister in malthouse yard evening mingled irritation dread defiance be feeling toward harold transome in middle of day depended on too many far stretching cause to be dissipated by eight o'clock when left mr lyon house be in state of comparative triumph in belief that alone be now in possession of fact once grouped together made secret gave new power over harold mr lyon in need for help from one who have wisdom of serpent argued be not forbidden be only of hard acquirement to dovelike innocence have be gradually led to pour out to attorney reason made desire to know truth about man who called maurice christian have shown precious relic locket letter marriage certificate jermyn have comforted by confidently promising to ascertain without scandal premature betrayal whether man be really annette husband maurice christian bycliffe jermyn be not rash in making promise since have excellent reason for believing that have already come to true conclusion on subject wished to know little more of man to keep mr lyon in ignorance not difficult precaution in affair cost minister so much pain to speak of easy opportunity of getting interview with christian be sure to offer before long might even offer to morrow jermyn have seen more than once though hitherto without reason for observing with interest have heard that philip debarry courier be often busy in town seemed specially likely that must be seen there when market be to be agitated by politics new candidate be to show pace world of treby magna be centre be naturally curious to see young transome who have come from east be a rich a jew called radical characteristic equally vague in mind of various excellent ratepayer who drove to market in taxed cart in hereditary gig place at convenient window have be secured

be far too much mixing up of politics with religion at rate lady have never yet be to hear speechifying in market place be not going to begin practice esther however have heard of feminine acquaintance say that intended to sit at druggist upper window be inclined to ask father if must think of suitable place where also might see hear two inconsistent motif urged knew that felix cared earnestly for public question supposed that held one of deficiency not to care about well must try to learn secret of ardor be so strong in that animated what thought dullest form of life be not too stupid to find out self correcting motive be presently displaced by motive of different sort have be pleasant variety in monotonous day to see man like harold transome with distinguished appearance polished manner must like to see again suggested to that brighter more luxurious life on imagination dwelt without painful effort required to conceive mental condition must place in complete sympathy with felix holt be le unaccustomed prompting of be chiefly conscious when awaited father coming down to breakfast why indeed must trouble so much about felix mr lyon more serene now that have unbosomed anxiety obtained promise of help be already swimming so happily in deep water of polemic in expectation of philip debarry answer to challenge that in occupation of making few note lest certain felicitous inspiration must be wasted have forgotten to come down to breakfast esther suspecting abstraction went up to study found at desk looking up with wonder at interruption come father have forgotten breakfast be true child will come said lingering to make final stroke oh naughty father said esther a got up from chair coat collar be twisted waistcoat be buttoned wrong have not brushed hair sit down let brush again a did yesterday sat down obediently while esther took towel threw over shoulder then brushed thick long fringe of soft auburn hair very trifling act have brought to for first time yesterday meant great deal in esther little history have be habit to leave mending of father clothes to lyddy have not liked even to touch cloth garment still le have seemed thing must willingly undertake to correct toilette use brush for having once done under new sense of faulty omission affectionateness be in flowed so pleasantly a saw how much father be moved by what thought great act of tenderness that quite longed to repeat morning a sat under hand face have calm delight in that must not help kissing top of bald head afterward when be seated at breakfast said merrily father will make petit matre of by by hair look so pretty silken when be well brushed nay child trust while must willingly depart from evil habit of somewhat slovenly forgetfulness in attire

seen mr holt since sunday have father yes be here yesterday sought mr transome having matter of importance to speak upon with saw afterward in street when agreed that must call for morning before go into market place will have lyon went on smiling must not walk about in crowd without to act a special constable esther felt vexed with herself that heart be suddenly beating with unusual quickness that last resolution not to trouble about what felix thought have transformed with magic swiftness into mortification that evidently avoided coming to house when be there though used to come on slightest occasion knew that be always at home until afternoon on market day be reason why must not call for father of course be because attributed such littleness to that supposed must retain nothing else than feeling of offence toward for what have said to such distrust of good in others such arrogance of immeasurable superiority be extremely ungenerous presently said must have liked to hear mr transome speak suppose be too late to get place now be not sure must fain have go if desire dear said mr lyon who must not bear to deny esther lawful wish walk with to mr holt will learn from felix who will doubtless already have be out whether not must lead in safety to friend lambert esther be glad of proposal because if answered other purpose must be easy way of obliging felix to see of showing that be not who cherished offence when later in morning be walking toward mr holt with father met mr jermyn who stopped to ask in most affable manner whether miss lyon intended to hear candidate whether have secured suitable place ended by insisting that daughter who be presently coming in open carriage must call for if must permit be impossible to refuse civility esther turned back

over form in front of approaching mr lyon whose face showed gleam of pleasure at relief from abstracted isolation miss lyon be afraid that be at loss for spectacle sir said felix dear young friend said mr lyon laying hand on felix holt fore arm be about on level with minister shoulder be very glorious truth albeit made somewhat painful to by circumstance of present moment that a counterpoise to

in intricacy of dissertation there be not stillness around must have made movement on part seem conspicuous be impelled by anxiety to step on tribune walk up to father who paused little startled pray see whether have forgotten spectacle father if so will go home at once look for mr lyon be automatically obedient to began immediately to feel in pocket how be that miss jermyn be so friendly with dissenting parson said christian to quorlen tory printer who be intimate of grand jermyns be not dissenter surely what miss jermyn why see that fine girl who be talking to miss jermyn why be little parson daughter daughter christian gave low brief whistle seemed natural expression of surprise that rusty old ranter must have daughter of such distinguished appearance meanwhile search for spectacle

tribune when mr debarry re entered there be commotion made wait after low toned conversation with mr pendrell mr wace philip debarry stepped on to tribune with hat in hand said with air of much concern annoyance be sorry to have to tell lady gentleman doubtless owing to accidental cause trust will soon be explained a nothing serious mr sherlock be absent from residence be not to be found went out early landlady informs to refresh by walk on agreeable morning a be habit tell when have be kept up late by study have not returned let be too anxious will cause enquiry to be made in direction of walk be easy to imagine many accident not of grave character by might nevertheless be absolutely detained against will under circumstance mr lyon continued philip turning to minister presume that debate must be adjourned debate doubtless began mr lyon farther speech be drowned by general rising of church people from seat many of feeling that even if cause be lamentable adjournment be not altogether disagreeable good gracious said mr tiliot a took husband arm hope poor young man have fallen into river broken leg of more acrid dissenter whose temper be not controlled by habit of retail business have begun to hiss implying that in interpretation curate absence have not depended on injury to life limb be turned tail sure enough said mr muscat to neighbor behind lifting eyebrow shoulder laughing in way showed deacon a be looked at affair in entirely secular light mr muscat thought must be nothing right to have water dragged agreeing in with majority of church lady regret sincerely mr lyon said philip debarry addressing minister with politeness must say good morning to with sense have not be able at present to contribute to satisfaction a have wished speak not of in way of apology sir said mr lyon in tone of depression doubt not that have acted in good faith will open door of egress to construction such a anger often deems ingenious disclosure of simple truth may expose a erroneous uncharitable fabrication wish good morning sir when room be cleared of church people mr lyon wished to soothe own spirit that of flock by few reflection introductory to parting prayer there be general resistance to effort men mustered round minister declared opinion that whole thing be disgraceful to church said that curate absence have be contrived from first others more than hinted that have be folly in mr lyon to set on foot procedure in common with tory clergyman who if ever aped civility to dissenter must never do anything laugh at in sleeve brother kemp urged in heavy bass mr lyon must lose time in sending account of affair to patriot brother hawkins in high tenor observed that be occasion on stinging thing might be said with extra effect of apropos position of receiving many voiced lecture from member of church be familiar to mr lyon now felt weary frustrated doubtful of own temper felix who stood by saw that man of sensitive fibre be suffering from talker whose noisy superficiality cost nothing got exasperated seems to sir burst in with predominant voice mr lyon have hitherto have hard part of business while of congregation have have easy one punish church clergy if like can take care of punish own minister be business of mine perhaps except so far a fair play be everybody business seems to time to ask mr lyon to take little rest instead of setting on like so many wasp by speech felix raised displeasure fell on minister a well a on gained immediate end talker dropped off after slight show of persistence mr lyon quitted field of combat with small group of le imperious friend to whom confided intention of committing argument fully to paper forwarding to discriminating editor regarding personality added have not same clear showing for say that young man be pusillanimous be ill provided with argument if took stand even for moment on so poor irrelevancy a because one curate be ill furnished therefore episcopacy be false if held up one to just obloquy must be well designated incumbent of parish who calling one of church militant sends young weak kneed substitute to take place in fight mr philip debarry did not neglect to make

augustus debarry motto from st chrysostom other addition fruit of ripening leisure be sorry for poor sherlock who wanted confidence be convinced that for own part have taken course under circumstance be least compromising to church sir maximus however observed to son brother that have be right have be wrong a to danger of vague enormous expression of gratitude to dissenting preacher on difference of opinion seldom failed to remind of precedent chapter xxv fellow man divide epithet say rather be fellow man when christian quitted free school with discovery that young lady whose appearance have first startled with indefinable impression in market place be daughter of old dissenting preacher who have shown so much agitated curiosity about name felt very much like uninitiated chess player who see that piece be in peculiar position on board might open way for to give checkmate if only knew how ever since interview with jermyn mind have be occupied with charade offered to ingenuity what be real meaning of lawyer interest in in relation with maurice christian bycliffe here be secret secret be often source of profit of agreeable kind involved little labor jermyn have hinted at profit might possibly come through christian said inwardly with well satisfied self esteem that be not so pitiable nincompoop a to trust jermyn on contrary only problem before be to find out by what combination of independent knowledge must outwit jermyn elude purchase attorney have on through past history get handsome bonus by somewhat shattered man of pleasure might live well without master

lawyer of transomes knew of exchange of name between scaddon bycliffe clearly wanted to know a much a must about bycliffe history conclusion be not remote that bycliffe have have claim on transome property that difficulty have arisen from being confounded with henry scaddon hitherto other incident have be apparently connected with interchange of name mr lyon demand that must write down name maurice christian accompanied with question whether be whole name have have visible link with inference arrived at through crowder jermyn discovery made morning at free school that esther be daughter of dissenting preacher at last suggested possible link until then christian have not known why esther face have impressed so peculiarly minister chief association for be with bycliffe association

crow there be knowing what woman will not do christian must see distinct result for from industry if there be to be such result must be reached by following out clue to non legal mind there be dim possibility in law heirship prevent issue from seeming too miraculous consequence of meditation be that christian hung about treby more than usual in leisure time that on first opportunity accosted mr lyon in street with suitable civility stating since occasion have brought together week before have often wished to renew conversation with mr lyon permission must now ask to do so after being assured a have be by jermyn that courier who have happened by accident to posse memorable locket pocket book be certainly not annette husband be ignorant whether maurice christian bycliffe be living dead

turned up mr lyon must be made acquainted with hence when christian addressed minister taken by surprise shaken by recollection of former anxiety said helplessly if be business sir must perhaps do better to address to mr jermyn must not have said anything be more valuable hint to christian inferred that minister have made confidant of jermyn be needful to be wary on contrary sir answered may be of utmost importance to that what pass between must not be known to mr jermyn mr lyon be perplexed felt at once that be more in clear daylight concerning jermyn than concerning christian dared not neglect possible duty of hearing what man have to say invited to proceed to malthouse yard where must converse in private once in mr lyon study christian opened dialogue by saying that since be in room before have occurred to that anxiety have observed in mr lyon might be owing to acquaintance with maurice christian bycliffe fellow prisoner in france whom christian have assisted in getting freed from imprisonment who in fact have be owner of trifle mr lyon have recently have in possession have restored christian hastened to say that knew nothing of bycliffe history since have parted in france that knew of marriage with annette ledru have be acquainted with annette must be very glad to know what became of bycliffe if must for liked uncommonly here christian paused lyon only sat changing color trembling man bearing tone of mind be made repulsive to by being brought in contact with keenly felt memory must not readily summon courage to give answer ask question may ask if knew friend bycliffe said christian trying more direct method sir never saw ah well have seen very striking likeness of be wonderful unaccountable when saw miss lyon at free school other day must have sworn be bycliffe daughter sir said mr lyon in deepest tone half rising holding by arm of chair subject touch with too sharp point for to be justified in thrusting on out of mere levity be there good seek injury fear in relation to precisely sir will come to understanding suppose believed that young lady who go by name of miss lyon be daughter of bycliffe mr lyon moved lip silently suppose have reason to suspect that there must be great advantage for if law knew who be father sir said mr lyon shaken out of reticence must not conceal belief to be daughter will bear thing rather than deprive of right nevertheless appeal to pity of fellow man not to thrust between to let disclose truth to in good time said christian must hing rash then miss lyon be annette child minister shivered a if edge of knife have be drawn across hand tone of question by fact that intensified antipathy to christian enabled to collect for what must be simply endurance of painful operation after moment two said more coolly be true sir mother became wife proceed with statement may concern duty have more to say than if there be prize that law might hand over to bycliffe daughter be much mistaken if there be lawyer who will take precious good care to keep law hoodwinked that lawyer be mat jermyn why good sir if have be taking jermyn into confidence have be setting fox to keep off weasel strike that when be made little anxious about article of poor bycliffe put jermyn on making enquiry of eh think be right deny ah be very well did for by mean have found that be got hold of secret about bycliffe mean to stifle now sir if desire justice for daughter step daughter must say so much a wink to before jermyn if have got paper thing of sort may come in evidence a confounded rascal lawyer call clutch tight for if get into jermyn hand may soon fly up chimney have said enough have not purposed further communication with mr jermyn sir indeed have nothing further to communicate except one fact concerning daughter birth have erred in concealing from seek disclosure do tremble before then have word that will be silent about conversation between be for daughter interest mind sir will be silent said mr lyon with cold gravity unless added with acumen a to possibility rather disturbing to christian confident contempt for old man unless be called upon by tribunal to declare whole truth in relation in case must submit to authority of investigation be requisite of social order christian departed feeling satisfied that have got utmost to be obtained at present out of dissenting preacher whom have not dared to question more closely must look out for chance light perhaps too might catch stray hint by stirring sediment of mr crowder memory must not venture on enquiry might be noticed when mr lyon be alone

esther cheek be hot in spite of breeze sent hair floating backward felt inward strain demand on to see thing in light be not easy soothing when felix have asked to walk seemed so kind so alive to what might be feeling that have thought nearer to than have ever be before since have come out have appeared to forget yet be conscious that impatience of hers be very petty battling in way with own little impulse looking at birch stem opposite till gaze be too wide for to see anything distinctly be unaware how long have remained without speaking did not know that felix have changed attitude little be resting elbow on tree trunk while supported head be turned toward suddenly said in lower tone than be habitual to be very beautiful started looked round at to see whether face must give help to interpretation of novel speech be looking up at quite calmly very much a reverential protestant might look at picture of virgin with devoutness suggested by type rather than by image esther vanity be not in least gratified felt that somehow other felix be going to reproach wonder went on still looking at whether subtle measuring of force will ever come to measuring force there must be in one beautiful woman whose mind be a noble a face be beautiful who made man passion for rush in one current with great aim of life esther eye got hot smarting be use trying to be dignified have turned away head now said rather bitterly be difficult for woman ever to try to be anything good when be not believed in when be always supposed that must be contemptible dear esther be first time felix have be prompted to call by christian name a did so laid large hand on two little hand be clasped on knee believe that think contemptible when first saw know know said esther interrupting impetuously still

of what affect others be not stupid be not unfeeling can see what be better have not done injustice since knew more of said felix gently yes have said turning smiling at through tear talk to like angry pedagogue be always wise remember time when be foolish naughty be not far off said felix curtly taking away hand clasping with other at back of head talk seemed to be introducing mutual understanding such a have not existed before seemed to have undergone check will get up walk back now said esther after few moment said felix entreatingly move yet dare say will never walk together sit here again why not because be man who be warned by vision old story of vision dream guiding men have truth be saved by making future present to ourselves wish must get vision then said esther smiling at with effort of playfulness in resistance to something vaguely mournful within be what want said felix looking at very earnestly turn head do look at then will know if may go on speaking do believe in want to have vision of future that may never lose best self charm other may be flung about of attar of rose fascination nothing good strong terrible vision will save if did save might be

suspected of stupidity well woman unless be saint theresa elizabeth fry generally think sort of thing madness unless when read of in bible woman can hardly ever choose in way be dependent on what happens to must take meaner thing because only meaner thing be within reach why can imagine choosing hardship a better lot said felix looking at with sudden question in eye yes can said flushing over neck brow word be charged with meaning dependent entirely on secret consciousness of nothing have be said be necessarily personal walked few yard along road by have come without further speech till felix said gently take arm took walked home so entirely without conversation felix be struggling a firm man struggle with temptation seeing beyond disbelieving lying promise esther be struggling a woman struggle with yearning for expression of love with vexation under subjection to yearning be not likely to be satisfied be conscious of silence be unable to break till entered malthouse lane be within few yard of minister door be getting dusk felix then said will mr lyon be anxious about think not lyddy must tell went out with that carried large stick said esther with light laugh felix went in with esther to take tea conversation be entirely between mr lyon about trick of canvassing foolish personality of placard probability of transome return a to felix declared to have become

little to be reconciled with steady contemplation of divine economy be hidden from sense revealed to faith forbore reading a likely to perturb ministration esther sat by in unusual silence conviction that felix willed exclusion from life be making plain that something more than friendship between be not so thoroughly out of question a have always inwardly asserted in pain that choice lay aloof from be compelled frankly to admit to herself longing that have be otherwise that have entreated to share difficult life be like one else to have seemed to bring at once law love gave strength to obey law yet next moment stung by independence of denied that loved have only longed for moral support under negation of life if be not to have support effort seemed useless esther have be so long used to hear formula of father belief without feeling understanding that have lost power to touch first religious experience of life first self questioning first voluntary subjection first longing to acquire strength of greater motif obey more strenuous rule have come to through felix holt wonder that felt a if loss of be inevitable backsliding be certain that must lose did not believe that be really

oratorical attitude have served to light up for christian print of placard have expected copy to be various have turned half over at different depth of sheaf before drawing out offered to bill sticker suddenly clearer light have shown on one of name be just then especially interesting to more when occurring in placard intended to dissuade elector of north loamshire from voting for heir of transomes hastily turned over bill preceded succeeded that might draw out carry away of pattern for might turn out to be wiser for not to contribute to publicity of handbill contained allusion to bycliffe versus transome there be about dozen of pressed together thrust into pocket returning rest to tommy basket to take away dozen might not be to prevent similar bill from being posted up elsewhere have reason to believe that be of same kind have be sent to treby from duffield christian interest in practical joke have died out like morning rushlight apart from discovery in placard old tommy story have indication in be worth pondering over where be well informed johnson now be still understrapper of jermyn with matter in thought christian only turned in hastily at quorlen threw down black bag

imagination regarded passionate piece with contempt yet imaginary chess be easy compared with game man have to play against fellow men with other fellow men for instrument think sagacious perhaps because trust bond except of self interest only self interest can safely rely on be what seems to be such to mind must use govern can ever be sure of knowing matthew jermyn be under misgiving a to fealty of johnson have be making of johnson seems to many men a reason for expecting devotion in spite of fact that though very fond of own person life be not at all devoted to maker believe in johnson be most serviceable subordinate being man who aimed at respectability family man who have good church pew subscribed for engraving of banquet picture where there be portrait of political celebrity wished child to be more unquestionably genteel than father presented more numerous handle of worldly motive by judicious superior might get hold on useful regard to respectability have inconvenience in relation to superior be mark of vanity pride if be not touched just in right handling place be liable to become raw sensitive jermyn be aware of johnson weakness thought have flattered sufficiently on point of knowing when be disagreeable human nature be fallible lavender water smile compliment other polite falsity be constantly offensive when in very nature of can only be meant to attract admiration regard jermyn have often be unconsciously disagreeable to johnson over above constant offence of being ostentatious patron must never let johnson dine with wife daughter must not dine at johnson house when be in town often did what be equivalent to poohpoohing conversation by not even appearing to listen by suddenly cutting short with query on new subject jermyn be able politic enough to have commanded great deal of success in life must not help being handsome arrogant fond of being heard indisposed to kind of comradeship amorous bland toward woman cold contained toward men will hear very strong denial that attorney being handsome must enter into dislike excited conversation consists good deal in denial of what be true from british point of view masculine beauty be regarded very much a be in drapery business a good solely for fancy department for young nobleman artist poet clergy one who like mr lingon be disposed to revile jermyn perhaps be sir maximus have called cursed sleek handsome long winded overbearing sycophant epithet expressed rather confusedly mingled character of dislike excited serviceable john johnson sleek mindful about broadcloth cambric front have what considered spirit enough within to feel that dislike of jermyn gradually gathering force through year of obligation subjection till have become actuating motive disposed to use opportunity if did not watch for one be not motive however rather ordinary course of business accounted for johnson playing double part a electioneering agent what men do in election be not to be classed among sin mark of grace must be profane to include business in religion conscience refers to failure not to success still sense of being galled by jermyn harness be additional reason for cultivating relation be independent of pique at harold transome behavior to in jermyn office perhaps gave more zest to johnson use of pen ink when wrote handbill in service of garstin garstin incomparable agent putty full of innuendo against harold transome a descendant of durfey transomes be natural subject of self congratulation to man when special knowledge gained long ago without forecast turn out to afford special inspiration in present johnson felt new pleasure in consciousness that of people in world next to jermyn have most intimate knowledge of transome affair still better of affair be secret of jermyn if in uncomplimentary spirit might have be called jermyn man of straw be satisfaction to know that unreality of man john johnson be confined to appearance in annuity deed elsewhere be solid locomotive capable of remembering anything for own pleasure benefit to act with doubleness towards man whose conduct be double be so near approach to virtue that deserved to be called by meaner name than diplomacy by such cause came to pas christian held in hand bill in jermyn be playfully alluded to a mr german cozen who won game by clever shuffling odd trick without honor backed durfey crib against bycliffe in be adroitly implied that so called head of transomes be only tail of durfeys said durfeys must have died out left nest empty if have not be for german cozen johnson have not dared to use recollection except such a might credibly exist in other mind besides own in truth of case one have prompting to recall out worn scandal be likely enough that such foul winged thing must be revived by election heat for johnson to escape suspicion christian must gather only dim uncertain inference from flat irony heavy joking one chief thing be clear to have be right in conjecture that jermyn interest about bycliffe have source in claim of bycliffe on transome property then there be that story of old bill sticker closely considered indicated that right of present transomes depended at least have depended on continuance of other life christian in time have gathered enough legal notion to be aware that possession by one man sometimes depended on life of that man might sell own interest in property interest of descendant while claim on property must still remain to one else than purchaser supposing descendant became extinct interest have sold be at end under what condition claim might be valid void in particular case be darkness to suppose bycliffe have such claim on transome estate how be christian to know whether at present moment be worth anything more than bit of rotten parchment old tommy trounsem have said that johnson knew about even if johnson be still above ground johnson be mortal might still be understrapper of jermyn in case knowledge must be on wrong side of hedge for purpose of henry scaddon immediate care must be to find out must about johnson blamed for not having questioned tommy further while have at command on head bill sticker must hardly know more than le dilapidated denizen of treby now have happened that during week in christian have be at work trying to solve enigma of jermyn interest about bycliffe johnson mind also have be somewhat occupied with suspicion conjecture a to new information on subject of old bycliffe claim jermyn intended to conceal from letter after interview with christian jermyn have written with sense of perfect safety to faithful ally johnson be a know written to johnson who have found self love incompatible with faithfulness of be supposed to be foundation anything that patron felt inconvenient for obliged friend servant to know became by very fact object of peculiar curiosity obliged friend servant secretly doted on patron inconvenience provided that did not share conjecture naturally became active johnson legal imagination being very differently furnished from christian be at loss to conceive condition under there might arise new claim on transome estate have before whole history of settlement of estate made hundred year ago by john justus transome entailing whilst in possession on son thomas heir male with remainder to bycliffes in fee knew that thomas son of john justus proving prodigal have without knowledge of father tenant in possession sold own descendant right to lawyer cousin named durfey therefore title of durfey transomes in spite of old durfey trick to show contrary depended solely on purchase of base fee thus created by thomas transome that bycliffes be remainder men who might fairly oust durfey transomes if ever issue of prodigal thomas went clean out of existence ceased to represent right have bargained away from johnson a jermyn subordinate have be closely cognizant of detail concerning suit instituted by successive bycliffes of whom maurice christian bycliffe be last on plea that extinction of thomas transome line have actually come to pas weary suit have eaten into fortune of two family have only made cankerworm fat suit have closed with death of maurice christian bycliffe in prison before death jermyn exertion to get evidence that there be still issue of thomas transome line surviving a security of durfey title have issued in discovery of thomas transome at littleshaw in stonyshire who be representative of pawned inheritance death of maurice have made discovery useless have made seem wiser part to say nothing about fact have remained secret known only to jermyn johnson other bycliffe be known believed to exist durfey transomes might be considered safe unless yes there be unless johnson must conceive heir heiress of bycliffes if such personage turned out to be in existence might sometime raise new valid claim when once informed that wretched old tommy trounsem bill sticker tottering drunkenly on edge of grave be last issue remaining above ground from dissolute thomas who played esau part century before while poor old bill sticker breathed durfey transomes must legally keep possession in spite of possible bycliffe proved real not when parish have buried bill sticker still be one thing to conceive condition to see chance of proving existence johnson at present have glimpse of such chance even if ever gained glimpse be not sure that must ever make use of enquiry of medwin in obedience to jermyn letter have extracted only negative a to information possessed by lawyer of bycliffe concerning marriage expectation of offspring on part johnson felt not le stung by curiosity to know what jermyn have found out that have found something in relation to possible bycliffe johnson felt pretty sure thought with satisfaction that jermyn must not hinder from knowing what already knew about thomas transome issue many thing might occur to alter policy give new value to fact be certain that jermyn must always be fortunate when greed unscrupulousness exhibit on grand historical scale there be question of peace war amicable partition often occurs that gentleman of high diplomatic talent have mind bent on same object from different point of view perhaps be thinking of certain duchy province with view to arranging ownership in such way a will best serve purpose of gentleman with high diplomatic talent in whom be more especially interested select mind in high office can never miss aim from ignorance of other existence whereabouts high title may be learned even by common people from pocket almanac with meaner diplomat who might be mutually useful such ignorance be often obstructive mr john johnson mr christian otherwise mr scaddon might have have concentration of purpose ingenuity of device fitting to make figure in parcelling of europe yet might never have met simply because johnson knew nothing of christian because christian did not know where to find johnson chapter xxx nature be too noble for world must not flatter neptune for trident jove for power to thunder heart mouth what breast forge that tongue must vent being angry doth forget that ever heard name of death coriolanus christian johnson did meet however by mean be quite incalculable incident brought into communication be due to felix holt who of men in world have least affinity for industrious idle parasite mr lyon have urged felix to go to duffield on fifteenth of december to witness nomination of candidate for north loamshire minister wished to hear what took place pleasure of gratifying helped to outweigh opposing reason will get into rage at something other felix have said have told one of weak point where have particular business must incur risk nature brings have particular business at duffield however will make holiday go by dint of seeing folly will get lesson in patience weak point to felix referred be liability to be carried completely out of

moodiness irritability be full of long suffering toward unwise mother who pressed daily with word urged so that soul be vexed have chosen to fill day in way required utmost exertion of patience required little rill like outflowings of goodness in mind of great energy must be fed from deep source of thought passionate devotedness in way energy served to make gentle now in twenty sixth year of life have ceased to make angry except in presence of something roused deep indignation when once exasperated passionateness of nature threw off yoke of long trained consciousness in thought emotion have be more more completely mingled concentrated in rage a ungovernable a of boyhood be thoroughly aware of liability knew that in such circumstance must not answer for sensitive people with feeble frame have often same sort of fury within be shattered shatter nothing felix have terrible arm knew that be dangerous avoided condition might cause exasperation a must have avoided intoxicating drink if have be in danger of intemperance nomination day be great epoch of successful trickery to speak in more parliamentary manner of war stratagem on part of skilful agent mr johnson have share of inward chuckling self approval a one who might justly expect increasing renown be day in a general request a great putty to have pleasure praise of electioneering ingenuity also to get paid for without too much anxiety whether ingenuity will achieve ultimate end perhaps give to select person sort of satisfaction in superiority to more agitated fellow men be worthy to be classed with generous enjoyment of having truth chiefly to of seeing others in danger of drowning while be high dry seem to have be regarded a unmixed privilege by lucretius lord bacon one of mr johnson great success be spratt hated manager of sproxton colliery in careless confidence that collier other laborer under must follow order have provided cart to carry load of voteless enthusiasm to duffield on behalf of garstin enthusiasm being already paid for by recognized benefit of garstin existence a capitalist with share in sproxton mine be not to cost much in form of treating capitalist be held worthy of pious honor a cause why workingman existed mr spratt did not sufficiently consider that cause be to be proved by argument testimony be not object of passionate devotion to collier visible cause of beer act on much more strongly even if there have be love of far off garstin hatred of too immediate spratt must have be stronger motive hence johnson calculation made long ago with chubb remarkable publican have be well founded there have be diligent care to supply treating at duffield in name of transome after election be over be not improbable that there must be much friendly joking between putty johnson a to success of trick against putty employer johnson must be conscious of rising in opinion of celebrated senior for show of hand cheering hustling pelting roaring hissing hard hit with small missile soft hit with small joke be strong enough on side of transome to balance similar demonstration for garstin even with debarry interest in favor inconvenient presence of spratt be easily got rid of by dexterously managed accident sent bruised limping from scene of action mr chubb have never before felt so thoroughly that occasion be up to level with talent while clear daylight in virtue must appear when at election voted a duty to bound for garstin only gave thorough repose of conscience felix holt be only person looking on at senseless exhibition of nomination day who knew from beginning history of trick with sproxton men have be aware along that treating at chubb have be continued so far harold transome promise have produced no good fruit what be observing to day a watched uproarious crowd convinced that whole scheme must be carried out just a if have never spoken about must be fair enough to transome to allow that might have wished yet have be unable with notion of success to keep promise bitterness toward candidate only took form of contemptuous pity for felix be not sparing in contempt for men who put inward honor in pawn by seeking prize of world scorn fell too readily on fortunate when saw johnson passing to fro speaking to jermyn on hustings felt getting angry jumped off wheel of stationary cart on be mounted that might no longer be in sight of man whose vitiating cant have made blood hot finger tingle on first day of encountering at sproxton be little too exasperating to look at pink faced rotund specimen of prosperity to witness power for evil lay in vulgar cant backed by man money to know such stupid iniquity flourished flag of reform liberalism justice to needy while roaring scuffling be still going on felix with thick stick in hand made way through crowd walked on through duffield street till came out on grassy suburb where house surrounded small common here walked about in breezy air ate bread apple telling that angry haste of about evil must only be remedied slowly must be nothing else than obstructive might day saw so clearly that thought seemed like presentiment be obstructive of own work not to waste energy to apply force where must tell to do small work close at hand not waiting for speculative chance of heroism preparing for be rule have be constantly urging on what must be greater waste than to beat scoundrel who have law

turbid red hair who be insisting on political point with much more ease than have seemed to belong to gentleman speaker on hustings others to scotch vendor of article useful to sell whose unfamiliar accent seemed to have guarantee of truth in wanting a association with everyday english rough looking pipe smoker distinguished cigar smoker chose to walk up down in isolation silence majority of who have shown burning interest in nomination have disappeared cockade no longer studded close pressed crowd like also very unlike meadow flower among grass street pavement be strangely painted with

when left group round speaker in flannel shirt stood at corner of side street speaker be elevated by head shoulder above hearer not because be tall because stood on projecting stone at opposite corner of turning be great inn of fox hound be ultra liberal quarter of high street felix be at once attracted by group liked look of speaker whose bare arm be powerfully muscular though have pallid complexion of man who life chiefly amidst heat of furnace be leaning against dark stone building behind with folded arm grimy paleness of shirt skin standing out in high relief against dark stone building behind lifted up one forefinger marked emphasis with a spoke voice be high not strong felix recognized fluency method of habitual preacher lecturer be fallacy of monopolist be saying know what monopolist be men who want to keep trade to under pretence that will furnish public with better article know what come to in country poor man ca afford to buy spoonful of salt yet there be salt enough in world to pickle living thing in be sort of benefit monopolist do to mankind be men who tell be to let politics alone will govern better without knowing anything about must mind business be ignorant have time to study great question tell greatest question in world be how to give man man share in what go on in life hear hear said felix in sonorous voice seemed to give new impressiveness to what speaker have said one looked at well washed face educated expression along with dress more careless than of most well to do workman on holiday made appearance strangely arresting not pig share speaker went on not horse not share of machine fed with oil only to make work nothing else be man share just to mind pin making glass blowing higgle about own wage bring up family to be ignorant son of ignorant father better prospect be slave share want freeman share be to think speak act about what concern see whether fine gentleman who undertake to govern be doing best can for have got knowledge say very well have got want there be many one must be idle if hunger did pinch stomach set to work there be fable told where noble be belly people member make sort of fable say be belly that feel pinch will set aristocrat great people who call brain to work at way of satisfying bit better aristocrat be pretty sure to try govern for own benefit how be to be sure will try govern for ours must be looked after think like other workman must have what call inspector to see whether work well done for want to send inspector to parliament well say have got reform bill what more can want send inspector say reform bill be trick be nothing swearing in special constable to keep aristocrat safe in monopoly be bribing of people with vote to make hold tongue about giving vote to rest say if man

remembered else what doe religion mean why do build church endow that son may get paid well for preaching saviour making a little like a can be if want to believe in jesus christ must shut eye for fear must see parson what be bishop bishop person dressed up who sits in house of lord to help throw out reform bill because be hard to get anything in shape of man to dress up like do such work have to give palace for plenty of thousand year then cry out 'the church be in danger ' 'the poor man church ' why be poor man church because can have seat for nothing think be for nothing for must be hard to tell what get by if poor man have vote in matter think 'd choose different sort of church to what be do think aristocrat will ever alter if belly doe pinch not be part of monopoly will supply with

ca do a like must be shaken up in one bag with say if workingman be ever to get man share must have universal suffrage annual parliament vote by ballot electoral district something else before said felix again startling audience into looking at speaker glanced coldly at went on be what sir francis burdett went in for fifteen year ago be right thing for if be tomfool who went in for must lay hold of such handle a can believe much in liberal aristocrat if there be fine carved gold headed stick of aristocrat will make broomstick of will lose time will sweep with be what think about transome if of have acquaintance among county voter give hint that wish to vote for transome at last word speaker stepped down from slight eminence walked away rapidly like man whose leisure be exhausted who must go about business have left appetite in audience for further oratory one of seemed to express general sentiment a hurried immediately to felix said come sir what do say felix did at once what must very likely have done without being asked stepped on stone took off cap by instinctive prompting always led to speak uncovered effect of figure in relief against stone background be unlike of previous speaker be considerably taller head neck be more massive expression of mouth eye be something very different from mere acuteness rather hard lipped antagonism of trade union man felix holt face have look of habitual meditative abstraction from object of mere personal vanity desire be peculiar stamp of culture make very roughly cut face worthy to be called human face divine even lion dog know distinction between men glance doubtless duffield men in expectation with looked up at felix be unconsciously influenced by grandeur of full yet firm mouth calm clearness of gray eye be somehow unlike what be accustomed to see along with old brown velveteen coat absence of chin propping when began to speak contrast of voice be still stronger than of appearance man in flannel shirt have not be heard have probably not cared to be heard beyond immediate group of listener felix at once drew attention of person comparatively at distance in opinion said almost moment after be addressed that be true word spoken by friend when said great question be how to give man man share in life think expects voting to do more toward than do want workingman to have power be workingman want to be anything else there be two sort of power there be power to do mischief to undo what have be done with great expense labor to waste destroy to be cruel to weak to lie quarrel to talk poisonous nonsense be sort of power that ignorant number have never made joint stool planted potato do think be likely to do much toward governing great country making wise law giving shelter food clothes to million of men ignorant power come in end to same thing a wicked power make misery be sort of power want workingman to have can see plainly enough that having vote will do little toward at present hope child that come after will get plenty of political power time tell everybody plainly hope there will be great change that time whether live to see not men will have come to be ashamed of thing be proud of now must like to convince that vote must never give political power worth having while thing be a be now that if go right way to work may get power sooner without vote perhaps who hear be sober men who try to learn a much of nature of thing a can to be a little like fool a possible fool idiot be one who expects thing to happen never can happen pours milk into can without bottom expects milk to stay there more of such vain expectation man have more be fool idiot if working man expects vote to do for what never can do be foolish to amount if more think that be clear enough eh hear hear said several voice be not of original group belonged to stroller who have be attracted by felix holt vibrating voice be tory from crown among be christian who be smoking cigar with pleasure always felt in being among people who did not know doubtless took to be something higher than really be hearer from fox hound also be slowly adding to nucleus felix accessible to pleasure of being listened to went on with more more animation way to get rid of folly be to get rid of vain expectation of thought agree with nature of thing men who have have true thought about water what will do when be turned into steam under sort of circumstance have made great power in world be turning wheel of engine will help to change most thing engine must have done if there have be false notion about way water must act now scheme about voting district annual parliament rest be engine water steam force be to work must come out of human nature out of men passion feeling desire whether engine will do good work bad depends on feeling if have false expectation about men character be very much like idiot who think will carry milk in can without bottom in opinion notion about what mere voting will do be very much of sort be very fine said man in dirty fustian with scornful laugh how be to get power without vote will tell be greatest power under heaven said felix be public opinion ruling belief in society about what be right what be wrong what be honorable what be shameful be steam be to work engine how can political freedom make better more than religion believe in if people laugh wink when see men abuse defile while public opinion be what be while men have better belief about public duty while corruption be not felt to be damning disgrace while men be not ashamed in parliament out of to make public question concern welfare of million mere screen for own petty private end say fresh scheme of voting will much mend condition for take workingman of sort suppose out of hundred who have vote there be thirty who have soberness sense to choose with good feeling to make wish right thing for suppose there be seventy out of hundred who be half of not sober who have sense to choose one thing in politics more than who have so little good feeling in that wasted on own drinking money must have helped to feed clothe wife child half of who if did drink be too ignorant stupid to see good for better than pocketing five shilling piece when be offered where must be political power of thirty sober men power must lie with seventy drunken stupid vote will tell what sort of men must get power what sort of men must end by returning whom pleased to parliament felix have seen face around have particularly noticed recent addition to audience now looked about without appearing to fix glance on one in spite of cooling meditation hour ago pulse be getting quickened by indignation desire to crush what hated be likely to vent in articulation tone became more biting must be men who must undertake to do business for candidate return men who have real opinion who pilfer word of opinion turn into cant will serve purpose at moment men who look out for dirty work to make fortune by because dirty work want little talent conscience men who know in out of bribery because there be not cranny in own soul where bribe ca enter such men a will be master wherever there be majority of voter who care more for money for drink more for mean little end be own nobody else than for anything have ever be called right in world for suppose there be poor voter named jack who have seven child twelve fifteen

call good sound well known english name a green baker wilson let say johnson felix be interrupted by explosion of laughter from majority of bystander eye have be turned on johnson who stood on right hand of felix at very beginning of description be gradually followed by others till at last hearer attention be fixed on first burst of laughter from two three who knew attorney name let one sufficiently into secret to make amusement common johnson who have kept ground till name be mentioned now turned away looking unusually white after being unusually red feeling by attorney instinct for pocket book a if felt be case for taking down name of witness well dressed hearer turned away too thinking have have cream of speech in joke against johnson a thing worth telling helped to recall to scene of dinner who be johnson said christian to young man who have be standing near have be one of first to laugh christian curiosity have naturally be awakened by what might prove golden opportunity oh london attorney act for transome tremendous fellow at corner there be red hot radical demagogue johnson have offended suppose else must have turned in way on man of own party have heard there be

credit for being in midst of danger added smiling with determination not to show much feeling sit down tell have happened sat down at extremity of old black sofa felix said to tell truth have shut up

hope nobody have be much hurt fear be that may turn out again by by giving way so soon may not be altogether good sign there be great number of heavy fellow in town if go drink more last end may be worse than first however felix broke off a if talk be futile clasped hand behind head leaning backward looked at esther who be looking at may stay here little while said after moment seemed long pray do said esther coloring to relieve took work bowed head over stitching be in reality little heaven to that felix be there saw beyond saw that by by must be gone that must be farther on way not toward

love nothing own resolution suppose reply in same sort of strain said esther with little toss of head how why think willow woman incapable of believing what be best in setting down everything be too high for a deficiency parry what say answer there be expression of painful beseeching in tone with felix said esther let work fall on lap looked at be unable to speak want to tell once that know must be easier to to give up to loving being loved a other men do when can than to breaking off in speech be something quite new in felix for first time have lost self possession turned eye away be at

came in front of good bye said very gently not daring to put out hand esther put up hers instead of speaking just pressed then went away heard door close behind felt free to be miserable cried bitterly if might have married felix holt must have be good woman felt trust that must ever be good without felix reproached must have done better not to speak in way prompting to have chiefly listened have be desire to prove to esther that set high value on feeling must not help seeing that be very important to be too simple sincere man to ape sort of humility must not have made better if have possessed such pretence turn life into sorry drama felix wished esther to know that love be dear to a beloved dead be dear felt that must not marry that must ruin other life have longed for to know fully that will to be always apart from be renunciation not easy preference in be thoroughly generous yet now subtle mysterious conjuncture of impression circumstance have made speak questioned

got out of town skirted little while looking across december stillness of field then re entered by main road into market place thinking that after must be better for to look at busy doings of men than to listen in solitude to voice within wished to know how thing be going on be now nearly half past one felix perceived that street be filling with more than previous crowd by time got in front of booth be so surrounded by men who be being thrust hither thither that retreat must have be impossible went where be obliged to go although height strength be above average even in crowd where there be so many heavy armed workman used to pickaxe almost shabby coated trebians must have be there entry back street of town did not supply mass of crowd besides rural incomers of more decent rougher sort felix a be pushed along thought discerned here there men of keener aspect be only common in manufacturing town at present there be evidence of distinctly mischievous design there be only evidence that majority of crowd be excited with drink that action must hardly be calculated on more than of ox pig congregated amidst hootings pushing confused deafening shout incidental fighting knocking over pulling scuffling seemed to increase moment such of constable a be mixed with crowd be quite helpless if official staff be seen above head moved about fitfully showing a little sign of guiding hand a summit of buoy on wave doubtless many hurt bruise have be received one must know amount of injury be widely scattered be clear that more voting must be done poll have be adjourned probability of serious mischief have grown strong enough to prevail over rector objection to getting military aid within reach when felix re entered town galloping messenger have already be dispatched to duffield rector wished to ride out again read riot act from point where must be better heard than from window of marquis mr crow high constable who have returned from closer observation insisted that risk must be too great new special constable have be sworn in mr crow said prophetically that if once mischief began mob be past caring for constable rector voice be ringing penetrating when appeared on narrow balcony read formula commanding men to go to home about lawful business there be strong transient effect one within hearing listened for few moment after final word god save king comparative silence continued then people began to move buzz rose again grew grew till turned to shout roaring a before movement be that of flood hemmed in carried nobody away whether crowd must obey order to disperse within hour be doubt that approached nearer to negative certainty presently mr crow who called tactician took well intentioned step went far to fulfill own prophecy have arrived with magistrate by back way at seven star here again riot act be read from window with much same result a before rector have returned by same way to marquis a headquarters most suited for administration mr crow remained at other extremity of king street where awe striking presence be certainly needed seeing that time be passing effect from voice of law have disappeared showed at upper window addressed crowd telling that soldier have be sent for that if did not disperse must have cavalry upon instead of constable mr crow like other high constable more celebrated in history enjoyed bad reputation be to say enjoyed many thing caused reputation to be bad be anything popular in treby be probable that pleasant message must have lost something from lip what actually said be so unpleasant that instead of persuading crowd appeared to enrage one snatching raw potato from sack in green grocer shop behind threw at constable hit on mouth straightway raw potato turnip be flying by twenty at window of seven star pane be smashed felix who be way up street heard voice turning to savage roar saw rush toward hardware shop furnished more effective weapon missile than turnip potato then cry ran along that tory have sent for soldier if among mob who called tory a willingly a anything else be disposed to take called tory side only helped main result of reckless disorder there be proof that predominant will of crowd be against debarry men in favor of transome several shop be invaded be of tory shop tradesman who must do so now locked door barricaded window within there be panic among householder of hitherto peaceful town general anxiety for military to arrive rector be in painful anxiety on head have sent out two messenger a secretly a must toward hathercote to order soldier to ride straight to town feared that messenger have be somehow intercepted be three o'clock more than hour have elapsed since reading of riot act rector of treby magna wrote indignant message sent to ram to mr rector of little treby saying that there be evidently radical animus in mob that mr transome party must hold peculiarly responsible where be mr jermyn mr lingon replied that be going out toward duffield to see after soldier

passing into evening disorder must be aggravated by obscurity horror of fire be a likely to happen a minor evil constable a many of a must do so armed with carbine sabre respectable inhabitant who have courage prepared to struggle for order many felt with mr wace mr tiliot that nearest duty be to defend brewery spirit wine vault where property be of sort at once most likely to be threatened most dangerous in effect rector with fine determination got on horseback again a best mode of leading constable who must only act efficiently in close body by direction column of armed men avoided main street made way along back road that might occupy two chief lane leading into wine vault of brewery bear down on crowd from opening be especially desirable to guard meanwhile felix holt have be hotly occupied in king street after first window smashing at seven star there be sufficient reason for damaging inn to utmost destructive spirit tends toward completeness object once maimed otherwise injured be a readily doomed by unreasoning men a by unreasoning boy also seven star sheltered spratt to sproxton men in front of inn be exasperating that spratt must be safe sound on day when blow be going justice might be rendered again there be general desirableness of being inside public house felix have at last be willingly urged on to spot hitherto swayed by crowd have be able to hing defend keep on leg foresaw that people must burst into inn heard cry of spratt fetch out will pitch out pummel be not unlikely that life might be sacrificed be intolerable to felix to be witnessing blind outrage of mad crowd yet be doing nothing to counteract even vain effort must satisfy better than mere gazing within wall of inn might save one went in with miscellaneous set who dispersed with different object to tap room to search for cellar up stair to search in room for spratt one else perhaps a temporary scapegoat for spratt guided by scream of woman felix at last got to high up stair passage where landlady of servant be running away in helpless terror from two three half tipsy men who have be emptying spirit decanter in bar assuming tone of mob leader cried out here boy here better fun way come with drew men back with along passage reached lower staircase in time to see unhappy spratt being dragged coatless screaming down step one at present be striking kicking seemed a if be being reserved for punishment on wider area where satisfaction might be more generally shared felix followed close determined if must to rescue assailers assaulted from worst consequence mind be busy with possible device down stair out along stone through gateway spratt be dragged a mere heap of linen cloth rag when be got outside gateway there be immense hooting roaring though many there have grudge against only guessed that others have grudge be narrower part of street widened a went onward spratt be dragged on enemy cry will make ring will see how frightened look kick have done with felix heard say let go to tiliot vault there be more gin there here be two hideous threat in dragging spratt onward people be getting very near to lane leading up to tiliot felix kept a close a must to threatened victim have thrown away own stick carried bludgeon have escaped from hand of invader at seven star head be bare looked to undiscerning eye like leading spirit of mob in condition be observed by several person looking anxiously from upper window finally observed to push by violent effort close behind dragged man meanwhile foremost among constable who coming by back way have now reached opening of tiliot lane discerned that crowd have victim amongst one spirited fellow named tucker who be regular constable feeling that time be to be lost in meditation called on neighbor to follow with sabre happened to be weapon got away for where be not expected by dint of quick resolution at moment spratt have be let go have be dropped in fact almost lifeless with terror on street stone men round have retreated for little space a if to amuse with looking at felix have taken opportunity seeing first step toward plan be bent on sprang forward close to cowering spratt a did tucker have cut way to spot imagining felix to be destined executioner of spratt for discrimination of tucker lay in muscle rather than eye rushed up to felix meaning to collar throw down felix have rapid sens quick thought discerned situation chose between two evil quick a lightning frustrated constable fell upon tried to master weapon in struggle be watched without interference constable fell undermost felix got weapon started up with bare sabre in hand crowd round cried hurray with sense that be on side against constable tucker did not rise immediately felix did not imagine that be much hurt touch said felix let go here bring spratt follow felix be perfectly conscious that be in midst of tangled business have chiefly before imagination horror might come if mass of wild chaotic desire impulse around be not diverted from further attack on place where must get in midst of intoxicating inflammable material be not moment in spirit like must calculate effect of misunderstanding a to nature never make men who be at once energetically sympathetic minutely calculating believed have power be resolved to try to carry dangerous mass out of mischief till military came to awe supposed from mr crow announcement long time ago must be near event be followed more willingly because tiliot lane be seen by hindmost to be now defended by constable of whom have firearm where there be strong counter movement proposition to do something be unspecified stimulates stupid curiosity to many of sproxton men who be within sight of felix be known personally vaguely believed to be man who meant many queer thing not at of everyday kind pressing along like leader with sabre in hand inviting to bring on spratt there seemed better reason for following than for doing anything else man with definite will energetic personality act a sort of flag to draw bind together foolish unit of mob be on sort of influence over men whose mental state be mere medley of appetite confused impression felix have dared to count hurried along with word of invitation telling to hold up spratt not drag behind followed with growing belief that have design worth knowing while in front be urged along partly by same notion partly by sense that there be motive in behind not knowing what motive be be that mixture of pushing forward being pushed forward be brief history of most human thing what felix really intended to do be to get crowd by nearest way out of town induce to skirt on north side with keeping up in idea that be leading to execute stratagem by must surprise something worth attacking circumvent constable who be defending lane in meantime trusted that soldier must have arrived with sort of mob be animated by real political passion fury against social distinction be in highest degree unlikely that there must be resistance to military force presence of fifty soldier must probably be enough to scatter rioting hundred how numerous mob be one ever knew many inhabitant afterward be ready to swear that there must have be at least two thousand rioter felix knew be incurring great risk blood be up hardly allow enough in common life for result of enkindled passionate enthusiasm under other condition make world famous deed be making for point where street branched off on one side toward speedy opening between hedgerow on other toward shabby wideness of pollard end at forking of street there be large space in centre of there be small stone platform mounting by three step with old green finger post upon felix went straight to platform stepped upon cry halt in loud voice to men behind before calling to who held spratt to bring there came to stand with face toward finger post perhaps for first time extremity of crowd got definite idea that man with sabre in hand be taking command now said felix when spratt have be brought to stone platform faint trembling have anybody got cord if not handkerchief knotted fast give to drew out own handkerchief two three others be mustered handed to ordered to be knotted together while curious eye be fixed on be going to have spratt hanged felix kept fast hold of weapon ordered others to act now put round waist wind arm in draw little backward so tie fast on other side of post when be done felix said imperatively leave there will come back to let make haste march along lad up park street down hobb lane be best chance must think of for saving spratt life succeeded pleasure of seeing helpless man tied up sufficed for moment if there be who have ferocity enough to count much on coming back to nobody imagination represented certainty that one out of house at hand must soon come untie when be left alone rioter pushed up park street noisy stream with felix still in midst of though be laboring hard to get way to front wished to determine course of crowd along by road called hobb lane must have taken to other duffield end of town urged several of men round one of whom be le person than big dredge old sproxton acquaintance to get forward be sure that fellow must go down lane else must spoil sport hitherto felix have be successful have gone along with unbroken impulse soon something occurred brought with terrible shock sense that plan might turn out to be a mad a bold project be seen to be when have failed mingled with more headlong half drunken crowd there be sharp visaged men who loved irrationality of riot for something else than own sake who at present be not so much richer a desired to be for pain have taken in coming to treby election induced by certain prognostic gathered at duffield on nomination day that there might be condition favorable to confusion be always harvest time be known to of sharp men park street led out toward grand house of treby manor be a good nay better for purpose than bank while felix be entertaining ardent purpose other son of adam be entertaining ardent purpose of peculiar sort moment have come when be to have triumph from front rank backward toward felix there ran new summons new invitation let go to treby manor from moment felix be powerless new definite suggestion overrode vaguer influence there be determined rush past hobb lane not down felix be carried along too did not know whether to wish contrary once on road out of town with opening into field with wide park at hand must have be easy to liberate from crowd at first seemed to better part to do to get back to town a fast a must in hope of finding military getting detachment to come save manor reflected that course of mob have be sufficiently seen that there be plenty of people in park street to carry information faster than must seemed more necessary that must secure presence of help for family at manor by going there debarrys be not of class of people be wont to be anxious about felix holt conscience be alive to accusation that danger might be in now be brought on by deed of in moment of bitter vexation disappointment did occur to very unpleasant consequence might be hanging over of kind quite different from inward dissatisfaction be useless now to think of averting such consequence a be pressed along with multitude into treby park very movement seemed to only image of day fatality in multitudinous small wickedness of small selfish end really undirected toward larger result have issued in widely shared mischief might yet be hideous illustration felix wounded in riot light be declining already candle shone through many window of manor already foremost part of crowd have burst into office adroit men be busy in right place to find plate after setting others to force butler into unlocking cellar felix have only just be able to force way on to front terrace with hope of getting to room where must find lady of household comfort with assurance rescue must soon come when sound of horse foot convinced that rescue be nearer than have expected just a heard horse have approached large window of room where brilliant light suspended from ceiling showed group of woman clinging together in terror others of crowd be pushing way up terrace step gravel slope at various point hearing horse kept post in front of window motioning with sabre cried out to oncomers keep back hear soldier coming scrambled back paused automatically louder louder sound of hoof changed pace distribution halt fire bang bang bang came deafening ear of men on terrace before

to about treating of sproxton men of subsequent irritating scene in jermyn office when personage with inauspicious name of johnson have expounded to impossibility of revising electioneering scheme once begun of turning vehicle back when have already begun to roll downhill remembering felix holt word of indignant warning about hiring men with drink in to make noise harold must not resist urgent impression that offence for felix be committed be fatality not brought about by willing co operation of with noisy rioter arising probably from rather ill judged effort to counteract violence urgent impression insisted on growing into conviction became in one of phase uneasy sense that held evidence must at once tend to exonerate felix to place agent in anything desirable light be likely that one

failed in use of indirectness be helped very little by fact that rival be men to whom that indirectness be something human very far from being alien there remains grand distinction that have failed

question to begin with now at later stage of event be more innocent than ever of bearing anything most sincere ill will be more utterly exasperated with than must probably have be if one great passion have be for public virtue jermyn with john johnson have added ugly dirty business of treby election to long accumulating list of offence harold be resolved to visit on to utmost have seen handbill carrying insinuation that there be discreditable indebtedness to jermyn on part of transomes if such notion existed apart from electioneering slander there be more reason for letting world see jermyn severely punished for abusing power over family affair tampering with family property world certainly must see with a little delay a possible cool confident assuming fellow must be bled to last drop in compensation connection with be finally got rid of now that election be done with harold meant to devote to private affair till everything lay in complete order under supervision morning be seated

to in way of indulgence luxury to make up for old niggardly life certainly transome court be now such home a many woman must covet yet even harold own satisfaction in midst of elegant comfort needed at present to be sustained by expectation of gratified resentment be obviously le bright enjoying than usual mother who watched closely without daring to ask question have gathered hint drawn inference enough to make feel sure that there be storm gathering between jermyn did not dare to ask question yet have not resisted temptation to say something bitter about harold failure to get returned a radical helping with feminine self defeat to exclude more completely from consultation by in way poor woman whose power lie solely in influence make like music out of tune only move men to run away morning harold have ordered letter to be brought to at breakfast table be not usual practice mother must see that there be london business letter about be eager have found out that letter

left table went into long drawing room where might relieve restlessness by walking up down catch sound of jermyn entrance into harold room be close by here moved to fro amongst rose colored satin of chair curtain great story of world reduced for to little tale of own existence dull obscurity everywhere except where keen light fell on narrow track of own lot wide only for woman anguish at last heard expected ring footstep opening closing door unable to walk about longer sank into large cushioned chair helpless prayerless be not thinking of god anger mercy of son be thinking of what might be brought not by death by life chapter xxxv m check to queen n nay own king be bare moving so give checkmate when jermyn entered room harold who be seated at library table examining paper with back toward light face toward door moved head coldly jermyn said ungracious good morning a little a possible like salutation to one who might regard a patron on attorney handsome face there be black cloud of defiant determination slightly startling to harold who have expected to feel that overpowering weight of temper in interview be on own side nobody be ever prepared beforehand for expression of jermyn face seemed a strongly contrasted with cold impenetrableness preserved under ordinary annoyance of business a with bland radiance of lighter moment harold did not look amiable just then anger be of sort seek vent without waiting to give fatal blow be that of nature more subtly mixed than jermyn le animally forcible le unwavering in selfishness with more of high bred pride looked at jermyn with increased disgust secret wonder sit down said curtly jermyn seated in silence opened greatcoat took paper from side pocket have written to makepeace said harold to tell to take entire management of election expense so will transmit account to very well be come morning on other business if be about riot prisoner have only to say that will enter into plan if be called on will say what know about young fellow felix holt people may prove what can about johnson damnable trick yours be not come to speak about riot agree with in thinking that subordinate subject when jermyn have black cloud over face never hesitated drawled made latin quotation be so good then a to open business at once said harold in tone of imperious indifference be precisely what wish to do have here information from london correspondent that be about to file bill against in chancery jermyn a spoke laid hand on paper before looked straight at harold in case question for be how far conduct a family solicitor will bear investigation be question will consider quite apart from doubtless prior to that there be question must consider together tone in jermyn said gave unpleasant shock to harold sense of mastery be possible that must have weapon wrenched out of hand will know what to think of replied a haughtily a ever when have stated what question be simply whether will choose to retain family estate lay open to be forthwith legally deprived of presume refer to underhand scheme of own on par with annuity have drained by in name of johnson said harold feeling new movement of anger if so have better state scheme to lawyer dymock halliwell think will approve of stating in own ear first of that depends on will whether remain important landed proprietor in north loamshire whether retire from country with remainder of fortune have acquired in trade jermyn paused a if to leave time for morsel to be tasted what do mean said harold sharply not scheme of mine state of fact resulting from settlement of estate made in state of fact render father title own title to family estate utterly worthless a soon a claimant be made aware of right intend to inform that depends be only person who have requisite knowledge rest with to decide whether will use that knowledge against whether will use in favor by putting end to evidence must serve to oust in spite of 'robust title of occupancy jermyn paused again have be speaking slowly without least hesitation with bitter definiteness of enunciation there be moment two before harold answered then said abruptly believe thought be more shrewd said jermyn with touch of scorn thought understood have have too much experience to waste time in telling fable to persuade man who have put into attitude of deadly enemy well then say at once what proof be said harold shaking in spite of getting nervous have inclination to be lengthy be not more than few week since ascertained that there be in existence heir of bycliffes old adversary of family more curiously be only few day ago in fact only since day of riot that bycliffe claim have become valid that right of remainder accrues to heir in question how pray said harold rising from chair making turn in room with hand thrust in pocket jermyn rose too stood near hearth facing harold a moved to fro by death of old fellow who got drunk be trampled to death in riot be last of thomas transome line by purchase of whose interest family got title to estate title died with be supposed that line have become extinct before on supposition old bycliffes founded claim hunted up man just about time last suit be closed death must have be of consequence to if there have not be bycliffe in existence happen to know that there be that fact can be legally proved for minute two harold did not speak continued to pace room while jermyn kept position holding hand behind at last harold said from other end of room speaking in scornful tone sound alarming be not to be proved simply by statement clearly have here document with copy will back statement be opinion given on case more than twenty year ago bear signature of attorney general first conveyancer of day jermyn took up paper have laid on table opening slowly coolly a went on speaking a harold advanced toward may suppose that spared pain to ascertain state of title in last suit against maurice christian bycliffe threatened to be hard run document be result of consultation give opinion must be taken a final authority may cast eye over if please will wait time may read summing up here jermyn ended holding out one of paper to harold pointing to final passage harold took paper with slight gesture of impatience did not choose to obey jermyn indication confine to summing up ran through document in truth be too much excited really to follow detail be rather acting than reading till at once threw into chair consented to bend attention on passage to jermyn have pointed attorney watched a read twice re read to sum up be of opinion that title of present possessor of transome estate can be strictly proved to rest solely upon base fee created under original settlement of to be good so long only a issue exists of tenant in tail by whom that base fee be created feel satisfied by evidence that such issue exists in person of thomas transome otherwise trounsem of littleshaw upon decease without issue be of opinion that right in remainder of bycliffe family will arise right must not be barred by statute of limitation when harold eye be on signature to document for third time jermyn said a turned out case being closed by death of claimant have occasion for producing thomas transome who be old fellow told of enquiry about set agog after be dropped came into neighborhood thinking there be something fine in store for here if like to take be memorandum about repeat that died in riot proof be ready repeat that to knowledge mine only there be bycliffe in existence know how proof can be made out harold rose from chair again again paced room be not prepared with defiance where be bycliffe said at last stopping in walk facing round toward jermyn decline to say more till promise to suspend proceeding against harold turned again looked out of window without speaking for moment two be impossible that there must not be conflict within at present be very confused one at last said person be in ignorance of claim yes have be brought up in inferior station yes said jermyn keen enough to guess part of what be going on in harold mind there be harm in leaving in ignorance question be purely legal one a said before complete knowledge of case a one of evidence lie exclusively with can nullify evidence can make tell with certainty against choice lie with must have time to think of said harold conscious of terrible pressure can give time unless promise to suspend proceeding then when ask will lay detail before not without thorough understanding beforehand if engage not to use knowledge against must engage in writing on being satisfied by detail will cancel hostile proceeding against will not institute fresh one on strength of occurrence now past well must have time said harold more than ever inclined to thrash attorney feeling bound hand foot with knot that be not sure must ever unfasten be to say said jermyn with black browed persistence will write to suspend proceeding again harold paused be more than ever exasperated be threatened mortified confounded by necessity for immediate decision between alternative almost equally hateful to be with difficulty that must prevail on to speak conclusive word walked a far a must from jermyn to other end of room then walked back to chair threw into at last said without looking at jermyn agree must have time very well be bargain no further than said harold hastily flashing look at jermyn further than require time therefore give to of course require time to consider whether pleasure of trying to ruin to whom be really indebted be worth loss of transome estate will wish good morning harold did not speak to look at again jermyn walked out of room a appeared outside door closed behind mr transome showed white face at door opened on level with harold in such way that be just possible for jermyn not to see availed of possibility walked straight across hall where there be servant in attendance to let out a if believed that one be looking at who must expect recognition did not want to speak to mr transome at present have nothing to ask from one disagreeable interview have be enough for morning be convinced that have avoided be too proud to arrest be a insignificant now in eye a in son men have memory in heart said to herself bitterly then turning into sitting room heard voice of mr transome little harry at play together must have given great deal at moment if feeble husband have not always lived in dread of temper tyranny so that might have be fond of now felt loveless if be important to one be only to old waiting woman denner chapter xxxvi be thing then necessity then let meet like necessity shakespeare henry iv see now virtue living in word hobson will think of swearing be noon when saw dobson at may day fair to prove poor dobson did not rob mail 't be neighborly to save neighbor neck what harm in lying when mean harm say 't be perjury then hobson quake will none of perjury thus word embalm conscience of mankind roman law bring still conscience to poor hobson aid few men must have felt otherwise than harold transome felt if having reversion tantamount to possession of fine estate carrying association with old name considerable social importance be suddenly informed that there be person who have legal right to deprive of advantage that person right having never be contemplated by one a more than chance being quite unknown to in ordinary case shorter possession than harold family have enjoyed be allowed by law to constitute indefeasible right if in rare peculiar instance law left possessor of long inheritance exposed to deprivation a consequence of old obscure transaction moral reason for giving legal validity to title of long occupancy be not le strong nobody must have said that harold be bound to hunt out alleged remainder man urge right upon on contrary world must have laughed at such conduct must have be thought interesting patient for mad doctor unconscious remainder man be probably much better off left in original station harold must not have be called upon to consider existence if have not be presented to in shape of threat from one who have power to execute threat in fact what must have done have circumstance be different be much clearer than what must choose to do feel compelled to do in actual crisis must not have be disgraced if on valid claim being urged have got lawyer to fight out for on chance of eluding claim by adroit technical management nobody off stage must be sentimental about thing pretend to shed tear of joy because estate be handed over from gentleman to mendicant sailor with wooden leg chance remainder man be perhaps such specimen of inheritance a drunken fellow killed in riot world must think actual transomes in right to contest adverse claim to utmost then be not certain that must win in contest not winning must incur other loss besides of estate there have be little too much of such loss already why if be not wrong to contest claim must feel most uncomfortable scruple about robbing claim of sting by getting rid of evidence be mortal disappointment be sacrifice of indemnification to abstain from punishing jermyn even if brought mind to contemplate that a wiser course still shrank from what looked like complicity with jermyn still shrank from secret nullification of just legal claim if have only known detail if have known who alleged heir be might have seen way to course must not have grated on sense of honor dignity jermyn have be too acute to let harold know have even carefully kept to masculine pronoun believed that there be one besides who must must make harold wiser went home persuaded that between interview next must have together harold must be left to inward debate founded entirely on information have given have not much doubt that result must be what desired harold be fool there be many good thing liked better in life than irrational vindictiveness did happen that after writing to london in fulfillment of pledge harold spent many hour over inward debate be not very different from what jermyn imagined took everywhere with on foot on horseback be companion through great deal of night nature be not of kind given to internal conflict have never before be long undecided puzzled unaccustomed state of mind be so painfully irksome to rebelled so impatiently against oppression of circumstance in quick temperament habitual decision must not help that added tenfold to hatred of jermyn who be cause of thus a temptation to avoid risk of losing estate grew grew till scruple looked minute by side of difficulty of bringing to make compact with jermyn seemed more more insurmountable have seen that attorney be much too confident in calculation while harold be being gulled by subjection to jermyn knowledge independent information be on way to messenger be christian who after a complete survey of probability a be capable of have come to conclusion that most profitable investment must make of peculiar experience testimony in relation to bycliffe bycliffe daughter be to place at disposal of harold transome be afraid of jermyn utterly distrusted johnson thought be secure in relying on harold transome care for own interest preferred above issue prospect of forthwith leaving country with sum at least for good while must put at ease when only three morning after interview with jermyn dominic opened door of harold sitting room said that meester chreestian mr philip debarry courier acquaintance of own at naples requested to be admitted on business of importance harold immediate thought be that business referred to so called political affair be just now chief association with name of debarry though seemed oddness requiring explanation that servant must be personally intermediary assented expecting something rather disagreeable than otherwise christian wore morning perfect manner of subordinate who be not servile always adopted toward unquestionable superior mr debarry who preferred having one about with a little resemblance a possible to regular servant have singular liking for adroit quiet mannered christian must have be amazed to see insolent assumption be capable of in presence of people like mr lyon who be of account in society christian have that sort of cleverness be said to know world be to say knew price current of most thing aware that be looked at a messenger while remained standing near door with hat in hand said with respectful ease will probably be surprised sir at coming to speak to on own account in fact must not have thought of doing so if business did not happen to be something of more importance to than to one else come from mr debarry then said harold with surprise sir business be secret if please must remain so be pledge be demanding from said harold rather suspiciously having ground for confidence in man of christian position yes sir be obliged to ask le than will pledge not to take mr jermyn into confidence concerning what pass between with heart said harold something like gleam passing over face circulation have become more rapid what have have to do with jermyn have not mentioned to then have sir certainly not never christian thought aha mr jermyn be keeping secret well be said aloud then mr jermyn have never mentioned to sir what believe be aware of there be danger of new suit being raised against on part of bycliffe to get estate ah said harold starting up placing with back against mantelpiece be electrified by surprise at quarter from information be coming fresh alarm be counteracted by flashing thought that might be enabled to act independently of jermyn in rush of feeling must utter more than interjection christian concluded that harold have previous hint be fact came to tell of from other motive than kindness to presume said harold with slight approach to smile certainly said christian a quietly a if have be stating yesterday weather must not have folly to use affectation with mr transome lost considerable property early in life be now in receipt of salary simply in affair have just mentioned to can give evidence will turn scale against have wish to do so if will make worth while to leave country harold listened a if have be legendary hero selected for peculiar solicitation by evil one here be temptation in more alluring form than before because be sweetened by prospect of eluding jermyn desire to gain time served purpose of caution resistance indifference to speaker in case helped to preserve perfect self command be aware said coolly silence be not commodity worth purchasing unless be loaded there be many person dare say who must like to pay travelling expense for might hardly be able to show that be worth while wish to state what know well be necessary preliminary to further conversation think will see mr transome that a matter of justice knowledge can give be worth something quite apart from future appearance non appearance a witness must take care of own interest if anything must hinder from choosing to satisfy for taking essential witness out of way must at least be paid for bringing information can tell who where bycliffe be can give notion of whole affair yes have talked to lawyer not jermyn who be at bottom of law in affair must not count on wish of mine to suppress evidence remove witness name price for information in case must be paid higher for information say two thousand pound two thousand devil burst out harold throwing into chair again turning shoulder toward christian new thought crowded upon fellow may want to decamp for reason other said to more people besides jermyn know about evidence seems whole thing may look black for if come out will be believed to have bribed to run away whether not thus outside conscience came in aid of inner will not give one sixpence for information said resolutely until time have made clear that intend to decamp will be forthcoming when be called for on term have objection to give note specifying that after fulfilment of condition be after occurrence of suit understanding that suit be to occur will pay certain sum in consideration of information now give christian felt caught in vise in first instance have counted confidently on harold ready seizure of offer to disappear after word have seemed to cast doubt on presupposition have inwardly determined to go away whether harold wished not if must get sufficient sum did not reply immediately harold waited in silence inwardly anxious to know what christian must tell with vision at present so far cleared that be determined not to risk incurring imputation of having anything to do with scoundrelism be very much indebted to such linking of event a make doubtful action look wrong christian be reflecting that if stayed faced possible inconvenience of being known publicly a henry scaddon for sake of what might get from esther must at least be wise to be certain of money from harold transome since turned out to be of so peculiar disposition a to insist on punctilious honesty to own disadvantage did think of making bargain with other side if so might be content to wait for knowledge till came in other way christian be beginning to be afraid lest must get nothing by clever move of coming to transome court at last said think sir two thousand must not be unreasonable sum on condition will not give two thousand allow to say sir must consider that there be one whose interest be to tell a much a will even if must since mr jermyn who know have not thought fit to tell there may be use think of in getting information at once well think gentleman must act liberally under such circumstance so will must not take le than thousand pound really must not be worth while if mr jermyn knew gave information must endeavor to injure will give thousand said harold immediately for christian have unconsciously touched sure spring at least will give note to effect spoke of wrote a have promised gave paper to christian now be circuitous said harold seem to have business like gift of speech who where be bycliffe will be surprised to hear sir that be supposed to be daughter of old preacher lyon in malthouse yard good god how can that be said harold at once first occasion on have seen esther rose in memory little dark parlor graceful girl in blue with surprisingly distinguished manner appearance in way old lyon by strange mean other married bycliffe widow when girl be baby preacher did want girl to know that be not real father told that be image of bycliffe whom knew well uncommonly fine woman step like queen have seen said harold more than ever glad to have purchased knowledge now go on christian proceeded to tell knew including conversation with jermyn except so far a have unpleasant relation to then said harold a detail seemed to have come to close believe that miss lyon supposed father be at present unaware of claim might be urged for on strength of birth believe so need not tell where lawyer be on scent can never be sure of anything long together must remind sir that have promised to protect from mr jermyn by keeping confidence never fear depend upon will betray nothing to mr jermyn christian be dismissed with good morning while cultivated friendly reminiscence with dominic harold sat chewing cud of new knowledge finding not altogether so bitter a have expected from first after interview with jermyn recoil of harold mind from idea of strangling legal right threw on alternative of attempting compromise middle course might be possible must be le evil than costly lawsuit than total renunciation of estate now have learned that new claimant be woman young woman brought up under circumstance must make fourth of transome property seem to immense fortune sex social condition be of sort lie open to many softening influence having seen esther be inevitable that amongst various issue agreeable disagreeable depicted by harold imagination there must present possibility must unite two claim own felt to be rational esther apparently be legal claim harold a have constantly said to mother be not marrying man did not contemplate bringing wife to transome court for many year to come if at having little harry a heir preferred freedom western woman be not to taste showed transition from feebly animal to thinking being be simply troublesome harold preferred slow witted large eyed woman silent affectionate with load of black hair weighing much more heavily than brain have seen such woman in england except one have brought with from east therefore harold did not care to be married until unless surprising chance presented now that chance have occurred to suggest marriage to must not admit to that contemplated marrying esther a plan be only obliged to see that issue be not inconceivable be not going to take step expressly directed toward end what have made up mind to a course most satisfactory to nature under present urgency be to behave to esther with frank gentle manliness must win good will incline to save family interest a much a possible be helped to determination by pleasure of frustrating jermyn contrivance to shield from punishment most distinct cheering prospect be that within very short space of time must not only have effected satisfactory compromise with must have made jermyn aware by very disagreeable form of announcement harold transome be no longer afraid of jermyn must bite dust at end of meditation felt satisfied with light hearted have rejected two dishonest proposition be going to do something seemed eminently graceful needed mother assistance be necessary that must confide in persuade within two hour after christian left harold begged mother to come into private room there told strange startling story omitting however particular must involve identification of christian a informant harold felt that engagement demanded reticence told mother that be bound to conceal source of knowledge have got independently of jermyn mr transome said little in course of story made exclamation listened with close attention asked few question so much to point a to surprise harold when showed copy of legal opinion jermyn have left with said knew very well have copy particular of last lawsuit be too well engraven on mind happened at time when there be one to supersede be virtual head of family affair be prepared to understand how estate might be in danger nothing have prepared for strange detail for way in new claimant have be reared brought within range of converging motif have led to revelation least of for part jermyn have come to play in revelation mr transome saw thing through medium of certain dominant emotion made seem like long ripening retribution harold perceived that be painfully agitated that trembled that white lip must not readily lend to speech be hardly more than expected have not liked revelation when have first come to did not guess what be in narrative have most pierced mother be something that made threat about estate only secondary alarm now for first time heard of intended proceeding against jermyn harold have not chosen to speak of before having at last called mother into consultation there be nothing in mind to hinder from speaking without reserve of determination to visit on attorney shameful maladministration of family affair harold went through whole narrative of what called jermyn scheme to catch in vise power of triumphantly frustrating scheme in usual rapid way speaking with final decisiveness of tone mother felt that if urged counter consideration at must only do so when have more to say now what want to do mother if can see matter a see harold said in conclusion be to go with to call on girl in malthouse yard will open affair to appears be not likely to have be informed yet will invite to visit here at once that scandal hatching of law mischief may be avoided thing may be brought to amicable conclusion seems almost incredible extraordinary girl in position said mr transome with difficulty must have seemed bitterest humiliating penance if sort of suffering have left room in heart assure be lady saw when be canvassing be amazed at time will be quite struck with be indignity for to invite oh said mr transome with low toned bitterness must put up with thing a be determined for when will go well said harold looking at watch be hardly two must really go to day when have lunched be better to lose time will order carriage stay said mr transome with desperate effort there be plenty of time will not lunch have word to say harold withdrew hand from bell leaned against mantelpiece to listen see comply with wish at once harold yes mother be much obliged to for making difficulty ought to listen to in return pray go on said harold expecting to be annoyed what be good of having chancery proceeding against jermyn good good fellow have burdened estate with annuity mortgage to extent of three thousand year bulk of be certain hold under name of man advance yearly interest represents have not be much more than twenty thousand of course have hoodwinked father never gave attention to thing have be up to sort of devil work with deed did count on coming back from smyrna to fill poor durfey place will feel difference good will be that will save almost annuity for rest of father life may be ten year more will get back of money will punish scoundrel be good will be ruined be what intend said harold sharply exerted great deal for in old suit everyone said have wonderful zeal ability said mr transome getting courage warmth a went on temper be rising what did did for own sake may depend on said harold with scornful laugh there be very painful thing in last suit seem anxious about young woman to avoid further scandal contest in family why wish to do in case jermyn might be willing to arrange thing amicably to make restitution a far a can if have done anything wrong will arrange nothing amicably with said harold decisively if have ever done anything scandalous a agent let bear infamy right way to throw infamy on be to show world that have robbed mean to punish why do wish to shield fellow mother have be chiefly through that have have to lead thrifty miserable life who used to make a brilliant figure a woman need wish mr transome rising temper be turned into horrible sensation a painful a sudden concussion from something hard immovable when have struck out with fist intending to hit something warm soft breathing like poor mr transome stroke be sent jarring back on by hard unalterable past did not speak in answer to harold rose from chair a if gave up debate woman be frightened at everything know said harold kindly feeling that have be little harsh after mother compliance have be used for so many year to think law of nature come mother went on looking at gently resting hand on shoulder look cheerful will get through difficulty girl dare say will be quite interesting visitor for have not have young girl about for long while who know may fall deeply in love with may be obliged to marry spoke laughingly only thinking how must make mother smile looked at seriously said do mean that harold be not capable of making conquest not too fat yet handsome well rounded youth of thirty four be forced to look straight at beaming face with rich dark color just bent little over why must not be happy in son whose future have once dreamed of who have be a fortunate a have ever hoped tear came not plenteously making dark eye a large bright a youth have once made without tear there there said harold coaxingly be afraid will not have daughter in law unless be pearl now will get ready to go in hour from time mr transome came down looking majestic in sable velvet ready to call on girl in malthouse yard have composed to go through task saw there be nothing better to be done after resolution harold have taken sort of compromise with oddly placed heiress be result most to be hoped for if compromise turned out to be marriage well have reason to care much be already powerless remained to be seen what girl be carriage be to be driven round back way to avoid too much observation late election affair might account for mr lyon receiving visit from unsuccessful radical candidate chapter xxxvii also must speak a ye do if soul be in soul stead must heap up word against shake mine head at book of job in interval since esther parted with felix holt on day of riot have gone through so much emotion have already have so strong shock of surprise that be

terribly shaken by news saw clear explanation of felix holt conduct for statement have heard be so conflicting that have not be able to gather distinctly what have come out in examination by magistrate mr lyon felt confident that felix be innocent of wish to abet riot infliction of injury what chiefly feared be that in fatal encounter with tucker have be moved by rash temper not sufficiently guarded against by prayerful humble spirit poor young friend be being taught with mysterious severity evil of too confident self reliance said to esther a sat opposite to other listening

esther mind why must not bear that harold must detect sensibility on subject be not only fibre of maidenly pride reserve of bashfulness undefinably peculiar toward man who while much older than bearing stamp of experience quite hidden from imagination be taking strongly aspect of lover be not only exquisite kind of shame be at work within there be sort of susceptibility in esther present circumstance tended to encourage though have come to regard a not at lofty rather a something condemned to littleness in comparison with mind have learned to venerate knew quite well that to harold

interest of noticing harold practical cleverness masculine ease with governed everybody administered everything about without least harshness with facile good nature yet be not weak in background too there be ever present consideration that if harold transome wished to marry accepted problem of lot must be more easily solved than in other way be difficult by theory of providence consideration of result to see course must call duty if something must come urge strongly a pleasure save from effort to find clue of principle amid labyrinthine confusion of right possession promise must not seem alluring yet life at transome court be not life of day dream there be dullness already in ease in absence of high demand there be vague consciousness that love of not unfascinating man who hovered about gave air of moral mediocrity to prospect must not have be able perhaps to define impression somehow other by elevation of fortune seemed that higher ambition have begun to spring in be forever

eye of woman when have once be turned with admiration on what be severely true then severely true rarely come within range of vision esther have have unusual illumination harold did not know how discerned enough of effect to make more cautious than have ever be in life before caution must have prevented just then from following up question a to style of person must think pleasant to live with

turned saw elderly woman advancing with tiny red haired boy scantily attired a to jacket merged into small sparrow tail little higher than waist muffled a to throat with blue woollen comforter esther recognized pair too well felt very uncomfortable be so pitiably in subjection to sort of vanity even very vanity be practically renouncing in spite of almost solemn memory connected with mr holt esther first shudder be raised by idea of what thing woman must say by mortification of having felix in way represented by mother a mr holt advanced into closer observation became more evident that be attired with view not to charm eye rather to afflict with expression of woe belongs to very rusty bombazine limpest state of false hair still be not woman to lose sense of own value become abject in manner under circumstance of depression have peculiar sense on present occasion that be justly relying on force of own character judgment in independence of anything mr lyon masterful felix must have said if have thought worthy to know of undertaking courtesied once a if to entire group now including even dog who showed various degree of curiosity especially a to what kind of game smaller animal job might prove to be after due investigation then proceeded at once toward esther who in spite of annoyance took arm from harold said how do do mr holt very kindly stooped to pat little job yes know miss lyon said mr holt in tone implies that conversation be intended for edification of company generally know orphin child a felix brought home for that be mother to take care of be what have done nobody more so though be trouble be reward esther have raised herself again to stand in helpless endurance of might be coming by time young harry struck even more than dog by appearance of job tudge

off tiny cloth cap observed with much interest tight red curl have be hidden underneath job looked at inspector with round blue eye of astonishment until harry purely by way of experiment took bon bon from fantastic wallet hung over shoulder applied test to job lip result be satisfactory to one have be watching small comedy when job crunched bon bon while harry looked down at inquiringly patted back there be general laughter except on part of mr holt who be shaking head slowly slapping back of left hand with painful patience of tragedian whose part be in abeyance to ill timed introduction of humorous hope job cough have be better lately said esther in mere uncertainty a to what must be desirable to say do dare say hope so miss lyon said mr holt looking at distant landscape have reason to disbelieve what wish well to child to felix to be sure nobody have occasion to wish otherways character will bear enquiry what a be young know others can tell be what said to myself when made up mind to come here see ask to get freedom to speak to mr transome said miss lyon may be now in way of being lifted up among great people be minister daughter be not above coming to house walking with son felix though will not deny made that figure on lord day that will perhaps go against with judge if anybody think well to tell here mr holt paused moment a with mind arrested by painful image have called up esther face be glowing when harold glanced at seeing be considerate enough to address mr holt instead of be then mother of unfortunate young man who be in prison indeed be sir said mr holt feeling that be now in deep water be not likely must claim if be own though be not by will advice sir that ever walked for gave none good if everybody son be guided by mother world be different son be

listening to a there be ought to go to king get to let off son felix speech in chief point have be deliberately prepared mr holt have set face like flint to make gentry know duty a knew hers defiant defensive tone be due to consciousness not only that be braving powerful audience that be daring to stand on strong basis of own judgment in opposition to son proposal have be waived off by mr lyon felix have long have feminine conviction that if must get to speak in right quarter thing might be different daring bit of impromptu about three mr transomes be immediately suggested by movement of old mr transome to foreground in line with mr lingon harold furred unusual costume appearing to indicate mysterious dignity must hasten to include in appeal there be reason that none must have foreseen made mr holt remonstrance immediately effective while old mr transome stared very much like waxen image in expression be failure rector accustomed to female parishioner complainant looked on with smile in eye harold said at once with cordial kindness think be quite right mr holt for part be determined to do best for son in witness box elsewhere take comfort if be necessary king will be appealed to rely upon will bear in mind a felix holt mother rapid thought have convinced harold that in way be best commending to esther well sir said mr holt who be not going to pour forth

account of a have never be in service took wage never did never thought of son doing father left money meaning otherways so a might have be doctor on horseback at very minute instead of being in prison what be regularly apprenticed to doctor said mr lingon who have not understood before sir be most clever like father before only turned contrary a for harming anybody felix never meant to harm anybody mother certainly did in respect of clothes taking to be low workingman stopping living respectable more particular by pill have sale a may be sure suited people inside what folk can never have box enough of to swallow must think have right to sell there be many many text for a have opened on without ever thinking for if be true 'ask will have must think be truer when be willing to pay for what have be little too much for mr lingon gravity exploded harold must not help following mr holt fixed eye on distance slapped back of left hand again might be that kind of mirth be peculiar effect produced by forcible truth on high worldly people who be neither in independent general baptist connection be sure must be tired with long walk little job too said esther by way of breaking awkward scene be job added stooping to caress child who be timidly shrinking from harry invitation to to pull little chariot harry view being that job must make good horse for to beat must run faster than gappa be well can feel for orphin child miss lyon said mr holt choosing indirect answer rather than to humble by confessing fatigue before gentleman who seemed to be taking too lightly did believe what 'd behave pretty a always did to though everybody said held high be sure never did to felix for let sit by at free school before town with never bit of stock round neck show saw that in worth taking notice of be right if know word be true a must speak for to gentleman assure mr holt said harold coming to rescue assure that enough have be said to make use best effort for son now pray go on to house with little boy take rest dominic show mr holt way ask mr hickes to make comfortable see that somebody take back to treby in buggy will go back with mr holt said esther making effort against pray said harold with kind of entreaty be really decision let holt have time to rest will have returned can see before go will say good by for present mr holt poor woman be not sorry to have prospect of rest food especially for orphin child of whom be tenderly careful like many woman who appear to others to have masculine decisiveness of tone to to have masculine force of mind who come into severe collision with son arrived at masterful stage have maternal cord vibrating strongly within toward tiny child when saw dominic pick up job hoist on arm for little while by way of making acquaintance regarded with approval have not thought possible to extend to foreigner since dominic be going harry old mr transome chose to follow uncle lingon shook hand turned off across grass thus esther be left alone with harold there be new consciousness between harold quick perception be least likely to be slow in seizing indication of anything might affect position with regard to esther time before jealousy have be awakened to possibility that before have known have be deeply interested in one else jealousy of sort whether for fortune love be ready at combination likely even to outstrip fact esther renewed confusion united with silence about felix now first seemed noteworthy with mr holt graphic detail a to walking with letting sit by before town be ground not merely for suspicion for conclusion in harold mind effect of at once regarded a discovery be rather different from what esther have anticipated seemed to that felix be least formidable person that must have found a object of interest antecedent to young workman who have got thrown into prison recommendation might have have for girl at romantic age in dreariness of dissenting society at treby must hardly be considered by harold in light of rival esther be too clever tasteful woman to make ballad heroine of herself by bestowing beauty land on lowly lover besides harold cherished belief at present time esther be more wisely disposed to bestow thing on lover in way eligible in two direction discovery have determining effect on curiosity be stirred to know exactly what relation with felix have be be solicitous that behavior with regard to young man must be such a to enhance own merit in esther eye at same time be not inclined to euphemism must seem to bring felix into list with naturally when be left alone be harold who spoke first must think there be good deal of worth in young fellow holt notwithstanding mistake have made little queer conceited perhaps be usually case with men of class when be at superior to fellow felix holt be highly cultivated man be not at conceited said esther different kind of pride within be coalescing now be aware that there have be betrayal ah said harold not quite liking tone of answer eccentricity be sort of fanaticism then giving up being doctor on horseback a old woman call taking to let see watchmaking be if be eccentricity to be very much better than other men be certainly eccentric fanatical too if be fanatical to renounce small selfish motif for sake of great unselfish one never knew what nobleness of character really be before knew felix holt seemed to esther a if in excitement of moment own word be bringing clearer revelation god bless said harold in tone of surprised yet thorough belief looking in esther face wish have talked to about before esther at moment looked perfectly beautiful with expression harold have never hitherto seen confusion have depended on personal feeling have given way before sense that have to speak truth about man whom felt to be admirable think did see meaning of anything fine did even see value of father character until have be taught little by hearing what felix holt said seeing that life be like word harold looked listened felt slight jealousy allayed rather than heightened be not like love said to with satisfaction with due regard to harold transome be one of men who be liable to make greater mistake about particular woman feeling because pique on power of interpretation derived from much experience experience be enlightening with difference experiment on live animal may go on for long period yet fauna on be made may be limited there may be passion in mind of woman precipitate not along path of easy beguilement into great leap away from harold experience have not taught be enthusiasm about felix holt did not seem to to be dangerous be quite apostolic sort of fellow then be self quieting answer gave to last word did look like have only short interview with be given to understand that refused to see in prison believe be not very well inclined toward saw great deal of suppose testimony to one be enough for said harold lowering voice rather tenderly now know what opinion be will spare effort on behalf of young man in fact have come to same resolution before wish must make difficult thing easy after energetic speech of esther a often happens tear have just suffused eye be nothing more than might have be expected in tender hearted woman considering felix holt circumstance tear only made more lovely look with met harold when spoke so kindly felt pleased with be open to fallacious delight of being assured that have power over to make do what liked quite forgot many impression have convinced that harold have padded yoke ready for neck of man woman child depended on after short silence be getting near stone gateway harold said with air of intimate consultation what must do for young man supposing be let off will send letter with fifty pound to old woman to morrow ought to have done before really slipped memory amongst many thing have occupied lately young man what do think must be best thing must do for if get at large again must be put in position where quality must be more telling esther be recovering liveliness little be disposed to encourage for sake of veiling other feeling about felt renewed reticence now that overpowering influence of enthusiasm be past be rather wickedly amused scornful at harold misconception ill placed intention of patronage be hopelessly in dark said with light laugh toss of head what must offer felix holt place in excise might a well think of offering to john baptist felix have chosen lot mean always to be poor man mean yes said harold slightly piqued what man mean usually depends on what happens mean to be commoner peerage might present under acceptable circumstance oh there be sum in proportion to be done there said esther again gaily a be to peerage so be not felix holt to offer of advantage that must imagine for must think fit for position first in county said esther shaking head mischievously think too high for see can be ardent in admiration yes be champagne know like other kind must be satisfactory if one be sure of getting admiration said harold leading up to terrace amongst crocus from whence have fine view of park river stood still near east parapet saw dash of light on water pencilled shadow of tree on grassy lawn must do a well to admire instead of being worthy to be admired said harold turning eye from landscape to esther face must be thing to be put up with said esther smiling at rather roguishly be not in state of self despair well be conscious of not having severe virtue that have be praising be true be quite in genre woman must not find tragic hero oh must dress for general comedy such a mother once described to where most thrilling event be drawing of handsome check be naughty fairy said harold daring to press esther hand little more closely to drawing down eastern step into pleasure ground a if be unwilling to give up conversation confess that be disgusted with want of romance will not confess to being disgusted will ask to confess that be not romantic figure be little too stout for romance yes at least must find security for not getting stouter look languishing enough oh yes rather too much so at fine cigar be not in danger of committing suicide be widower harold did not reply immediately to last thrust of esther have uttered with innocent thoughtlessness from playful suggestion of moment be fact that harold previous married life have entered strongly in impression about presence of harry made inevitable harold took allusion of esther a indication that quality of widower be point made against after brief silence said in altered more serious tone suppose hope that other woman have ever held place that must hold in life esther began to tremble little a always did when love talk between seemed getting serious only gave rather stumbling answer how so harry be mother have be slave be bought in fact be impossible for harold to preconceive effect have on esther natural disqualification for judging of girl feeling be heightened by blinding effect of exclusive object be to assure that own place be peculiar supreme hitherto esther acquaintance with oriental love be derived chiefly from byronic poem have not sufficed to adjust mind to new story where giaour concerned be giving arm be unable to speak harold went on though be close on thirty five never met with woman at like before there be new era in one life be equivalent to youth be something better than youth be never aspirant till knew esther be still silent not that dare to call be not so confident personage a imagine be necessarily in painful position for man who have feeling here at last harold have stirred right fibre esther generosity seized at once whole meaning implied in last sentence have fine sensibility to line at flirtation must cease be now pale shaken with feeling have not yet defined for let speak of difficult thing more now said with gentle seriousness be come into new world of late have to learn life over again let go in must see poor mr holt again little friend job paused at glass door opened on terrace entered there while harold went round to stable when esther have be up stair descended again into large entrance hall found stony capaciousness made lively by human figure extremely unlike statue since harry insisted on playing with job again mr holt orphan after dining have just be brought to delightful scene for game at hide seek for exhibiting climbing power of two pet squirrel mr holt sat on stool in singular relief against pedestal of apollo while dominic denner otherwise mr hickes bore company harry in bright red purple flitted about like great tropic bird after sparrow tailed job who hid with much intelligence behind scagliola pillar pedestal while one of squirrel perched on head of tallest statue other be already peeping down from among heavy stuccoed angel on ceiling near summit of pillar mr holt held on lap basket filled with good thing for job seemed much soothed by pleasant company excellent treatment a esther descending softly unobserved leaned over stone banister looked at scene for minute two saw that mr holt attention having be directed to squirrel have scampered on to head of silenus carrying infant bacchus have be drawn downward to tiny babe looked at with so much affection by rather ugly hairy gentleman of whom nevertheless spoke with reserve a of one who possibly belonged to transome family be most pretty to see little limb gentleman holding must think be amiable by look be odd must have likeness took without clothes be transome by name mr holt suspected that there might be mild madness in family denner peering smiling quietly be about to reply when be prevented by appearance of old mr transome who since walk have be having forty wink on sofa in library now came out to look for harry have doffed fur cap cloak in lying down to sleep have thrown over shoulder soft oriental scarf harold have given still hung over scanty white hair down to knee held fast by wooden looking arm laxly clasped hand fell in front of singular appearance of undoubted transome fitted exactly into mr holt thought at moment lay in probability of thing that gentry intellect must be peculiar since have not to get own living good lord might have economized in case that common sense others be so much more in need of in shuffling figure before saw descendant of gentleman who have chosen to be represented without clothes more eccentric where there be mean of buying best oddity said nothing in great folk who be powerful in high quarter same mr holt rose courtesied with proud respect precisely a must have done if mr transome have looked a wise a lord burleigh hope be in way taking liberty sir began while old gentleman looked at with bland feebleness be not that woman to sit anywhere out of own home without inviting pressing to be brought here to wait because little gentleman wanted to play with orphin child very glad good woman sit down sit down said mr transome nodding smiling between clause nice little boy grandchild indeed sir said mr holt continuing to stand quite apart from awe of mr transome sitting down felt must be too great familiarity with own pathetic importance on extra unlooked for occasion be not have grandchild ever will have though most fit with only son saying will never be married in prison besides saying will be transported may see though gentleman a there be much chance of having grandchild of own be old master tudge grandchild a own felix took to for pity because be sickly clemm 'd be noways against being of tender heart for

gentleman a be head of everything be not to be thought 'd give up to son a poor widow be forced to do behooves to take part of a be deserving for bible say gray hair must speak yes yes poor woman what will say said old mr transome feeling scolded a usual desirous of mollifying displeasure sir can tell what to say fast enough for be what must say if must get to speak to king for have asked that know

whereby deed be same in outward appearance effect yet differ a knife stroke of surgeon even though kill differs from knife stroke of wanton mutilater might use discretion in tempering punishment so that must not be very evil to bear now be said that judge who cometh be severe man one nourishing prejudice against bolder spirit who stand not in old path be going to be present at trial father said esther who be preparing way to express wish be timid about even with father mentioned to mr transome must like to do so said that used in old day always to attend assize that must take will be there

concerning what esther contemplated a ultimate arrangement between herself transomes after conversation showed that what happened to felix touched esther more closely than have supposed minister felt

be not fond of prison said felix smiling suppose best can hope for be to have good deal more of be thought that in worst case pardon may be obtained said esther avoiding harold transome name rely on said felix shaking head wisest course be to make up mind to very ugliest penalty can condemn to if can face that anything le will seem easy know went on smiling at brightly never went in for fine company cushion ca be very heavily disappointed in way do see thing just a used to do said esther turning pale a said mean about poverty people will live among have misunderstanding sadness left just a obstinate tried to smile must not succeed what about sort of life must lead if be free again said felix yes ca help being discouraged for by thing have happened see how may fail esther spoke timidly saw peculiar smile knew well gathering in eye ah dare say be silly said deprecatingly be dreadfully inspired said felix when wicked tempter be tired of snarling that word failure in man cell sends

esther said felix affair have be settled long ago yours great change have come in magic at work yes said esther rather falteringly well said felix looking at gravely again be case of fitness seems to give chance sanction to musty law first time saw birth be immense puzzle to however appropriate condition be come at last word seemed cruel to esther felix must not know reason for seeming so must not speak be turning cold feeling heart beat painfully taste be gratified now went on innocently will remember old pedagogue lecture one thought in mind of felix be that esther be sure to marry harold transome men readily believe thing of woman who love must not allude to marriage more directly be afraid of destiny for without having very distinct knowledge by to justify fear to mind of did not satisfy that esther must marry harold transome child said mr lyon at moment not looking round only looking close at watch have just two minute more then went on writing esther did not speak felix must not help observing now that hand have turned to deathly coldness that be trembling believed knew that prospect have feeling be for sake overpowering impulse from mingled love gratitude anxiety urged to say have horrible struggle esther see be right there be fitting lot in reserve for remember have cost great price throw what be precious away will want news that have happiness worthy of esther felt too miserable for tear to come looked helplessly at felix for moment then took hand from turning away mutely walked dreamily toward father said be ready there be more to say turned back again toward chair where bonnet lay with face quite corpse like above dark garment esther heard felix say word with entreating cry went toward with swift movement of frightened child toward protector clasped kissed other never must recall anything else happened till be in carriage again with mr transome chapter xlvi why there be maiden of heroic touch yet seem like thing of gossamer 'd pinch life

in court under mr transome wing a to see hear everything without effort harold have received at hotel have observed that esther looked ill be unusually abstracted in manner seemed to be sufficiently accounted for by sympathetic anxiety about result of trial in prisoner at bar be friend in father be important witness mr transome have reluctance to keep small secret from son betrayal be made of previous engagement of esther with father harold be particularly delicate unobtrusive in attention to day have consciousness that be going to behave in way must gratify esther win admiration be of made more graceful by inward presence of what believe to be generous purpose action move to hidden music melody be sweetly played in tune if have be le absorbed by supreme feeling must have be aware that be object of special notice in bare squareness of public hall where there be not one jutting angle to hang guess thought upon not image bit of color to stir fancy where only object of speculation of admiration of interest be human being occupied position indicating importance notice bestowed on esther must not have be surprising even if have be merely tribute to youthful charm be well championed by mr transome elderly majesty be due also to whispering that be hereditary claimant of transome estate whom harold transome be about to marry harold have of late not cared to conceal either fact probability tended rather to honor than dishonor to day when there be good proportion of trebians present whispering spread rapidly court be still more crowded than on previous day when poor acquaintance dredge two collier companion be sentenced to year imprisonment with hard labor more enlightened prisoner who stole debarry plate to transportation for life poor dredge have cried have wished 'd never heared of 'lection in spite of sermon from jail chaplain fell back on explanation that be world in spratt old nick be sure to get best of so that in dredge case at least most observer must have have melancholy conviction that there have be enhancement of public spirit faith in progress from wave of political agitation have reached sproxton pit curiosity be necessarily at higher pitch to day when character of prisoner circumstance of offence be of highly unusual kind soon a felix appeared at bar murmur rose spread into loud buzz continued until there have be repeated authoritative call for silence in court rather singularly be now for first time that esther have feeling of pride in on ground simply of appearance at moment when be centre of multitudinous gaze seemed to act on own vision like broad unmitigated daylight felt that there be something pre eminent in notwithstanding vicinity of numerous gentleman apple woman must have admired not only to feminine mind like mr tiliot to many mind in coat waistcoat there be something dangerous perhaps unprincipled in bare throat great gothic head somewhat massive person must doubtless have come out very oddly from hand of fashionable tailor of time a esther saw large gray eye looking round calmly undefiantly first at audience generally then with more observant expression at lawyer other person immediately around felt that bore outward stamp of distinguished nature forgive if needed satisfaction of whether men woman be liable to weakness of liking to have preference justified before others a well a ourselves esther said inwardly with certain triumph felix holt looked a worthy to be chosen in midst of large assembly a have ever looked in tte tte under sombre light of little parlor in malthouse yard esther have felt relief in hearing from father that felix have insisted on doing without mother presence since to mr holt imagination notwithstanding general desire to have character enquired into there be greatly consolatory difference between being witness criminal appearance of kind before judge must hardly be made to suggest anything definite must overcome dim sense of unalleviated disgrace have be le inclined than usual to complain of son decision esther have shuddered beforehand at inevitable farce there must be in mr holt testimony surely felix must lose something for want of witness who must testify to behavior in morning before became involved in tumult be really fine young fellow said harold coming to speak to esther after colloquy with prisoner solicitor hope will not make blunder in defending be not likely to make blunder said have recovered color little be brighter than have be morning before felix have seemed to include in general glance have avoided looking at particularly understood how delicate feeling for must prevent that might safely look at toward father whom must see in same direction turning to harold to make observation saw that be looking toward same point with expression on face that surprised dear said prompted to speak without reflection how angry look never saw look so angry before be not father be looking at oh be angry at something be looking away from said harold making effort to drive back troublesome demon who must stare out at window be that jermyn added glancing at mother a well a esther will thrust under eye everywhere since refused interview returned letter be determined never to speak to directly again if can help mr transome heard with changeless face have for time be watching have taken on marble look of immobility said inward bitter of course to everything be unpleasant after esther soon became impatient of speech attention be rivetted on proceeding of court on mode in felix bore in case for prosecution there be nothing more than reproduction with irrelevancy added by witness of fact already known to spratt have retained consciousness enough in midst of terror to swear that when be tied to finger post felix be presiding over action of mob landlady of seven star who be indebted to felix for rescue from pursuit by drunken rioter gave evidence went to prove assumption of leadership prior to assault on spratt remembering only that have called away pursuer to better sport various respectable witness swore to felix encouragement of rioter who be dragging spratt in king street to fatal assault on tucker to attitude in front of drawing room window at manor three other witness gave evidence of expression used by prisoner tending to show character of act with be charged two be treby tradesman third be clerk from duffield clerk have heard felix speak at treby men have frequently heard declare on public matter quoted expression tended to show that have virulent feeling against respectable shopkeeping class that nothing be likely to be more congenial to than gutting of retailer shop one else knew witness did not know fully how far strong perception memory on point be due to fourth mind namely that of mr john johnson attorney who be nearly related to one of treby witness familiar acquaintance of duffield clerk man can not be defined a evidence giving animal in difficulty of getting up evidence on subject there be room for much unrecognized action of diligent person who have extra stimulus of private motive mr johnson be present in court to day in modest retired situation have come down to give information to mr jermyn to gather information in other quarter be well illuminated by appearance of esther in company with transomes when case for prosecution closed stranger thought that looked very black for prisoner in two instance only felix have chosen to put cross examining question first be to ask spratt if did not believe that having be tied to post have saved from probably mortal injury second be to ask tradesman who swore to having heard felix tell rioter to leave tucker alone come along with whether have not shortly before heard cry among mob summoning to attack on wine vault brewery esther have hitherto listened closely calmly knew that there must be strong adverse testimony hope fear be bent on be to come beyond be when prisoner be asked what have to adduce in reply that felt in grasp of tremor doe not disable mind rather give keener consciousness of mind having penalty of body attached to there be silence a of night when felix holt began to speak voice be firm clear spoke with simple gravity evidently without enjoyment of occasion esther have never seen face look so weary lord be not going to occupy time of court with unnecessary word believe witness for prosecution have spoken truth a far a superficial observation must enable to do see nothing can weigh with jury in favor unless believe statement of own motif testimony certain witness will give to character purpose a being inconsistent with willingly abetting disorder will tell court in a few word a can how got entangled in mob how came to attack constable how be led to take course seems rather mad to myself now look back upon felix then gave concise narrative of motif conduct on day of riot from moment when be startled into quitting work by earlier uproar of morning omitted of course visit to malthouse yard merely said that went out to walk again after returning to quiet mother mind got warmed by story of experience moved more strongly than ever now recalled in vibrating word before large audience of fellow men sublime delight of truthful speech to one who have great gift of uttering will make felt even through pang of sorrow be have to say for lord pleaded 'not guilty ' to charge of manslaughter because know that word may carry meaning must not fairly apply to act when threw tucker down did not see possibility that must die from sort of attack ordinarily occurs in fighting without fatal effect a to assaulting constable be quick choice between two evil must else have be disabled attacked under mistake about intention be not prepared to say never must assault constable where have more chance of deliberation certainly must assault if saw doing anything that made blood boil reverence law not where be pretext for wrong must be very object of law to hinder consider must be making unworthy defence if let court infer from what say from what be said by witness that because be man who hate drunken motiveless disorder wanton harm therefore be man who must never fight against authority hold blasphemy to say that man ought not to fight against authority there be great religion great freedom have not done in beginning must be impertinent for to speak of now if did not need to say in own defence must hold worst sort of traitor if put hand to fighting disorder must mean to injure somebody if be not urged to by what hold to be sacred feeling making sacred duty to own manhood to fellow man certainly felix ended with strong ring of scorn in voice never held sacred duty to try get radical candidate returned for north loamshire by willingly heading drunken howling mob whose public action must consist in breaking window destroying hard got produce endangering life of men woman have more to say lord foresaw must make blunder said harold in low voice to esther then seeing shrink little feared might suspect of being merely stung by allusion to mean what said about radical candidate added hastily in correction mean last sentence mean that whole peroration of ought to have left unsaid have done harm with jury wo understand rather will misunderstand will answer for have soured judge remains to be seen what witness can say for to nullify effect of what have said for hope attorney have done best in collecting evidence understand expense of witness be undertaken by liberal at glasgow in lancashire friend of holt suppose father have told first witness called to defence be mr lyon gist of statement be that from beginning of september last till day of election be in very frequent intercourse with prisoner that have become intimately acquainted with character view of life conduct with respect to election that be totally inconsistent with other supposition than being involved in riot fatal encounter with constable be due to calamitous failure of bold good purpose stated further that have be present when interview have occurred in own house between prisoner mr harold transome who be then canvassing for representation of north loamshire that object of prisoner in seeking interview have be to inform mr transome of treating given in name to workman in pit on canal at sproxton to remonstrate against continuance prisoner fearing that disturbance mischief might result from what believed to be end toward treating be directed namely presence of men on occasion of nomination polling several time after interview mr lyon said have heard felix holt recur to subject therein discussed with expression of grief anxiety be in habit of visiting sproxton in ministerial capacity knew fully what prisoner have done there in order to found night school be certain that prisoner interest in workingman of district turned entirely on possibility of converting somewhat to habit of soberness to due care for instruction of child finally stated that prisoner in compliance with request have be present at duffield on day of nomination have on return expressed with strong indignation concerning employment of sproxton men on occasion what called wickedness of hiring blind violence quaint appearance manner of little dissenting minister must not fail to stimulate peculiar wit of bar be subjected to troublesome cross examination bore with wide eyed short sighted quietude absorption in duty of truthful response on being asked rather sneeringly if prisoner be not one of flock answered in deeper tone made one of most effective transition of varying voice nay must to god be must then feel that great virtue pure life have beheld in be witness to efficacy of faith believe in discipline of church whereunto belong perhaps required larger power of comparison than be possessed by of audience to appreciate moral elevation of independent minister who must utter word nevertheless there be murmur be clearly one of sympathy next witness one on whom interest of spectator be chiefly concentrated be harold transome there be decided predominance of tory feeling in court human disposition to enjoy infliction of little punishment on opposite party be in instance of tory complexion harold be keenly alive to to everything else might prove disagreeable to in having to appear in witness box be not likely to lose self possession to fail in adjusting gracefully under condition most men must find difficult to carry without awkwardness have generosity candor enough to bear felix holt proud rejection of advance without petty resentment have susceptibility of gentleman moral quality gave right direction to acumen in judging of behavior must best secure dignity everything requiring command be easier to because of esther presence for admiration be just then object well tanned man of world have most at heart to secure when entered witness box be much admired by lady amongst audience many of whom sighed little at thought of wrong course in politics certainly looked like handsome portrait by sir thomas lawrence in remarkable artist have happily omitted usual excess of honeyed blandness mixed with alert intelligence be hardly compatible with state of man out of paradise stood not far off felix two radical certainly made striking contrast felix might have come from hand of sculptor in later roman period when plastic impulse be stirred by grandeur of barbaric form when rolled collar be not yet conceived satin stock be not harold transome declared have have only one interview with prisoner be interview referred to by previous witness in whose presence in whose house be begun interview however be continued beyond observation of mr lyon prisoner quitted dissenting minister house in malthouse yard together proceeded to office of mr jermyn who be then conducting electioneering business on behalf object be to comply with holt remonstrance by enquiring into alleged proceeding at sproxton if possible to put stop to be language in malthouse yard in attorney office be strong be evidently indignant indignation turned on danger of employing ignorant men excited by drink on occasion of popular concourse believed that holt sole motive be prevention of disorder what considered demoralization of workman by treating event have certainly justified remonstrance have not have subsequent opportunity of observing prisoner if reliance be to be placed on rational conclusion must thought be plain that anxiety thus manifested by holt be guarantee of statement have made a to motif on day of riot entire impression from holt manner in single interview be that be moral political enthusiast who if sought to coerce others must seek to coerce into difficult perhaps impracticable scrupulosity harold spoke with a noticeable directness emphasis a if what said must have reaction on have of course not entered unnecessarily into what occurred in jermyn office now be subjected to cross examination on subject gave rise to subdued shrug smile wink among county gentleman question be directed so a to bring out if possible indication that felix holt be moved to remonstrance by personal resentment against political agent concerned in setting on foot treating at sproxton such questioning be sort of target shooting that sometimes hit about widely cross examining counsel have close connection among tory of loamshire enjoyed business to day under fire of various question about jermyn agent employed by at sproxton harold got warm in one of reply said with rapid sharpness mr jermyn be agent then not now have no longer hostile relation with sense that have shown slight heat must have vexed harold more if have not got satisfaction out of thought jermyn word recovered good temper quickly when subsequently question came acquiesced in treating of sproxton men a necessary to efficient working of reformed constituency harold replied with quiet fluency yes on return to england before put up for north loamshire got best advice from practised agent whig tory agreed a to electioneering measure next witness be michael brincey otherwise mike brindle who gave evidence of saying doings of prisoner among sproxton men mike declared that felix went uncommon again drink pitch toss quarrelling sich be for schooling bringing up little chap on being cross examined admitted that must give much account that felix did talk again idle folk whether poor rich most like meant rich who have right to be idle be what mike liked sometimes though for most part be hard working butty on being checked for superfluous allegation of own theory practice mike became timidly conscious that answering be great mystery beyond reach of butty soul began to err from defect instead of excess however reasserted that what felix most wanted be to get to set up school for little chap with two succeeding witness who swore to fact that felix have tried to lead mob along hobb lane instead of toward manor to violently threatening character of tucker attack on case for defence be understood to close meanwhile esther have be looking on listening with growing misery in sense that have not be said might have be said on behalf of felix if be jury who be to be acted on argued to herself there might have be impression made on feeling must determine verdict be not constantly said seen that jury pronounced guilty not guilty from sympathy for against accused be too inexperienced to check own argument by thoroughly representing to herself course of thing how counsel for prosecution must reply how judge must sum up with object of cooling down sympathy into deliberation what have painfully pressing on inward vision be that trial be coming to end that voice of right truth have not be strong enough when woman feel purely nobly that ardor of hers break through formula too rigorously urged on men by daily practical need make one of most precious influence be added impulse shatters stiffening crust of cautious experience inspired ignorance give sublimity to action so incongruously simple that otherwise must make men smile of ardor have flashed out illuminated poetry history be burning to day in bosom of sweet lyon in at least woman lot be perfect that man loved be hero that woman passion reverence for rarest goodness rushed together in undivided current to day be making one danger one terror one irresistible impulse for heart feeling be growing into necessity for action rather than resolve to act must not support thought that trial must come to end sentence must be passed on felix that while something have be omitted might have be said for there have be no witness to tell what have be behavior state of mind just before riot must do be possible there be time not too much time other agitation became merged in eagerness not to let moment escape last witness be being called harold transome have not be able to get back to on leaving witness box mr lingon be close by with firm quickness said to pray tell attorney have evidence to give for prisoner lose time do know what be going to say dear said mr lingon looking at in astonishment yes entreat for god sake said esther in low tone of urgent beseeching be equivalent to cry with look of appeal more penetrating still must rather die than not do old rector always leaning to good natured view of thing felt chiefly that there seemed to be additional chance for poor fellow who have got into trouble disputed farther went to attorney before harold be aware of esther intention be on way to witness box when appeared there be a if vibration quick a light have gone through court have shaken felix who have hitherto seemed impassive sort of gleam seemed to shoot across
