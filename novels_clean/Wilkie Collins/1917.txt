never get on to own satisfaction beyond father uncle george chapter ii be taken home on appointed day to suffer trial hard one even at tender year of witnessing mother passionate grief father mute despair remember that scene of first meeting after caroline death be wisely considerately shortened by aunt who took out of room seemed to have confused desire to keep from leaving after door have

garden uncle george be gone be never to see more be never to speak of again be word repeated to with indescribable terror confusion moment be alone there be something unspeakably horrible to young mind in mystery be commanded always to respect so far a then knew must never hope to see revealed father mother aunt appeared to be separated from now by impassable barrier home seemed home no longer with caroline dead uncle george gone forbidden subject of talk perpetually mysteriously interposing between parent though never infringed command father have given in study word look dreadful scream of mother seemed to be still ringing in ear be more than enough to insure obedience also never lost secret desire to penetrate darkness clouded over fate of uncle george for two year remained at home discovered nothing if asked servant about uncle must only tell that one morning disappeared from house of member of father family must make inquiry lived far away never came to see idea of writing to at age in position be out of question aunt be a unapproachably silent a father mother never forgot how face have altered when reflected for moment after hearing of extraordinary adventure while going home with servant over sand at night more thought of change of countenance in connection with what have occurred on return to father house more certain felt that stranger who have kissed wept over must have be other than uncle george at end of two year at home be sent to sea in merchant navy by own earnest desire have always determined to be sailor from time when first went to stay with aunt at sea side persisted long enough in resolution to make parent recognize necessity of acceding to wish new life delighted remained away on foreign station more than four year when at length returned home be to find new affliction darkening fireside father have died on very day when sailed for return voyage to england absence change of scene have in respect weakened desire to penetrate mystery of uncle george disappearance mother health be so delicate that hesitated for time to approach forbidden subject in presence when at last ventured to refer to suggesting to that prudent reserve might have be necessary while be child need no longer be persisted in now be growing to be young man fell into violent fit of trembling commanded to say more have be father will said that reserve to referred must be always adopted toward have not authorized before died to speak more openly now that be gone must not so much a think of acting on own unaided judgment aunt said same thing in effect when appealed to determined not to be discouraged even yet undertook journey ostensibly to pay respect to father family with secret intention of trying what must learn in quarter on subject of uncle george investigation led to result though be by mean satisfactory george have always be looked upon with something like contempt by handsome sister prosperous brother have not improved position in family by warm advocacy of brother cause at time of father marriage found that uncle surviving relative now spoke of slightingly carelessly assured that have never heard from that knew nothing about except that have gone away to settle a supposed in foreign place after having behaved very basely badly to father have be traced to london where have sold out of fund small share of money have inherited after father death have be seen on deck of packet bound for france later on same day beyond nothing be known about in what alleged baseness of behavior have consisted none of brother sister must tell father have refused to pain by going into particular not only at time of brother disappearance afterward whenever subject be mentioned george have always be black sheep of flock must have be conscious of own baseness must certainly have written to explain to justify such be particular gleaned during visit to father family to mind tended rather to deepen than to reveal mystery that gentle docile affectionate creature a uncle george must have injured brother loved by word deed at period of intercourse seemed incredible that must have be guilty of act of baseness at very time when sister be dying be simply plainly impossible yet there be incomprehensible fact staring in face that death of caroline disappearance of uncle george have taken place in same week never did feel more daunted bewildered by family secret than after have heard particular in connection with that father relative have to tell may pas over event of next few year of life briefly enough nautical pursuit filled up time took far away from country friend did wherever went memory of uncle george desire to penetrate mystery of disappearance haunted like familiar spirit often in lonely watch of night at sea did recall dark evening on beach strange man hurried embrace startling sensation of feeling tear on cheek disappearance of before have breath self possession enough to say word often did think over inexplicable event followed when have returned after sister funeral to father house oftener still did puzzle brain vainly in attempt to form plan for inducing mother aunt to disclose secret have hitherto kept from so perseveringly only chance of knowing what have really happened to uncle george only hope of seeing again rested with two near dear relative despaired of ever getting mother to speak on forbidden subject after what have passed between felt more sanguine about prospect of ultimately inducing aunt to relax in discretion anticipation however in direction be not destined to be fulfilled on next visit to england found aunt prostrated by paralytic attack deprived of power of speech died soon afterward in arm leaving sole heir searched anxiously among paper for reference to family mystery found clew to guide mother letter to sister at time of caroline illness death have be destroyed chapter iii more year passed mother followed aunt to grave still be a far a ever from making discovery in relation to uncle george shortly after period of last affliction health gave way departed by doctor advice to try bath in south of france traveled slowly to destination turning

that thought bore up to last on death bed always spoke of sister a 'little darling ' firmly believed that be waiting to forgive console in other world who will say be deceived in belief not not anyone who have ever loved suffered surely be out of depth of self sacrificing love for child that drew fatal courage to undertake operation continued priest father naturally shrank from attempting medical brother whom consulted doubted propriety of taking measure for removal of tumor in particular condition situation of when be called in uncle alone differed with be too modest man to say so mother found out deformity of beautiful child horrified be desperate enough to catch at faintest hope of remedying that anyone might hold out to persuaded uncle to put opinion to proof horror at deformity of child despair at prospect of lasting for life seem to have utterly blinded to natural sense of danger of operation be hard to know how to say to son must be told nevertheless that one day when father be out untruly informed uncle that brother have consented to performance of operation that have gone purposely out of house because have not nerve enough to stay witness after uncle no longer

love for child shook firm hand have never trembled before in word operation failed father returned found child dying frenzy of despair when truth be told carried to excess shock to mention excess began in degrading brother by blow ended in binding by oath to make that brother suffer public punishment for fatal rashness in court of law uncle be too heartbroken by what have happened to feel

deceived in saying that have brother permission to try be silent when spoke be to join husband in denouncing a murderer of child whether fear of father anger revengeful indignation against uncle most actuated can not presume to inquire in presence can only state fact priest paused looked at anxiously must not speak to at moment must only encourage to proceed by pressing hand resumed in term meanwhile uncle turned to father spoke last word be ever to address to eldest brother in world said ' have deserved worst anger can inflict on will spare scandal of bringing to justice in open court

regard never seemed to strong enough to explain intimacy between mr elmslie inhabitant of abbey intimate however certainly be one result of constant interchange of visit between two family in due time declared mr monkton son mr elmslie daughter became attached to other have opportunity of seeing much of young lady only remember at time a delicate gentle lovable girl very opposite in appearance apparently in character also to alfred monkton perhaps be one reason why fell in love with other attachment be soon discovered be far from being disapproved by parent on side in essential point except of wealth elmslies be nearly equal of monktons want of money in bride be of consequence to heir of wincot alfred be well known must succeed to thirty thousand year on father death thus though parent on side thought young people not old enough to be married at once saw reason why ada alfred must not be engaged to other with understanding that must be united when young monkton came of age in two year time person to be consulted in matter after parent be father in capacity of ada guardian knew that family misery have shown many year ago in mr monkton who be husband cousin illness a be significantly called have be palliated by careful treatment be reported to have passed away father be not to be deceived knew where hereditary taint still lurked viewed with horror bare possibility of

congratulation one two significant reference to late mr monkton searching inquiry a to disposition of son mr elmslie always met polite hint with one bold form of answer first admitted existence of report about monktons friend be unwilling to specify distinctly then declared that be infamous calumny hereditary taint have died out of family generation back alfred be best kindest sanest of human being loved study retirement ada sympathized with taste have made choice unbiased if more hint be dropped about sacrificing by marriage hint must be viewed a so many insult to mother whose affection for be monstrous to call in question way of talking silenced people did not convince began to suspect what be indeed actual truth that mr elmslie be selfish worldly grasping woman who wanted to get daughter well married cared nothing for consequence a long a saw ada mistress of greatest establishment in whole county seemed however a if there be fatality at work to prevent attainment of mr elmslie great object in life hardly be one obstacle to ill omened marriage removed by father death before succeeded in shape of anxiety difficulty caused by delicate state of ada health doctor be consulted in direction result of advice be that marriage must be deferred that miss elmslie must leave england for certain time to reside in warmer climate south of france if remember rightly thus happened that just before alfred came of age ada mother departed for continent union of two young people be understood to be indefinitely postponed curiosity be felt in neighborhood a to what alfred monkton must do under circumstance must follow lady love must go yachting must throw open door of old abbey at last endeavor to forget absence of ada postponement of marriage in round of gayeties did

supposed to have be shut close for year year have discovered standing on perilous summit of one of crumbling turret never ascended before within memory popularly considered to be inhabited by ghost of monk who have once possessed building result of observation discovery when be communicated to others be of course to impress one with firm belief that poor young monkton be going way that rest of family have gone before opinion always appeared to be immensely strengthened in popular mind by conviction founded on particle of evidence that priest be at bottom of mischief thus far have spoken from hearsay evidence mostly what have next to tell will be result of own personal experience chapter ii about five month after alfred monkton came of age left college resolved to amuse instruct little by traveling abroad at time when quitted england young monkton be still leading secluded life at abbey be in opinion of everybody sinking rapidly if have not already succumbed under hereditary

hitherto proved utterly fruitless impression be said after moment consideration that inquiry made along high road anywhere near rome be likely to be made in vain a to discovery of uncle remains be think identical with discovery of place where be shot for engaged in duel must certainly not risk detection by carrying corpse distance with in flight place then be that want to find out now let consider for moment dueling party changed carriage traveled separately two two doubtless took roundabout road stopped at post house town a blind walked perhaps considerable distance unguided depend upon such precaution a know must have employed left very little time out of two day though might start at sunrise not stop at night fall for straightforward traveling belief therefore be that duel be

mountain be idea do think worth anything face flushed over in instant think inspiration cried not day be to be lost in carrying out plan police be not to be trusted with must start to morrow morning stopped face grew suddenly pale sighed heavily eye wandered once more into fixed look at vacancy rigid deathly expression fastened again upon feature must tell secret before talk of to morrow proceeded faintly if hesitated longer at confessing everything must be unworthy of past kindness unworthy of help be last hope that will gladly give when have heard begged to wait until be more composed until be better able to speak did not appear to notice what said slowly struggling a seemed against turned little away from bending head over table supported on hand packet of letter with have seen occupied when came in lay just beneath eye looked down on steadfastly when next spoke to chapter iv be born believe in county said perhaps therefore may have heard at time of curious old prophecy about family be still preserved among tradition of wincot abbey have heard of such prophecy answered never knew in what term be expressed professed to predict extinction of family something of sort did not inquiry went on have traced back prophecy to time when be first made none of family record tell anything of origin old servant old tenant of ours remember to have heard from father grandfather monk whom succeeded in abbey in henry eighth time got knowledge of in way for discovered rhyme in know prophecy to have be preserved from very remote period written on blank leaf of one of abbey manuscript be verse if verse deserve to be called when in wincot vault place wait for one of monkton race when one forlorn will lie graveless under open sky beggared of six foot of earth though lord of acre from birth that will be certain sign of end of monkton line dwindling ever faster faster dwindling to last left master from mortal ken from light of day monkton race will pas away prediction seems almost vague enough to have be uttered by ancient oracle said observing that waited after repeating verse a if expecting to say something vague not be being accomplished returned be

be ours when lived in ancient manor house near very ruin of have long since disappeared family burying place be in vault under abbey chapel whether in remote time prediction against be known dreaded not much be certain one of monktons whether living at abbey on smaller estate in scotland be buried in wincot vault matter at what risk what sacrifice in fierce fighting day of olden time body of ancestor who fell in foreign place be recovered brought back to wincot though often cost not heavy ransom only desperate bloodshed a well to obtain superstition if please to call so have never died out of family from time to present day for century succession of dead in vault at abbey have be unbroken absolutely unbroken until now place mentioned in prediction a waiting to be filled be stephen monkton place voice cry vainly to earth for shelter be spirit voice of dead a surely a if saw know that have left unburied on ground where fell stopped before must utter word in remonstrance by slowly rising to foot pointing in same direction toward eye have wandered short time since can guess what want to ask exclaimed sternly loudly want to ask how can be mad enough to believe in doggerel prophecy uttered in age of superstition to awe most ignorant hearer answer at word voice sank suddenly to whisper answer because stephen monkton stand there at moment confirming in belief whether be awe horror that looked out ghastly from face a confronted whether be that have never hitherto fairly believed in report about madness that conviction of truth now forced upon on sudden know not felt blood curdling a spoke knew in own heart a sat there speechless dare not turn round look where be still pointing close at side see there went on in same whispering voice figure of dark complexioned man standing up with head uncovered one of hand still clutching pistol have fallen to side other press bloody handkerchief over mouth spasm of mortal agony convulses feature know for feature of swarthy man who twice frightened by taking up in arm when be child at wincot abbey asked nurse at time who that man be told be uncle stephen monkton plainly a if stood there living see now at side with death glare in great black eye so have ever seen since moment when be shot at home abroad waking sleeping day night be always together wherever go whispering tone sank into almost inaudible murmuring a pronounced last word from direction expression of eye suspected that be speaking to apparition if have beheld at moment must have be think le horrible sight to witness than to see a saw now muttering inarticulately at vacancy own nerve be more shaken than must have thought possible by what have passed vague dread of being near in present mood came over moved back step two noticed action instantly go pray pray go have alarmed believe do light make eye ache only asked to sit in glare of candle because must not bear to see light always shine from phantom there at dusk shining over a sat in shadow go leave yet there be utter forlornness unspeakable misery in face a spoke word gave back self possession by simple process of first moving to pity resumed chair said must stay with a long a wished thank thousand time be patience kindness said going back to former place resuming former gentleness of manner now have got over first confession of misery follows in secret wherever go think can tell calmly remains to be told see a said uncle stephen turned away head quickly looked down at table a name passed lip uncle stephen came twice to wincot while be child on occasion frightened dreadfully only took up in arm spoke to very kindly a afterward heard for terrified nevertheless perhaps be frightened at great stature swarthy complexion thick black hair mustache a other child might have be perhaps mere sight of have strange influence on must not then understand can not now explain however be used to dream of long after have gone away to fancy that be stealing on to catch up in arm whenever be left in dark servant who took care of found out used to threaten with uncle stephen be perverse difficult to manage a grew up still retained vague dread abhorrence of absent relative always listened intently yet without knowing why whenever name be mentioned by father mother listened with unaccountable presentiment that something terrible have happened to be about to happen to feeling only changed when be left alone in abbey then seemed to merge into eager curiosity have begun to grow on rather before time about origin of ancient prophecy predicting extinction of race be following follow word with closest attention must know then have first found out fragment of old rhyme in prophecy occurs quoted a curiosity in antiquarian book in library on page opposite quotation have be pasted rude old wood cut representing dark haired man whose face be so strangely like what remembered of uncle stephen that portrait absolutely startled when asked father about be then just before death knew pretended to know nothing of when afterward mentioned prediction fretfully changed subject be just same with chaplain when spoke to said portrait have be done century before uncle be born called prophecy doggerel nonsense used to argue with on latter point asking why catholic who believed that gift of working miracle have never departed from certain favored person might not just a well believe that gift of prophecy have never departed must not dispute with must only say must not waste time in thinking of such trifle have more imagination than be good for must suppress instead of exciting such advice a only irritated curiosity determined secretly to search throughout oldest uninhabited part of abbey to try if must not find out from forgotten family record what portrait be when prophecy have be first written uttered did ever pas day alone in long deserted chamber of ancient house never such solitude a be not at to taste ah what life be when began search must like to live over again such tempting suspense such strange discovery such wild fancy such inthralling terror belonged to life only think of breaking open door of room living soul have entered before for nearly hundred year think of first step forward into region of airless awful stillness where light fall faint sickly through closed window rotting curtain think of ghostly creaking of old floor cry out on for treading on step a softly a will think of arm helmet weird tapestry of by gone day seem to be moving out on from wall a first walk up to in dim light think of prying into great cabinet iron clasped chest not knowing what horror may appear when tear open of poring over content till twilight stole on darkness grew terrible in lonely place of trying to leave not being able to go a if something held of wind wailing at outside of shadow darkening round closing up in obscurity within only think of thing may imagine fascination of suspense terror in life a mine be in past day shrank from imagining that life be bad enough to see result a saw before now well search lasted month month then be suspended little then resumed in direction pursued always found something to lure on terrible confession of past crime shocking proof of secret wickedness have be hidden securely from eye mine came to light sometimes discovery be associated with particular part of abbey have have horrible interest of own for ever since sometimes with certain old portrait in picture gallery actually dreaded to look at after what have found out there be period when result of search of mine so horrified that determined to give up entirely never must persevere in resolution temptation to go on seemed at certain interval to get too strong for then yielded to again again at last found book have belonged to monk with whole of prophecy written in blank leaf first success encouraged to get back further yet in family record have discovered nothing hitherto of identity of mysterious portrait same intuitive conviction have assured of extraordinary resemblance to uncle stephen seemed also to assure that must be more closely connected with prophecy must know more of than one else have mean of holding communication with mean of satisfying whether strange idea of mine be right wrong until day when doubt be settled forever by same terrible proof be now present to in very room paused for moment looked at intently suspiciously then asked if believed have said to so far instant reply in affirmative seemed to satisfy doubt went on on fine evening in february be standing alone in one of deserted room of western turret at abbey looking at sunset just before sun went down felt sensation stealing over be impossible to explain saw nothing heard nothing knew nothing utter self oblivion came suddenly be not fainting for did not fall to ground did not move inch from place if thing must be must say be temporary separation of soul body without death description of situation at time be impossible call state what will trance catalepsy know remained standing by window utterly unconscious dead mind body until sun have set then came to sens again then when opened eye there be apparition of stephen monkton standing opposite to faintly luminous just a stand opposite at very moment by side be before news of duel reached england asked two week before news of reached at wincot even when heard of duel did not hear of day on be fought only found that out when document have read be published in french newspaper date of document will remember be february d be stated that duel be fought two day afterward wrote down in pocketbook on evening when saw phantom day of month on first appeared to that day be th of february paused again a if expecting to say something after word have just spoken what must say what must think even in first horror of first seeing apparition went on prophecy against house came to mind with conviction beheld before in spectral presence warning of own doom a soon a recovered little determined nevertheless to test reality of what saw to find out whether be dupe of own diseased fancy not left turret phantom left with made excuse to have drawing room at abbey brilliantly lighted up figure be still opposite walked out into park be there in clear starlight went away from home traveled many mile to sea side still tall dark man in death agony be with after strove against fatality no more returned to abbey tried to resign to misery be not to be have hope be dearer to than own life have one treasure belonging to that shuddered at prospect of losing when phantom presence stood warning obstacle between one treasure dearest hope then misery grew heavier than must bear must know what be alluding to must have heard often be engaged to be married yes often have acquaintance with miss elmslie never can know that have sacrificed for never can imagine what have felt for year year past voice trembled tear came into eye dare not trust to speak of that thought of old happy day in abbey almost break heart now let get back to other subject must tell kept frightful vision pursued at time in place secret from everybody knowing vile report about having inherited madness from family fearing that unfair advantage must be taken of confession might make though phantom always stood opposite to therefore always appeared before by side of person to whom spoke soon schooled to hide from others be looking at except on rare occasion when have perhaps betrayed to self possession availed nothing with day of marriage be approaching stopped shuddered waited in silence till have controlled think went on think of what must have suffered at looking always on hideous vision whenever looked on betrothed wife think of taking hand seeming to take through figure of apparition think of calm angel face tortured specter face being always together whenever eye met hers think of will not wonder that betrayed secret to eagerly entreated to know worst nay more insisted on knowing at bidding told then left free to break engagement thought of death be in heart a spoke parting word death by own act if life still held out after separation suspected that thought knew never left till good influence have destroyed forever for must not have be alive now for must never have attempted project have brought here do mean that be at miss elmslie suggestion that came to naples asked in amazement mean that what said suggested design have brought to naples answered while believed that phantom have appeared to a fatal messenger of death there be comfort there be misery rather in hearing say that power on earth must make desert that must live for for only through trial be far different when afterward reasoned together about purpose apparition have come to fulfill far different when showed that mission might be for good instead of for evil that warning be sent to give might be to profit instead of to loss at word new idea gave new hope of life came to in instant believed then what believe now have supernatural warrant for errand here in faith live without must die never ridiculed never scorned a insanity mark what say spirit appeared to in abbey have never left since stand there now by side warns to escape from fatality hang over race command if must avoid to bury unburied dead mortal love mortal interest must bow to awful bidding specter presence will never leave till have sheltered corpse cry to earth to cover dare not return dare not marry till have filled place be empty in wincot vault eye flashed dilated voice deepened fanatic ecstasy shone in expression a uttered word shocked grieved a be made attempt to remonstrate to reason with must have be useless to have referred to of usual commonplace about optical delusion diseased imagination worse than useless to have attempted to account by natural cause for of extraordinary coincidence event of have spoken briefly a have referred to miss elmslie have said enough to show that only hope of poor girl who loved best have known longest of one be in humoring delusion to last how faithfully still clung to belief that must restore how resolutely be sacrificing to morbid fancy in hope of happy future might never come little a knew of miss elmslie mere thought of situation a now reflected on made feel sick at heart call mad monkton exclaimed suddenly breaking silence between during last few minute here in england everybody belief be out of sens except ada have be salvation will be salvation too something told that when first met walking in villa peale struggled against strong desire be in to trust secret to must resist no longer when saw to night at ball phantom seemed to draw on to a stood alone in quiet room tell more of idea of yours about finding place where duel be fought if set out to morrow to seek for where must go to first where stopped strength be evidently becoming exhausted mind be growing confused what be to do ca remember know everything will not help misery have made unable to help stopped murmured something about failing if went to frontier alone spoke confusedly of delay might be fatal then tried to utter name of ada in pronouncing first letter voice faltered turning abruptly from burst into tear pity for got better of prudence at moment without thinking of responsibility promised at once to do for asked wild triumph in expression a started up seized hand showed that have better have be more cautious be too late now to retract what have said next best thing to do be to try if must not induce to compose little then to go away think coolly over whole affair by yes yes rejoined in answer to few word now spoke to try calm be afraid about after what have said will answer for own coolness composure under emergency have be so long used to apparition hardly feel presence at except on rare occasion besides have here in little packet of letter medicine for malady of sick heart be ada letter read to calm whenever misfortune seems to get better of endurance wanted that half hour to read in to night before came to make fit to see will go through again after be gone so once more be afraid about know will succeed with help ada will thank a deserve to be thanked when get back to england if hear fool at naples talk about being mad trouble to contradict scandal be so contemptible that must end by contradicting left promising to return early next day when got back to hotel felt that idea of sleeping after have seen heard be out of question so lit pipe sitting by window how refreshed mind just then to look at calm moonlight tried to think what must be best to do in first place appeal to doctor to alfred friend in england be out of question must not persuade that intellect be sufficiently disordered to justify under existing circumstance in disclosing secret have intrusted to keeping in second place attempt on part to induce to abandon idea of searching out uncle remains must be utterly useless after what have incautiously said to having settled two conclusion only really great difficulty remained to perplex be whether be justified in aiding to execute extraordinary purpose supposing that with help found mr monkton body took back with to england be right in thus to lend to promoting marriage must most likely follow event marriage might be duty of one to prevent at hazard set thinking about extent of madness to speak more mildly more correctly of delusion sane certainly be on ordinary subject nay in narrative part of what have said to on very evening have spoken clearly connectedly a for story of apparition other men with intellect a clear a intellect of neighbor have fancied pursued by phantom have even written about in high strain of philosophical speculation be plain that real hallucination in case now before lay in monkton conviction of truth of old prophecy in idea that fancied apparition be supernatural warning to to evade denunciation be equally clear that delusion have be produced in first instance by lonely life have led acting on naturally excitable temperament be rendered further liable to moral disease by hereditary taint of insanity be curable miss elmslie who knew far better than did seemed by conduct to think so have reason right to determine offhand that be mistaken supposing refused to go to frontier with must then most certainly depart by to commit sort of error perhaps to meet with sort of accident while idle man with time entirely at own disposal be stopping at naples leaving to fate after have suggested plan of expedition have encouraged to confide in in way kept turning subject over over again in mind being quite free let add from looking at in other than practical point of view firmly believed a derider of ghost story alfred be deceiving in fancying that have seen apparition of uncle before news of mr monkton death reached england be on account therefore uninfluenced by slightest infection of unhappy friend delusion when at last fairly decided to accompany in extraordinary search possibly harum scarum fondness for excitement at time biased little in forming resolution must add in common justice to myself that also acted from motif of real sympathy for monkton from sincere wish to allay if must anxiety of poor girl who be still so faithfully waiting hoping for far away in england certain arrangement preliminary to departure found obliged to make after second interview with alfred betrayed object of journey to most of neapolitan friend astonishment of everybody be of course unbounded nearly universal suspicion must be a mad in way a monkton showed pretty plainly in presence people actually tried to combat resolution by telling what shameless profligate stephen monkton have be a if have strong personal interest in hunting out remains ridicule moved a little a argument of sort mind be made up be a obstinate then a be now in two day time have got everything ready have ordered traveling carriage to door hour earlier than have originally settled be jovially threatened with parting cheer by english acquaintance thought desirable to avoid on friend account for have be more excited a be by preparation for journey than at liked accordingly soon after sunrise without soul in street to stare at privately left naples nobody will wonder think experienced difficulty in realizing own position shrank instinctively from looking forward single day into future when now found starting in company with mad monkton to hunt for body of dead duelist along frontier line of roman state chapter v have settled in own mind that have better make town of fondi close on frontier headquarters to begin with have arranged with assistance of embassy that leaden coffin must follow so far securely nailed up in packing case besides passport be well furnished with letter of introduction to local authority at most of important frontier town to crown have money enough at command thanks to monkton vast fortune to make sure of service of one whom wanted to assist along line of search various resource insured facility for action provided always that succeeded in discovering body of dead duelist in very probable event of failing to do future prospect more especially after responsibility have undertaken be of anything agreeable nature to contemplate confess felt uneasy almost hopeless a posted in dazzling italian sunshine along road to fondi made easy two day journey of for have insisted on monkton account that must travel slowly on first day excessive agitation of companion little alarmed showed in many way more symptom of disordered mind than have observed in on second day however seemed to get accustomed to contemplate calmly new idea of search on be bent except on one point be cheerful composed enough whenever dead uncle formed subject of conversation still persisted on strength of old prophecy under influence of apparition saw thought saw always in asserting that corpse of stephen monkton wherever be lay yet unburied on other topic deferred to with utmost readiness docility on maintained strange opinion with obstinacy set reason persuasion alike at defiance on third day rested at fondi packing case with coffin in reached be deposited in safe place under lock key engaged mule found man to act a guide who knew country thoroughly occurred to that have better begin by confiding real object of journey only to most trustworthy people must find among better educated class for reason followed in one respect example of fatal dueling party by starting early on morning of fourth day with sketch book color box a if be only artist in search of picturesque after traveling hour in northerly direction within roman frontier halted to rest ourselves mule at wild little village far out of track of tourist in general only person of smallest importance in place be priest to addressed first inquiry leaving monkton to await return with guide spoke italian quite fluently correctly enough for purpose be extremely polite cautious in introducing business in spite of pain took only succeeded in frightening bewildering poor priest more more with fresh word said to idea of dueling party dead man seemed to scare out of sens bowed fidgeted cast eye up to heaven piteously shrugging shoulder told with rapid italian circumlocution that have not faintest idea of what be talking about be first failure confess be weak enough to feel little dispirited when rejoined monkton guide after heat of day be over resumed journey about three mile from village road rather cart track branched off in two direction path to right guide informed led up among mountain to convent about six mile off if penetrated beyond convent must soon reach neapolitan frontier path to left led far inward on roman territory must conduct to small town where must sleep for night now roman territory presented first fittest field for search convent be always within reach supposing returned to fondi unsuccessful besides path to left led over widest part of country be starting to explore be always for vanquishing greatest difficulty first so decided manfully on turning to left expedition in resolution involved lasted whole week produced result discovered absolutely nothing returned to headquarters at fondi so completely baffled that did not know whither to turn step next be made much more uneasy by effect of failure on monkton than by failure resolution appeared to break down altogether a soon a began to retrace step became first fretful capricious then silent desponding finally sank into lethargy of body mind seriously alarmed on morning after return to fondi showed strange tendency to sleep incessantly made suspect existence of physical malady in brain whole day hardly exchanged word with seemed to be never fairly awake early next morning went into room found a silent lethargic a ever servant who be with informed that alfred have once twice before exhibited such physical symptom of mental exhaustion a be now observing during father lifetime at wincot abbey piece of information made feel easier left mind free to return to consideration of errand have brought to fondi resolved to occupy time until companion got better in prosecuting search by path to right hand led to convent have not yet be explored if set off to trace need not be away from monkton more than one night must at least be able on return to give satisfaction of knowing that one more uncertainty regarding place of duel have be cleared up consideration decided left message for friend in case asked where have gone set out once more for village at have halted when starting on first expedition intending to walk to convent parted company with guide mule where track branched off leaving to go back to village await return for first four mile path gently ascended through open country then became abruptly much steeper led deeper deeper among thicket endless wood by time watch informed that must have nearly walked appointed distance view be bounded on side sky be shut out overhead by impervious screen of leaf branch still followed only guide steep path in ten minute emerging suddenly on plot of tolerably clear level ground saw convent before be dark low sinister looking place not sign of life movement be visible anywhere about green stain streaked once white facade of chapel in direction moss clustered thick in crevice of heavy scowling wall surrounded convent long lank weed grew out of fissure of roof parapet drooping far downward waved wearily in out of barred dormitory window very cross opposite entrance gate with shocking life sized figure in wood nailed to be so beset at base with crawling creature looked so slimy green rotten way up that absolutely shrank from bell rope with broken handle hung by gate approached hesitated hardly knew why looked up at convent again then walked round to back of building partly to gain time to consider what have better do next partly from unaccountable curiosity urged strangely to myself to see must of outside of place before attempted to gain admission at gate at back of convent found outhouse built on to wall clumsy decayed building with greater part of roof fallen in with jagged hole in one of side where in probability window have once be behind outhouse tree grew thicker than ever a looked toward must not determine whether ground beyond rose fell whether be grassy earthy rocky must see nothing pervading leaf bramble fern long grass not sound broke oppressive stillness bird note rose from leafy wilderness around voice spoke in convent garden behind scowling wall clock struck in chapel tower dog barked in ruined outhouse dead silence deepened solitude of place inexpressibly began to feel weighing on spirit more because wood be never favorite place with to walk in sort of pastoral happiness poet often represent when sing of life in wood never to mind have charm of life on mountain in plain when be in wood miss boundless loveliness of sky delicious softness distance give to earthly view beneath feel oppressively change free air suffers when get imprisoned among leaf be always awed rather than pleased by mysterious still light shine with strange dim luster in deep place among tree may convict of want of taste absence of due feeling for marvelous beauty of vegetation must frankly own never penetrate far into wood without finding that getting out of again be pleasantest part of walk getting out on to barest down wildest hill side bleakest mountain top getting out anywhere so that can see sky over view before a far a eye can reach after such confession a have now made will appear surprising to one must have felt strongest possible inclination while stood by ruined outhouse to retrace step at once make best of way out of wood have indeed actually turned to depart when remembrance of errand have brought to convent suddenly stayed foot seemed doubtful whether must be admitted into building if rang bell more than doubtful if be let in whether inhabitant must be able to afford clew to information of be in search however be duty to monkton to leave mean of helping in desperate object untried so resolved to go round to front of convent again ring at gate bell at hazard by merest chance looked up a passed side of outhouse where jagged hole be noticed that be pierced rather high in wall a stopped to observe closeness of atmosphere in wood seemed to be affecting more unpleasantly than ever waited minute untied cravat closeness surely be something more than that air be even more distasteful to nostril than to lung there be faint indescribable smell loading smell of have never have previous experience smell thought now that attention be directed to grew more more certainly traceable to source nearer advanced to outhouse by time have tried experiment two three time have made sure of fact curiosity became excited there be plenty of fragment of stone brick lying about gathered of together piled up below hole then mounted to top feeling rather ashamed of what be doing peeped into outhouse sight of horror that met eye instant looked through hole be a present to memory now a if have beheld yesterday can hardly write of at distance of time without thrill of old terror running through again to heart first impression conveyed to a looked in be of long recumbent object tinged with lightish blue color over extended on trestle bearing certain hideous half formed resemblance to human face figure looked again felt certain of there be prominence of forehead nose chin dimly shown a under veil there round outline of chest hollow below there point of knee stiff ghastly upturned foot looked again yet more attentively eye got accustomed to dim light streaming in through broken roof satisfied judging by great length of body from head to foot be looking at corpse of man corpse have apparently once have sheet spread over that have lain rotting on trestle under open sky long enough for linen to take livid light blue tinge of mildew decay now covered how long remained with eye fixed on dread sight of death on tombless terrible wreck of humanity poisoning still air seeming even to stain faint descending light disclosed know not remember dull distant sound among tree a if breeze be rising slow creeping on of sound to near place where stood noiseless whirling fall of dead leaf on corpse below through gap in outhouse roof effect of awakening energy of relaxing heavy strain on mind even slight change wrought in scene beheld by falling leaf produced in immediately descended to ground sitting down on heap of stone wiped away thick perspiration covered face now became aware of for first time be something more than hideous spectacle unexpectedly offered to eye have shaken nerve a felt that be shaken now monkton prediction that if succeeded in discovering uncle body must find unburied recurred to instant saw trestle ghastly burden felt assured on instant have found dead man old prophecy recurred to memory strange yearning sorrow vague foreboding of ill inexplicable terror a thought of poor lad who be awaiting return in distant town struck through with chill of superstitious dread robbed of judgment resolution left when have at last recovered weak dizzy a if have just suffered under pang of overpowering physical pain hastened round to convent gate rang impatiently at bell waited little while rang again then heard footstep in middle of gate just opposite face there be small sliding panel not more than few inch long be presently pushed aside from within saw through bit of iron grating two dull light gray eye staring vacantly at heard feeble husky voice saying what may please to want ' be traveler began live in miserable place have nothing to show traveler here come to see anything have important question to ask believe one in convent will be able to answer if be not willing to let in at least come out speak to here be alone quite alone be there woman with none gate be slowly unbarred old capuchin very infirm very suspicious very dirty stood before be far too excited impatient to waste time in prefatory phrase so telling monk at once how have looked through hole in outhouse what have seen inside asked in plain term who man have be whose corpse have beheld why body be left unburied old capuchin listened to with watery eye twinkled suspiciously have battered tin snuff box in hand finger thumb slowly chased few scattered grain of snuff round round inside of box time be speaking when have done shook head said be certainly ugly sight in outhouse one of ugliest sight felt sure that ever have seen in life want to talk of sight rejoined impatiently want to know who man be how died why be not decently buried can tell monk finger thumb having captured three four grain of snuff at last slowly drew into nostril holding box open under nose while to prevent possibility of wasting even one grain sniffed once twice luxuriously closed box then looked at again with eye watering twinkling more suspiciously than before yes said monk be ugly sight in outhouse very ugly sight certainly never have more difficulty in keeping temper in life than at moment succeeded however in repressing very disrespectful expression on subject of monk in general be on tip of tongue made attempt to conquer old man exasperating reserve fortunately for chance of succeeding with be snuff taker have box full of excellent english snuff in pocket now produced a bribe be last resource thought box seemed empty just now said will try pinch out of mine offer be accepted with almost youthful alacrity of gesture capuchin took largest pinch ever saw held between man finger thumb inhaled slowly without spilling single grain half closed eye wagging head gently patted paternally on back oh son said monk what delectable snuff oh son amiable traveler give spiritual father who love yet tiny tiny pinch let fill box for will have plenty left for battered tin snuff box be given to before have done speaking paternal hand patted back more approvingly than ever feeble husky voice grew glib eloquent in praise have evidently found out weak side of old capuchin on returning box took instant advantage of discovery excuse troubling on subject again said have particular reason for wanting to hear that can tell in explanation of horrible sight in outhouse come in answered monk drew inside gate closed then leading way across grass grown courtyard looking out on weedy kitchen garden showed into long room with low ceiling dirty

function to want word to thank for kindness answered brother must have borne with more affectionately helped more patiently than stopped grew thoughtful then occupied in tying up slowly carefully packet of miss elmslie letter then looked suddenly toward vacant wall behind with strange expression meaning of knew so well since have left naples have purposely avoided exciting by talking on useless shocking subject of apparition by believed to be perpetually followed just now however seemed so calm collected so little likely to be violently agitated by allusion to dangerous topic ventured to speak out boldly doe phantom still appear to asked a appeared at naples looked at smiled did not tell that followed everywhere eye wandered back again to vacant space went on speaking in direction a if have be continuing conversation with third person in room will part said slowly softly when empty place be filled in wincot vault then will stand with ada before altar in abbey chapel when eye meet hers will see tortured face more saying leaned head on hand sighed began repeating softly to line of old prophecy when in wincot vault place wait for one of monkton race when one forlorn will lie graveless under open sky beggared of six foot of earth though lord of acre from birth that will be certain sign of end of monktons line dwindling ever faster faster dwindling to last left

race will pas away repeated not with fatality hang over head no longer will bury unburied dead will fill vacant place in wincot vault then then new life life with ada name seemed to recall to drew traveling desk toward placed packet of letter in then took out sheet of paper be going to write to ada said turning to tell good news happiness when know will be even greater than mine worn out by event of day left writing went to bed be however either too anxious too tired to sleep in waking condition mind naturally occupied with discovery at convent with event to discovery must in probability lead a thought on future depression for must not account weighed on spirit there be not slightest reason for vaguely melancholy foreboding oppressed remains to finding of unhappy friend attached so much importance have be traced must certainly be placed at disposal in few day might take to england by first merchant vessel sailed from naples gratification of strange caprice thus accomplished there be at least reason to hope that mind might recover tone that new life must lead at wincot might result in making happy man such consideration a be in certainly not calculated to exert melancholy influence over yet through night same inconceivable unaccountable depression weighed heavily on spirit heavily through hour of darkness heavily even when walked out to breathe first freshness of early morning air with day came engrossing business of opening negotiation with authority only who have have to deal with italian official can imagine how patience be tried by one with whom came in contact be bandied about from one authority to other be stared at cross questioned mystified not in least because case presented special difficulty intricacy because be absolutely necessary that civil dignitary to whom applied must assert own importance by leading to object in most roundabout manner possible after first day experience of official life in italy left absurd formality have choice to perform to be accomplished by alfred alone applied to really serious question of how remains in convent outhouse be to be safely removed best plan suggested to be to write to friend in rome where knew that be custom to embalm body of high dignitary of church where consequently inferred such chemical assistance a be needed in emergency might be obtained simply stated in letter that removal of body be imperative then described condition in have found engaged that expense on part must be spared if right person person must be found to help here again more difficulty interposed more useless formality be to be gone through in end patience perseverance money triumphed two men came expressly from rome to undertake duty required of be unnecessary must shock reader by entering into detail in part of narrative when have said that progress of decay be so far suspended by chemical mean a to allow of remains being placed in coffin to insure being transported to england with perfect safety convenience have said enough after ten day have be wasted in useless delay difficulty have satisfaction of seeing convent outhouse empty at last passed through final ceremony of snuff taking rather of snuff giving with old capuchin ordered traveling carriage to be ready at inn door hardly month have elapsed since departure ere entered naples successful in achievement of design have be ridiculed a wildly impracticable by friend of ours who have heard of first object to be accomplished on return be to obtain mean of carrying coffin to england by sea a matter of course inquiry after merchant vessel on point of sailing for british port led to most unsatisfactory result there be only one way of insuring immediate transportation of remains to england be to hire vessel impatient to return resolved not to lose sight of coffin till have seen placed in wincot vault monkton decided immediately on hiring first ship must be obtained vessel in port be informed must soonest be got ready for sea be sicilian brig vessel friend accordingly engaged best dock yard artisan must be got be set to work smartest captain crew to be picked up on emergency in naples be chosen to navigate brig monkton after again expressing in warmest term gratitude for service have rendered disclaimed intention of asking to accompany on voyage to england greatly to surprise delight however offered of own accord to take passage in brig strange coincidence have witnessed extraordinary discovery have hit on since first meeting in naples have made one great interest in life one great interest for time being a well shared none of delusion poor fellow be hardly exaggeration to say that eagerness to follow remarkable adventure to end be a great a anxiety to see coffin laid in wincot vault curiosity influenced be afraid almost a strongly a friendship when offered a companion of voyage home set sail for england on calm lovely afternoon for first time since have known monkton seemed to be in high spirit talked jested on sort of subject laughed at for allowing cheerfulness to be affected by dread of seasickness have really such fear be excuse to friend for return of unaccountable depression under have suffered at fondi everything be in favor everybody on board brig be in good spirit captain be delighted with vessel crew italian maltese be in high glee at prospect of making short voyage on high wage in well provisioned ship alone felt heavy at heart there be valid reason must assign to myself for melancholy oppressed yet struggled against in vain late on first night at sea made discovery be by mean calculated to restore spirit to usual equilibrium monkton be in cabin on floor of have be placed packing case containing coffin be on deck wind have fallen almost to calm be lazily watching sail of brig a flapped from time to time against mast when captain approached drawing out of hearing of man at helm whispered in ear there be something wrong among men forward did observe how suddenly became silent just before sunset have observed told so there be maltese boy on board pursued captain who be smart enough lad bad one to deal with have found out that have be telling men there be dead body inside that packing case of friend in cabin heart sank a spoke knowing superstitious irrationality of sailor of foreign sailor especially have taken care to spread report on board brig before coffin be shipped that packing case contained valuable marble statue mr monkton prized highly be unwilling to trust out of own sight how must maltese boy have discovered that pretended statue be human corpse a pondered over question suspicion fixed on monkton servant who spoke italian fluently whom knew to be incorrigible gossip man denied when charged with betraying have never believed denial to day little imp wo say where picked up notion of about dead body continued captain be not place to pry into secret advise to call crew aft contradict boy whether speaks truth not men be parcel of fool who believe in ghost rest of of say must never have signed article if have known be going to sail with dead man others only grumble be afraid will have trouble with in case of rough weather unless boy be contradicted by other gentleman men say that if friend tell on word of honor that maltese be liar will hand up to be rope ended accordingly that if wo have made up mind to believe boy here captain paused awaited answer must give none felt hopeless under desperate emergency to get boy punished by giving word of honor to support direct falsehood be not to be thought of even for moment what other mean of extrication from miserable dilemma remained none must think of thanked captain for attention to interest told must take time to consider what course must pursue begged that must say nothing to friend about discovery have made promised to be silent sulkily enough walked away from have expected breeze to spring up with morning breeze came a wore on toward noon atmosphere became insufferably sultry sea looked a smooth a glass saw captain eye turn often anxiously to windward far away in direction alone in blue heaven observed little black cloud asked if must bring wind more than want captain replied shortly then to astonishment ordered crew aloft to take in sail execution of maneuver showed too plainly temper of men did work sulkily slowly grumbling murmuring among captain manner a urged on with oath threat convinced be in danger looked again to windward one little cloud have enlarged to great bank of murky vapor sea at horizon have changed in color squall will be on before know where be said captain go below will be only in way here descended to cabin prepared monkton for what be coming be still questioning about what have observed on deck when storm burst on felt little brig strain for instant a if must part in two then seemed to be swinging round with then to be quite still for moment trembling in timber last came shock hurled from seat deafening crash flood of water pouring into cabin clambered half drowned to deck brig have in nautical phrase broached to now lay on beam end before must make out anything distinctly in horrible confusion except one tremendous certainty that be entirely at mercy of sea heard voice from fore part of ship stilled clamoring shouting of rest of crew in instant word be in italian understood fatal meaning only too easily have sprung leak sea be pouring into ship hold like race of mill stream captain did not lose presence of mind in fresh emergency called for ax to cut away foremast ordering of crew to help directed others to rig out pump word have hardly passed lip before men broke into open mutiny with savage look at ringleader declared that passenger might do a pleased that messmate be determined to take to boat leave accursed ship dead man in to go to bottom together a spoke there be shout among sailor observed of pointing derisively behind looking round saw monkton who have hitherto kept close at side making way back to cabin followed directly water confusion on deck impossibility from position of brig of moving foot without slow assistance of hand so impeded progress that be impossible for to overtake when have got below be crouched upon coffin with water on cabin floor whirling splashing about a ship heaved plunged saw warning brightness in eye warning flush on cheek a approached said to there be nothing left for alfred to bow to misfortune do best can to save life save yours cried waving hand to for have future before mine be gone when coffin go to bottom if ship sink will know that fatality be accomplished will sink with saw that be in state to be reasoned with persuaded raised again to deck men be cutting away obstacle so a to launch longboat placed amidships over depressed bulwark of brig a lay on side captain after having made last vain exertion to restore authority be looking on at in silence violence of squall seemed already to be spending asked whether there be really chance for if remained by ship captain answered that there might have be best chance if men have obeyed order now there be none knowing must place dependence on presence of mind of monkton servant confided to captain in fewest plainest word condition of unhappy friend asked if might depend on help nodded head descended together to cabin even at day cost pain to write of terrible necessity to strength obstinacy of monkton delusion reduced in last resort be compelled to secure hand drag by main force to deck men be on point of launching boat refused at first to receive into coward cried captain have got dead man with time be going to bottom along with brig who be afraid of when get into boat sort of appeal produced desired effect men became ashamed of retracted refusal just a pushed off from sinking ship alfred made effort to break from held firm never repeated attempt sat by with drooping head still silent while sailor rowed away from vessel still silent when with one accord paused at little distance off waited watched to see brig sink still silent even when sinking happened when laboring hull plunged slowly into hollow of sea hesitated a seemed for one moment rose little again then sank to rise more sank with dead freight sank snatched forever from power corpse have discovered almost by miracle jealously preserved remains on safe keeping of rested so strangely hope love destiny of two living being a last sign of ship in depth of water felt monkton trembling over a sat close at side heard repeating to sadly many time over name of ada tried to turn thought to subject be useless pointed over sea to where brig have once be where nothing be left to look at rolling wave empty place will now remain empty forever in wincot vault a said word fixed eye for moment sadly earnestly on face then looked away leaned cheek on hand spoke more be sighted long before nightfall by trading vessel be taken on board landed at cartagena in spain alfred never held up head never once spoke to of own accord whole time be at sea in merchantman observed however with alarm that talked often incoherently to constantly muttering line of old prophecy constantly referring to fatal place be empty in wincot vault constantly repeating in broken accent affected inexpressibly to hear name of poor girl who be awaiting return to england be only cause for apprehension now felt on account toward end of voyage began to suffer from alternation of fever fit shivering fit ignorantly imagined to be attack of ague be soon undeceived have hardly be day on shore before became so much worse secured best medical assistance cartagena must afford for day two doctor differed a usual about nature of complaint ere long alarming symptom displayed medical men declared that life be in danger told that disease be brain fever shocked grieved a be hardly knew how to act at first under fresh responsibility now laid upon ultimately decided on writing to old

remain with monkton to last after have dispatched letter have sent to gibraltar to secure best english medical advice must be obtained felt that have done best that nothing remained to wait hope many sad anxious hour did pas by poor friend bedside many time did doubt whether have done right in giving encouragement to delusion reason for doing so have suggested to after first interview with seemed however on reflection to be valid reason still only way of hastening return to england to miss elmslie who be pining for return be way have taken be not fault that disaster man must foresee have overthrown project mine now that calamity have happened be irretrievable how in event of physical recovery be moral malady to be combated when reflected on hereditary taint in mental organization on first childish fright of stephen monkton from have never recovered on perilously secluded life that have led at abbey on firm persuasion of reality of apparition by believed to be constantly followed confess despaired of shaking superstitious faith in word line of old family prophecy if series of striking coincidence appeared to attest truth have made strong lasting impression on be assuredly case how must wonder that have produced effect of absolute conviction on mind constituted a be if argued with answered how must rejoin if said prophecy point at last of family be last of family prophecy

idea never leaf night day have unsettled reason will end in killing unless of friend can remove oftener heard more acutely felt own powerlessness more shrank from idea be connected with hopeless

of bargain mean to keep money be not yorkshire young gentleman have lived long enough in part to have wit sharpened must wonder if found out way to brighten up yours next time come among with word landlord turned toward door laughed to softly in high satisfaction at own sharpness startled shocked a be arthur have by time sufficiently recovered to feel indignant at trick have be played on at insolent manner in landlord exulted in laugh said sharply till be quite sure have got laugh against sha have five shilling for nothing man will keep bed will said landlord then wish good night rest with brief farewell went out shut door after good night rest word have hardly be spoken door have hardly be closed before arthur half repented hasty word have just escaped though not naturally over sensitive not wanting in courage of moral a well a physical sort presence of dead man have instantaneously chilling effect on mind when found alone in room alone bound by own rash word to stay there till next morning older man must have thought nothing of word must have acted without reference to a calmer sense suggested arthur be too young to treat ridicule even of inferior with contempt too young not to fear momentary humiliation of falsifying own foolish boast more than feared trial of watching out long night in same chamber with dead be few hour thought to can get away first thing in morning be looking toward occupied bed a idea passed through mind sharp angular eminence made in clothes by dead man upturned foot again caught eye advanced drew curtain purposely abstaining a did so from looking at face of corpse lest might unnerve at outset by fastening ghastly impression of on mind drew curtain very gently sighed involuntarily a closed poor fellow said almost a sadly a if have known man ah poor fellow went next to window night be black must see nothing from rain still pattered heavily against glass inferred from hearing that window be at back of house remembering that front be sheltered from weather by court building over while be still standing at window for even dreary rain be relief because of sound made relief also because moved have faint suggestion in consequence of life companionship in while be standing at window looking vacantly into black darkness outside heard distant church clock strike ten only ten how be to pas time till house be astir next morning under other circumstance must have gone down to public house parlor must have called for grog must have laughed talked with company assembled a familiarly a if have known life very thought of whiling away time in manner be now distasteful to new situation in be placed seemed to have altered to already thus far life have be common trifling prosaic surface life of prosperous young man with trouble to conquer trial to face have lost relation whom loved friend whom treasured till night what share have of immortal inheritance be divided among have lain dormant within till night death have not once met even in thought took few turn up down room then stopped noise made by boot on poorly carpeted floor jarred on ear hesitated little ended by taking boot off walking backward forward noiselessly desire to sleep to rest have left bare thought of lying down on unoccupied bed instantly drew picture on mind of dreadful mimicry of position of dead man who be what be story of past life poor must have be must not have stopped at place a two robin inn weakened probably by long illness must hardly have died in manner landlord have described poor ill lonely dead in strange place dead with nobody stranger to pity sad story truly on mere face of very sad story while thought be passing through mind have stopped insensibly at window close to stood foot of bed with closed curtain at first looked at absently then became conscious that eye be fixed on then perverse desire took possession of to do very thing have resolved not to do up to time to look at dead man stretched out hand toward curtain checked in very act of undrawing turned back sharply on bed walked toward chimney piece to see what thing be placed on to try if must keep dead man out of mind in way there be pewter inkstand on chimney piece with mildewed remains of ink in bottle there be two coarse china ornament of commonest kind there be square of embossed card dirty fly blown with collection of wretched riddle printed on in sort of zigzag direction in variously colored ink took card went away to read at table on candle be placed sitting down with back resolutely turned to curtained bed read first riddle second third in one corner of card then turned round impatiently to look at before must begin reading riddle printed here sound of church clock stopped eleven have got through hour of time in room with dead man once more looked at card be not easy to make out letter printed on in consequence of dimness of light landlord have left common tallow candle furnished with pair of heavy old fashioned steel snuffer up to time mind have be too much occupied to think of light have left wick of candle unsnuffed till have risen higher than flame have burned into odd pent house shape at top from morsel of charred cotton fell off from time to time in little flake took up snuffer now trimmed wick light brightened directly room became le dismal again turned to riddle reading doggedly resolutely now in one corner of card now in effort however must not fix attention on pursued occupation mechanically deriving sort of impression from what be reading be a if shadow from curtained bed have got between mind gayly printed letter shadow that nothing must dispel at last gave up struggle threw card from impatiently took to walking softly up down room again dead man dead man hidden dead man on bed there be one persistent idea still haunting hidden be only body being there be body being there concealed be preying on mind stopped at window with doubt in once more listening to pattering rain once more looking out into black darkness still dead man darkness forced mind back upon set memory at work reviving with painfully vivid distinctness momentary impression have received from first sight of corpse before long face seemed to be hovering out in middle of darkness confronting through window with paleness whiter with dreadful dull line of light between imperfectly closed eyelid broader than have seen with parted lip slowly dropping further further away from other with feature growing larger moving closer till seemed to fill window to silence rain to shut out night sound of voice shouting below stair woke suddenly from dream of own distempered fancy recognized a voice of landlord shut up at twelve ben heard say be off to bed wiped away damp have gathered on forehead reasoned with for little while resolved to shake mind free of ghastly counterfeit still clung to by forcing to confront if be only for moment solemn reality without allowing instant to hesitate parted curtain at foot of bed looked through there be sad peaceful white face with awful mystery of stillness on laid back upon pillow stir change there only looked at for moment before closed curtain again that moment steadied calmed restored mind body to returned to old occupation of walking up down room persevering in time till clock struck again twelve a sound of clock bell died away be succeeded by confused noise downstairs of drinker in taproom leaving house next sound after interval of silence be caused by barring of door closing of shutter at back of inn then silence followed again be disturbed no more be alone now absolutely hopelessly alone with dead man till next morning wick of candle wanted trimming again took up snuffer paused suddenly on very point of using looked attentively at candle then back over shoulder at curtained bed then again at candle have be lighted for first time to show way upstairs three part of at least be already consumed in hour must be burned out in hour unless called at once to man who have shut up inn for fresh candle must be left in dark strongly a mind have be affected since have entered room unreasonable dread of encountering ridicule of exposing courage to suspicion have not altogether lost influence over even yet lingered irresolutely by table waiting till must prevail on to open door call from landing to man who have shut up inn in present hesitating frame of mind be kind of relief to gain few moment only by engaging in trifling occupation of snuffing candle hand trembled little snuffer be heavy awkward to use when closed on wick closed hair breadth too low in instant candle be out room be plunged in pitch darkness one impression absence of light immediately produced on mind be distrust of curtained bed distrust shaped into distinct idea be powerful enough in very vagueness to bind down to chair to make heart beat fast to set listening intently sound stirred in room familiar sound of rain against window louder sharper now than have heard yet still vague distrust inexpressible dread possessed kept in chair have put carpet bag on table when first entered room now took key from pocket reached out hand softly opened bag groped in for traveling writing case in knew that there be small store of match when have got one of match waited before struck on coarse wooden table listened intently again without knowing why still there be sound in room steady ceaseless rattling sound of rain lighted candle again without moment of delay on instant of burning up first object in room that eye sought for be curtained bed just before light have be put out have looked in direction have seen change disarrangement of sort in fold of closely drawn curtain when looked at bed now saw hanging over side of long white hand lay perfectly motionless midway on side of bed where curtain at head curtain at foot met nothing more be visible clinging curtain hid everything long white hand stood looking at unable to stir unable to call out feeling nothing knowing nothing faculty possessed gathered up lost in one seeing faculty how long that first panic held never must tell afterward might have be only for moment might have be for many minute together how got to bed whether ran to headlong whether approached slowly how wrought up to unclose curtain look in never have remembered never will remember to dying day be enough that did go to bed that did look inside curtain man have moved one of arm be outside clothes face be turned little on pillow eyelid be wide open changed a to position a to one of feature face be otherwise fearfully wonderfully unaltered dead paleness dead quiet be on still one glance showed arthur one glance before flew breathlessly to door alarmed house man whom landlord called ben be first to appear

medicine ran to inn expecting to find nothing more remarkable when got there than patient in fit surprise at finding that man have spoken literal truth be almost if not quite equaled by astonishment at finding face to face with arthur holliday a soon a entered bedroom be time then for giving seeking explanation just shook hand amazedly then ordered everybody arthur out of room hurried to man on bed kitchen fire have not be long out there be plenty of hot water in boiler plenty of flannel to be have with with medicine with such help a arthur must render under direction dragged man literally out of jaw of death in le than hour from time when have be called in be alive talking in bed on have be laid out to wait for coroner inquest will naturally ask have be matter with might treat in reply to long theory plentifully sprinkled with what child call hard word prefer telling that in case cause effect must not be satisfactorily joined together by theory there be mystery in life condition of human science have not fathomed yet candidly confess to that in bringing man back to existence be morally speaking groping haphazard in dark know from testimony of doctor who attended in afternoon that vital machinery so far a action be appreciable by sens have in case unquestionably stopped be equally certain seeing that recovered that vital principle be not extinct when add that have suffered from long complicated illness that whole nervous system be utterly deranged have told really know of physical condition of dead alive patient at two robin inn when came to a phrase go be startling

dear fellow with arthur now have come to life again begin by being down hearted about prospect will answer for can help to capital thing in medical line if ca know father can medical student looked at steadily thank said coldly then added may ask who father be be well enough known about part of country replied arthur be great manufacturer name be holliday hand be on man wrist during brief conversation instant name of holliday be pronounced felt pulse under finger flutter stop go on suddenly with bound beat afterward for minute two at fever rate how did come here asked stranger quickly excitably passionately almost arthur related briefly what have happened from time of first taking bed at inn be indebted to mr holliday son then for help have saved life said medical student speaking to with singular sarcasm in voice come here held out a spoke long white bony right hand with heart said arthur taking hand cordially may confess now continued laughing upon honor almost frightened out of wit stranger did not seem to listen wild black eye be fixed with look of eager interest on arthur face long bony finger kept tight hold of arthur hand young holliday on side returned gaze amazed puzzled by medical student odd language manner two face be close together looked at to amazement be suddenly impressed by sense of likeness between not in feature complexion solely in expression must have be strong likeness must certainly not have found out for be naturally slow at detecting resemblance between face have saved life said strange man still looking hard in arthur face still holding tightly by hand if have be own brother must not have done more for than that laid singularly strong emphasis on three word own brother change passed over face a pronounced change that language of mine be competent to describe hope have not done being of service to yet said arthur will speak to father a soon a get home seem to be fond proud of father said medical student suppose in return be fond proud of of course be answered arthur laughing be there anything wonderful in be father fond stranger suddenly dropped young holliday hand turned face away beg pardon said arthur hope have not

signed to to say nothing then laid finger again on man wrist in spite of extraordinary speech that have just made be not a have be disposed to suspect beginning to get light headed pulse by time have fallen back to quiet slow beat skin be moist cool not symptom of fever agitation about finding that neither of answered turned to began talking of extraordinary nature of case asking advice about future course of medical treatment to ought to subject said matter required careful thinking over suggested must send prescription little later told to write at once a must most likely be leaving doncaster in morning before be up be quite useless to represent to folly danger of such proceeding a heard politely patiently held to resolution without offering reason explanation repeated to that if wished to give chance of seeing prescription must write at once hearing arthur volunteered loan of traveling writing case said have with bringing to bed shook note paper out of pocket of case forthwith in usual careless way with paper there fell out on counterpane of bed small packet of sticking plaster little water color drawing of landscape medical student took up drawing looked at eye fell on initial neatly written in cipher in one corner started trembled pale face grew whiter than ever wild black eye turned on arthur looked through through pretty drawing said in remarkably quiet tone of voice ah done by pretty girl said arthur oh such pretty girl wish be not landscape wish be portrait of admire very much arthur half in jest half in earnest kissed hand for answer love at first sight said young holliday putting drawing away again course of doe run smooth be old story be monopolized a usual trammeled by rash engagement to poor man who be never likely to get money enough to marry be lucky heard of in time must certainly have risked declaration when gave that drawing here doctor here be pen ink paper ready for when gave that drawing gave gave repeated word slowly to suddenly closed eye momentary distortion passed across face saw one of hand clutch up bedclothes squeeze hard thought be going to be ill again begged that there might be no more talking opened eye when spoke fixed once more searchingly on arthur said slowly distinctly like like poor man may die out of way who can tell that may not give a well a drawing after before young holliday must answer turned to said in whisper now for prescription from time though spoke to arthur again never looked at more when have written prescription examined approved of then astonished by abruptly wishing good night offered to sit up with shook head arthur offered to sit up with said shortly with face turned away no insisted on having somebody left to watch gave way when found be determined said must accept service of waiter at inn thank said a rose to go have one last favor to ask not of doctor for leave to exercise professional discretion of mr holliday eye while spoke still rested steadily on never once turned toward arthur beg mr holliday will not mention to one least of to father event have occurred word have passed in room entreat to bury in memory a for might have be buried in grave can not give reason for making strange request can only implore to grant voice faltered for first time hid face on pillow arthur completely bewildered gave required pledge took young holliday away with immediately afterward to house of friend determining to go back to inn to see medical student again before have left in morning returned to inn at eight o'clock purposely abstaining from waking arthur who be sleeping off past night excitement on one of friend sofa suspicion have occurred to a soon a be alone in bedroom made resolve holliday stranger whose life have saved must not meet again if must

holliday of resemblance of expression have discovered between face arthur be of emphasis have laid on three word own brother of incomprehensible acknowledgment of own illegitimacy while be thinking of

woke went a told alone to inn next morning have missed only opportunity of seeing nameless patient again have be gone nearly hour when inquired for have now told everything know for certain in relation to man whom brought back to life in double bedded room of inn at doncaster what have next to add be matter for inference surmise be not strictly speaking matter of fact have to tell first that medical student turned out to be strangely unaccountably right in assuming a more than probable that arthur holliday must marry young lady who have given water color drawing of landscape marriage took place little more than year after event occurred have just be relating young couple came to live in neighborhood in be then established in practice be present at wedding be rather surprised to find that arthur be singularly reserved with before after marriage on subject of young lady prior engagement only referred to once when be alone merely telling on occasion that wife have done honor duty required of in matter that engagement have be broken off with full approval of parent never heard more from than for three year wife lived together happily at expiration of time symptom of

communicative confessed to that have be looking over old letter have be addressed to before have seen arthur by man to whom have be engaged to be married asked how engagement came to be broken off replied that have not be broken off that have died out in very mysterious way person to whom be engaged first love called be very poor there be immediate prospect of being married followed profession went abroad to study have corresponded regularly until time when a believed have returned to england from period heard more of be of fretful sensitive temperament feared that might have inadvertently done said something to offend however might be have never written to again after waiting year have married arthur asked when first estrangement have begun found that time at ceased to hear anything of first lover exactly corresponded with time at have be called in to mysterious patient at two robin inn fortnight after conversation died in course of time arthur married again of late year have lived principally in london have seen little nothing of have year to pas over before can approach to anything like conclusion of fragmentary narrative even when later period be reached little have to say will not occupy attention for more than few minute one rainy autumn evening while be still practicing a country doctor be sitting alone thinking over case then under charge sorely perplexed when low knock at door of room come in cried looking up curiously to see who wanted after momentary delay lock moved long white bony hand stole round door a opened gently pushing over fold in carpet hindered from working freely on hinge hand be followed by man whose face instantly struck with very strange sensation there be something familiar to in look of yet be also something suggested idea of change quietly introduced a mr lorn presented to excellent professional recommendation proposed to fill place then vacant of assistant while be speaking noticed a singular that did not appear to be meeting other like stranger while be certainly startled at seeing did not appear to be at startled at seeing be on tip of tongue to say that thought have met with before there be something in face something

together a if have be old friend from first throughout whole time of residence in house never volunteered confidence on subject of past life never approached forbidden topic except by hint resolutely refused to understand have long have notion that patient at inn might have be natural son of elder mr holliday that might also have be man who be engaged to arthur first wife now idea occurred to that

failing decline therefore altogether to take offense at tone of letter give full benefit of natural generosity of nature sponge very existence of surly communication out of memory in short chief inspector theakstone forgive proceed to business first duty be to draw up full statement of instruction have received from sergeant bulmer here be at service according to version of at number thirteen rutherford street soho there be stationer shop be kept by one mr yatman be married man have family besides mr mr yatman other inmate in house be lodger young single man named jay who occupies front room on second floor shopman who sleep in one of attic servant of work whose bed be in back kitchen once week charwoman come to help servant be person who on ordinary occasion have mean of access to interior of house placed a matter of course at disposal mr yatman have be in business for many year carrying on affair prosperously enough to realize handsome independence for person in position unfortunately for endeavored to increase amount of property by speculating ventured boldly in investment luck went against rather le than two year ago found poor man again be saved out of wreck of property be sum of two hundred pound although mr yatman did best to meet altered circumstance by giving up many of luxury comfort to wife have be accustomed found impossible to retrench so far a to allow of putting by money from income produced by shop business have be declining of late year cheap advertising stationer having done injury with public consequently up to last week only surplus property possessed by mr yatman consisted of two hundred pound have be recovered from wreck of fortune sum be placed a deposit in joint stock bank of highest possible character eight day ago mr yatman lodger mr jay held conversation on subject of commercial difficulty be hampering trade in direction at present time mr jay who life by supplying newspaper with short paragraph relating to accident offense brief record of remarkable occurrence in general who be in short what call penny liner told landlord that have be in city day heard unfavorable rumor on subject of joint stock bank rumor to alluded have already reached ear of mr yatman from other quarter confirmation of by lodger have effect on mind predisposed a be to alarm by experience of former loss that resolved to go at once to bank withdraw deposit be then getting on toward end of afternoon arrived just in time to receive money before bank closed received deposit in bank note of following amount one fifty pound note three twenty pound note six ten pound note six five pound note object in drawing money in form be to have ready to lay out immediately in trifling loan on good security among small tradespeople of district of whom be sorely pressed for very mean of existence at present time investment of kind seemed to mr yatman to be most safe most profitable on must now venture brought money back in envelope placed in breast pocket asked shopman on getting home to look for small flat tin cash box have not be used for year a mr yatman remembered be exactly of right size to hold bank note for time cash box be searched for in vain mr yatman called to wife to know if have idea where be question be overheard by servant of work who be taking up tea tray at time by mr jay who be coming downstairs on way out to theater ultimately cash box be found by shopman mr yatman placed bank note in secured by padlock put box in coat pocket stuck out of coat pocket very little enough to be seen mr yatman remained at home upstairs that evening visitor called at eleven o'clock went to bed put cash box under pillow when wife woke next morning box be gone payment of note be immediately stopped at bank of england news of money have be heard of since time so far circumstance of case be perfectly clear point unmistakably to conclusion that robbery must have be committed by person living in house suspicion fall therefore upon servant of work upon shopman upon mr jay two first knew that cash box be being inquired for by master did not know what be wanted to put into must assume of course that be money have opportunity servant when took away tea shopman when came after shutting up to give key of till to master of seeing cash box in mr yatman pocket of inferring naturally from position there that intended to take into bedroom with at night mr jay on other hand have be told during afternoon conversation on subject of joint stock bank that landlord have deposit of two hundred pound in one of also knew that mr yatman left with intention of drawing money out heard inquiry for cash box afterward when be coming downstairs must therefore have inferred that money be in house that cash box be receptacle intended to contain that must have have idea however of place in mr yatman intended to keep for night be impossible seeing that went out before box be found did not return till landlord be in bed consequently if committed robbery must have gone into bedroom purely on speculation speaking of bedroom reminds of necessity of noticing situation of in house mean that exist of gaining easy access to at hour of night room in question be back room on first floor in consequence of mr yatman constitutional nervousness on subject of fire make apprehend being burned alive in room in case of accident by hampering of lock if key be turned in husband have never be accustomed to lock bedroom door wife be by own admission heavy sleeper consequently risk to be run by evil disposed person wishing to plunder bedroom be of most trifling kind must enter room by merely turning handle of door if moved with ordinary caution there be fear of waking sleeper inside fact be of importance strengthens conviction that money must have be taken by one of inmate of house because tends to show that robbery in case might have be committed by person not possessed of superior vigilance cunning of experienced thief such be circumstance a be related to sergeant bulmer when be first called in to discover guilty party if possible to recover lost bank note strictest inquiry must institute failed of producing smallest fragment of evidence against of person on whom suspicion naturally fell language behavior on being informed of robbery be perfectly consistent with language behavior of innocent people sergeant bulmer felt from first that be case for private inquiry secret observation began by recommending mr mr yatman to affect feeling of perfect confidence in innocence of person living under roof then opened campaign by employing in following going coming in discovering friend habit secret of maid of work three day night of exertion on own part on of others who be competent to assist investigation be enough to satisfy that there be sound cause for suspicion against girl next practiced same precaution in relation to shopman there be more difficulty uncertainty in privately clearing up person character without knowledge obstacle be at last smoothed away with tolerable success though there be not same amount of certainty in case there be in case of girl there be still fair reason for supposing that shopman have have nothing to do with robbery of cash box a necessary consequence of proceeding range of suspicion now becomes limited to lodger mr jay when presented letter of introduction to sergeant bulmer have already made inquiry on subject of young man result so far have not be at favorable mr jay habit be irregular frequents public house seems to be familiarly acquainted with great many dissolute character be in debt to most of tradespeople whom employ have not paid rent to mr yatman for last month yesterday evening came home excited by liquor last week be seen talking to prize fighter in short though mr jay doe call journalist in virtue of penny line contribution to newspaper be young man of low taste vulgar manner bad habit nothing have

will sooner meet end of justice went on addressing lawyer if prove question of identity by witness who have be in habit of daily communication with mr james smith upon one of servant from hall be placed in box alteration in master appearance evidently puzzled man besides perplexing change already adverted to there be also change in mr james smith expression manner rascal a be must do justice to say that looked startled ashamed when first caught sight of unfortunate wife servant who be used to be eyed tyrannically by ordered about roughly seeing now for first time abashed silent stammered hesitated on being asked to swear to identity can hardly say for certain sir said man addressing justice in bewildered manner be like master yet be if wore whisker have hair long if be saving presence sir little more rough ready in way must swear to anywhere with safe conscience fortunately for at moment mr james smith feeling of uneasiness at situation in be placed changed to feeling of irritation

chosen to make in personal appearance there be legal charge against speaking morally must be unworthy of place hold if hesitated to declare present conviction that conduct have be deceitful inconsiderate unfeeling in highest degree to sharp reprimand mr james smith evidently tutored beforehand a to what be to say replied that in attending before justice wished to perform plain duty to keep strictly within letter of law apprehended that only legal obligation laid on be to attend in court to declare to enable competent witness to prove identity duty accomplished have merely to add that preferred submitting to reprimand from bench to entering into explanation must involve disclosure of domestic circumstance of very unhappy nature after brief reply have nothing further to say

number two who object to be left behind go with a far a london there trump up first story come into head about rent in country house in lincolnshire be too damp for to trust in so leaving for few day in london start boldly for darrock notion be to wheedle mistress out of money by good behavior seems started badly by quarreling with about fiddle playing parson yes yes know about part of story broke in seeing by mr dark manner that be likely to speak ignorantly impertinently of mistress unlucky friend ship for mr meeke go on to time when left master alone in red room tell what did between midnight nine next morning did said mr dark why went to bed with unpleasant conviction on mind that mistress have found out with comfort to speak of except what must get out of brandy bottle must sleep more tossed tumbled more certain felt that wife intended to have tried for bigamy at last toward gray of morning must stand no longer made up mind to give law slip while have chance a soon a be dressed struck that there might be reward offered for catching determined to make slight change in personal appearance puzzled witness so much before magistrate to day so open dressing case crop hair in time take off whisker next fire be out have to shave in cold water what with what with flurry of mind naturally enough cut dried blood with nightgown say with nightgown repeated mr dark be first thing lay handy snatched up wait bit though cream of thing be to come when have done being own barber must for life of hit on way of getting rid of loose hair fire be out have match so must burn a for

set thinking that husband mr james smith whom wanted might be one same man 'nothing ' say 'but seeing come home with hair cut short whisker shaved off finding that must not give good reason for disfiguring in way have suspicion that something be wrong sight of advertisement strengthened directly ' hearing say suggested to mind that there might be difficulty in identifying after change in look asked what have done with loose hair before left london be found in pocket of traveling coat just a have huddled up there on leaving hall worry fright vexation having caused to forget about of course took charge of parcel know what good did a well a do so to speak william just completed beautifully neat case looking at matter in professional point of view hesitate to say that have managed business with mr james smith to perfection have produced at right time be going to get rid of at right time by to night will be on way to foreign part with number two wo show nose in england again if life to age of methuselah be relief to hear that be almost a great comfort to find from what mr dark said next that mistress need fear nothing josephine must do for future charge of theft on be about to be tried did not afford shadow of excuse in law more than in logic for alluding to crime master have committed if meant to talk about might do so in place of transportation must not have slightest chance of being listened to previously in court of law in short said mr dark rising to take leave a have told already william be checkmate for marmzelle did manage business of robbery half a sharply a must have expected certainly began well enough by staying modestly at lodging in village to give attendance at examination a might be required nothing must look more innocent respectable so far hiding property between mattress of bed very first place that experienced man must think of looking in be such amazingly stupid thing to do really ca account for unless mind have more weighing on than be able to bear considering heavy stake played for be likely enough anyhow hand be tied now tongue too for matter of give respect to mistress tell that runaway husband lying maid will never of harm her again a long a live have nothing to do now to pluck up spirit live happy here long life to to william in last glass of ale here be same toast to myself in bottom of jug with word mr dark pocketed

in house be left for still have married during long interval of time be now passing over in few word change in life be perhaps not worth mentioning be reminded of two little child when speak of mistress in present position really think make great happiness interest amusement of life prevent from feeling lonely dried up at heart be pleasant reflection to to remember perhaps may be same to for reason only speak of a for other person connected with trouble at darrock hall may mention vile woman josephine first so a to have sooner done with mr dark guess when tried to account for want of cunning in hiding stolen property by saying that mind might have have more weighing on than be able to bear turned out to be nothing le than plain awful truth after have be found guilty of robbery have be condemned to seven year transportation worse sentence fell upon from higher tribunal than in world while be still in county jail previous to removal mind gave way madness breaking out in attempt to set fire to prison case be pronounced to be hopeless from first lawful asylum received lawful asylum will keep to end of day mr james smith who in humble opinion deserved hanging by law
