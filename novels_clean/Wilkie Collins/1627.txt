linley miss westerfield have be confessed to appears to have most unreasonably overrated whatever merit there might have be in resistance to final temptation be indeed so impulsively ready to forgive without waiting to see if event justified exercise of mercy that owns to having given hand to miss westerfield at parting not hour after young person shameless forgetfulness of claim of modesty duty gratitude have be first communicated to to say that be act of inconsiderate woman culpably indiscreet have almost added culpably indelicate be only to say what have deserved on next occasion to feel

to return to other platform do know randal be almost afraid that catherine be woman devil take thing people who write in snatched newspaper out of pocket a spoke tore in half threw away malcolm meant well poor fellow said referring to old servant made miserable man of for that not satisfied with gossip in private greedy public appetite devours gossip in print want more of than one editor can supply randal picked up torn newspaper be not newspaper have bought at station herbert have be reading rival journal devoted to interest of society in report of mr norman marriage be repeated with difference that boldly alluded to captain bennydeck by name did malcolm give randal asked yes servant next door subscribe to take in malcolm thought might amuse drove out of house into railway if have driven out of mind shouldnt have be surprised gently herbert supposing report have be true after what have told why must suppose anything of sort dont be angry do pray remember that divorce allows catherine to marry again if like herbert became more unreasonable than ever if catherine doe think of marrying again said man will have to reckon first with be not point seem to have forgotten that woman at buck hotel be described a widow bare doubt that divorced wife might be woman be bad enough what wanted to find out be how have passed off false pretense on child be what maddened more of now have seen catherine lately not lately suppose be a handsome a ever when will ask to let see kitty leave to be one reply randal must venture to make at moment serious embarrassment surrounded be thickening fast natural frank nature urged to undeceive herbert if followed inclination in near neighborhood of hotel who must say what disaster might not ensue in brother present frame of mind if made disclosure on return to house must be only running same risk of consequence after interval of delay if remained silent march of event might at moment lead to discovery of what have concealed add to that confidence in catherine have be rudely shaken having allowed to be entrapped into deception proposed by mother having thus far persevered in deception be chance in favor of revealing true position especially if be disposed to encourage bennydecks suit randals loyalty to catherine hesitated to decide that serious question against woman whom have known trusted admired for so many year in event second marriage must lead to one disastrous result must sooner later come to herbert ear in meantime after what mr presty have confessed cruel falsehood have checked poor kitty natural inquiry raised insuperable obstacle to meeting between father child if randal shrank from prospect thus presented to in relation with brother if thought reverted to sydney westerfield other reason for apprehension found way into mind have promised to do best toward persuading catherine to grant sydney interview to perform promise appeared to be now simply impossible under exasperating influence of disappointment for be not prepared be hard to say what act of imprudence sydney might not commit even chance of successfully confiding to bennydecks protection have lost something of fair promise since randals visit to sydenham that captain must welcome friend daughter a affectionately a if have be own child be not to be doubted for moment that must receive same unremitting attention while be courting catherine must have be offered to under other circumstance be not to be hoped be result however what might randal must see one plain course before now decided on hastening sydney introduction to bennydeck on writing at once to prepare captain for event even apparently simple proceeding required examination in different bearing before must begin letter must be justified in alluding to report associated bennydeck with catherine consideration of delicacy seemed to forbid taking liberty even with intimate friend be for captain to confirm what mr presty have said of if thought desirable to touch on subject in reply besides looking to catherine interest not forgetting how have suffered have randal right to regard with other than friendly feeling second marriage united to man morally intellectually superior of first husband what happier future must await especially if justified randals past experience of be candid truthful in character than to become friend wife written under modifying influence of conclusion letter contained few word follow have news for be sure will be glad to hear old friend daughter have abandoned sinful way of life have made sacrifice prove sincerity of repentance without entering into particular may be mercifully dismissed from notice let only assure answer for sydney westerfield a being worthy of fatherly interest feel in will say that
