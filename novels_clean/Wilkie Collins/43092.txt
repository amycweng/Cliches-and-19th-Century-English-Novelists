shapeless bulk of bed towered up heavily gloomily into view other object be merged together in general obscurity through open window opened to admit fresh air of new morning after sultriness of august night there poured monotonously into room dull still distant roaring of surf on sandy coast outer noise be hushed at first dark hour of new day inside room one audible sound be slow toilsome breathing of dying woman raising in mortal frailness awfully distinctly even through far thunder breathing from bosom of everlasting sea mistress said sarah leeson standing close to curtain not withdrawing master have left room have sent here in place light give more light feebleness of mortal sickness be in voice accent of speaker sounded resolute even yet doubly resolute by contrast with hesitation of tone in sarah have spoken strong nature of mistress weak nature of maid came out even in short interchange of word spoken through curtain of death bed sarah lit two candle with wavering hand placed hesitatingly on table by bedside waited for moment looking round with suspicious timidity then undrew curtain disease of mr treverton be dying be one of most terrible of malady afflict humanity one to woman be especially subject one undermines life without in most case showing remarkable trace of corroding progress in face no uninstructed person looking at mr treverton when attendant undrew bed

groaned to herself oh what will happen what will happen now mr treverton eye have softened moistened when spoke of love for husband lay silent for few minute working of strong emotion in being

of hand glance upward at imaginary gallery of spectator write cried with awful mimicry of old stage voice write weak hand be waved again with forlorn feeble imitation of old stage gesture closing finger mechanically on pen be thrust between sarah with eye still expressing superstitious terror mistress word have aroused waited for next command minute elapsed before mr treverton spoke again still retained sens sufficiently to be vaguely conscious of effect medicine be producing on to be desirous of combating further progress before succeeded in utterly confusing idea asked first for

addressed maid reiterating word write be able to enforce direction by beginning immediately to dictate in quiet deliberate determined tone sarah tear fell fast lip murmured fragment of sentence in entreaty expression of penitence exclamation of fear be strangely mingled together wrote on submissively in wavering line until have nearly filled first two side of note paper then mr treverton paused

joyously into sick room heavy beating hum of distant surf came in at same time poured out unresting music in louder strain then window curtain fell to again heavily wavering flame of candle grew steady once more awful silence in room sank deeper than ever swear said mr treverton voice failed when have pronounced that one word struggled little recovered power of utterance went on swear that

effect of writing on mind lay not only in in circumstance have attended act of production oath have be proposed by mr treverton under more serious influence than last caprice of disordered faculty stimulated by confused remembrance of stage word stage situation have be accepted by sarah leeson a most sacred inviolable engagement to must bind threat of enforcing obedience to last command from beyond grave mistress have uttered in mocking experiment on superstitious fear of maid now hung darkly over weak mind of sarah a judgment might descend on visibly inexorably at moment of future life when roused at last pushed away paper rose to foot stood quite still for instant before ventured to look behind when did look be with effort start with searching distrust of empty dimness in remoter corner of room old habit of talking to herself began to resume influence a now walked rapidly backward forward sometimes along room sometimes across repeated incessantly such broken phrase a how can give letter good master so kind to why did die leave to ca bear alone be too much for while reiterating sentence vacantly occupied in putting thing about room in order be set in perfect order already

hour ago be gone now do know where have gone pry into other people going coming mind own business with discourteous answer nurse closed door again just a sarah turned away from looked toward inner end of passage door of nursery be situated there be ajar dim gleam of candle light be flickering through illustration toward opening thus made sarah now advanced went in immediately saw that candle light came from inner room usually occupied a well knew by nursery maid by only child of house of treverton little girl named rosamond aged at time nearly five year can be there in room of room in house

trellis work formed only barrier between day room bedroom one of be looped up toward opening thus made sarah now advanced after cautiously leaving candle in passage outside first object attracted attention in child bedroom be figure of nurse maid leaning back fast asleep in easy chair by window venturing after discovery to look more boldly into room next saw master sitting with back toward by

be cry bitterly have now exhausted so that be only moaning little from time to time with head laid wearily on father bosom tear stood thick in sarah eye a looked on master on little hand that lay round neck lingered by raised curtain heedless of risk ran from moment to moment of being discovered questioned lingered until heard captain treverton say soothingly to child hush rosie dear hush own love cry more for poor mamma think of poor papa try to comfort simple a word be quietly tenderly a be spoken seemed instantly to deprive sarah leeson of power of self control reckless whether be heard not turned ran into passage a if have be flying for life passing candle have left there without so much a look at made for stair descended with headlong rapidity to kitchen floor there one of servant who have be sitting up met with face of astonishment alarm asked what be matter be ill be faint want air answered speaking thickly confusedly open garden door let out man obeyed doubtfully a if thought unfit to be trusted by get stranger than ever in way said when rejoined fellow servant after sarah have hurried past into open air now mistress be dead will have to find place suppose for one sha' break heart when be gone will chapter iii hiding of secret cool sweet air in garden blowing freshly over sarah face seemed to calm violence of agitation turned down side walk led to terrace overlooked church of neighboring village daylight out of door be clear already misty auburn light go before sunrise be flowing up peaceful lovely behind line of black brown moorland over eastern sky old church with hedge of myrtle fuchsia growing round little cemetery in luxuriance be only seen in cornwall be clearing brightening to view almost a fast a morning firmament sarah leaned arm heavily on back of garden seat turned face toward church eye wandered from building to cemetery by side rested there watched light growing warmer warmer over lonesome refuge where dead lay at rest oh heart heart said what must be made of not to break remained for time leaning on seat looking sadly toward church yard pondering over word have heard captain treverton say to child seemed to connect a thing else now appeared to connect in mind with letter have be written on mr treverton death bed drew from bosom once more crushed up angrily in finger still in hand still not seen by eye mine said looking down at crumpled page be fault if be alive now if have seen what saw if have heard what heard in nursery must expect to give letter mind be apparently steadied by reflection last word expressed moved away thoughtfully from garden seat crossed terrace descended wooden step followed shrubbery path led round by winding track from east to north side of house part of building have be uninhabited neglected for more than century past in time of captain treverton father whole range of north room have be stripped of finest picture most valuable furniture to assist in redecorating west room now formed only inhabited part of house be amply sufficient for accommodation of family of visitor who came to stay with mansion have be originally built in form of square have be strongly fortified of many defense of place one now remained heavy low tower from from village near house derived name of porthgenna tower standing at southern extremity of west front south side consisted of stable out house with ruinous wall in front of running back eastward at right angle joined north side so completed square whole outline of building represented outside view of range of north room from weedy deserted garden below showed plainly enough that many year have passed since human creature have inhabited window pane be broken in place covered thickly with dirt dust in others here shutter be closed there be only half opened untrained ivy rank vegetation growing in fissure of stone work festoon of spider web rubbish of wood brick plaster broken glass rag strip of soiled cloth lay beneath window told same tale of neglect shadowed by position ruinous side of house have dark cold wintry aspect even on sunny august morning when sarah leeson strayed into deserted northern garden lost in labyrinth of own thought moved slowly past flower bed long since rooted up along gravel walk overgrown by weed eye wandering mechanically over prospect foot mechanically carrying on wherever there be trace of footpath lead where might shock word spoken by master in nursery have communicated to mind have set whole nature so to speak at bay have roused in at last moral courage to arm with final desperate resolution wandering more more slowly along pathway of forsaken garden a course of idea withdrew more more completely from outward thing stopped insensibly on open patch of ground have once be well kept lawn still commanded full view of long range of uninhabited north room what bind to give letter to master at thought to herself smoothing out crumpled paper dreamily in palm of hand mistress died without making swear to do can visit on from other world if keep promise swore to observe do more may not risk worst can happen so long a hold religiously to undertook to do on oath paused here in reasoning with superstitious fear still influencing out of door in daylight a have influenced in own room in time of darkness paused then fell to smoothing letter again began to recall term of solemn engagement mr treverton have forced to contract what have actually bound to to destroy letter not to take away with if left house beyond mr treverton desire have be that letter must be given to husband be that last wish binding on person to whom have be confided yes a binding a oath no a arrived at conclusion looked up at first eye rested vacantly on lonely deserted north front of house gradually became attracted by one particular window exactly in middle on floor above ground largest gloomiest of row suddenly brightened with expression of intelligence started faint flush of color flew into cheek hastily advanced closer to wall of house pane of large window be yellow with dust dirt festooned about fantastically with cobweb below be heap of rubbish scattered over dry mould of what might once have be bed of flower shrub form of bed be still marked out by oblong boundary of weed rank grass followed irresolutely round looking up at window at step then stopped close under glanced at letter in hand said to abruptly will risk a word fell from lip hastened back to inhabited part of house followed passage on kitchen floor led to housekeeper room entered took down from nail in wall bunch of key having large ivory label attached to ring connected on be inscribed key of north room placed key on writing table near took up pen rapidly added line on blank side of letter have written under mistress dictation if paper must ever be found pray with whole heart never may be wish to say have come to resolution of hiding because dare not show writing that contains to master to whom be addressed in doing what now propose to do though be acting against mistress last wish be not breaking solemn engagement obliged to make before on death bed engagement forbids to destroy letter to take away with if leave house will do purpose be to conceal in place of others where think there be least chance of ever being found again hardship misfortune may follow a consequence of deceitful proceeding on part will fall on others believe in conscience will be happier for hiding of dreadful secret letter contains signed line with name pressed hurriedly over blotting pad lay with rest of writing material on table took note in hand after first folding up then snatching at bunch of key with look round a if dreaded being secretly observed left room action since have entered have be hasty sudden be evidently afraid of allowing one leisure moment to reflect on quitting housekeeper room turned to left ascended back staircase unlocked door at top of cloud of dust flew about a softly opened door mouldy coolness made shiver a crossed large stone hall with black old family portrait hanging on wall canvas of be bulging out of frame ascending more stair came upon row of door leading into room on first floor of north side of house knelt down putting letter on board beside opposite key hole of fourth door came to after reaching top of stair peered in distrustfully for instant then began to try different key till found one fitted lock have great difficulty in accomplishing from violence of agitation made hand tremble to degree that be hardly able to keep key separate one from other at length succeeded in opening door thicker cloud of dust than have yet met with flew out moment interior of room be visible dry airless suffocating atmosphere almost choked a stooped to pick up letter from floor recoiled from at first took few step back toward staircase recovered resolution immediately ca go back now said desperately entered room did not remain in more than two three minute when came out again face be white with fear hand have held letter when went into room held nothing now small rusty key after locking door again examined large bunch of key have taken from housekeeper room with closer attention than have yet bestowed on besides ivory label attached to ring connected there be smaller label of parchment tied to handle of of key to indicate room to gave admission particular key have used have one of label hanging to held little strip of parchment close to light read on in written character faded by time myrtle room room in letter be hidden have name then prettily sounding name must attract most people keep pleasantly in memory name to be distrusted by after what have done on very account took housewife from usual place in pocket of apron with scissors contained cut label from key be enough to destroy one only lost in maze of useless conjecture ended by cutting off other label from other motive than instinctive suspicion of carefully gathering up strip of parchment from floor put along with little rusty key have brought out of myrtle room in empty pocket of apron then carrying large bunch of key in hand carefully locking door that have opened on way to north side of porthgenna tower retraced step to housekeeper room entered without seeing body hung up bunch of key again on nail in wall fearful a morning hour wore on of meeting with of female servant next hastened back to bedroom candle have left there be still burning feebly in fresh daylight when drew aside window curtain after extinguishing candle shadow of former fear passed over face even in broad daylight now flowed in upon opened window leaned out eagerly into cool air whether for good for evil fatal secret be hidden now act be done there be something calming in first consciousness of one fact must think more composedly after of herself of uncertain future lay before under circumstance must have expected to remain in situation now that connection between herself mistress have be severed by death knew that mr treverton in last day of illness have earnestly recommended maid to captain treverton kindness protection felt assured that wife last entreaty in a in other instance must be viewed a most sacred of obligation by husband must accept protection kindness at hand of master whom have be accessory to deceiving whom have now committed to deceiving still

standing just inside door looked respectfully toward doctor answered in affirmative although only said two common word yes ma'be in quiet uninterested way mr orridge be struck by sweetness tenderness of voice if have not be looking at must have supposed to be voice of young woman eye remained fixed on after have spoken though felt that ought to have be looking toward mistress most unobservant of men in such thing found noticing dress so that remembered long afterward form of spotless muslin cap primly covered smooth gray hair quiet brown color of silk dress fitted so neatly hung around in such spare disciplined fold little confusion evidently felt at finding object of doctor attention did not betray into slightest awkwardness of gesture manner if there can be such thing physically speaking a grace of restraint be grace seemed to govern mr jazeph slightest movement led foot smoothly over carpet a advanced when mistress next spoke to governed action of wan right hand a rested lightly on table by side while stopped to hear next question be addressed to well continued mr norbury poor lady be just getting on comfortably when nurse who be looking after fell ill morning there

mr jazeph turned round with start looked at doctor apparently forgetting that right hand be on table moved so suddenly that struck against bronze statuette of dog placed on writing material statuette

be not hurt put back again be first time mr jazeph that ever knew do awkward thing may take that a compliment think well a be saying lady be daughter of captain treverton whose dreadful shipwreck read about in paper knew father in early day on account be doubly anxious to be of service to now do think again be there nobody within reach who can be trusted to nurse doctor still watching mr jazeph with secret medical interest of in case have seen turn so deadly pale when started looked toward that must not have be surprised if have fainted on spot now observed that changed color again when mistress left off speaking hectic red tinged cheek once more with two bright spot timid eye wandered uneasily about room finger a clasped hand together interlaced mechanically must be interesting case to treat thought doctor following nervous movement of housekeeper hand with watchful eye do think again repeated mr norbury be so anxious to help poor lady through difficulty if can be very sorry said mr jazeph in faint trembling tone still always with same sweetness in voice very sorry that can think of one who be fit stopped shy child on first introduction to society of stranger must have looked more disconcerted than looked now eye be on ground color be deepening finger of clasped hand be working together faster faster moment what asked mr norbury be about to say ma'be answered mr jazeph speaking with greatest difficulty uneasiness never raising eye to mistress face that rather than lady must want for nurse must considering interest ma'be take in must if thought must spare what nurse exclaimed mr norbury upon word although have got to in rather roundabout way have come to point at last in manner doe infinite credit to kindness of heart readiness to make useful a to sparing of

jazeph still without raising eye from ground shortly after marriage flush disappeared face turned pale again a said word have practice in nursing continued at interval until time of husband death only presume to offer sir went on turning toward doctor becoming more earnest possessed in manner a did so only presume to offer with mistress permission a substitute for nurse until better qualified person can be found what do say mr orridge asked mr norbury have be doctor turn to start when first heard mr jazeph propose for office of nurse hesitated before answered mr norbury question then said can have one doubt about propriety of thankfully accepting mr jazeph offer mr jazeph timid eye looked anxiously perplexedly at a spoke mr norbury in downright abrupt way asked immediately what doubt be feel uncertainty replied mr orridge a to whether mr jazeph will pardon a medical man for mentioning a to whether mr jazeph be strong enough have nerve sufficiently under control to perform duty be so kindly ready to undertake in spite of politeness of explanation mr jazeph be evidently disconcerted distressed by certain quiet uncomplaining sadness be very touching to see overspread face a turned away without word walked slowly to door go yet cried mr norbury kindly at least if do go come back again in five minute be quite certain will have something more to say to then mr jazeph eye expressed thanks in one grateful glance looked so much brighter than usual while rested on mistress face that mr norbury half doubted whether tear be not just rising in at moment before must look again mr jazeph have courtesied to doctor have noiselessly left room now be alone mr orridge said mr norbury may tell with submission to medical judgment that be little exaggerating mr jazeph nervous infirmity look poorly enough own after five year experience of can tell that be stronger than look honestly think will be doing good service to mr frankland if try volunteer nurse at least for day two be gentlest tenderest creature ever met with conscientious to fault in performance of duty that undertakes be under delicacy about taking away gave dinner party last week will not give for time to come never must have spared housekeeper more easily than can spare now be sure may offer mr frankland thanks to a well a own said mr orridge after what have said must be ungracious ungrateful in not to follow advice will excuse if ask one question did ever hear that mr jazeph be subject to fit of kind never not even to hysterical affection now then never since have be in house surprise there be something in look manner yes yes body remark at first simply mean that be in delicate health that have not led very happy life a suspect in younger day lady from whom have with excellent character

that have be excellent servant here for last five year that in place poorly a may look must consider a best nurse mr frankland must possibly wish for under circumstance there be need for to say more take mr jazeph telegraph to london for stranger decision of course rest with mr orridge thought detected slight tone of irritability in mr norbury last sentence be prudent man suppressed doubt might still feel in reference to mr jazeph physical capacity for nursing rather than risk offending most important lady in neighborhood at outset of practice in west winston a medical man can not hesitate

comfortable friendly new nurse left window went back to part of room where be hidden from view between fire place closed curtain at foot of bed rosamond looked round to express surprise to doctor turned away at same moment so a to occupy position might enable to observe what mr jazeph be doing on other side of bed curtain when first caught sight of hand be raised to face before must decide whether have surprised in act of clasping over eye not changed position be occupied in removing bonnet after have placed part of wearing apparel shawl glove on chair in corner of room went to dressing table began to arrange various useful ornamental object scattered about set in order with remarkable dexterity neatness showing taste for arrangement capacity for discriminating between thing be likely to be wanted thing be not impressed mr orridge very favorably particularly noticed carefulness with handled bottle of physic reading label on arranging medicine might be required at night on one side of table medicine might be required in day time on other when left dressing table occupied in setting furniture straight in folding up article of clothing have be thrown on one side not slightest movement of thin wasted hand seemed ever to be made at hazard in vain noiselessly modestly observantly moved from side to side of room neatness order followed step wherever went when mr orridge resumed place at mr frankland bedside mind be at ease on one point at least be perfectly evident that new nurse must be depended on to make mistake what odd woman be whispered rosamond odd indeed returned mr orridge desperately broken in health though may not confess to however be wonderfully neat handed careful there can be harm in trying for one night be to say unless feel objection on contrary said rosamond rather interest there be something in face manner ca say what make feel curious to know more of must get to talk try if ca bring out peculiarity be afraid of exciting stop

one moment just look at baby again doe take dangerous quantity of sleep doe mr orridge one word more when have done wine will promise to lend husband use of eye bring up stair to wish good night wo willingly engaging to pay attention to mr frankland request mr orridge left bedside a opened room door stopped to tell mr jazeph that must be down stair if wanted that must give instruction of might stand in need later in evening before left inn for night new nurse when passed by be kneeling over one of mr frankland open trunk arranging article of clothing have be rather carelessly folded up just before spoke to observed that have chemisette in hand frill of be laced through with ribbon one end of ribbon appeared to to be on point of drawing out when sound of footstep disturbed moment became aware of approach dropped chemisette suddenly in trunk covered over with handkerchief although proceeding on mr jazeph part rather surprised doctor abstained from showing that have noticed mistress have vouched for character after five year experience of bit of ribbon be intrinsically worthless on account be impossible to suspect of attempting to steal yet a mr orridge must not help feeling when have left room conduct when surprised over trunk be exactly conduct of person who be about to commit theft pray trouble about luggage said rosamond remarking mr jazeph occupation a soon a doctor have gone be idle maid business will only make more careless than ever if do for be sure room be beautifully set in order come here sit down rest must be very unselfish kind hearted woman to give trouble to serve stranger doctor message afternoon told that mistress be friend of poor dear father suppose must have known before time way feel doubly grateful to for taking interest in for father sake can have such feeling must have come here from pure good nature anxiety to help others go away there to window come sit down by mr jazeph have risen from trunk be approaching bedside when suddenly turned away in direction of fire place just a mr frankland began to speak of father come sit here reiterated rosamond getting impatient at receiving answer what in world be doing there at foot of bed figure of new nurse again interposed between bed fading evening light glimmered through window before there be reply evening be closing in said mr jazeph window be not quite shut be thinking of making fast of drawing down blind if have objection ma'be oh not yet not yet shut window if please in case baby must catch cold draw down blind let get peep at view a long a there be light left to see by long flat stretch of grazing ground out there be just beginning at dim time to look little like childish recollection of cornish moor do know thing about cornwall mr jazeph have heard at first three word of reply nurse stopped be just then engaged in shutting window seemed to find difficulty in closing lock what have heard asked rosamond have heard that cornwall be wild dreary country said mr jazeph still busying with lock of window by consequence still keeping back turned to mr frankland ca shut window yet said rosamond maid always doe quite easily leave till come up be going to ring for directly want to brush hair cool face with little eau de cologne water have shut ma'be said mr jazeph suddenly succeeding in closing lock if will allow must be very glad to make comfortable for night save trouble of ringing for maid thinking new nurse oddest woman have ever met with mr frankland accepted offer by time mr jazeph have prepared eau de cologne water twilight be falling softly over landscape outside room be beginning to grow dark have not better light candle suggested rosamond think not ma'be said mr jazeph rather hastily can see quite well without began to brush mr frankland hair a spoke at same time asked question referred to few word have passed between on subject of cornwall pleased to find that new nurse have grown familiar enough at last to speak before be spoken to rosamond desired nothing better than to talk about recollection of native country from inexplicable reason mr jazeph touch light tender a be have strangely disconcerting effect on that must not succeed for moment in collecting thought so a to reply except in briefest manner careful hand of nurse lingered with stealthy gentleness among lock of hair pale wasted face of new nurse approached now then more closely to own than appeared at needful vague sensation of uneasiness must not trace to particular part of must hardly say that really felt in bodily sense at seemed to be floating about to be hanging around over like air breathed must not move though wanted to move in bed must not turn head so a to humor action of brush must not look round must not break embarrassing silence have be caused by own short discouraging answer at last sense of oppression whether fancied real irritated into snatching brush out of mr jazeph hand instant have done so felt ashamed of discourteous abruptness of action confused at alarm surprise manner of nurse exhibited with strongest sense of absurdity of own conduct yet without least power of controlling burst out laughing tossed brush away to foot of bed pray look surprised mr jazeph said still laughing without knowing why without feeling in slightest degree amused be very rude odd know have brushed hair delightfully ca tell how seemed time a if be brushing strangest fancy into head ca help laughing at ca indeed do know once twice absolutely fancied when face be closest to mine that wanted to kiss did ever hear of thing so ridiculous declare be more of baby in thing than little darling here by side mr jazeph made answer left bed while rosamond be speaking came back after unaccountably long delay with eau de cologne water a held basin while mr frankland bathed face kept away at arm length came nearer when be time to offer towel rosamond began to be afraid that have seriously offended mr jazeph tried to soothe propitiate by asking question about management of baby there be slight trembling in sweet voice of new nurse not faintest tone of sullenness anger a simply quietly answered inquiry addressed to by dint of keeping conversation still on subject of child mr frankland succeeded little by little in luring back to bedside in tempting to bend down admiringly over infant in emboldening at last to kiss tenderly on cheek one kiss be that gave turned away from bed after sighed heavily sound of sigh fell very sadly on rosamond heart up to time baby little span of life have always be associated with smiling face pleasant word made uneasy to think that one must caress sigh after be sure must be fond of child said hesitating little from natural delicacy of feeling will excuse for noticing that seems rather mournful fondness pray pray answer question if give pain if have loss to deplore do so want to ask if have ever have child of own mr jazeph be standing near chair when question be put caught fast hold of back of grasping so firmly perhaps leaning on so heavily that woodwork cracked head dropped low on bosom did not utter even attempt to utter single word fearing that must have lost child of own dreading to distress unnecessarily by venturing to ask more question rosamond said nothing a stooped over baby to kiss in turn lip rested on cheek little above where mr jazeph lip have rested moment before touched spot of wet on smooth warm skin fearing that of water in have be bathing face might have dropped on passed finger lightly over head neck bosom felt other spot of wet where one drop have fallen on be drop wetted cheek new nurse have kissed twilight faded over landscape room grew darker darker still though be now sitting close to table on candle match be placed mr jazeph made attempt to strike light rosamond did not feel quite comfortable at idea of lying awake in darkness with nobody in room person who be a yet almost total stranger resolved to have candle lighted immediately mr jazeph said looking toward gathering obscurity outside window will be much obliged to if will light candle pull down blind can trace more resemblance out there now to cornish prospect view have gone altogether be very fond of cornwall ma'be asked mr jazeph rising in rather dilatory manner to light candle indeed be said rosamond be born there husband be on way to cornwall when be obliged to stop on account at place be long time getting candle lit ca find match box mr jazeph with awkwardness be rather surprising in person who have shown so much neat handedness in setting room to right broke first match in attempting to light let second go out instant after flame be kindled at third attempt be more successful only lit one candle that one carried away from table mr frankland must see to dressing table be hidden from by curtain at foot of bed why do move candle asked rosamond thought be best for eye ma'be not to have light too near replied mr jazeph then added hastily a if be unwilling to give mr frankland time to make objection so be going to cornwall ma'be when stopped at place to travel about there little suppose after saying word took up second candle passed out of sight a carried to dressing table rosamond thought that nurse in spite of gentle look manner be remarkably obstinate woman be too good natured to care about asserting right to have candle placed where pleased when answered mr jazeph question still spoke to a cheerfully familiarly a ever oh dear not to travel about said to go straight to old country house where be born belongs to husband now mr jazeph have not be near since be little girl of five year of age such ruinous rambling old place who talk of dreariness wildness of cornwall must be quite horrified at very idea of living in porthgenna tower faintly rustling sound of mr jazeph silk dress a moved about dressing table have be audible while rosamond be speaking ceased instantaneously when said word porthgenna tower for one moment there be dead silence in room who have be living life suppose in nicely repaired house can not imagine what place be that be going to when be well enough to travel again pursued rosamond what do think mr jazeph of house with one whole side of have never be inhabited for sixty seventy year past may get notion of size of porthgenna tower from that there be west side that be to live in when get there north side where empty old room be hope will be able to repair only think of host of odd old fashioned thing that may find in uninhabited room mean to put on cook apron gardener glove rummage over from top to bottom how will astonish housekeeper when get to porthgenna ask for key of ghostly north room low cry sound a if something have struck against dressing table followed mr frankland last word started in bed asked eagerly what be matter nothing answered mr jazeph speaking so constrainedly that voice dropped to whisper nothing ma'be nothing assure struck side by accident against table pray be alarmed be not worth noticing speak a if be in pain said rosamond not in pain not hurt not hurt indeed while mr jazeph be declaring that be not hurt door of room be opened doctor entered leading in mr frankland come early mr frankland be going to give plenty of time to compose for night said mr orridge paused noticed that rosamond color be heightened be afraid have be talking exciting little too much went on if will excuse for venturing on suggestion mr frankland think sooner good night be said better where be nurse mr jazeph sat down with back to lighted candle when heard asked for just before have be looking at mr frankland with eager undisguised curiosity if one have noticed must have appeared surprisingly out of character with usual modesty refinement of manner be afraid nurse have accidentally hurt side more than be willing to confess said rosamond to doctor pointing with one hand to place in mr jazeph be sitting raising other to husband neck a stooped over pillow mr orridge on inquiring what have happened must not prevail on new nurse to acknowledge that accident be of slightest consequence suspected nevertheless that be suffering at least that something have happened to discompose for found greatest difficulty in fixing attention while gave few needful direction in case service be required during night time be speaking eye wandered away from to part of room where mr mr frankland be talking together mr jazeph looked like last person in world who must be guilty of act of impertinent curiosity yet openly betrayed characteristic of inquisitive woman while mr frankland be standing by wife pillow doctor be obliged to assume most peremptory manner before must get to attend to at now mr frankland said mr orridge turning away from nurse a have given mr jazeph direction want will set example of leaving in quiet by saying good night understanding hint conveyed in word mr frankland attempted to say good night too wife kept tight hold of hand declared that be unreasonable to expect to let go for half hour at least mr orridge shook head began to expatiate on evil of over excitement blessing of composure sleep remonstrance however must have produced very little effect even if rosamond have allowed to continue for interposition of baby who happened to wake up at moment who proved powerful auxiliary on doctor side by absorbing mother attention immediately seizing opportunity at right moment mr orridge quietly led mr frankland out of room just a rosamond be taking child up in arm stopped before closing door to whisper one last word to mr jazeph if mr frankland want to talk must not encourage said a soon a have quieted baby ought to go to sleep there be chair bedstead in corner can open for when want to lie down keep candle where be now behind curtain le light mr frankland see sooner will compose to sleep mr jazeph made answer only looked at doctor courtesied that strangely scared expression in eye have noticed on first seeing be more painfully apparent than ever when left alone for night with mother child will never do thought mr orridge a led mr frankland down inn stair will have to send to london for nurse after feeling little irritated by summary manner in husband have be taken away from rosamond fretfully rejected offer of assistance be made to by mr jazeph a soon a doctor have left room nurse said nothing when service be declined yet judging by conduct seemed anxious to speak twice advanced toward bedside opened lip stopped retired confusedly before settled finally in former place by dressing table here remained silent out of sight until child have be quieted have fallen asleep in mother arm with one little pink half closed hand resting on bosom rosamond must not resist raising hand to lip though risked waking again by doing so a kissed sound of kiss be followed by faint suppressed sob proceeding from other side of curtain at lower end of bed what be that exclaimed nothing ma'be said mr jazeph in same constrained whispering tone in have answered mr frankland former question think be just falling asleep in arm chair here ought to have told perhaps that having have trouble being afflicted with heart complaint have habit of sighing in sleep mean nothing ma'be hope will be good enough to excuse rosamond generous instinct be aroused in moment excuse said hope may do better than mr jazeph be mean of relieving when mr orridge come to morrow will consult will take care that want for nothing that may order thank until have be mean of making well keep where be if arm chair be comfortable baby be asleep again must like to have hour quiet before change to night side of bed stop where be for present will call a soon a want so far from exercising soothing effect on mr jazeph kindly meant word produced precisely opposite result of making restless began to walk about room confusedly attempted to account for change in conduct by saying that wished to satisfy that arrangement be properly made for night in few minute more began in defiance of doctor prohibition to tempt mr frankland into talking again by asking question about porthgenna tower by referring to chance for against being chosen a permanent residence by young married couple perhaps ma'be said speaking on sudden with eagerness in voice be curiously at variance with apparent indifference of manner perhaps when see porthgenna tower may not like so well a think will now who can tell that may not get tired leave place again after few day especially if go into empty room must have thought if will excuse saying so ma'be must have thought that lady like must have liked to get a far away a possible from dirt dust disagreeable smell can face worse inconvenience than where curiosity be concerned said rosamond be more curious to see uninhabited room at porthgenna than to see seven wonder of world even if settle altogether at old house feel certain that will stay there for time at answer mr jazeph abruptly turned away asked more question retired to corner of room near door where chair bedstead stood doctor have pointed out to occupied herself for few minute in making ready for night then left a suddenly a have approached began to walk up down once more unaccountable restlessness have already surprised rosamond now made feel rather uneasy especially when once twice overheard mr jazeph talking to herself judging by word fragment of sentence be audible now then mind be still running with most inexplicable persistency on subject of porthgenna tower a minute wore on continued to walk up down still went on talking rosamond uneasiness began to strengthen into something like alarm resolved to awaken mr jazeph in least offensive manner to sense of strangeness of own conduct by noticing that be talking by not appearing to understand that be talking to herself what did say asked rosamond putting question at moment when nurse voice be most distinctly betraying in act of thinking aloud mr jazeph stopped raised head vacantly a if have be awakened out of heavy sleep thought be saying something more about old house continued rosamond thought heard say that ought not to go to porthgenna that must not go there in place something of sort mr jazeph blushed like young girl think must have be mistaken ma'be said stooped over chair bedstead again watching anxiously rosamond saw that while be affecting to arrange bedstead be doing nothing to prepare for being slept in what did mean what did whole conduct mean for last half hour a mr frankland asked question thrill of terrible suspicion turned cold to very root of hair have never occurred to before suddenly struck now with force of positive conviction that new nurse be not in right sens be unaccountable in behavior odd disappearance behind curtain at foot of bed lingering stealthy over familiar way of using hair brush silence at one time talkativeness at restlessness whispering to herself affectation of being deeply engaged in doing something be not doing at one of strange action otherwise incomprehensible became intelligible in moment on one dreadful supposition that be mad terrified a be rosamond kept presence of mind one of arm stole instinctively round child have half raised other to catch at bell rope hanging above pillow when saw mr jazeph turn look at woman possessed only of ordinary nerve must probably at instant have pulled at bell rope in unreasoning desperation of sheer fright rosamond have courage enough to calculate consequence to remember that mr jazeph must have time to lock door before assistance must arrive if betrayed suspicion by ringing without first assigning plausible reason for doing so slowly closed eye a nurse looked at partly to convey notion that be composing to sleep partly to gain time to think of safe excuse for summoning maid flurry of spirit however interfered with exercise of ingenuity minute after minute dragged on heavily still must think of assignable reason for ringing bell be just doubting whether must not be safest to send mr jazeph out of room on message to husband to lock door moment be alone then to ring be just doubting whether must boldly adopt course of proceeding not when heard rustle of nurse silk dress approaching bedside first impulse be to snatch at bell rope fear have paralyzed hand must not raise from pillow rustling of silk dress ceased half unclosed eye saw that nurse be stopping midway between part of room from have advanced bedside there be nothing wild angry in look agitation face expressed be agitation of perplexity alarm stood rapidly clasping unclasping hand image of bewilderment distress stood so for nearly minute then came forward few step more said inquiringly in whisper not asleep not quite asleep yet rosamond tried to speak in answer quick beating of heart seemed to rise up to very lip to stifle word on nurse came on still with same perplexity distress in face to within foot of bedside knelt down by pillow looked earnestly at rosamond shuddered little glanced round a if to make sure that room be empty bent forward hesitated bent nearer whispered into ear word when go to porthgenna keep out of myrtle room hot breath of woman a spoke beat on rosamond cheek seemed to fly in one fever throb through vein of body nervous shock of unutterable sensation burst bond of terror have hitherto held motionless speechless started up in bed with scream caught hold of bell rope pulled violently oh hush hush cried mr jazeph sinking back on knee beating hand together despairingly with helpless gesticulation of child rosamond rang again again hurrying footstep eager voice be heard outside on stair be not ten o'clock yet nobody have retired for night violent ringing have already alarmed house nurse rose to foot staggered back from bedside supported against wall of room a footstep voice reached door said not word hand that have be beating together so violently instant before hung down nerveless at side blank of great agony spread over face stilled awfully first person who entered room be mr frankland maid landlady followed fetch mr frankland said rosamond faintly addressing landlady want to speak to directly continued beckoning to maid sit by here till master come have be dreadfully frightened ask question stop here maid stared at mistress in amazement then looked round with disparaging frown at nurse when landlady left room to fetch mr frankland have moved little away from wall so a to command full view of bed eye be fixed with look of breathless suspense of devouring anxiety on rosamond face from other feature expression seemed to be gone said nothing noticed nothing did not start did not move aside inch when landlady returned led mr frankland to wife lenny let new nurse stop here to night pray pray whispered rosamond eagerly catching husband by arm warned by trembling of hand mr frankland laid finger lightly on temple on heart good heaven rosamond what have happened left quiet comfortable now have be frightened dear dreadfully frightened by new nurse be hard on poor creature be not in right sens be certain be not only get away quietly only send back at once to where came from will die of fright if stop here have be behaving so strangely have spoken such word to lenny lenny let go of hand came stealing up to so horribly just where be now knelt down at ear whispered oh such word hush hush love said mr frankland getting seriously alarmed by violence of rosamond agitation never mind repeating word now wait till be calmer beg entreat of wait till be calmer will do thing wish if will only lie down be quiet try to compose before say word be quite enough for to know that woman have frightened that wish to be sent away with a little harshness a possible will put off further explanation till to morrow morning deeply regret now did not persist in carrying out own idea of sending for proper nurse from london where be landlady landlady placed by mr frankland side be late asked leonard oh sir not ten o'clock yet order fly to be brought to door then a soon a possible if please where be nurse standing behind sir near wall said maid a mr frankland turned in direction rosamond whispered to be hard on lenny maid looking with contemptuous curiosity at mr jazeph saw whole expression of countenance alter a word be spoken tear rose thick in eye flowed down cheek deathly spell of stillness have lain on face be broken in instant drew back again close to wall leaned against a before be hard on maid heard repeat to herself in low sobbing voice be hard on oh god said that kindly said that kindly at least have desire to speak to to use unkindly said mr frankland imperfectly hearing what said know nothing of what have happened make accusation find mr frankland violently agitated frightened hear connect that agitation with not angrily compassionately instead of speaking harshly prefer leaving to own sense of what be right to decide whether attendance here ought not to cease at once have provided proper mean for conveyance from place must suggest that must make apology to mistress say nothing more than circumstance have happened oblige to dispense with service have be considerate toward sir said mr jazeph speaking quietly with certain gentle dignity in manner will not prove unworthy of forbearance by saying what might say in own defense advanced into middle of room stopped where must see rosamond plainly twice attempted to speak twice voice failed at third effort succeeded in controlling before go ma'be said hope will believe have bitter feeling against for sending away be not angry pray remember always be not angry never complained there be such forlornness in face sweet sorrowful resignation in tone of voice during utterance of few word that rosamond heart smote why did frighten asked half relenting frighten how must frighten oh of people in world how must frighten mournfully saying word nurse went to chair on have placed bonnet shawl put on landlady maid watching with curious eye detected that be again weeping bitterly noticed with astonishment at same time how neatly put on bonnet shawl wasted hand be moving mechanically be trembling while moved yet slight thing though be inexorable instinct of propriety guided most trifling action still on way to door stopped again at passing bedside looked through tear at rosamond child struggled little with then spoke farewell word god bless keep child happy prosperous said be not angry at being sent away if ever think of again after to night please to remember be not angry never complained stood for moment longer still weeping still looking through tear at mother child then turned away walked to door something in last

that have be sent away from tiger head by mr frankland direction reached doctor residence from inn just a be sitting down to breakfast finding that report of nurse dismissal be not accompanied by satisfactory explanation of cause of mr orridge refused to believe that attendance on mr frankland have really ceased however although declined to credit news be so far disturbed by that finished

bringing message from mr frankland sir said man want to see a soon a possible be true that mr frankland nurse be sent away last night by mr frankland order asked mr orridge quite true sir answered waiter doctor colored looked seriously discomposed one of most precious thing have about especially if happen to belong to medical profession be dignity struck mr orridge that ought to have be

privileged to offer practical contradiction to man good opinion of never have doctor thought more disrespectfully of rank rich never have be conscious of reflecting on republican principle with such absolute impartiality a when now followed waiter in sullen silence to mr frankland room who be that asked leonard when heard door open mr orridge sir said waiter good morning said mr orridge with self asserting abruptness familiarity mr frankland be sitting in arm chair with leg crossed mr orridge carefully selected arm chair crossed leg on model of mr frankland moment sat down mr frankland hand be in pocket of dressing gown mr orridge have pocket except in coat tail must not conveniently get at put thumb into arm hole of waistcoat asserted against easy insolence of wealth in way made difference to so curiously narrow be range of man perception when be insisting on own importance that mr frankland be blind consequently incapable of being impressed by independence of bearing mr orridge own

to oh if must only go to sleep at once not wake again till doctor come back love try not to count too certainly on being enlightened even then woman may refuse to explain to body even hint at disappointment a lenny will be wanting to get up go question even if must get up question rosamond might find impossible to make answer may be afraid of certain consequence can not foresee in case can

explanation go where like to see what like said patting on shoulder will stop here to make happy with pipe mozart will come out of cage sing little in fine fresh air unslung leather case from shoulder while spoke took out musical box set ringing tiny peal to second of two air be constructed to play minuet in don giovanni sarah left looking about carefully not for seat for for smooth bit of rock to

letter of inscription mechanically one by one with finger sacred to memory of hugh polwheal aged year met with death through fall of rock in porthgenna mine december th hand lingered over letter after have followed to last line bent forward pressed lip on stone better so said to herself a rose from knee looked down at inscription for last time better must fade out so fewer stranger eye will see fewer stranger foot will follow where mine have be will lie quieter in place of rest brushed tear from eye gathered few blade of grass from grave then left church yard outside hedge surrounded inclosure stopped for moment drew from bosom of dress little book of wesley hymn have taken with from desk in bedroom on morning of flight from porthgenna withered remains of grass that have plucked from grave sixteen year ago lay between page still added to fresh fragment that have just gathered replaced book in bosom of dress hastened back over moor to spot where old man be waiting for found packing up musical box again in leather case good wind said holding up palm of hand to fresh breeze be sweeping over moor very good wind indeed if take by bitter bad wind if take with mozart blow off

cry so so see fewer question ask just now better will like good have done have last question yet what be standing here for why do not go on yes yes be right uncle joseph let go on at once will lose little courage have if stay here much longer looking at house proceeded down path without moment of delay when have reached end of stood opposite eastern boundary wall of porthgenna tower principal entrance to house have be very rarely used of late year be in west front be approached by terrace road overlooked sea smaller entrance be generally used be situated on south side of building led through servant office to great hall west staircase sarah old experience of porthgenna guided instinctively toward part of house led companion on until gained southern angle of east wall then stopped looked about since have passed postman have entered on moor have not set eye on living creature still though be now under very wall of porthgenna man woman child not even domestic animal appeared in view be very lonely here said sarah looking round distrustfully much lonelier than used to be be only to tell what can see for that be stopping now asked uncle joseph whose inveterate cheerfulness must have be proof against solitude of sahara answered in quick anxious whisper bell must ring at be so close only round there must like to know what be to say when come face to face with servant told be time enough to think about when be at door uncle be at door now what will do first thing to do said uncle joseph shrugging shoulder be surely to ring yes when servant come what be to say say repeated uncle joseph knitting eyebrow quite fiercely with effort of thinking rapping forehead with forefinger just under hat say stop stop stop stop ah have got know make quite easy sarah moment door be opened speaking to servant will be done by oh how relieve what will say say 'how do do have come to see house when have disclosed that remarkable expedient for effecting entrance into porthgenna tower spread out hand interrogatively drew back several pace from niece looked at with serenely self satisfied air of man who have leaped at one mental bound from doubt to discovery sarah gazed at in astonishment expression of absolute conviction on face staggered poorest of poor excuse for gaining admission into house have thought of have rejected during previous night seemed like very perfection of artifice by comparison with childishly simple expedient a suggested by uncle joseph yet there stood apparently quite convinced that have hit on mean of smoothing away obstacle at once not knowing what to say not believing sufficiently in validity of own doubt to venture on openly expressing opinion one way other took last refuge be now left open to endeavored to gain time be very very good of uncle to take difficulty of speaking to servant on own shoulder said hidden despondency at heart expressing in spite of in faintness of voice forlorn perplexity of eye must mind waiting little before ring at door walking up down for few minute by side of wall where nobody be likely to see want to get little more time to prepare for trial have to go through in case servant make difficulty about letting in mean difficulty that can not just now anticipate must not be a well to think of something else to say at door perhaps if be to consider again there be not least need interposed uncle joseph have only to speak to servant crick crack will see that will get in will walk up down a long a please there be reason because have done thinking in one moment that must have done thinking in one moment too reason at saying word with patronizing air self satisfied smile must have be irresistibly comical under le critical circumstance old man again offered arm to niece led back over broken ground that lay under eastern wall of porthgenna tower while sarah be waiting in doubt outside wall happened by curious coincidence that person vested with highest domestic authority be also waiting in doubt inside wall person be other than housekeeper of porthgenna tower cause of perplexity be nothing le than letter have be delivered by postman very morning be letter from mr frankland have be written after have held long conversation with husband mr orridge on receiving last fragment of information doctor be able to communicate in reference to mr housekeeper have read letter through over over again be more puzzled astonished by at fresh reading be now waiting for return of steward mr munder from occupation out of door with intention of taking opinion on singular communication have received from mistress while sarah uncle be still walking up down outside eastern wall mr munder entered housekeeper room be one of tall grave benevolent looking men with conical head deep voice slow step heavy manner who passively contrive to get great reputation for wisdom without trouble of saying doing thing to deserve round porthgenna neighborhood steward be popularly spoken of a remarkably sound sensible man housekeeper although sharp woman in other matter in one respect shared to large extent in general delusion good morning mr pentreath said mr munder news to day what weight importance deep voice impressively slow method of using gave to two insignificant sentence news mr munder will astonish replied housekeeper have received letter morning from mr frankland be without exception most mystifying thing of sort ever met with be told to communicate letter to have be waiting whole morning to hear opinion of pray down give attention for do positively assure that letter requires mr munder sat down became picture of attention immediately not of ordinary attention can be wearied of judicial attention know fatigue be superior alike to power of dullness power of time housekeeper without wasting precious minute mr munder minute ranked next on scale of importance to prime minister opened mistress letter resisting natural temptation to make few more prefatory remark on immediately favored steward with first paragraph in following term mr pentreath must be tired of receiving letter from fixing day for arrival of mr frankland on third occasion of writing to about plan will be best think to make third appointment merely to say that will leave west winston for porthgenna moment can get doctor permission to travel so far remarked mr pentreath placing letter on lap smoothing out rather irritably while spoke so far there be nothing of much consequence letter certainly seems to between to be written in rather poor language too much like common talking to come up to idea of what lady style of composition ought to be be matter of opinion ca say must be last person to wish to say that beginning of mr frankland letter be not upon whole perfectly clear be middle end wish to consult about mr munder just so said mr munder only two word more meaning in than two hundred in mouth of ordinary man housekeeper cleared throat with extraordinary loudness elaboration read on thus principal object in writing line be to request by mr frankland desire that mr munder will endeavor to ascertain a privately a possible whether person now traveling in cornwall in whom happen to be much interested have be yet seen in neighborhood of porthgenna person in question be known to by name of mr jazeph be elderly woman of quiet lady like manner looking nervous in delicate health dress according to experience of with extreme propriety neatness in dark color eye have singular expression of timidity voice be particularly soft low manner be frequently marked by extreme hesitation be thus particular in describing in case must not be traveling under name by know for reason be not necessary to state husband think probable that at former period of life mr jazeph may have be connected with porthgenna neighborhood whether be fact be indisputably certain that be familiar with interior of porthgenna tower that have interest of kind quite incomprehensible to in house coupling fact with knowledge have of being now in cornwall think just within range of possibility that mr munder other person in employment may meet with be particularly anxious if must by chance ask to see house not only that must show over with perfect readiness civility also that must take private particular notice of conduct from time when enters building to time when leaf let out of sight for moment if possible pray get trustworthy person to follow unperceived ascertain where go to after have quitted house be of most vital importance that instruction strange a may seem to must be implicitly obeyed to very letter have only room time to add that know nothing to discredit of person that particularly desire will manage matter with sufficient discretion in case meet with to prevent from having suspicion that be acting under order that have especial interest in watching movement will be good enough to communicate letter to steward be at liberty to repeat instruction in to other trustworthy person if necessary yours truly rosamond frankland p have left room baby be getting on charmingly there said housekeeper who be to make head tail of must like to know did ever in experience mr munder meet with letter before here be very heavy responsibility laid on shoulder without one word of explanation have be puzzling brain about what interest in mysterious woman can be whole morning more think le come of be opinion mr munder ought to do something immediately be there course in particular feel disposed to point out mr munder coughed dubiously crossed right leg over left put head critically on one side coughed for second time looked at housekeeper if have belonged to other man in world mr pentreath must have considered that face now confronted hers expressed nothing most profound vacant bewilderment be mr munder face be only to be looked at with sentiment of respectful expectation rather think began mr munder yes said housekeeper eagerly before word must be spoken maid servant entered room to lay cloth for mr pentreath dinner there there never mind now betsey said housekeeper impatiently lay cloth till ring for mr munder have something very important to talk about ca be interrupted just yet have hardly said word before interruption of most unexpected kind happened door bell rang be very unusual occurrence at porthgenna tower few person who have occasion to come to house on domestic business always entered by small side gate be left on latch in day time who in world can that be exclaimed mr pentreath hastening to window commanded side view of lower door step first object that met eye when looked out be lady standing on lowest step lady dressed very neatly in quiet dark color good heaven mr munder cried housekeeper hurrying back to table snatching up mr frankland letter have left on there be stranger waiting at door at very moment lady at least woman dressed neatly dressed in dark color might knock down mr munder with feather stop betsey stop where be be only going ma'be to answer door said betsey in amazement stop where be reiterated mr pentreath composing by great effort happen to have certain reason on particular occasion for descending out of own place putting into yours stand out of way staring fool be going up stair to answer that ring at door chapter iii inside house mr pentreath surprise at seeing lady through window be doubled by amazement at seeing gentleman when opened door waiting close to bell handle after have rung instead of rejoining niece on step uncle joseph stood near enough to house to be out of range of view from mr pentreath window to housekeeper excited imagination appeared on threshold with suddenness of apparition apparition of little rosy faced old gentleman smiling bowing taking off hat with superb flourish of politeness have something quite superhuman in sweep dexterity of how do do have come to see house said uncle joseph trying infallible expedient for gaining admission instant door be open mr pentreath be struck speechless who be familiar old gentleman with foreign accent fantastic bow what did mean by talking to a if be intimate friend mr frankland letter said not so much from beginning to end a one word about how do do have come to see house repeated uncle joseph giving irresistible form of salutation benefit of second trial so said just now sir remarked mr pentreath recovering self possession enough to use tongue in own defense doe lady continued looking down over old man shoulder at step on niece be standing doe lady wish to see house too sarah gently spoken reply in affirmative short a be convinced housekeeper that woman described in mr frankland letter really truly stood before besides neat quiet dress there be now softly toned voice when looked up for moment there be timid eye also to identify by in relation to one of two stranger mr pentreath however agitated surprised might be must no longer feel uncertainty about course ought to adopt in relation to other visitor incomprehensible old foreigner be beset by most bewildering doubt must be safest to hold to letter of mr frankland instruction ask to wait outside while lady be being shown over house must be best to act on own responsibility to risk giving admission a well a companion be difficult point to decide therefore one be necessary to submit to superior sagacity of mr munder will step in for moment wait here while speak to steward said mr pentreath pointedly neglecting to notice familiar old foreigner addressing straight through to lady on step below thank very much said uncle joseph smiling bowing impervious to rebuke what did tell whispered triumphantly to niece a passed on way into house mr pentreath first impulse be to go down stair at once speak to mr munder timely recollection of part of mr frankland letter enjoined not to lose sight of lady in quiet dress brought to stand still next moment be more easily recalled to remembrance of particular injunction by curious alteration in conduct of lady who seemed to lose diffidence to become surprisingly impatient to lead way into interior of house moment have stepped across threshold betsey cried mr pentreath cautiously calling to servant after have only retired few pace from visitor betsey ask mr munder to be so kind a to step way mr munder presented with great deliberation with certain lowering dignity in face have be accustomed to be treated with deference be not pleased with housekeeper for unceremoniously leaving moment heard ring at bell without giving time to pronounce opinion on mr frankland letter accordingly when mr pentreath in high state of excitement drew aside out of hearing confided to in whisper astounding intelligence that lady in whom mr mr frankland be so mysteriously interested be at moment actually standing before in house received communication with air of most provoking indifference be worse still when proceeded to state difficulty warily keeping eye on two stranger while appeal a respectfully a might to mr munder superior wisdom for guidance persisted in listening with disparaging frown ended by irritably contradicting when ventured to add in conclusion that own idea inclined to assume responsibility to beg foreign gentleman to wait outside while lady in conformity with mr frankland instruction be being shown over house such may be opinion ma'be said mr munder severely be not mine housekeeper looked aghast perhaps suggested deferentially think that foreign old gentleman must be likely to insist on going over house with lady of course think so said mr munder have thought nothing of sort only idea just then being idea of asserting own supremacy by setting steadily in opposition to preconceived arrangement of mr pentreath then must take responsibility of showing over house seeing that have come to door together asked housekeeper of course must answered steward with promptitude of resolution distinguishes superior men well mr munder be always glad to be guided by opinion will be guided by now said mr pentreath a there will be two people to look after for must not trust foreigner out of sight on consideration must really beg to share trouble of showing over house along with be so excited nervous feel a if have wit about never be placed in such position a before be in midst of mystery understand in short if ca count on assistance wo answer for will not make mistake must be very sorry to make mistake not only on own account here housekeeper stopped looked hard at mr munder go on ma'be said mr munder with cruel composure not only on own account resumed mr pentreath demurely on yours for mr frankland letter certainly cast responsibility of conducting delicate business on shoulder a well a on mine mr munder recoiled few step turned red opened lip indignantly hesitated closed again be fairly caught in trap of own setting must not retreat from responsibility of directing housekeeper conduct moment after have voluntarily assumed must not deny that mr frankland letter positively repeatedly referred to by name there be only one way of getting out of difficulty with dignity mr munder unblushingly took way moment have recovered self possession enough to collect for effort be perfectly amazed mr pentreath began with gravest dignity yes repeat be perfectly amazed that must think capable of leaving to go over house alone under such remarkable circumstance a be now placed in ma'be other fault may be shrinking from share of responsibility be not one of require to be reminded of mr frankland letter require apology be quite ready ma'be quite ready to show way up stair whenever be sooner better mr munder for there be that audacious old foreigner actually chattering to betsey now a if have known life assertion be quite true uncle joseph be exercising gift of familiarity on maid servant who have lingered to stare at stranger instead of going back to kitchen just a have already exercised on old lady passenger in stage coach on driver of pony chaise took niece to post town of porthgenna while housekeeper steward be holding private conference be keeping betsey in ecstasy of suppressed giggling by odd question that asked about house about how got on with work in inquiry have naturally led from south side of building by companion have entered to west side be shortly to explore thence round to north side be forbidden ground to body in house when mr pentreath came forward with steward overheard exchange of question answer passing between foreigner maid tell betzee dear said uncle joseph why doe nobody ever go into mouldy old room because there be ghost in answered betsey with burst of laughter a if series of haunted room series of excellent joke meant precisely same thing hold tongue directly go back to kitchen cried mr pentreath indignantly ignorant people about here continued still pointedly overlooking uncle joseph addressing only to sarah tell absurd story about old room on unrepaired side of house have not be inhabited for more than century past absurd story about ghost servant be foolish enough to believe be not said betsey retiring under protest to lower region believe word about ghost at least not in day time adding important saving clause in whisper betsey unwillingly withdrew from scene mr pentreath observed with surprise that mysterious lady in quiet dress turned very pale at mention of ghost story made remark on while be still wondering what meant mr munder emerged into dignified prominence loftily addressed not to uncle joseph not to sarah to empty air between if wish to see house said will have goodness to follow with word mr munder turned solemnly into passage led to foot of west staircase walking with peculiar slow strut in serious

event have just happened in house a seldom enjoyed there be only one kind of speaker who be quite certain never to break down under stress of circumstance man whose capability of talking doe not include dangerous underlying capacity for knowing what mean among favored order of natural orator mr munder occupied prominent rank be now vindictively resolved to exercise ability on two stranger under pretense of asking for explanation of conduct before must suffer to quit house on entering room found uncle joseph seated with niece at lower end of engaged in dropping sal volatile into glass of water at upper end stood housekeeper with open medicine chest on table before to part of room mr munder slowly advanced with portentous countenance drew arm chair up to table sat down in with

calmly impartially politely plainly smoothly when say smoothly mean quietly whether be not of bound to explain yourselves mr munder paused to let last irresistible appeal work way to conscience of person whom addressed housekeeper took advantage of silence to cough a congregation cough just before sermon apparently on principle of getting rid of bodily infirmity beforehand in order to give mind free play for undisturbed intellectual enjoyment betsey following mr pentreath lead indulged in cough on own account of faint distrustful sort uncle joseph sat perfectly easy undismayed still holding niece hand in giving little squeeze from time to time when steward oratory became particularly involved impressive sarah never moved never looked up never lost expression of terrified restraint have taken possession of face from first moment when entered housekeeper room now what be fact circumstance event proceeded mr munder leaning back in chair in calm enjoyment of sound of own voice ma'be sir

munder warily by coat tail whispered to to be careful mr frankland letter said in ear tell particularly not to let be suspected that be acting under order fancy mr pentreath forget what ought to

violent language in drawing room ma'be disappear rather go altogether out of sight such conduct a so highly unparalleled so entirely unprecedented so very unusual cause mr pentreath to feel here mr munder stopped at loss for word for first time astonished suggested mr pentreath after long interval of silence ma'be retorted mr munder nothing of sort be not at astonished be surprised what followed succeeded that what did hear sir on first floor looking sternly at uncle joseph what did hear mr pentreath while be searching for missing absent party on second floor what thus personally appealed to housekeeper answered briefly scream said mr munder fretfully tapping hand on table screech mr pentreath screech what be meaning purport upshot of screech young woman here mr munder turned suddenly on betsey have now traced extraordinary fact circumstance a far a have goodness to step forward tell in presence of two party how came to utter give what mr pentreath call scream what call screech plain statement will do good girl quite plain statement if please young woman one word more speak up understand speak up covered with confusion by public solemn nature of appeal betsey on starting with statement unconsciously followed oratorical example of le person than mr munder be to say spoke on principle of drowning smallest possible infusion of idea in largest possible dilution of word extricated from mesh of verbal entanglement in contrived to involve statement may be not unfairly represented a simply consisting of following fact first betsey have to relate that happened to be just taking lid off saucepan on kitchen fire when heard in neighborhood of housekeeper room sound of hurried footstep vernacularly termed by witness scurrying of somebody foot secondly betsey on leaving kitchen to ascertain what sound meant footstep retreating rapidly along passage led to north side of house stimulated by curiosity followed sound of for certain distance thirdly at sharp turn in passage betsey stopped short despairing of overtaking person whose footstep heard feeling also sense of dread termed by witness creeping of flesh at idea of venturing alone even in broad daylight into ghostly quarter of house fourthly while still hesitating at turn in passage betsey heard lock of door go stimulated afresh by curiosity advanced few step farther then stopped again debating within difficult dreadful question whether be usual custom of ghost when passing from one place to to unlock closed door may happen to be in way to save trouble by simply passing through fifthly after long deliberation many false start forward toward north hall backward toward kitchen betsey decided that be immemorial custom of ghost to pas through door not unlock sixthly fortified by conviction betsey went on boldly close to door when suddenly heard loud report a of heavy body falling graphically termed by witness banging scrash seventhly noise frightened betsey out of wit brought heart up into mouth took away breath eighthly lastly on recovering breath enough to scream screech betsey did with might main scream screech running back toward kitchen a fast a leg must carry with hair standing up on end flesh in crawl from crown of head to sol of foot just so just so said mr munder when statement came to close a if sight of young woman with hair standing on end flesh in crawl be ordinary result of experience of female humanity just so may stand back good girl may stand back there be nothing to smile at sir continued sternly addressing uncle joseph who have be excessively amused by betsey manner of delivering evidence must be doing better to carry rather transport mind back to what followed succeeded young woman screech what did do sir rushed to spot ran to place what did see

employer in name of decency in name of wonder what do mean by with conclusion mr munder struck fist on table waited with glare of merciless expectation for thing in shape of answer explanation defense culprit at bottom of room might be disposed to offer tell thing whispered sarah to old man thing to keep quiet thing to make let go after have suffered people will drive mad never very quick at inventing excuse perfectly ignorant besides of what have really happened to niece while be alone in north hall uncle joseph with best will in world to prove equal to emergency felt considerable difficulty in deciding what must say do determined however at hazard to spare sarah useless suffering to remove from house a speedily a possible rose to take responsibility of speaking on looking hard before opened lip at mr munder who immediately leaned forward on table with hand to ear uncle joseph acknowledged polite act of attention with one of fantastic bow then replied to whole of steward long harangue in six unanswerable word wish good day sir how dare wish thing of sort cried mr munder jumping out of chair in violent indignation how dare trifle with serious subject serious question in way wish good day indeed do suppose be going to let out of house without hearing explanation of abstracting purloining snatching of key of north room ah be that want to know said uncle joseph

to post town of porthgenna sarah have asserted literal truth jacob have tracked to inn have waited little while about door to ascertain if there be likelihood of continuing journey that evening have then returned to porthgenna tower to make report to claim promised reward same night housekeeper steward devoted to joint production of letter to mr frankland informing of have taken place from time when visitor first made appearance to time when gardener boy have followed to door of inn composition be plentifully garnished throughout with flower of mr munder rhetoric be by necessary consequence inordinately long a narrative hopelessly confused a statement of fact be unnecessary to say that letter with fault absurdity be read by mr frankland with deepest interest husband mr orridge to of whom communicated content be a much amazed perplexed by a be although discovery of mr jazeph departure for cornwall have led to consider within range of possibility that might appear at porthgenna although housekeeper have be written to by rosamond under influence of idea husband be quite prepared for such speedy confirmation of suspicion a have now received astonishment however on first ascertaining general purport of letter be a nothing compared with astonishment when came to particular passage in referred to uncle fresh element of complication imparted to thickening mystery of mr jazeph myrtle room by entrance of foreign stranger on scene by intimate connection with extraordinary proceeding have taken place in house fairly baffled letter be read again again be critically dissected paragraph by paragraph be carefully annotated by doctor for purpose of extricating fact that contained from mass of unmeaning word in mr munder have artfully lengthily involved be finally pronounced after pain have be taken to render intelligible to be most mysterious bewildering document that mortal pen have ever produced first practical suggestion after letter have be laid aside in despair emanated from rosamond proposed that husband baby included a matter of course must start at once for porthgenna to question servant minutely about proceeding of mr jazeph foreign stranger who have accompanied to examine premise on north side of house with view to discovering clew to locality of myrtle room while event be still fresh in memory of witness plan thus advocated however excellent in be opposed by mr orridge on medical ground mr frankland have caught cold by exposing too carelessly to air on first leaving room doctor refused to grant permission to travel for at least week to come if not for longer period next proposal came from mr frankland declared to be perfectly clear to mind that only chance of penetrating mystery of myrtle room rested entirely on discovery of mean of communicating with mr jazeph suggested that must not trouble to think of thing unconnected with accomplishment of purpose proposed that servant then in attendance on at west winston man who have be in employment for many year whose zeal activity intelligence must be thoroughly depended on must be sent to porthgenna forthwith to start necessary inquiry to examine premise carefully on north side of house advice be immediately acted on at hour notice servant started for cornwall thoroughly instructed a to what be to do well supplied with money in case found necessary to employ many person in making proposed inquiry in due course of time sent report of proceeding to master proved to be of most discouraging nature trace of mr jazeph companion have be lost at post town of porthgenna investigation have be made in direction reliable information have be obtained people in totally different part of country declared readily enough that have seen two person answering to description of lady in dark dress old foreigner when be called upon to state direction in two stranger be traveling answer received turned out to be of most puzzling contradictory kind pain have be spared necessary expenditure of money have be grudged so far result of slightest value have be obtained whether lady foreigner have gone east west north south be more than mr frankland servant at present stage of proceeding must take on to say report of examination of north room be not more satisfactory here again nothing of importance must be discovered servant have ascertained that there be twenty two room on uninhabited side of house six on ground floor opening into deserted garden eight on first floor eight above on second story have examined door carefully from top to bottom have come to conclusion that none of have be opened evidence afforded by lady own action led to nothing have if testimony of servant must be trusted dropped key on floor of hall be found a housekeeper steward asserted lying in fainting condition at top of landing of first flight of stair door opposite to in position showed more trace of having be recently opened than of other door of other twenty one room whether room to wished to gain access be one of eight on first floor whether have fainted on way up to higher range of eight room on second floor be impossible to determine only conclusion must be fairly drawn from event have taken place in house be two in number first might be taken for granted that lady have be disturbed before have be able to use key to gain admission to myrtle room secondly might be assumed from position in be found on stair from evidence relating to dropping of key that myrtle room be not on ground floor be one of sixteen room situated on first second story beyond writer of report have nothing further to mention except that have ventured to decide on waiting at porthgenna in event of master having further instruction to communicate what be to be done next be necessarily first question suggested by servant announcement of unsuccessful result of inquiry at porthgenna how be to be answered be not very easy to discover mr frankland have nothing to suggest mr frankland have nothing to suggest doctor have nothing to suggest more industriously three hunted through mind for new idea le chance there seemed to be of succeeding in finding one at last rosamond proposed in despair that must seek advice of fourth person who must be depended on asked husband permission to write confidential statement of difficulty to vicar of long beckley doctor chennery be oldest friend adviser have known a child be well acquainted with history of family felt fatherly interest in fortune possessed that invaluable quality of plain clear headed common sense marked out a very man who must be most likely a well a most willing to help mr frankland readily agreed to wife suggestion rosamond wrote immediately to doctor chennery informing of thing have happened since mr jazeph first introduction to asking for opinion on course of proceeding must be best for husband to adopt in difficulty in be now placed by return of post answer be received amply justified rosamond reliance on old friend doctor chennery not only sympathized heartily with eager curiosity mr jazeph language conduct have excited in mind of correspondent have also plan of own to propose for ascertaining position of myrtle room vicar prefaced suggestion by expressing strong opinion against instituting further search after mr jazeph judging by circumstance a be related to considered that must be merest waste of time to attempt to find out accordingly passed from that part of subject at once devoted to consideration of more important question how mr mr frankland be to proceed in endeavor to discover for mystery of myrtle room on point doctor chennery entertained conviction of strongest kind warned rosamond beforehand that must expect to be very much surprised when came to statement of taking for granted that husband must not hope to find out where room be unless be assisted by one better acquainted than with old local arrangement of interior of porthgenna tower vicar declared to be opinion that there be only one individual living who must afford information wanted that person be other than rosamond own cross grained relative andrew treverton startling opinion doctor chennery supported by two reason in first place andrew be only surviving member of elder generation who have lived at porthgenna tower in by gone day when tradition connected with north room be still fresh in memory of inhabitant of house people who lived in now be stranger who have be placed in situation by mr frankland father servant employed in former day by captain treverton be dead dispersed one available person therefore whose recollection be likely to be of service to mr mr frankland be indisputably brother of old owner of porthgenna tower in second place there be chance even if andrew treverton memory be not to be trusted that might posse written printed information relating to locality of myrtle room by father will have be made when andrew be young man just going to college have not be altered at period of departure from england at after time have inherited choice old collection of book in library at porthgenna supposing that still preserved heir loom be highly probable that there might exist among plan description of house a be in olden time must supply information be wanted here then be valid reason for believing that if clew to position of myrtle room existed where andrew treverton be man to lay hand on assuming therefore to be proved that surly old misanthrope be only person who must be profitably applied to for requisite information next question be how to communicate with vicar understood perfectly that after andrew inexcusably heartless conduct toward father mother be quite impossible for rosamond to address direct application to obstacle however might be surmounted by making necessary communication proceed from doctor chennery heartily a vicar disliked andrew treverton personally strongly a disapproved of old misanthrope principle be willing to set aside own antipathy objection to serve interest of young friend expressed perfect readiness to write recall to andrew recollection to ask a if be matter of antiquarian curiosity for information on subject of north side of porthgenna tower including of course special request to be made acquainted with name by room have be individually known in former day in making offer vicar frankly acknowledged that thought chance be very much against receiving answer at to application matter how carefully might word with view to humoring andrew churlish peculiarity however considering that in present posture of affair forlorn hope be better than hope at thought be at least worth while to make attempt on plan have just suggested if mr mr frankland must devise better mean of opening communication with andrew treverton if have discovered new method of own for obtaining information of stood in need doctor chennery be perfectly ready to set aside own opinion to defer to theirs very brief consideration of vicar friendly letter convinced rosamond husband that have choice gratefully to accept offer contained chance be certainly against success of proposed application be more unfavorable than chance against success of unaided investigation at porthgenna there be at least faint hope of doctor chennery request for information producing result there seemed hope at of penetrating mystery connected with one room only by dint of wandering in perfect ignorance of what to search for through two range of room reached number of sixteen influenced by consideration rosamond wrote back to vicar to thank for kindness to beg that must communicate with andrew treverton a have proposed without moment delay doctor chennery immediately occupied in composition of important letter taking care to make application on purely antiquarian ground accounting for assumed curiosity on subject of interior of porthgenna tower by referring to former knowledge of treverton family to natural interest in old house with name fortune have be so closely connected after appealing to andrew early recollection for information that wanted ventured step farther alluded to library of old book mentioning own idea that there might be found among plan verbal description of house might prove to be of greatest service in event of mr treverton memory not having preserved particular in connection with name position of north room in conclusion took liberty of mentioning that loan of document of kind to have alluded permission to have extract made from must be thankfully acknowledged a great favor conferred added in postscript that in order to save mr treverton trouble messenger must call for answer might be disposed to give day after delivery of letter having completed application in term vicar inclosed under cover to man of business in london with direction that be to be delivered by trustworthy person that messenger be to call again next morning to know if there be answer three day after letter have be dispatched to destination at time tidings of sort have be received from doctor chennery rosamond at last obtained medical attendant permission to travel taking leave of mr orridge with many promise to let know what progress made toward discovering myrtle room mr mr frankland turned back on west winston for third time started on journey to porthgenna tower chapter ii beginning of end be baking day in establishment of mr andrew treverton when messenger intrusted with doctor chennery letter found way to garden door of cottage at bayswater after have rung three time heard gruff voice on other side of

carefully through from address at beginning to name at end scratched reflectively for little while at ragged beard then folded letter up carefully put in pocket will have look at later in day thought to tearing off piece of old newspaper to light fire with strike just at present that there may be better thing done with letter than burning resolutely abstaining from taking letter out of pocket again until duty of household for day have be duly performed shrowl lit fire occupied morning in making baking bread patiently took turn afterward at digging in kitchen garden be four o'clock in afternoon before felt at liberty to think of private affair to venture on retiring into solitude with object of secretly looking over letter once more second perusal of doctor chennery unlucky application to mr treverton helped to confirm shrowl in resolution not to destroy letter with great pain perseverance much incidental scratching at beard contrived to make master of three distinct point in stood out in estimation a possessing prominent serious importance first point contrived to establish clearly in mind be that person who signed name of robert chennery be desirous of examining plan printed account of north side of interior of certain old house in cornwall called porthgenna tower second point appeared to resolve into robert chennery believed such plan printed account might be found among collection of book belonging to mr treverton third point be that same robert chennery must receive loan of plan printed account a one of greatest favor must be conferred on meditating on latter fact with eye exclusively fixed on contemplation of own interest shrowl arrived at conclusion that might be well worth while in pecuniary point of view to try if must not privately place in position to oblige robert chennery by searching in secret among master book might be worth five pound note to if managed well thought shrowl putting letter back in pocket again ascending stair thoughtfully to lumber room at top of house room be two in number be entirely unfurnished be littered over with rare collection of book have once adorned library at porthgenna tower covered with dust scattered in direction position over floor lay hundred hundred of volume cast out of packing case a coal be cast out of sack into cellar ancient book student must have treasured a priceless lay in chaotic equality of neglect side by side with modern publication whose chief merit be beauty of binding by be inclosed into wilderness of scattered volume shrowl now wandered fortified by supreme self possession of ignorance to search resolutely for one particular book with other light to direct than faint glimmer of two guiding word porthgenna tower having got firmly fixed in mind next object be to search until found printed on first page of one of hundred of volume lay around be for time being emphatically business in life there now stood in largest of two attic doggedly prepared to do cleared away space enough with foot to enable to sit down comfortably on floor then began to look over book that lay within arm length of odd volume of rare edition of classic odd volume of english historian odd volume of play by elizabethan dramatist book of travel book of sermon book of jest book of natural history book of sport turned up in quaint rapid succession book containing on title page word porthgenna tower rewarded searching industry of shrowl for first ten minute after have sat down on floor before removing to position contending with fresh accumulation of literary lumber paused considered little with whether there might not be easier more orderly method than have yet devised of working way through scattered mass of volume yet remained to be examined result of reflection be that must be le confusing to if searched through book in part of room indifferently regulating selection of solely by various size disposing of largest to begin with then after stowing away together proceeding to next largest so going on until came down at last to pocket volume accordingly cleared away morsel of vacant space near wall then trampling over book a coolly a if be so many clod of earth on ploughed field picked out largest of volume lay on floor be atlas shrowl turned over map reflected shook head removed volume to vacant space have cleared close to wall next largest book be magnificently bound collection of engraved portrait of distinguished character shrowl saluted distinguished character with grunt of gothic disapprobation carried off to keep atlas company against wall third largest book lay under several others projected little at one end be bound in scarlet morocco in position bound in quieter color must probably have escaped notice shrowl drew out with difficulty opened with portentous frown of distrust looked at title page suddenly slapped thigh with great oath of exultation there be very two word of be in search staring in face a be with emphasis of largest capital letter took step toward door to make sure that master be not moving in house then checked turned back what do care thought shrowl whether see not if come to tustle betwixt be to have own way know who be master who be servant in house by time composing with reflection turned to first leaf of book with intention of looking over carefully page by page from beginning to end first leaf be blank second leaf have inscription written at top of in faded ink contained word initial rare only six copy printed t below on middle of leaf be printed dedication to john arthur treverton esquire lord of manor of porthgenna one of majesty justice of peace fr etc etc etc work in attempt be made to describe ancient honored mansion of ancestor there be many more line filled to bursting with largest most obsequious word to be found in dictionary shrowl wisely abstained from giving trouble of reading turned over at once to title page there be important word history antiquity of porthgenna tower from period of first erection to present time comprising interesting genealogical particular relating to treverton family with inquiry into origin of gothic architecture few thought on theory of fortification after period of norman conquest by reverend job dark dd rector of porthgenna whole adorned with portrait view plan executed in highest style of art not published printed by spaldock grime truro be title page next leaf contained engraved view of porthgenna tower from west then came several page devoted to origin of gothic architecture then more page explaining norman theory of fortification be succeeded by engraving porthgenna tower from east after followed more reading under title of treverton family then came third engraving porthgenna tower from north shrowl paused there looked with interest at leaf opposite print only announced more reading still about erection of mansion be succeeded by engraving from family portrait in gallery at porthgenna placing left thumb between leaf to mark place shrowl impatiently turned to end of book to see what must find there last leaf contained plan of stable leaf before presented plan of north garden on next leaf turning backward be very thing described in robert chennery letter plan of interior arrangement of north side of house shrowl first impulse on making discovery be to carry book away to safest hiding place must find for preparatory to secretly offering for sale when messenger called next morning for answer to letter little reflection however convinced that proceeding of sort bore dangerously close resemblance to act of thieving might get into trouble if person with whom desired to deal asked preliminary question touching right to volume wanted to dispose of only alternative that remained be to make best copy must of plan to traffic with a document most scrupulous person in world need not hesitate to purchase resolving after consideration to undergo trouble of making copy rather than run risk of purloining book shrowl descended to kitchen took from one of drawer of dresser old stump of pen bottle of ink crumpled half sheet of dirty letter paper returned to garret to copy plan a best might be of simplest kind occupied small portion of page yet presented to eye hopelessly involved intricate appearance when now examined for second time room be represented by row of small square with name neatly printed inside position of door staircase passage be indicated by parallel line of various length breadth after much cogitation frowning pulling at beard occurred to shrowl that easiest method of copying plan must be to cover with letter paper though hardly size of page be large enough to spread over engraving on then to trace line saw through paper a carefully a must with pen ink puffed snorted grumbled got red in face over task accomplished at last bating certain drawback in shape of blot smear in sufficiently creditable manner then stopped to let ink dry to draw breath freely before attempted to do thing more next obstacle to be overcome consisted in difficulty of copying name of room be printed inside square fortunately for shrowl who be one of clumsiest of mankind in use of pen none of name be very long a be found greatest difficulty in writing in sufficiently small character to fit into square one name in particular that of myrtle room presented combination of letter in word myrtle tried patience finger sorely when attempted to reproduce indeed result in case when have done best be so illegible even to eye that wrote word over again in larger character at top of page connected by wavering line with square represented myrtle room same accident happened to in two other instance be remedied in same way with rest of name however succeeded better when have finally completed business of transcription by writing title plan of north side copy presented on whole more respectable appearance than might have be anticipated after satisfying of accuracy by careful comparison of with original folded up along with doctor chennery letter deposited in pocket with hoarse gasp of relief grim smile of satisfaction next morning garden door of cottage presented to public eye in totally new aspect of standing hospitably ajar one of bare post have advantage of being embellished by figure of shrowl who leaned against easily with leg

frame to keep drawing engraving steady in piece of wood only secured to back of frame by one nail have be forced out of place probably by overthrow of table when rosamond took frame out of drawer observed between dislodged piece of wood end of morsel of paper apparently folded many time over so a to occupy smallest possible space drew out piece of paper laid aside on table without unfolding replaced piece of wood in proper position then turned frame round to see if there be picture in front there be picture picture painted in oil darkened not much faded by age represented head of woman figure a far a bosom instant rosamond eye fell on shuddered hurriedly advanced toward husband with picture in hand well what have found now inquired hearing approach picture answered faintly stopping

natural complexion fading out gradually while dull equal whiteness overspreading face in stead when have come to end of third page hand in held letter dropped to side turned head slowly toward leonard in position stood tear moistening eye change passing over feature word escaping lip movement varying position of limb in position stood with fatal letter crumpled up in cold finger looking steadfastly speechlessly breathlessly at blind husband be still sitting a have seen few minute before with leg crossed hand clasped together in front of head turned expectantly in direction in have last heard sound of wife voice in few moment intense stillness in room forced upon attention changed position listened for little turning head uneasily from side to side then called to wife rosamond at sound of voice lip moved finger closed faster on paper that held neither stepped forward spoke rosamond lip moved again faint trace of expression began to pas shadow like over blank whiteness of face advanced one step hesitated looked at letter stopped hearing answer rose surprised uneasy moving poor helpless wandering hand to fro before in air walked forward few pace straight out from wall against have be sitting chair hand be not held low enough to touch stood in way a still advanced struck knee sharply against cry burst from rosamond lip a if pain of blow have passed at instant of infliction from husband to herself be by side in moment be not hurt lenny said faintly no tried to press hand on place where have struck knelt down quickly put own hand there instead nestling head against while be on knee in strangely hesitating timid way lightly laid hand have intercepted on shoulder moment touched eye began to soften tear rose in fell slowly one by one down cheek thought have left said there be such silence fancied have gone out of room will come out of with now strength seemed to fail while asked question head drooped on breast let letter fall on floor at side be tired already rosamond

be though may not confess sooner leave room better appeared not to hear last word said finger be working feverishly about neck bosom two bright red spot be beginning to burn in pale cheek eye be fixed vacantly on letter at side hand wavered about before picked up for few second waited on knee looking at intently with head turned away from husband then rose walked to fire place among dust ash other rubbish at back of grate be scattered old torn piece of paper caught eye held fixed on looked looked slowly bending down nearer nearer to grate for one moment held letter out over rubbish in hand next drew back shuddering violently turned round so a to face husband again at sight of faint inarticulate exclamation half sigh half sob burst from oh whispered to herself clasping hand together fervently looking at with fond mournful eye never never lenny come of may be speaking to rosamond yes love be saying paused with trembling finger folded up paper again exactly in form in have found where be asked voice sound away from at other end of room again where be ran to flushed trembling tearful took by arm without instant of hesitation without faintest sign of irresolution in face placed folded paper boldly in hand keep that lenny said turning deadly pale still not losing firmness keep ask to read to a soon a be out of myrtle room what be asked last thing have found love replied looking at earnestly with deep sigh of relief be of importance instead of answering suddenly caught to bosom clung to with fervor of impulsive nature breathlessly passionately covered face with kiss gently gently said leonard laughing take away breath drew back stood looking at in silence with hand laid on of shoulder oh angel murmured tenderly must give have in world if must only know how much love surely returned still laughing surely rosamond ought to know by time will know soon spoke word in tone so quiet low that be barely audible interpreting change in voice a fresh indication of fatigue leonard invited to lead away by holding out hand took in silence guided slowly to door chapter vi telling of secret on way back to inhabited side of house rosamond made further reference to subject of folded paper have placed in husband hand attention while be returning to west front seemed to be absorbed in one act of jealously watching inch of ground that leonard walked over to make sure that be safe smooth before suffered to set foot on careful considerate a have always be from first day of married life whenever led from one place to be now unduly almost absurdly anxious to preserve from remotest possibility of accident finding that be nearest to outside of open landing when left myrtle room insisted on changing place so that might be nearest to wall while be descending stair stopped in middle to inquire if felt pain in knee have struck against chair at last step brought to stand still again while moved away torn tangled remains of old mat for fear one of foot must catch in walking across north hall intreated that must take arm lean heavily upon because felt sure that knee be not quite free from stiffness yet even at short flight of stair connected entrance to hall with passage leading to west side of house twice stopped on way down to place foot on sound part of step represented a dangerously worn away in more place than one laughed good humoredly at excessive anxiety to save from danger of stumbling asked if there be likelihood with numerous stoppage of getting back to west side of house in time for lunch be not ready a usual with retort laugh found pleasant echo in hers only answered that be impossible to be too anxious about then went on in silence till reached door of housekeeper room leaving for moment outside went in to give key back again to mr pentreath dear ma'be exclaimed housekeeper look quite overcome by heat of day close air of old room can get glass of water may give bottle of salt rosamond declined offer may be allowed to ask ma'be if thing have be found time in north room inquired mr pentreath hanging up bunch of key only old paper replied rosamond turning away beg pardon again ma'be pursued housekeeper in case of gentry

housekeeper room now led up west staircase library door happening to stand open passed through on way to drawing room be larger cooler apartment of two having guided leonard to seat rosamond returned to library took from table tray containing bottle of water tumbler have noticed when passed through may feel faint a well a frightened said quickly to herself turning round with tray in hand to return to drawing room after have put water down on table in corner noiselessly locked door leading into library then door leading into passage leonard hearing moving about advised to keep quiet on sofa patted gently on cheek be about to make suitable answer when accidentally beheld face reflected in looking glass under be sitting sight of own white cheek startled eye suspended word on lip hastened away to window to catch breath of air might be wafted toward from sea heat mist still hid horizon nearer oily colorless surface of water be just visible heaving slowly from time to time in one vast monotonous wave rolled out smoothly endlessly till be lost in white obscurity of mist close on shore noisy surf be hushed sound came from beach except at long wearily long interval when quick thump still splash just audible more announced fall of one tiny mimic wave upon parching sand on terrace in front of house changeless hum of summer insect be that told of life movement not human figure be to be seen where on shore sign of sail loomed through heat at sea breath of air waved light tendril of creeper twined up house wall refreshed drooping flower ranged in window rosamond turned away from outer prospect after moment weary contemplation of a looked into room again husband spoke to what precious thing lie hidden in paper asked producing letter smiling a opened surely there must be something besides writing inestimable powder bank note of fabulous value wrapped up in fold rosamond heart sank within a opened letter passed finger over writing inside with mock expression of anxiety light jest about sharing treasure discovered at porthgenna with wife will read to directly lenny said dropping into nearest seat languidly pushing hair back from temple put away for few minute now let talk of thing else like doe not remind of myrtle room be very capricious be not to be so suddenly weary of very subject have be fondest of talking about for so many week past tell love added rising abruptly going to back of chair do get worse with whim fancy fault be improved since time when be first married tossed letter aside carelessly on table be always placed by arm of chair shook forefinger at with frown of comic reproof oh fie rosamond be trying to entrap into paying compliment light tone that persisted in adopting seemed absolutely to terrify shrank away from chair sat down again at little distance from remember used to offend continued quickly confusedly not to offend only to vex little by talking too familiarly to servant might almost have fancied at first if have not known so well that be habit with because have once be servant myself suppose have be servant servant who have helped to nurse in illness servant who led about in blindness more carefully than one else must have thought much then of difference between must stopped smile have vanished from leonard face have turned little away from what be use rosamond of supposing event never must have happened asked rather impatiently went to side table poured out of water have brought from library drank eagerly then walked to window plucked few of flower be placed there threw of away again next moment kept rest in hand thoughtfully arranging so a to contrast color with best effect when be done put into bosom looked down absently at took out again returning to husband placed little nosegay in button hole of coat something to make look gay bright love a always wish to see said seating in favorite attitude at foot looking up at sadly with arm resting on knee what be thinking about rosamond asked after interval of silence be wondering lenny whether woman in world must be a fond of a be feel almost afraid that there be others who must ask nothing better than to live die for a well a there be something in face in voice in way something besides interest of sad sad affliction must draw woman heart to think if be to die if be to die started a repeated word after leaning forward anxiously laid hand upon forehead be thinking talking very strangely morning rosamond be not well rose on knee looked closer at face brightening little faint smile just playing round lip wonder if will always be a anxious about a fond of a be now whispered kissing hand a removed from forehead leaned back again in chair told jestingly not to look too far into future word lightly a be spoken struck deep into heart there be time lenny said when one happiness in present depends upon one certainty of future looked at letter husband have left open on table near a spoke after momentary struggle with took in hand to read at first word voice failed deadly paleness overspread face again threw letter back on table walked away to other end of room future asked leonard what future rosamond can possibly mean

rosamond a door closed wanted to tell thing lenny why did stop love be that very simplicity admire admire too that make cautious at first sound of voice felt a warmly toward a do more heard talk more convinced became that must be rash to trust at first for fear of disclosing too abruptly to mother that know secret chance of winning confidence obtaining interview with depends can see upon own tact in dealing with exaggerated suspicion nervous fear good old man with best kindest intention in world might ruin thing will have done that can hope for that can wish if only succeeds in bringing back to truro if fails if thing happens if be really ill let wait till week be over rosamond will be time enough then to decide what will do next chapter ii waiting hoping week of expectation passed tidings from uncle joseph reached porthgenna tower on eighth day mr frankland sent messenger to truro with order to find out cabinet maker shop kept by mr buschmann to inquire of person left in charge there whether have received news from master messenger returned in afternoon brought word that mr buschmann have written one short note to shopman since departure announcing that have arrived safely toward nightfall in london that have met with hospitable welcome from countryman german baker that have discovered niece address have be prevented from seeing by obstacle hoped must be removed at next visit since delivery of note further communication have be received from nothing therefore be known of period at might be expected to return one fragment of intelligence thus obtained be not of nature to relieve depression of spirit doubt suspense of past week have produced in mr frankland husband endeavored to combat oppression of mind from be suffering by reminding that ominous silence of uncle joseph might be just a probably occasioned by niece unwillingness a by inability to return with to truro remembering obstacle at old man letter hinted taking also into consideration excessive sensitiveness unreasoning timidity declared to be quite possible that mr frankland message instead of re assuring might only inspire with fresh apprehension might consequently strengthen resolution to keep out of reach of communication from porthgenna tower rosamond listened patiently while view of case be placed before acknowledged that reasonableness of be beyond dispute readiness in admitting that husband might be right that might be wrong be accompanied by change for better in condition of spirit interpretation old man have placed upon alteration for worse in mr jazeph handwriting have produced vivid impression on mind have be strengthened by own recollection of mother pale worn face when met a stranger at west winston reason therefore a convincingly a might mr frankland be unable to shake wife conviction that obstacle mentioned in uncle joseph letter silence have maintained since be referable alike to illness of niece return of messenger from truro suggested besides topic of discussion question of much greater importance after having waited one day beyond week have be appointed be proper course of action for mr mr frankland now to adopt in absence of information from london from truro to decide future proceeding leonard first idea be to write immediately to uncle joseph at address have given on occasion of visit to porthgenna tower when project be communicated to rosamond opposed on ground that necessary delay before answer to letter must arrive must involve serious waste of time when might for aught knew to contrary be of last importance to not to risk loss of single day if illness prevented mr jazeph from traveling must be necessary to see at once because illness might increase if be only suspicious of motif be equally important to open personal communication with before must find opportunity of raising fresh obstacle of concealing again in place of refuge uncle joseph might not be able to trace truth of conclusion be obvious leonard hesitated to adopt because involved necessity of journey to london if went there without wife blindness placed at mercy of stranger servant in conducting investigation of most delicate most private nature if rosamond accompanied must be necessary to risk kind of delay inconvenience by taking child with on long wearisome journey of more than two hundred fifty mile rosamond met difficulty with usual directness decision idea of husband traveling where under circumstance in helpless dependent state without having to attend on dismissed at once a too preposterous for consideration second objection of subjecting child to chance fatigue of long journey met by proposing that must travel to exeter at own time in own conveyance that must afterward insure plenty of comfort plenty of room by taking carriage to when reached railroad at exeter after thus smoothing away difficulty seemed to set in opposition to journey again reverted to absolute necessity of undertaking reminded leonard of serious interest that have in immediately obtaining mr jazeph testimony to genuineness of letter have be found in myrtle room a well a in ascertaining detail of extraordinary fraud have be practiced by mr treverton on husband pleaded also own natural anxiety to make atonement in power for pain must have unconsciously inflicted in bedroom at west winston on person of others whose failing sorrow be most bound to respect having thus stated motif urged husband to lose time in communicating personally with mr jazeph again drew inevitable conclusion that there be alternative in position in be now placed to start forthwith on journey to london little further consideration satisfied leonard that emergency be of such nature a to render attempt to meet by half measure impossible felt that own conviction agreed with wife resolved accordingly to act at once without further indecision further delay before evening be over servant at porthgenna be amazed by receiving direction to pack trunk for traveling to order horse at post town for early hour next morning on first day of journey traveler started a soon a carriage be ready rested on road toward noon remained for night at liskeard on second day arrived at exeter slept there on third day reached london by railway between six seven o'clock in evening when be comfortably settled for night at hotel when hour rest quiet have enabled to recover little after fatigue of journey rosamond wrote two note under husband direction first be addressed to mr buschmann simply informed of arrival of earnest desire to see at hotel a early a possible next morning concluded by cautioning to wait until have seen before announced presence in london to second note be addressed to family solicitor mr nixon same gentleman who more than year since have written at mr frankland request letter informed andrew treverton of brother decease of circumstance under captain have died that rosamond now wrote in husband name own to ask of mr nixon be that must endeavor to call at hotel on way to business next morning to give opinion on private matter of great importance have obliged to undertake journey from porthgenna to london note note to uncle joseph be sent to respective address by messenger on evening when be written first visitor who arrived next morning be solicitor clear headed fluent polite old gentleman who have known captain treverton father before came to hotel fully expecting to be consulted on difficulty connected with porthgenna estate local agent be perhaps unable to settle might be of too confused intricate nature to be easily expressed in writing when heard what emergency really be when letter have be found in myrtle room be placed in hand be not too much to say that for first time in course of long life varied practice among sort condition of client sheer astonishment utterly paralyzed mr nixon faculty bereft for moment of power of uttering single word when however mr frankland proceeded from making disclosure to announcing resolution to give up purchase money of porthgenna tower if genuineness of letter must be proved to own satisfaction old lawyer recovered use of tongue immediately protested against client intention with sincere warmth of man who thoroughly understood advantage of being rich who knew what be to gain to lose fortune of forty thousand pound leonard listened with patient attention while mr nixon argued from professional point of view against regarding letter taken by a genuine document against accepting mr jazeph evidence taken with a decisive on subject of mr frankland real parentage expatiated on improbability of mr treverton alleged fraud upon husband having be committed without other person besides maid being in secret declared to be in accordance with received experience of human nature one more of other person must have spoken of secret from malice from want of caution that consequent exposure of truth must in course of so long period a twenty two year have come to knowledge of among many people in west of england a well a in london who knew treverton family personally by reputation from objection passed to admitted possible genuineness of letter a written document pleaded probability of having be produced under influence of mental delusion on mr treverton part maid might have have interest in humoring at time though might have hesitated after mistress death at risking possible consequence of attempting to profit by imposture having stated theory a one not only explained writing of letter hiding of also mr nixon further observed in reference to mr jazeph that evidence might give be of little value in legal point of view from difficulty might say impossibility of satisfactorily identifying infant mentioned in letter with lady whom have now honor of addressing a mr frankland whom unsubstantiated document in existence must induce to believe to be other than daughter of old friend client captain treverton having heard lawyer objection to end leonard admitted ingenuity acknowledged at same time that have produced alteration in impression on subject of letter in conviction a to course of duty felt bound to follow must wait said for mr jazeph testimony before acted decisively if testimony be of such nature be given in such manner a to satisfy that wife have moral right to fortune that possessed must restore at once to person who have mr andrew treverton finding that fresh argument suggestion must shake mr frankland resolution that separate appeal to rosamond have slightest effect in stimulating to use influence for purpose of inducing husband to alter determination feeling convinced moreover from that heard that mr frankland must if be opposed by many more objection employ professional

believed that must exercise instead of soothing seemed to excite alarm afresh among host of minute inquiry about mr frankland look about manner toward about exact word have spoken of be able to answer

friendly re assuring language of mr frankland message after making inquiry talking little while on indifferent matter doctor have privately taken aside have informed that pain over region of heart difficulty in breathing be symptom of niece complained be more serious in nature than person uninstructed in medical matter might be disposed to think have begged to give more message from one unless

than have just be relating with own lip except that also communicated a proof distance have not diminished fear tormented niece mind explanation have given to of concealment of name of choice of abode among stranger when have friend in london to whom might have gone explanation be perhaps needle to have lengthened letter by repeating for only involved saying over again in substance what have already said in speaking of motive have forced sarah to part from at truro with last word such a sad simple story of old man came to end after waiting little to recover self possession to steady voice rosamond touched husband to draw attention to herself whispered to may say now that wished to say at porthgenna answered if can trust rosamond be fittest that must hear from lip after first natural burst of astonishment be over effect of disclosure of secret on uncle joseph exhibited most striking contrast can be imagined to effect of on mr nixon shadow of doubt darkened old man face not word of objection dropped from lip one emotion excited in be simple unreflecting unalloyed delight sprang to foot with natural activity eye sparkled again with natural brightness one moment clapped hand like child next caught up hat entreated rosamond to let lead at once to niece bedside if will only tell sarah what have just told cried hurrying across room to open door will give back courage will raise up from bed will cure before day be out warning word from mr frankland stopped on sudden brought back silent attentive to chair that have left moment before think little of what doctor told said leonard sudden surprise have made so happy might do fatal mischief to niece before take responsibility of speaking to on subject be sure to agitate violently however careful may be in introducing ought first think for safety sake to apply to doctor for advice rosamond warmly seconded husband suggestion with characteristic impatience of delay proposed that must find out medical man immediately uncle joseph announced little unwillingly a seemed in answer to inquiry that knew place of doctor residence that be generally to be found at home before one o'clock in afternoon be then just half past twelve rosamond with husband approval rang bell at once to send for cab be about to leave room to put on bonnet after giving necessary order when old man stopped by asking with appearance of hesitation confusion if be considered necessary that must go to doctor with mr mr frankland adding before question must be answered that must greatly prefer if there be objection to on part being left to wait at hotel to receive instruction might wish to give on return leonard immediately complied with request without inquiring into reason for making rosamond curiosity be aroused asked why preferred remaining by at hotel to going with to doctor like not said old man when speaks about sarah look talk a if thought must never get up from bed again answering in brief word walked away uneasily to window a if desired to say more residence of doctor be at little distance mr mr frankland arrived there before one o'clock found at home be young man with mild grave face quiet subdued manner daily contact with suffering sorrow have perhaps prematurely steadied saddened character merely introducing husband to a person who be deeply interested in patient at lodging house rosamond left to leonard to ask first question relating to condition of mother health doctor answer be ominously prefaced by few polite word be evidently intended to prepare hearer for le hopeful report than might have come there expecting to receive carefully divesting subject of professional technicality told that patient be undoubtedly affected with serious disease of heart exact nature of disease candidly acknowledged to be matter of doubt various medical men might decide in various way according to opinion have formed from symptom believed that patient malady be connected with artery conveys blood directly from heart through system having found singularly unwilling to answer question relating to nature of past life must only guess that disease be of long standing that be originally produced by great mental shock followed by long wearing anxiety of face showed palpable trace that have be seriously aggravated by fatigue of journey to london acknowledged have undertaken at time when great nervous exhaustion rendered totally unfit to travel speaking according to view of case be painful duty to tell friend that violent emotion must unquestionably put life in danger at same time if mental uneasiness from be now suffering must be removed if must be placed in quiet comfortable country home among people who must be unremittingly careful in keeping composed in suffering to want for nothing there be reason to hope that progress of disease might be arrested that life might be spared for year to come rosamond heart bounded at picture of future fancy drew from suggestion lay hidden in doctor last word can command advantage have mentioned more if more be required interposed eagerly before husband must speak again oh sir if rest among kind friend be that poor weary heart want thank god can give can give said leonard continuing sentence for wife if doctor will sanction making communication to patient be of nature to relieve of anxiety be necessary to add be at present quite unprepared to receive may ask said doctor who be to be intrusted with responsibility of making communication mention there be two person who must be intrusted with answered leonard one be old man whom have seen by patient bedside other be wife in case rejoined doctor looking at rosamond there can be doubt that lady be fittest person to undertake duty paused reflected for moment then added may inquire however before venture on guiding decision one way other whether lady be a familiarly known to patient be on same intimate term with a old man be afraid must answer to question replied leonard ought perhaps to tell at same time that patient belief wife to be now in cornwall first appearance in sick room must fear cause great surprise to sufferer possibly little alarm a well under circumstance said doctor risk of trusting old man simple a be seems to be infinitely least risk of two for plain reason that presence can cause surprise however unskillfully may break news will have great advantage over lady of not appearing unexpectedly at bedside if hazardous experiment must be tried assume that must from what have said have choice think to trust with proper caution instruction to old man to carry out after arriving at conclusion there be more to be said on side interview terminated rosamond husband hastened back to give uncle joseph instruction at hotel a approached door of sitting room be surprised by hearing sound of music inside on entering found old man crouched upon stool listening to shabby little musical box be placed on table close by be
