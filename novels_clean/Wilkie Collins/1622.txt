have become broken why have major fitz david face changed when found that have discovered remains of shattered work of art in cabinet drawer remains left serious question unanswered remains told absolutely nothing yet if own observation of major be to be trusted way to clew of be in search lay directly indirectly through broken vase be useless to pursue question knowing more than knew now returned to book case thus far have assumed without sufficient reason that clew of be in search must necessarily reveal through written paper of sort now occurred to after movement have detected on part of major that clew might quite a probably present in form of book looked along lower row of shelf standing just near enough to to read title on back of volume saw voltaire in red morocco shakespeare in blue walter scott in green history of england in brown annual register in yellow calf there paused wearied discouraged already by long row of volume how thought to myself be to examine book what be to look for even if do examine major fitz david have spoken of terrible misfortune have darkened husband past life in what possible way must trace of misfortune suggestive hint of something resembling exist in archive of annual register in page of voltaire bare idea of such thing seemed absurd mere attempt to make serious examination in direction be surely wanton waste of time yet major have certainly stolen look at book case again broken vase have once stood on book case did circumstance justify in connecting vase book case a twin landmark on way led to discovery question be not easy one to decide on spur of moment looked up at higher shelf here collection of book exhibited greater variety volume be smaller be not so carefully arranged a on lower shelf be bound in be only protected by paper cover one two have fallen lay flat on shelf here there saw empty space from book have be removed not replaced in short there be discouraging uniformity in higher region of book case untidy top shelf looked suggestive of lucky accident might unexpectedly lead way to success decided if did examine book case at to begin at top where be library ladder have left against partition

present frame of mind observed languidly that be most of portrait of lady fair idol doubt of major facile adoration cared to notice no more business in room be certain of now began ended with book case left seat to fetch library ladder determining to begin work of investigation on top shelf on way to ladder passed one of table saw key lying on major fitz david have left at disposal smaller of two key instantly reminded of cupboard under bookcase have strangely overlooked vague distrust of locked door vague doubt of what might be hiding from stole into mind left ladder in place against wall set to examine content of cupboard first cupboard be three in number a opened first of singing upstairs ceased for moment there be something almost oppressive in sudden change from noise to silence suppose nerve must have be overwrought next sound in house nothing more remarkable than creaking of man boot descending stair made shudder over man be doubt singing master going away after giving lesson heard house door close on started at familiar sound a if be something terrible have never heard before then there be silence again roused a well a must began examination of first cupboard be divided into two compartment top compartment contained nothing box of cigar ranged in row one on under compartment be devoted to collection of shell be huddled together anyhow major evidently setting far higher value on cigar than on shell searched lower compartment carefully for object interesting to might be hidden in nothing be to be found in part of besides shell a opened second cupboard struck that light be beginning to fail looked at window be hardly evening yet darkening of light be produced by gathering cloud rain drop pattered against glass autumn wind whistled mournfully in corner of courtyard mended fire before renewed search nerve be in fault again suppose shivered when went back to book case hand trembled wondered what be matter with second cupboard revealed in upper division of really beautiful cameo not mounted laid on cotton wool in neat cardboard tray in one corner half hidden under one of tray there peeped out whit e leaf of little manuscript pounced on eagerly only to meet with new disappointment manuscript proved to be descriptive catalogue of cameo nothing more turning to lower division of cupboard found more costly curiosity in shape of ivory carving from japan specimen of rare silk from china began to feel weary of disinterring major treasure longer searched farther seemed to remove from one object have at heart to attain after closing door of second cupboard almost doubted whether must be worth while to proceed farther open third last door little reflection convinced that must be a well now that have begun examination of lower region of book case to go on with to end opened last cupboard on upper shelf there appeared in solitary grandeur one object only gorgeously bound book be of larger size than usual judging of by comparison with dimension of modern volume binding be of blue velvet with clasp of silver worked in beautiful arabesque pattern with lock of same precious metal to protect book from prying eye when took up found that lock be not closed have right to take advantage of accident open book have put question since to of friend of sex woman agree be perfectly justified considering serious interest have at stake in taking advantage of book in major house men differ from view declare ought to have put back volume in blue velvet unopened carefully guarding from after temptation to look at again by locking cupboard door dare say men be right being woman however opened book without moment hesitation leaf be of finest vellum with tastefully designed illumination round what did highly ornamental page contain to unutterable amazement disgust contained lock of hair let neatly into center of page with inscription beneath proved to be love token from various lady who have touched major susceptible heart at different period of life inscription be written in other language besides english appeared to be equally devoted to same curious purpose namely to reminding major of date at

looking at put down book disgusted with creature who have assisted in filling then took up again by afterthought thus far have thoroughly searched everything have presented to notice agreeable not agreeable be plainly of serious importance to own interest to go on a have begun thoroughly to search book turned over page until came to first blank leaf seeing that be blank leaf from place to end lifted volume by back a last measure of precaution shook so a to dislodge loose paper card might have escaped notice between leaf time patience be rewarded by discovery indescribably irritated distressed small photograph mounted on card fell out of book first glance showed that represented portrait of two person one of person recognized a husband other person be woman face be entirely unknown to be not young picture represented seated on chair with husband standing behind bending over holding one of hand in woman face be hard featured ugly with marking line of strong passion

one of two vas vase have be broken be change have noticed in major fitz david face produced by past association in connection with in way affected might might not be so be little disposed to indulge in speculation on topic while far more serious question of initial confronted on back of photograph s e m last two letter might stand for initial of husband name true name eustace macallan in case first letter s in probability indicated name what right have to associate with in manner considered little memory exerted suddenly called to mind that eustace have sister have spoken of more than once in time before marriage have be mad enough to torture with jealousy of husband sister might well be so s might stand for sister christian name felt heartily ashamed of a new view of matter dawned on what wrong have done to in thought turned photograph sadly penitently to examine portrait again with kinder truer appreciation of naturally looked now for family likeness between two face there be family likeness on contrary be a unlike other in form expression a face must be be sister after looked at hand a represented in portrait right hand be clasped by eustace left hand lay on lap on third

explanation direction took liberty of knocking at door of mr dexter room from lip first heard startling news doctor have refused to give usual certificate of death there be to be medical examination of body next morning there examination of nurse christina ormsay came to end ignorant a be of law must see what impression evidence so far be intended to produce on mind of jury after first showing that husband have have two opportunity of administering poison once in medicine once in tea counsel for crown led jury to infer that prisoner have taken opportunity to rid of ugly jealous wife whose detestable temper must no longer endure having directed examination to attainment of object lord advocate have done with witness dean of faculty acting in prisoner interest then rose to bring out favorable side of wife character by cross examining nurse if succeeded in attempt jury might reconsider conclusion that wife be person who have exasperated husband beyond endurance in case where so far be husband motive for poisoning where be presumption of prisoner guilt pressed by skillful lawyer nurse be obliged to exhibit husband first wife under entirely new aspect here be substance of what dean of faculty extracted from christina ormsay persist in declaring that mr macallan have most violent temper be certainly in habit of making amends for offense that gave by violence when be quiet

neighborhood then a to mr beauly though be certainly jealous of beautiful young widow have shown at same time that be capable of controlling that feeling be through mr macallan mr be in house mr beauly have wished to postpone visit on account of state of mr macallan health be mr macallan not husband who decided that mr beauly must not be disappointed must pay visit to gleninch then there further mr macallan in spite of temper be popular with friend popular with servant there be hardly dry eye in house when be known be dying further still in little domestic disagreement at nurse have be present mr macallan have never lost temper have never used harsh language seemed to be more sorry than angry when quarrel took place moral for jury be sort of woman who must exasperate man into poisoning be sort of man who must be capable of poisoning wife having produced salutary counter impression dean of faculty sat down medical witness be called next here evidence be simply irresistible dr jerome mr gale positively swore that symptom of illness be symptom of poisoning by arsenic surgeon who have performed post mortem examination followed positively swore that appearance of internal organ proved doctor jerome mr gale to be right in declaring that patient have died poisoned lastly to complete overwhelming testimony two analytical chemist actually produced in court arsenic have found in body in quantity admittedly sufficient to have killed two person instead of one in face of such evidence a cross examination be mere form first question raised by trial did woman die poisoned

informed crippled gentleman quite respectfully that must not allow to be in room at time appeared to think nothing of what said only answered bey name be dexter be one of mr macallan old friend be who be intruding here not ' again notified to that must leave room pointed out particularly that have got chair in position against bedside table a to prevent from examining only laughed see for yourselves said 'that be table nothing more ' in reply to warned that be acting under legal warrant that might get into trouble if obstructed in execution of duty finding there be moving by fair mean took chair pulled away while robert lorrie laid hold of table carried to other end of room crippled gentleman flew into furious rage with for presuming to touch chair chair be ' said dare lay hand on

be made at gleninch next inquiry took to edinburgh to druggist whose label have found on crumpled morsel of paper to other druggist likewise whom be instructed to question on twenty eighth of october fiscal be in possession of information that must collect duty for time being came to end concluded evidence of schoolcraft lorrie be not shaken on cross examination be plainly unfavorable to prisoner matter grew worse still when next witness be called druggist whose label have be found on crumpled bit of paper now appeared on stand to make position of unhappy husband more critical than ever andrew kinlay druggist of edinburgh deposed a follows keep special registry book of poison sold by produce book on date therein mentioned prisoner at bar mr eustace macallan came into shop said that wished to purchase arsenic asked what be wanted for told be wanted by gardener to be used in solution for killing of insect in greenhouse at same time mentioned name mr macallan of gleninch at once directed

be rule in shop that one sell poison asked prisoner what wanted arsenic for answered that wanted for killing rat at house called gleninch said honor of speaking to mr macallan of gleninch ' said that be name sold arsenic about ounce half labeled bottle in put with word 'poison ' in own handwriting signed register took arsenic away with after paying for cross examination of two men succeeded in asserting certain technical objection to evidence terrible fact that husband have actually purchased arsenic in case remained unshaken next witness gardener cook at gleninch wound chain of hostile evidence around prisoner more mercilessly still on examination gardener said on oath never received arsenic from prisoner from one else at date to refer of at other date never used such thing a solution of arsenic ever allowed men working under to use in conservatory in garden at gleninch disapprove of arsenic a mean of destroying noxious insect infesting flower plant cook being called next spoke a positively a gardener master other person gave arsenic to destroy rat at time such thing be wanted declare on oath that never saw rat in about house ever heard of rat infesting other household servant at gleninch gave similar evidence nothing must be extracted from on cross examination except there might have be rat in house though be not aware of possession of poison be traced directly to husband to one else that have bought be actually proved that have kept be one conclusion that evidence justified witness who came next did best to press charge against prisoner home to having arsenic in possession what have done with evidence led jury to infer what have done with prisoner valet deposed that master have rung for at twenty minute to ten on morning of day on mistress died have ordered cup of tea for man have received order at open door of mr macallan room must positively swear that other person master be there at time under housemaid appearing next said that have made tea

what mr macallan have said to on day when lady be first taken ill have said speaking to nurse at six o'clock in morning mr macallan came in about hour since found still sleepless gave composing draught be at five o'clock in morning while christina ormsay be asleep on sofa nurse further swore that have looked at bottle containing composing mixture have seen by measuring mark on bottle that dose have be poured out since dose previously given administered by herself on occasion special interest be excited by cross examination closing question put to under housemaid nurse revealed for first time what nature of defense be to be cross examining under housemaid dean of faculty said did ever notice when be setting mr eustace macallan room to right whether water left in basin be of blackish bluish color witness answered never noticed anything of sort dean of faculty went on did ever find under pillow of bed in other hiding place in mr macallan room book pamphlet telling of remedy used for improving bad complexion witness answered dean of faculty persisted did ever hear mr macallan speak of arsenic taken a wash taken a medicine a good thing to improve complexion witness answered never similar question be next put to nurse be answered by witness also in negative here then in spite of negative answer be plan of defense made dimly visible for first time to jury to audience by way of preventing possibility of mistake in so serious matter chief judge lord justice clerk put plain question when witness have retired to counsel for defense court jury said lordship wish distinctly to understand object of cross examination of housemaid nurse be theory of defense mr eustace macallan used arsenic husband purchased for purpose of improving defect of complexion dean of faculty answered be what say lord what propose to prove a foundation of defense can not dispute medical evidence declares that mr macallan died poisoned assert that died of overdose of arsenic ignorantly taken in privacy of own room a remedy for defect proved admitted defect of complexion prisoner declaration before sheriff expressly set forth that purchased arsenic at request of wife lord justice clerk inquired upon if there be objection on part of of learned counsel to have declaration read in court before trial proceeded further to dean of faculty replied that must be glad to have declaration read if might use expression must usefully pave way in mind of jury for defense have to submit to lord advocate speaking on other side be happy to be able to accommodate learned brother in matter so long a mere assertion declaration contained be not supported by proof looked upon document a evidence for prosecution too be quite willing to have read thereupon prisoner declaration of innocence on being char ged before sheriff with murder of wife be read in following term bought two packet of arsenic on occasion at wife own request on first occasion told poison be wanted by gardener for use in conservatory on second occasion said be required by cook for ridding lower part of house of rat handed packet of arsenic to wife immediately on return home have nothing to do with poison after buying wife be person who gave order to gardener cook not never held communication with of asked wife question about use of arsenic feeling interest in subject never entered conservatory for month together care little about flower a for rat left killing of to cook other servant just a must have left other part of domestic business to cook other servant wife never told wanted arsenic to improve complexion surely must be last person admitted to knowledge of such secret of toilet a implicitly believed what told viz that poison be wanted for purpose specified by gardener cook assert positively that lived on friendly term with wife allowing of course for little occasional disagreement misunderstanding of married life sense of disappointment in connection with marriage might have felt privately conceived to be duty a husband gentleman to conceal from wife be not only shocked grieved by untimely death be filled with fear have not with care behaved affectionately enough to in lifetime furthermore solemnly declare that know more of how took arsenic found in body than babe unborn be innocent even of thought of harming that unhappy woman administered composing draught exactly a found in bottle afterward gave cup of tea exactly a received from under housemaid hand never have access to arsenic after placed two package in wife possession be entirely ignorant of what did with of where kept declare before god be innocent of horrible crime with be charged with reading of true touching word proceeding on second day of trial came to end so far must own effect on of reading report be to depress spirit to lower hope whole weight of evidence at close of second day be against unhappy husband woman a be partisan a be must plainly see that merciless lord advocate confess hated have proved that eustace have bought poison that reason have given to druggist for buying poison be not true reason that have have two opportunity of secretly administering poison to wife on other side what have dean of faculty proved a yet nothing assertion in prisoner declaration of innocence be still a lord advocate have remarked assertion not supported by proof not one atom of evidence have be produced to show that be wife who have secretly used arsenic used for complexion one consolation be that reading of trial have already revealed to helpful figure of two friend on whose sympathy might surely rely crippled mr dexter have especially shown to be thorough good ally of husband heart warmed to man who have moved chair against bedside table man who have struggled to last to defend eustace paper from wretch who have seized decided then there that first person to whom must confide aspiration hope must be mr dexter if felt difficulty about advising must then apply next to agent mr playmore second good friend who have formally protested against seizure of husband paper fortified by resolution turned page read history of third day of trial chapter xviii third question what be motive first question did woman die poisoned have be answered positively second question who poisoned have be answered apparently there now remained third final question what be motive first evidence called in answer to inquiry be evidence of relative friend of dead wife lady brydehaven widow of rear admiral sir george brydehaven examined by mr drew counsel for crown with lord advocate gave evidence a follows deceased lady mr eustace macallan be niece be only child of sister lived under roof after time of mother death objected to marriage on ground be considered purely fanciful sentimental by other friend be extremely painful to to state circumstance in public be ready to make sacrifice if end of justice require prisoner at bar at time of be now speaking be staying a guest in house met with accident while be out riding caused serious injury to one of leg leg have be previously hurt while be serving with army in india circumstance tended greatly to aggravate injury received in accident be confined to recumbent position on sofa for many week together lady in house took in turn to sit with while away weary time by reading to talking to niece be foremost among volunteer nurse played admirably on piano sick man happened most unfortunately a event proved to be fond of music consequence of perfectly innocent intercourse thus begun be deplorable consequence for niece became passionately attached to mr eustace macallan without awakening corresponding affection on side did best to interfere delicately usefully while be still possible to interfere with advantage unhappily niece refused to place confidence in persistently denied that be actuated by warmer feeling toward mr macallan than feeling of friendly interest made impossible for to separate without openly acknowledging reason for doing so thus producing scandal might have affected niece reputation husband be alive at time one thing must do under circumstance be thing did requested to speak privately to mr macallan to appeal to honor to help out of difficulty without prejudice to niece mr macallan behaved admirably be still helpless made excuse for leaving be impossible to dispute in two day after husband have spoken to be removed from house remedy be well intended came too late utterly failed mischief be done niece pined away visibly medical help change of air scene did anything for in course of time after mr macallan have recovered from effect of accident found that be carrying on clandestine correspondence with by mean of maid letter be bound to say be most considerately carefully written nevertheless felt duty to stop correspondence interference what else must do interfere brought matter to crisis one day niece be missing at breakfast time next day discovered that poor infatuated creature have gone to mr macallan chamber in london have be found hidden in bedroom by bachelor friend who came to visit for disaster mr macallan be in respect to blame hearing footstep outside have only time to take measure for saving character by concealing in nearest room nearest room happened to be bedchamber matter be talked about of course motif be misinterpreted in vilest manner husband have private conversation with mr macallan again behaved admirably publicly declared that niece have visited a betrothed wife in fortnight from time silenced scandal in one way be possible married be alone in opposing marriage thought at time what have proved to be since fatal mistake must have be sad enough if mr macallan have only married without

prisoner favor next witness lady school friend of mr eustace macallan created new feeling of interest in court supplied missing link in evidence for defense first of lady declared that have mentioned arsenic a mean of improving complexion in conversation with mr eustace macallan have never used have read of practice of eating arsenic among styrian peasantry for purpose of clearing color of

already mentioned corroborated first witness in particular added that have procured book relating to arsenic eating practice of styrian peasantry result at mr eustace macallan own request book have dispatched by post to mr eustace macallan at gleninch there be one assailable point in otherwise conclusive evidence cross examination discovered both lady be asked in turn if mr eustace macallan have expressed to directly indirectly intention of obtaining arsenic with view to improvement of complexion in case answer to that important question be mr eustace macallan have heard of remedy have received book of own intention in future have not said one word have begged lady to consider conversation a strictly private there have ended required lawyer eye to discern fatal defect be now revealed in evidence for defense intelligent person present must see that prisoner chance of honorable acquittal depended on tracing poison to possession of wife at least on proving expressed intention to obtain in of case prisoner declaration of innocence must claim support of testimony however indirect might be honest intelligent men must be likely to resist be that testimony forthcoming be counsel for defense not at end of resource yet crowded audience waited in breathless expectation for appearance of next witness whisper went round among certain well instructed person that court be now to see hear prisoner old friend already often referred to in course of trial a mr dexter after brief interval of delay there be sudden commotion among audience accompanied by suppressed exclamation of curiosity surprise at same moment crier summoned new witness by extraordinary name of miserrimus dexter chapter xx end of trial calling of new witness provoked burst of laughter among audience due partly doubt to strange name by have be summoned partly also to instinctive desire of crowded assembly when interest be painfully excited to seize on relief in shape of first subject of merriment may present severe rebuke from bench restored order among audience lord justice clerk declared that must clear court if interruption to proceeding be renewed during silence followed announcement new witness appeared gliding self propelled in chair on wheel through opening made for among crowd strange startling creature literally half of man revealed to general view coverlet have

delaying even for moment proceeding of court delivered little address with perfect grace good humor examined by dean gave evidence clearly without slightest appearance of hesitation reserve be staying at gleninch a guest in house at time of mr eustace macallan death began doctor jerome mr gale desired to see at private interview prisoner being then in state of prostration made impossible for to attend to duty a master of house at interview two doctor astonished horrified by declaring that mr eustace macallan have died poisoned left to to communicate dreadful news to husband warned that post mortem examination must be held on body if fiscal have seen old friend when communicated doctor message doubt if must have ventured to charge prisoner with murder of wife to mind charge be nothing le than outrage resisted seizure of prisoner diary letter animated by feeling now that diary have be produced agree with prisoner mother in denying that be fair evidence to bring against diary when extends beyond bare record of fact date be nothing expression of poorest weakest side in character of person who keep be in nine case out of ten more le contemptible outpouring of vanity conceit writer dare not exhibit to mortal be prisoner oldest friend solemnly declare that never knew must write downright nonsense until diary read in court kill wife treat wife with neglect cruelty venture to say from twenty year experience of that there be man in assembly who be constitutionally more incapable of crime more incapable of cruelty than man who stand at bar while be about go further still even doubt whether man capable of crime capable of cruelty must have found in heart to do evil to woman whose untimely death be subject of inquiry have heard what ignorant prejudiced nurse christina ormsay have said of deceased lady from own personal observation contradict word of mr eustace macallan granting personal defect be nevertheless one of most charming woman ever met with be highly bred in best sense of word never saw in other person so sweet smile a hers such grace beauty of movement a hers if liked music sang beautifully few professed musician have touch on piano a hers if preferred talking never yet met with man even woman be saying great deal more whom conversation must not charm to say that wife a must be first cruelly neglected then barbarously murdered by man by martyr who stand there be to tell that sun never shine at noonday that heaven be not above earth oh yes know that letter of friend show that wrote to in bitter complaint of husband conduct to remember what one of friend wisest best of say in reply own to thinking ' writes 'that sensitive nature exaggerates misinterprets neglect that experience at hand of husband ' there in one sentence be whole truth mr eustace macallan nature be imaginative self tormenting nature of poet mortal love must ever have be refined enough for trifle woman of coarser moral fiber must have passed over without notice be cause of downright agony to exquisitely sensitive temperament there be person born to be unhappy that poor lady be one of when have said have said there be one word more still to be added may be a well to remind prosecution that mr eustace macallan death be in pecuniary sense serious loss to husband have insisted on having whole of fortune settled on on relative after when married income from fortune helped to keep in splendor house ground at gleninch prisoner own resource aided even by mother jointure be quite inadequate fitly to defray expense of living at splendid country seat knowing circumstance can positively assert that wife death have deprived husband of two third of income prosecution viewing a basest cruelest of men declares that deliberately killed with pecuniary interest pointing to preservation of life be useless to ask whether noticed anything in conduct of prisoner mr beauly might justify wife jealousy never observed mr beauly with attention never encouraged prisoner in talking to about be general admirer of pretty woman so far a know in perfectly innocent way that must prefer mr beauly to wife be inconceivable to unless be out of sens never have reason to believe that be out of sens a to question of arsenic mean question of tracing poison to possession of mr eustace macallan be able to give evidence may perhaps be worthy of attention of court be present in fiscal office during examination of paper of other object discovered at gleninch dressing case belonging to deceased lady be shown to after content have be officially investigated by fiscal happen to have very sensitive sense of touch in handling lid of dressing case on inner side felt something at certain place induced to examine whole structure of lid very carefully result be discovery of private repository concealed in space between outer wood lining in repository found bottle now produce further examination of witness be suspended while hidden bottle be compared with bottle properly belonging to dressing case last be of finest cut glass of very elegant form entirely unlike bottle found in private repository be of commonest manufacture of shape ordinarily in use among chemist not drop of liquid not smallest atom of solid substance remained in smell exhaled from more unfortunately still for interest of defense label be found attached to bottle when have be discovered chemist who have sold second supply of arsenic to prisoner be recalled examined declared that bottle be exactly like bottle in have placed arsenic be however equally like hundred of other bottle in shop in absence of label on have written word poison be impossible for to identify bottle dressing case deceased lady bedroom have be vainly searched for chemist missing label on chance that might have become accidentally detached from mysterious empty bottle in instance search have be without result morally be fair conclusion that might be really bottle have contained poison legally there be not slightest proof of thus ended last effort of defense to trace arsenic purchased by prisoner to possession of wife book relating practice of styrian peasantry found in deceased lady room have be produced must book prove that have asked husband to buy arsenic for crumpled paper with grain of powder left in have be identified by chemist have be declared to contain grain of arsenic where be proof mr macallan hand have placed packet in cabinet have emptied of content direct evidence anywhere nothing conjecture renewed examination of miserrimus dexter touched on matter of general interest cross examination resolved in substance into mental trial of strength between witness lord advocate struggle terminating according to general opinion in favor of witness one question one answer only will repeat here appeared to to be of serious importance to object have in view in reading trial believe mr dexter lord advocate remarked in most ironical manner that have theory of own make death of mr eustace macallan mystery to may have own idea on subject a on other subject witness replied let ask lordship judge be here to declare theory to state fact made note of answer mr dexter idea be idea of true friend to husband of man of far more than average ability might be of inestimable value to in coming time if must prevail on to communicate may mention while be writing on subject added to first note second containing observation of own in alluding to mr beauly while be giving evidence mr dexter have spoken of so slightingly so rudely might almost say a to suggest have strong private reason for disliking perhaps for distrusting lady here again might be of vital importance to to see mr dexter to clear up if must what dignity of court have passed over without notice last witness have be now examined chair on wheel glided away with half man in be lost in distant corner of court lord advocate rose to address jury for prosecution scruple to say that never read anything so infamous a great lawyer speech be not ashamed to declare at starting that firmly believed prisoner to be guilty what right have to say anything of sort be for to decide be judge jury must like to know having begun by condemning prisoner on own authority lord advocate proceeded to pervert most innocent action of unhappy man so a to give a vile aspect a possible thus when eustace kissed poor wife forehead on death bed did to create favorable impression in mind of doctor nurse again when grief under bereavement completely overwhelmed be triumphing in secret acting part if looked into heart must see there diabolical hatred for wife infatuated passion for mr beauly in everything have said have lied in everything have done have acted like crafty heartless wretch so chief counsel for prosecution spoke of prisoner standing helpless before at bar in husband place if must have done nothing more must have thrown something at head a be tore page contained speech for prosecution out of report trampled under foot felt better too for having done at same time feel little ashamed of having revenged on harmless printed leaf now fifth day of trial opened with speech for defense ah what contrast to infamy uttered by lord advocate be grand burst of eloquence by dean of faculty speaking on husband side illustrious lawyer struck right note at starting yield to one began in pity feel for wife say martyr in case from first to last be husband poor woman may have endured that unhappy man at bar have suffered be now suffering more if have not be kindest of men most docile most devoted of husband must never have occupied present dreadful situation man of meaner harder nature must have felt suspicion of wife motif when asked to buy poison must have seen through wretchedly commonplace excuse made for wanting must have wisely cruelly said 'no ' prisoner be not that sort of man be too good to wife too innocent of evil thought toward toward one to foresee inconvenience danger to fatal compliance may expose what be result stand there branded a murderer because be too high minded too honorable to suspect wife speaking thus of husband dean be just a eloquent just a unanswerable when came to speak of wife lord advocate said have asked with bitter irony for be celebrated at scottish bar why have failed entirely to prove that prisoner placed two packet of poison in possession of wife say in answer have proved first that wife be passionately attached to husband secondly that felt bitterly defect in personal appearance especially defect in complexion thirdly that be informed of arsenic a supposed remedy for defect taken internally to men who know anything of human nature there be proof enough doe learned friend actually suppose that woman be in habit of mentioning secret artifice application by improve personal appearance be in experience of sex that woman who be eagerly bent on making attractive to man must tell that man tell anybody else who might communicate with that charm by hoped to win heart say charm of pretty complexion have be artificially acquired by perilous use of deadly poison bare idea of such thing be absurd of course nobody ever heard mr eustace macallan speak of arsenic of course nobody ever surprised in act of taking arsenic be in evidence that must not even confide intention to try poison to friend who have told of a remedy who have got book actually begged to consider brief conversation on subject a strictly private from first to last poor creature kept secret just a must have kept secret if have worn false hair if have be indebted to dentist for teeth there see husband in peril of life because woman acted like woman a wife gentleman of jury must in similar position act toward after such glorious oratory a wish have room to quote more of next last speech delivered at trial be to say charge of judge to jury be dreary reading indeed lordship first told jury that must not expect to have direct evidence of poisoning such evidence hardly ever occurred in case of poisoning must be satisfied with best circumstantial evidence quite true dare say having told jury might accept circumstantial evidence turned back again on own word warned against being too ready to trust must have evidence satisfactory convincing to own mind said in find conjecture only irresistible just inference who be to decide what be just inference what be circumstantial evidence conjecture after specimen need give further extract from summing up jury thoroughly bewildered doubt took refuge in compromise occupied hour in considering debating among in own room jury of woman must not have taken minute then returned into court gave timid trimming scotch verdict in word not proven slight applause followed among audience be instantly checked prisoner be dismissed from bar slowly retired like man in deep grief head sunk on breast not looking at one not replying when friend spoke to knew poor fellow slur that verdict left on say be innocent of crime charged against only say there be not evidence enough to convict in lame impotent conclusion proceeding ended at time there must have remained for time for chapter xxi see way in gray light of new morning closed report of husband trial for murder of first wife sense of fatigue overpowered have wish after long hour of reading thinking to lie down sleep be strange be so felt a if have slept have now just awakened new woman with new mind must now at last understand eustace desertion of to man of refinement must have be martyrdom to meet wife after have read thing published of to world in report felt that a must have felt at same time thought might have trusted to make amends to for martyrdom might have come back perhaps might yet end in coming back in meanwhile in expectation pitied forgave with whole heart one little matter only dwelt on mind disagreeably in spite of philosophy did eustace still secretly love mr beauly have extinguished that passion in to what order of beauty did lady belong be by chance least in world like one window of room looked to east drew up blind saw sun rising grandly in clear sky temptation to go out breathe fresh morning air be irresistible put on hat shawl took report of trial under arm bolt of back door be easily drawn in minute be out in benjamin pretty little garden composed strengthened by inviting solitude delicious air found courage enough to face serious question now confronted question of future have read trial have vowed to devote life to sacred object of vindicating husband innocence solitary defenseless woman stood pledged to myself to carry desperate resolution through to end how be to begin bold way of beginning be surely wise way in position a mine have good reason founded a have already mentioned on important part played by witness at trial for believing that fittest person to advise assist be miserrimus dexter might disappoint expectation have fixed on might refuse to help like uncle starkweather might think have taken leave of sens event be possible nevertheless held to resolution to try experiment if be in land of living decided that first step at starting must take to deformed

first asked if have idea of own on subject of mr eustace macallan death did understand to say that looked at suspiciously very suspiciously face cleared up again when told that question be only suggested by what have read in report of trial yes drew slip of paper out of drawer in desk dipped pen in ink considered little placed chair for close at side lawyer disappears said man resume proper place there will be professional mystery between a husband old friend mr eustace feel no common interest in see serious necessity for warning before be too late can only do so to good purpose by running risk on few men in place must venture personally professionally be going to trust though be scotchman lawyer sit here look over shoulder while make note will see what be passing in mind if see what write sat down by looked over shoulder without smallest pretense of hesitation began to write a follows poisoning at gleninch query in what position doe miserrimus dexter stand toward poisoning what doe presumably know about matter have idea be secret suspect that have betrayed that have be discovered in way inconceivable to be palpably relieved when find that be not case pen stopped question went on let advance to second visit said mr playmore when saw dexter alone tell again what did how looked when informed that be not satisfied with scotch verdict repeated what have already written in page pen went back to paper again added line hears nothing more remarkable than that person visiting who be interested in case refuse to accept verdict at macallan trial a final verdict proposes to reopen inquiry what doe do upon that exhibit symptom of panic of terror see in incomprehensible danger be frantic at one moment servile at next must will know what disturbing person really mean when be informed on point first turn pale doubt evidence of own sens next with nothing said to justify gratuitously accuses visitor of suspecting somebody query here when small sum of money be missing in household servant in general be called together to be informed of circumstance what do think of one servant in particular who speaks first who say suspect ' laid down pen again be that right asked began to see end to note be drifting instead of answering question entreated to enter into explanation be still wanting to convince own mind held up warning forefinger stopped not yet said once again be right so far quite right very well now tell what happened next mind repeating give detail one after to end mentioned detail exactly a remembered playmore returned to writing for third last time thus note ended be indirectly assured that at least be not person suspected sink back in chair draw long breath asks to be left while by under pretense that subject excites when visitor return dexter have be drinking in interval visitor resume subject not dexter visitor be convinced that mr eustace macallan died by hand of poisoner openly say so dexter sink back in chair like man fainting what be horror have got possession of be easy to understand if call guilty horror be beyond understanding if call anything else how doe leave fly from one extreme to be indescribably delighted when discovers that visitor suspicion be fixed on absent person then then only take refuge in declaration that have be of one mind with visitor in matter of suspicion from first be fact to what plain conclusion do point shut up note steadily watching face waited for to speak first understand mr playmore beg impetuously believe that mr dexter warning forefinger stopped there tell interposed what dexter said to when be so good a to confirm opinion of poor mr beauly said 'there be doubt about mr beauly poisoned ' ca do better than follow so good example with one trifling difference say too there be doubt about dexter poisoned be joking playmore never be more in earnest in life rash visit to dexter extraordinary imprudence in taking into confidence have led to astonishing result light whole machinery of law be unable to throw on poisoning case at gleninch have be accidentally let in on by lady who refuse to listen to reason who insists on having own way quite incredible nevertheless quite true impossible exclaimed what be impossible asked coolly that dexter poisoned husband first wife why be that impossible if please began to be almost enraged with mr playmore can ask question replied indignantly have told that heard speak of in term of respect affection of woman might be proud life in memory of owe friendly reception of to resemblance fancy see between figure hers have seen tear in eye have heard voice falter fail when spoke of may be falsest of men in besides be true to have not misled in one thing there be sign that never deceive woman when man be talking to of what be really near heart saw sign be a true poisoned a that did be ashamed to set opinion against yours mr playmore really can not help declare be almost angry with seemed to be pleased instead of offended by bold manner in expressed dear mr eustace have reason to be angry with in one respect entirely share view with difference go little further than do understand will understand directly describe dexter feeling for late mr eustace a happy mixture of respect affection can tell be much warmer feeling toward than have information from poor lady who honored with confidence friendship for best part of life before married mr macallan kept secret from have better keep secret too miserrimus dexter be in love with miserrimus dexter asked deformed a be seriously asked to be wife in face of cried say that poisoned do see other conclusion possible after what happened during visit to frightened into fainting fit what be afraid of tried hard to find answer to even embarked on answer without quite knowing where own word might lead mr dexter be old true friend of husband began when heard say be not satisfied with verdict might have felt alarmed might have felt alarmed at possible consequence to husband of reopening inquiry said mr playmore ironically finishing sentence for rather far fetched mr eustace not very consistent with faith in husband innocence clear mind of one mistake continued seriously may fatally mislead if persist in pursuing present course miserrimus dexter may take word for ceased to be husband friend on day when husband married first wife dexter have kept up appearance grant in public in private evidence in friend favor at trial be given with deep feeling everybody expected from nevertheless firmly believe looking under surface mr macallan have bitterer enemy living than miserrimus dexter turned cold felt that here at least be right husband have wooed won woman who have refused dexter offer of marriage be dexter man to forgive that own experience answered said bear in mind what have told mr playmore proceeded now let get on to own position in matter to interest that have at stake try to adopt point of view for moment let inquire what chance have of making further advance toward discovery of truth be one thing to be morally convinced a be that miserrimus dexter be man who ought to have be tried for murder at gleninch be thing at distance of time to lay hand on plain evidence can alone justify anything like public assertion of guilt there a see be insuperable difficulty in case unless be completely mistaken question be now narrowed to plain issue public assertion of husband innocence depends entirely on public assertion of dexter guilt how be to arrive at result there be not particle of evidence against can only convict dexter on dexter own confession be listening to be listening most unwillingly if be right thing have indeed come to terrible pas must not with respect for superior knowledge experience must not persuade that be right owned with humility really felt smiled good humoredly at rate said will admit that dexter have not freely opened mind to thus far be still keeping something from knowledge be interested in discovering admit that very good what applies to view of case applies to mine say be keeping from confession of guilt say be keeping from information may fasten guilt on other person let start from point confession information how be to get at what be now withholding from what influence can bring to bear on when see again surely might persuade certainly if persuasion fail what then do think can entrap into speaking out terrify into speaking out if will look at note mr playmore will see have already succeeded in terrifying though be only woman though did mean to do very well answered mark trick what have done once think can do again well a be determined to try experiment can do harm to know little more of dexter character temperament than know now suppose apply for information to somebody who can help started looked round room made do spoke a if person who be to help be close at elbow be alarmed said oracle be silent oracle be here unlocked one of drawer of desk produced bundle of letter picked out one when be arranging husband defense said felt difficulty about including miserrimus dexter among witness have not slightest suspicion of need hardly tell be afraid of eccentricity among even feared that excitement of appearing at trial might drive completely out of mind in emergency applied to doctor to help under pretext forget now introduced to dexter in due course of time received report here be opened letter marking certain passage in with pencil handed to read line have marked said will be quite sufficient for purpose read word summing up result of observation may give a opinion that there be undoubtedly latent insanity in case that active symptom of madness have presented a yet may think produce at trial without fear of consequence may say do sort of odd thing have mind under control of will may trust self esteem to exhibit in character of substantially intelligent witness a to future be of course not able to speak positively can only state view that will end in madness if live entertain little doubt question of when madness will show depends entirely on state of health nervous system be highly sensitive there be sign that way of life have already damaged if conquer bad habit to have alluded in earlier part of report if pas many hour of day quietly in open air may last a sane man for year to come if persist in present way of life in other word if further mischief occur to sensitive nervous system lapse into insanity must infallibly take place when mischief have reached culminating point without warning to to others whole mental structure will give way at moment notice while be acting a quietly speaking a intelligently a at best time man will drop if may use expression into madness idiocy in case when catastrophe have happened be only due to friend to add that can a believe entertain hope of cure balance once lost will be lost for life there ended mr playmore put letter back in drawer have just read opinion of one of highest living authority said doe dexter strike a likely man to give nervous system chance of recovery do see obstacle peril in way silence answered suppose go back to dexter proceeded suppose that doctor opinion exaggerates peril in case what be to do last time saw have immense advantage of taking by surprise sensitive nerve of gave way betrayed fear that aroused in can take by surprise again not be prepared for now will be on guard if encounter nothing worse will have cunning to deal with next be match at for lady clarinda must have hopelessly misled on subject of mr beauly there be answering be foolish enough to try to answer for that told truth so far a knew rejoined really saw what said saw in corridor at gleninch told truth returned mr playmore because be cunning enough to see that truth must help in irritating suspicion really believe that shared suspicion why not said be a ignorant of what mr beauly be really doing on night a be until met lady clarinda remains to be seen whether will not be a much astonished a be when tell what lady clarinda told smart reply produced effect have not anticipated to surprise mr playmore abruptly dropped further discussion on side appeared to despair of convincing owned indirectly in next word will nothing can say to asked induce to think a think in matter have not ability experience answered be sorry to say ca think a think be really determined to see miserrimus dexter again have engaged to see again waited little thought over have honored by asking for advice said earnestly advise mr eustace to break engagement go even further than entreat not to see dexter again just what mother in law have said just what benjamin major fitz david have said be against still held out wonder when look back at at own obstinacy be almost ashamed to relate that made mr playmore reply waited still looking at felt irritated by fixed look arose stood before with eye on floor arose in

of trial lonely old couple man wife have key charge of man shook head in silent sorrowful disapproval of intrusion when mr playmore ordered to open door shutter let light in on dark deserted place fire be burning in library picture gallery to preserve treasure contained from damp be not easy at first to look at cheerful blaze without fancying that inhabitant of house must surely come in warm

along have hopped in horrible way following footstep of servant disguised in mistress clothes go where might ghost of dead absent be with step by step go where might lonely horror of house have still awful voice for keep secret of poison hide mystery of death oppression of place became unendurable longed for pure sky free air companion noticed understood come said have have enough of house let look at ground in gray quiet of evening roamed about lonely garden threaded way through rank neglected shrubbery wandering here wandering there drifted into kitchen garden with one little patch still sparely cultivated by old man wife rest wilderness of weed beyond far end of garden divided from by low paling of wood there stretched patch of waste ground sheltered on three side by tree in one lost corner of ground object common enough elsewhere attracted attention here object be dust heap great size of curious situation in be placed aroused moment languid curiosity in stopped looked at dust ash at broken crockery old iron here there be torn hat there fragment of rotten old boot scattered around small attendant litter of torn paper frowzy rag what be looking at asked mr playmore at nothing more remarkable than dust heap answered in tidy england suppose must have carted away out of sight said lawyer mind in scotland a long a dust heap be far enough away not to be smelt at house besides of sifted come in usefully a manure for garden here place be deserted rubbish in consequence have not be disturbed everything at gleninch mr eustace big dust heap included be waiting for new mistress

gate at carriage be waiting on return to edinburgh mr playmore directed conversation to topic entirely unconnected with visit to gleninch saw that mind stood in need of relief most good naturedly successfully exerted to amuse be not until be close to city that touched on subject of return to london have decided yet on day when leave asked leave edinburgh replied by train of to morrow morning do still see reason to alter opinion expressed yesterday doe speedy departure mean that be afraid doe mr playmore when be older woman may be wiser woman in meantime can only trust to indulgence if still blindly blunder on in own way smiled pleasantly patted hand then changed on sudden looked at gravely attentively before opened lip again be last opportunity of speaking to before go said may speak freely a freely a please mr playmore whatever may say to will only add to grateful sense of kindness have very little to say mr eustace little begin with word of caution told yesterday that when paid last visit to miserrimus dexter went to alone do again take somebody with do think be in danger then not in ordinary sense of word only think that friend may be useful in keeping dexter audacity be one of most impudent men living within proper limit then again in case anything worth remembering acting on must fall from in talk friend may be valuable a witness in place must have witness with who must take note then be lawyer business be to make fuss about trifle let only say go with companion when next visit dexter be on guard against when talk turn on mr beauly on guard against what do mean practice dear mr eustace have given eye for little weakness of human nature be quite naturally disposed to be jealous of mr beauly be in consequence not in full possession of excellent common sense when dexter us lady a mean of blindfolding be speaking too freely certainly not be very degrading to to be jealous of mr beauly vanity suffers dreadfully when think of common sense yield to conviction dare say be right be delighted to find that agree on one point rejoined dryly despair yet of convincing in far more serious matter be still in dispute between what be more if will throw obstacle in way look to dexter to help aroused curiosity how miserrimus dexter must help in in other way be riddle beyond reading propose to repeat to dexter lady clarinda told about mr beauly went on think be likely that dexter will be overwhelmed a be overwhelmed when hears story be going to venture on prophecy say that dexter will disappoint far from showing astonishment will boldly tell that have be duped by deliberately false statement of fact invented set afloat in own guilty interest by mr beauly now tell if really try in way to renew unfounded suspicion of innocent woman will shake confidence in own opinion will entirely destroy confidence in own opinion mr playmore very good will expect to write to in case believe will be of one mind before week be out keep strictly secret said to yesterday about dexter even mention name when see thinking of a think now must a soon touch hand of hangman a hand of monster god bless good by so said farewell word at door of hotel kind genial clever oh how easily prejudiced how shockingly obstinate in holding to own opinion what opinion shuddered a thought of chapter xxxv mr playmore prophecy reached london between eight nine in evening

obliged to wait for moment to let pony chaise get by before must draw up at benjamin door chaise passed very slowly driven by rough looking man with pipe in mouth for man might have doubted whether pony be quite stranger to a thing be thought no more of matter benjamin respectable old housekeeper opened garden gate startled by bursting into devout ejaculation of gratitude at sight of master lord be praised sir cried thought must never come back anything wrong asked benjamin in own impenetrably quiet way housekeeper trembled at question answered in enigmatical word mind upset sir whether thing be wrong whether thing be right be more than can say hour ago strange man came in asked stopped a if be completely bewildered looked for moment vacantly at master suddenly addressed to asked proceeded

house for aided by pony easily solved mystery of housekeeper otherwise unintelligible narrative passing through dining room where supper table be already laid for looked through half opened library door yes there be miserrimus dexter arrayed in pink jacket fast asleep in benjamin favorite arm chair coverlet hid horrible deformity nothing be sacrificed to conventional idea of propriety in extraordinary dress must hardly wonder that poor old housekeeper trembled from head to foot when spoke of valeria said benjamin pointing to portent in chair be indian idol man have already described miserrimus dexter a possessing sensitive ear of dog now allowed that also slept light sleep of dog quietly a benjamin have spoken strange voice aroused on instant rubbed eye smiled a innocently a waking child how do do mr valeria said have have nice little sleep know how happy be to see again who be rubbed eye once more looked at benjamin not knowing what else to do in extraordinary emergency presented visitor to master of house excuse getting up sir said miserrimus dexter ca get up have leg look a if thought be occupying chair if be committing intrusion be so good a to put umbrella under give jerk will fall on hand sha be offended with will submit to tumble scolding please break heart by sending away that beautiful woman there can be very cruel sometimes sir when fit take went away when stood in sorest need of little talk with went away left to loneliness suspense be poor deformed wretch with warm heart perhaps insatiable curiosity a well insatiable curiosity have ever felt be curse bore until brain began to boil in head then sent for gardener made drive here like being here air of library soothes sight of mr valeria be balm to wounded heart have something to tell something be dying to hear if be not too tired after journey if will let tell promise to have taken away when have done dear mr benjamin look like refuge of afflicted be afflicted shake hand like good christian take in held out hand soft blue eye melted into expression of piteous entreaty completely stupefied by amazing harangue of have be made object benjamin took offered hand with air of man in dream hope see well sir said mechanically then looked around at to know what be to do next understand mr dexter whispered leave to benjamin stole last bewildered look at object in chair bowed to with instinct of politeness never failed still with air of man in dream withdrew into next room left together looked at other for first moment in silence whether unconsciously drew on inexhaustible store of indulgence woman always keep in reserve for man who owns that have need of whether resenting a did mr playmore horrible suspicion of heart be especially accessible to feeling of compassion in unhappy case can not tell only know pitied miserrimus dexter at moment a have never pitied yet that spared reproof must certainly have administered to other man who have taken liberty of establishing uninvited in benjamin house be first to speak lady clarinda have destroyed confidence in began wildly lady clarinda have done nothing of sort replied have not attempted to influence opinion be really obliged to leave london a told sighed closed eye contentedly a if have relieved of heavy weight of anxiety be merciful to said tell something more have be so miserable in absence suddenly opened eye again looked at with appearance of greatest interest be very much fatigued by traveling proceeded be hungry for news of what happened at major dinner party be cruel of to tell so when have not rested after journey only one question to night will leave rest till to morrow what did lady clarinda say about mr beauly that wanted to hear more answered what what what cried wild with impatience in moment mr playmore last prophetic word be vividly present to mind have declared in most positive manner that dexter must persist in misleading must show sign of astonishment when repeated what lady clarinda have told of mr beauly resolved to put lawyer prophecy so far a question of astonishment be concerned to sharpest attainable test said not word to miserrimus dexter in way of preface preparation burst on with news a abruptly a possible person saw in corridor be not mr beauly said be maid dressed in mistress cloak hat mr beauly be not in house at mr beauly be dancing at masked ball in edinburgh there be what maid told lady clarinda there be what lady clarinda told in absorbing interest of moment poured out word one after a fast a must pas lip miserrimus dexter completely falsified lawyer prediction shuddered under shock eye opened wide with amazement say again cried ca take in at once stun be more than contented with result triumphed in victory for once have really reason to feel satisfied with have taken christian merciful side in discussion with mr playmore have won reward must sit in same room with miserrimus dexter feel blessed conviction be not breathing same air with poisoner be not worth visit to edinburgh to have made sure of in repeating at own desire what have already said to took care to add detail made lady clarinda narrative coherent credible listened throughout with breathless attention here there repeating word after to impress more surely more deeply on mind what be to be said what be to be done asked with look of blank despair ca disbelieve from first to last strange a be sound true how must mr playmore have felt if have heard word did justice to believe that must have felt heartily ashamed of there be nothing to be said rejoined except mr beauly be innocent that have done grievous wrong agree with entirely agree with answered without instant hesitation mr beauly be innocent woman defense at trial be right defense after folded arm complacently looked perfectly satisfied to leave matter there be not of mind to own amazement now found least reasonable person of two miserrimus dexter to use popular phrase have given more than have bargained for have not only done have anticipated in way of falsifying mr playmore prediction have actually advanced beyond limit must go length of recognizing mr beauly innocence at point stopped if defense at trial be right defense farewell to hope of asserting husband innocence held to hope a held to love life speak for yourself said opinion of defense remains unchanged started knit brow a if have disappointed displeased doe that mean that be determined to go on doe be downright angry with cast customary politeness to wind absurd impossible cried contemptuously have declared that wronged innocent woman when suspected mr beauly be there one else whom can suspect be ridiculous to ask question there be alternative left to accept fact a be to stir further in matter of poisoning at gleninch be childish to dispute plain conclusion must give up may be angry with if will mr dexter anger argument will make give up controlled by effort be quiet polite again when next spoke to very well pardon for moment if absorb in own thought want to do something have not done yet what may be mr dexter be going to put into mr beauly skin to think with mr beauly mind give minute thank what did mean what new transformation of be passing before eye be there ever puzzle of man a who saw now intently pursuing new train of thought must have recognized a childish creature who have awoke so innocently have astonished benjamin by infantine nonsense talked be said said truly that there be many side to human character dexter many side be developing at rapid rate of progress that be already beyond counting lifted head fixed look of keen inquiry on have come out of mr beauly skin announced have arrived at result be two impetuous people have be little hasty in rushing at conclusion stopped said nothing be shadow of doubt of beginning to rise in mind waited listened be a fully satisfied a ever of truth of what lady clarinda told proceeded see on consideration what failed to see at time story admits of two interpretation one on surface under surface look under surface in interest say be just possible that mr beauly may have be cunning enough to forestall suspicion to set up alibi be ashamed to own did not understand what meant by last word alibi saw be not following spoke out more plainly be maid something more than mistress passive accomplice said be hand that mistress used be on way to give first dose of poison when passed in corridor did mr beauly spend night in edinburgh so a to have defense ready if suspicion fell upon shadowy doubt of became substantial doubt when heard have absolved little too readily be really trying to renew suspicion of mr beauly a mr playmore have foretold time be obliged to answer in doing so unconsciously employed one of phrase lawyer have used to during first interview with sound rather far fetched mr dexter said to relief made attempt to defend new view that have advanced be far fetched admitted when said be just possible though did claim much for idea said more for perhaps than deserved dismiss view a ridiculous what be to do next if mr beauly be not poisoner by by maid who be be innocent eustace be innocent where be other person whom can suspect have poisoned cried with eye flashing voice rising to highest note do doe anybody suspect loved adored have never be same man since death hush will trust with secret tell

advanced one step nearer to end have in view in brief interval since left edinburgh see in letter in discovery irresistible evidence that dexter must have be in secret communication with deceased lady innocent communication be certain so far a be concerned not only at time of death perhaps for week before can not disguise from from own strong persuasion that if succeed in discovering nature of communication in human likelihood prove husband innocence by discovery of truth a honest man be bound not to conceal a honest man also be equally bound to add that not even with reward in view can find in conscience to advise to risk what must risk if see miserrimus dexter again in difficult delicate matter can not will not take responsibility final decision must rest with one favor only

gleninch heard again word in mr playmore have explained to custom of dust heap in scotch country house what have benjamin mr playmore done what have benjamin mr playmore found for true interest of narrative be there to portion of eagerly turned next have proceeded methodically of course with one eye on pound shilling penny other on object in view in benjamin lawyer have found what have not met with in sympathetic mind alive to value of abstract of expense conscious of most remunerative of human virtue virtue of economy at so much week have engaged men to dig into mound to sift ash at so much week have hired tent to shelter open dust heap from wind weather at so much week have engaged service of young man personally known to benjamin who be employed in laboratory under professor of chemistry who have distinguished by skillful manipulation of paper in recent case of forgery on well known london firm armed with preparation have begun work benjamin young chemist living at gleninch

piece of paper be turned up proved to be covered with written character mr playmore arriving at gleninch a usual evening on conclusion of labor in law be consulted a to handwriting after careful examination declared that mutilated portion of sentence submitted to have be written beyond doubt by eustace macallan first wife discovery aroused enthusiasm of searcher to fever height spade sieve be from moment forbidden utensil however unpleasant task might be hand alone be used in further examination of mound first foremost necessity be to place morsel of paper in flat cardboard box prepared for purpose in order a be found night came laborer be dismissed benjamin two colleague worked on by lamplight morsel of paper be now turned up by dozen instead of by one two for while search prospered in way then morsel appeared more have be recovered must renewed hand digging yield more yet next light layer of rubbish be carefully removed grand discovery of day followed there upside down be gum

separating piece of paper of preserving in order in have adhered to other be assigned to practiced finger of chemist difficulty of task did not end here writing be a usual in letter traced on side of paper must only be preserved for purpose of reconstruction by splitting morsel into two so a artificially to make blank side on must be spread fine cement used for reuniting fragment in original form

word one fond look resolved not to take with assistance thus afforded to labor of putting together concluding half of letter dated october be trifling compared with almost insurmountable difficulty encountered in dealing with scattered wreck of preceding page chapter xlviii what else must do a soon a must dry eye compose spirit after reading wife pitiable dreadful farewell first thought be of eustace first anxiety be to prevent from ever reading what have read yes to end have come have devoted life to attainment of one object that object have gained there on table before lay triumphant vindication of husband innocence in mercy to in mercy to memory of dead wife one hope be that might never see one desire be to hide from public view looked back at strange circumstance under letter have be discovered be doing a lawyer have said yet what have done have so to speak done merest accident might have altered whole course of later event have over over again interfered to check ariel when entreated master to tell story if have not succeeded in spite of opposition miserrimus dexter last effort of memory might never have be directed to tragedy at gleninch again if have only remembered to move chair so to give benjamin signal to leave off must never have written down apparently senseless word have led to discovery of truth looking back at event in frame of mind very sight of letter sickened horrified cursed day have disinterred fragment of from foul tomb just at time when eustace have found weary way back to health strength just at time when be united again happy again when month two more might make father mother a well a husband wife frightful record of suffering sin have risen against like avenging spirit there faced on table threatening husband tranquillity nay for knew if read at present critical stage of recovery even threatening life hour struck from clock on mantelpiece be eustace time for paying morning visit in own little room might come in at moment might see letter might snatch letter out of hand in frenzy of terror loathing caught up vile sheet of paper threw into fire be fortunate thing that copy only have be sent to if original letter have be in place believe must have burned original at moment last morsel of paper have be barely consumed by flame when door opened eustace came in glanced at fire black cinder of burned paper be still floating at back of grate have seen letter brought to at breakfast table did suspect what have done said nothing stood gravely looking into fire then advanced fixed eye on suppose be very pale first word spoke be word asked if felt ill be determined not to deceive even in merest trifle be feeling little nervous eustace answered be looked at again a if expected to say something more remained silent took letter out of breast pocket of coat laid on table before just where confession have lain before destroyed have have letter too morning said valeria have secret from understood reproach husband last word conveyed made attempt to answer do wish to read be said pointing to envelope have laid on table have already said that have secret from repeated envelope be open see for what be inclosed in took out not letter printed paragraph cut from scotch newspaper read said eustace read a follows strange doings at gleninch romance in real life seems to be in course of progress at mr macallan country house private excavation be taking place if reader will pardon unsavory allusion at dust heap of place in world something have assuredly be discovered nobody know what alone be certain for week past two stranger from london superintended by respected fellow citizen mr playmore have be at work night day in library at gleninch with door locked will secret ever be revealed will throw light on mysterious shocking event reader have learned to associate with past history of gleninch perhaps when mr macallan return may be able to answer question in meantime can only await event laid newspaper slip on table in very christian frame of mind toward person concerned in producing reporter in search of news have evidently be prying about ground at gleninch busy body in neighborhood have in probability sent published paragraph to eustace entirely at loss what to do waited for husband to speak did not keep in suspense questioned instantly do understand what mean valeria answered honestly owned that understood what meant waited again a if expected to say more still kept only refuge left to refuge of silence be to know more than know now proceeded after interval be not bound to tell what be going on in own house be common remark that people if can think at think quickly in emergency there be one way out of embarrassing position in husband last word have placed instinct showed way suppose at rate took have promised to trust began admitted that have promised must ask for own sake eustace to trust for little while longer will satisfy if will only give time face darkened how much longer must wait asked saw that time have come for trying stronger form of persuasion than word kiss said before tell hesitated so like husband persisted so like wife there be choice for to yield having given kiss not over graciously insisted once more on knowing how much longer wanted to wait want to wait answered until child be born started condition took by surprise gently pressed hand gave look returned look warmly enough time to satisfy say consent whispered consented so put off day of reckoning once more so gained time to consult again with benjamin mr playmore while eustace remained with in room be composed capable of talking to when left after time to think over what have passed between to remember how kindly have given way to heart turned pityingly to other wife better woman of than be whose husband under similar circumstance must have spoken hard word to must perhaps even have acted more cruelly still contrast thus suggested between fate mine quite overcame have done to deserve happiness what have done poor soul to deserve misery nerve be overwrought dare say after reading dreadful confession of eustace first wife burst out cry be better for afterward chapter xlix past future write from memory unassisted by note diary have distinct recollection of length of residence abroad certainly extended over period of month long after eustace be strong enough to take journey to london doctor persisted in keeping in paris have shown symptom of weakness in one of lung medical adviser seeing that prospered in dry atmosphere of france warned to be careful of breathing too soon moist air of own country thus happened that be still in paris when received next news from gleninch time letter passed on side to surprise delight benjamin quietly made appearance one morning in pretty french drawing room be so preternaturally smart in dress so incomprehensibly anxious while husband be in way to make understand that reason for visiting paris be holiday reason only that at once suspected of having crossed channel in double character say a tourist in search of pleasure when third person be present a ambassador from mr playmore when have room to ourselves later in day contrived that must be left together soon found that anticipation have not misled benjamin have set out for paris at mr playmore express request to consult with a to future to enlighten a to past presented with credential in shape of little note from lawyer there be few point mr playmore wrote recovery of letter doe not seem to clear up have done best with mr benjamin assistance to find right explanation of debatable matter have treated subject for sake of brevity in form of question answer will accept a interpreter after mistake made when consulted in edinburgh event admit have proved be entirely wrong in trying to prevent from returning to dexter partially wrong in suspecting dexter of being directly instead of indirectly answerable for first mr eustace death frankly make confession leave to tell mr benjamin whether think new catechism worthy of examination not thought new catechism a called decidedly worthy of examination if ag ree with view if be dying to be done with narrative pas on to next chapter by mean benjamin produced question answer read to at request in term question suggested by letter discovered at gleninch first group question relating to diary first question obtaining access to mr macallan private journal be miserrimus dexter guided by previous knowledge of content answer be doubtful if have such knowledge probability be that noticed how carefully mr macallan secured diary from observation that inferred therefrom existence of dangerous domestic secret in locked up page that speculated on using secret for own purpose when caused false key to be made second question to what motive be to attribute miserrimus dexter interference with sheriff officer on day when seized mr macallan diary along with other paper answer in replying to question must first do justice to dexter infamously a now know to have acted man be not downright fiend that secretly hated mr macallan a successful rival in affection of woman loved that did must to induce unhappy lady to desert husband be in case fact not to be denied on other hand be fairly to be doubted whether be additionally capable of permitting friend who trusted to be tried for murder through fault without making effort to save innocent man have naturally never occurred to mr macallan being guiltless of wife death to destroy diary letter in fear that might be used against until prompt secret action of fiscal took by surprise idea of being charged with murder of wife be idea know from own statement have never even entered mind dexter must have looked at matter from point of view in last wandering word spoken when mind broke down refers to diary in term 'the diary will hang wo have hanged ' if must have found opportunity of getting at in time if sheriff officer have not be too quick for there can be reasonable doubt that dexter must have destroyed diary foreseeing consequence of production in court so strongly doe appear to have felt consideration that even resisted officer in execution of duty agitation when sent for mr playmore to interfere be witnessed by gentleman may not be amiss to add be genuine agitation beyond dispute question of second group relating to wife confession first question what prevented dexter from destroying letter when first discovered under dead woman pillow answer same motif led to resist seizure of diary to give evidence in prisoner favor at trial induced to preserve letter until verdict be known looking back once more at last word a taken down by mr benjamin may infer that if verdict have be guilty must not have hesitated to save innocent husband by producing wife confession there be degree in wickedness dexter be wicked enough to suppress letter wounded vanity by revealing a object for loathing contempt be not wicked enough deliberately to let innocent man perish on scaffold be capable of exposing rival whom hated to infamy torture of public accusation of murder in event of adverse verdict shrank before direr cruelty of letting be hanged reflect in connection on what must have suffered villain a be when first read wife confession have calculated on undermining affection for husband whither have calculation led have driven woman whom loved to last dreadful refuge of death by suicide give consideration due weight will understand that little redeeming virtue might show a result even of man remorse second question what motive influenced miserrimus dexter conduct when mr valeria macallan informed that proposed reopening inquiry into poisoning at gleninch answer in probability dexter guilty fear suggested to that might have be watched on morning when secretly entered chamber in first mr eustace lay dead feeling scruple to restrain from listening at door looking through keyhole must be more ready to suspect other people of same practice with dread in must naturally occur to mind that mr valeria might meet with person who have watched might hear that person have discovered unless led astray at outset of investigation own jealous suspicion of mr beauly offered chance of easily doing be readier to profit by chance being animated by most hostile feeling toward lady knew a enemy who destroyed domestic peace of mistress of house loved mistress of house hated enemy accordingly preservation of guilty secret persecution of mr beauly there have greater lesser motive of conduct in relation with mr eustace second note by writer of narrative look back for further illustration of point of view to scene at benjamin house chapter xxxv where dexter in moment of ungovernable agitation betrays own secret to valeria benjamin laid down note took off spectacle have not thought necessary to go further than said be there point can think of be still left unexplained reflected there be point of importance left unexplained that must remember there be one little matter suggested by recent allusion to mr beauly wished if possible to have thoroughly cleared up have mr playmore ever spoken together on subject of husband former attachment to mr beauly asked have mr playmore ever told why eustace did not marry after trial put question to mr playmore said benjamin answered easily enough being husband confidential friend adviser be consulted when mr eustace wrote to mr beauly after trial repeated substance of letter at request must like to hear what remember of in turn owned must like to hear what benjamin thereupon told exactly coincided with what miserrimus dexter have told a related in thirtieth chapter of narrative mr beauly have be witness of public degradation of husband be enough in to prevent from marrying broke off with for same reason have led to separate from existence with woman who knew that have be tried for life a murderer be existence have not resolution enough to face two account agreed in particular at last jealous curiosity be pacified benjamin be free to dismiss past from further consideration to approach more critical more interesting topic of future first inquiry related to eustace asked if husband have suspicion of proceeding have taken place at gleninch told what have happened how have contrived to put off inevitable disclosure for time old friend face cleared up a listened to will be good news for mr playmore said excellent friend lawyer be sorely afraid that discovery may compromise position with husband on one hand be naturally anxious to spare mr eustace distress must certainly feel if read first wife confession on other hand be impossible in justice a mr playmore put to unborn child of marriage to suppress document vindicates memory of father from aspersion that scotch verdict might otherwise cast on listened attentively benjamin have touched on trouble be still secretly preying on mind how doe mr playmore propose to meet difficulty asked can only meet in one way benjamin replied proposes to seal up original manuscript of letter to add to plain statement of circumstance under be discovered supported by signed attestation mine a witness to fact done must leave to to take husband into confidence at own time will then be for mr eustace to decide whether will open inclosure whether will leave with seal unbroken a heirloom to child to be made public not at discretion when be of age to think for do consent to dear must prefer that mr playmore must see husband act for in matter decided without hesitation to take responsibility on where question of guiding eustace decision be concerned considered influence to be decidedly superior to influence of mr playmore choice met with benjamin full approval arranged to write to edinburgh relieve lawyer anxiety by day post one last thing now left to be settled related to plan for returning to england doctor be authority on subject promised to consult about at next visit to eustace have anything more to say to benjamin inquired a opened writing case thought of miserrimus dexter ariel inquired if have heard news of lately old friend
