narrative with legal detail now propose to state nature of defense in briefest outline only insisted on making prisoner plead not guilty done took objection to legality of proceeding at starting appealed to old english law that there must be conviction for murder until body of murdered person be found proof of destruction obtained beyond doubt denied that sufficient proof have be obtained in case now before court judge consulted decided that trial must go on took next objection when confession be produced in evidence declared that have be extorted by terror by undue influence pointed out

more overruled objection confession be admitted in evidence on side prosecution produced one new witness in support of case be needle to waste time in recapitulating evidence contradicted gravely on cross examination showed plainly after investigation proved that be not to be believed on oath chief justice summed up charged in relation to confession that weight must be attached to confession incited by hope fear left to jury to determine whether confession in case have be so influenced in course of trial have be shown for defense that sheriff governor of prison have told ambrose with father knowledge sanction that case be clearly against that only chance of sparing family disgrace of death by public execution lay in making confession that must do best if did confess to have sentence commuted to imprisonment for life a for silas be proved to have be beside with terror when made abominable charge against brother have vainly trusted to evidence on two point to induce court
