baregrove square room have mysterious peculiarity of physiognomy a well a men there be plenty of room of much same size furnished in much same manner nevertheless differ completely in expression if such term may be allowed one from other reflecting various character of inhabitant by such fine variety of effect in furniture feature generally common to a be often like infinitesimal variety of eye nose mouth too intricately minute to be traceable now parlor of mr thorpe house be neat clean comfortably sensibly furnished be of average size have usual side board dining table looking glass scroll fender marble chimney piece with clock on carpet with drugget over wire window blind to keep people from looking in characteristic of respectable london parlor of middle class yet be inveterately severe looking room room seemed a if have never be convivial never uproarious never anything sternly comfortable serenely dull room appeared to be a unconscious of act of mercy easy unreasoning over affectionate forgiveness to offender of kind juvenile otherwise a if have be cell in newgate private torturing chamber in inquisition perhaps mr goodworth felt thus affected by parlor especially in november weather a soon a entered for although have promised to beg zack off although mr thorpe be sitting alone by table accessible to petition with book in hand old gentleman hesitated uneasily for minute two suffered daughter to speak first where be zack asked mr thorpe glancing quickly nervously round be locked up in dressing room answered husband without taking eye off book in dressing room

interrupted mr goodworth boldly plunging head foremost with petition for mercy into conversation if have allowed to proceed sir said mr thorpe who always called father in law sir must have simply remarked that after having enlarged to son in such term will observe a thought best fitted to comprehension on disgrace to parent of behavior morning set a task three verse to learn out of beelect bible text for child choosing verse seemed most likely if may trust own judgment on point to impress on what behavior ought to be for future in church flatly refused to learn what told be of course quite impossible to allow authority to be set at defiance by own child whose disobedient disposition have always god know be source of constant trouble anxiety to so locked up locked up will remain until have obeyed dear turning to wife handing key have objection if wish to going trying what can do towards overcoming obstinacy of unhappy child mr thorpe took key went up stair immediately went up

down open page on knee for place where have left off found referred back moment to last line of preceding leaf then went on with book not taking smallest notice of mr goodworth thorpe cried old gentleman plunging head foremost again into son in law reading time instead of talk may say what please notion of bringing up zack be wrong one altogether with calmest imaginable expression of face mr thorpe looked up from book first carefully putting paper knife between leaf placed on table then crossed one of leg over other rested elbow on arm of chair clasped hand in front of on wall opposite

thick book in hand upon one of portrait name of original of be stated at foot of print to be reverend aaron yollop mr thorpe now fixed eye with faint approach to smile on face never be known to laugh with look manner said a plainly a if have spoken old man be about to say something improper absurd to be wife father be duty to bear with therefore be perfectly resigned be use looking in way thorpe growled old gentleman be not to be put down by look at time of life may have own opinion suppose like other people see why must express especially when relate to own daughter boy be very unreasonable of dare say think ought to have voice now then in zack bringing up mr thorpe bowed respectfully partly to mr goodworth partly to reverend aaron yollop will always be happy sir to listen to expression of opinion opinion burst out mr goodworth have business to take zack to church at till be year older than be now deny that there may be few child here there at six year old who be so very patient so very what be word for child know deal more than have business to know at age stop have got precocious be word so very patient so very precocious that will sit quiet in same place for two hour making believe time that understand word of service whether really do not deny that there may be such child though never met with must think impudent little hypocrite if did zack be one of sort zack genuine child god bless zack do understand dear sir interposed mr thorpe sorrowfully sarcastic to be praising conduct of son in disturbing congregation obliging to take out of church nothing of sort retorted old gentleman be not praising zack conduct be blaming yours here be in plain word keep on cramming church down throat keep on puking at a if be physic because know better ca know better at age be that way to make take kindly to religious teaching know a well a do that roared like young turk at sermon pray what be subject of sermon justification by faith do mean to tell that other child at time of life must understand anything of subject a get atom of good out of ca know ca say again be use taking to church yet what be more be worse than use for only associate first idea of religious instruction with everything in way of restraint discipline punishment can be most irksome to there be opinion must like to hear what have got to say against latitudinarianism said mr thorpe looking speaking straight at portrait of reverend aaron yollop ca fob off with long word understand believe can find in johnson dictionary continued mr goodworth doggedly must do much better to take advice let zack go to church for present at mother knee let morning service be about ten minute long let wife tell out of new testament about savior goodness gentleness to little child then let teach from sermon on mount to be loving truthful forbearing forgiving for savior sake if such precept a be enforced a may be in one way by example drawn from own daily life from people around from what meet with notice asks about out of door in mark word will take kindly to religious instruction have seen that in other child have seen in own child who be brought up so of course agree with of course have got objection ready to bowl down with rationalism said mr thorpe still looking steadily at lithographed portrait of reverend aaron yollop well objection short one time at rate be blessing said old gentleman rather irritably rationalism eh understand ism rather suspect better than other mean in plain english that think be wrong in only wanting to give religious instruction same chance with zack let other kind of instruction have chance of becoming useful by being first made attractive ca get to learn to read by telling that will improve mind can by getting to look at picture book ca get to drink senna salt by reasoning with about doing good can by promising lump of sugar to take after admit sort of principle so far because be obliged moment anybody want in spirit of perfect reverence desire to do good to extend to higher thing purse up lip shake head talk about rationalism a if be answer well well be use talking go own way wash hand of business altogether now be at will just say

heart dare say by fairly tiring out tell what be afraid will make learn too if mind will make learn to dislike bible a much a other boy dislike birch rod sir cried mr thorpe turning suddenly round severely confronting goodworth once for must most respectfully insist on being spared for future open profanity in conversation even from lip regard affection for a mr thorpe father will not prevent from solemnly recording abhorrence of such awful infidelity a believe to be involved in word have just spoken religious conviction recoil stop sir said mr goodworth seriously sternly mr thorpe obeyed at once old gentleman manner be generally much more remarkable for heartiness than for dignity altered completely while now spoke a struck hand on table rose from chair there be something in look be not wise to disregard mr thorpe went on more calmly very decidedly refrain from telling what opinion be of bespect 'affection have allowed to rebuke in such term a have chosen merely desire to say that will never need second reproof of same kind at hand for will never again speak to on subject of grandson education if in consideration of assurance will now permit in turn not to rebuke to offer one word of advice must recommend not to be too ready in future lightly cruelly to accuse man of infidelity because religious opinion happen to differ on subject from yours to infer serious motive for opponent conviction however wrong may think can do harm to infer scoffing motive can do no good will say nothing more about if please let shake hand never again revive subject about disagree too widely ever to discus with advantage at moment servant came in with lunch mr goodworth poured out glass of sherry made remark on weather soon resumed cheerful everyday manner did not forget pledge

whose case be always compassionately designated a sad one whenever be brought forward in course of conversation at dinner table tea table in new suburb socially may be easily divided into two class in world at least in civilized part of if be not people whom others talk about then be sure to be people who talk about others young lady who have just entered mr blyth painting room belonged to former order of human being seemed fated to be used a constant subject of conversation by fellow creature even face alone simply a face must not escape perpetual discussion that too among valentine friend who knew well loved dearly be oddest thing in world one of must ever agree with except on certain point to be presently mentioned a to of personal attraction ought to be first selected for approval quoted a particularly asserting claim to admiration of worshipper of beauty to take three four instance of there be mr gimble civil little picture dealer very good friend in way to valentine there be mr gimble who declared that principal charm be in complexion fair clear wonderful complexion must defy artist alive to paint let try ever so hard be ever so great man then came dowager countess of brambledown frolicsome old aristocrat who be generally believed to be little cracked who haunted mr blyth studio after having once given order to paint rare china tea service favorite muff in one

in carried head perhaps shoulder perhaps head shoulder together not that opinion be good for much in tasty matter of kind for reason begged to apologize for expressing at in speaking thus of opinion worthy engraver surely depreciated most unjustly for if father of eight daughter can not succeed in learning philoprogenitively speaking to be good judge of woman what man can however there be one point on mr gimble lady brambledown mr bullivant mr blyth father host of friend besides be agreed without one discordant exception unanimously asserted that young lady face be nearest living approach have ever seen to immortal madonna face have for ever associated idea of beauty with name of raphael resemblance struck everybody alike even who be slightly conversant with picture moment saw taken in detail feature might be easily found fault with eye might be pronounced too large mouth too small nose not grecian enough for people taste general effect of feature shape of head face especially habitual expression reminded beholder at once irresistibly of image of softness purity feminine gentleness have be engraven on civilized memory by madonna of raphael be in consequence of extraordinary resemblance that own english name of mary have be from first altered italianized by mr mr blyth by intimate friend into madonna one two extremely strict extremely foolish people objected to such familiar application of name a being open in certain direction to imputation of irreverence mr blyth be not generally very quick at answer on occasion have three answer ready before objection be quite out of friend mouth in first place said that friend used name only in artist sense only with reference to raphael picture in next place produced italian dictionary showed that madonna have second meaning in language signifying simply literally lady in conclusion proved historically that madonna have be used in old time a prefix to name of italian woman quoting for example madonna pia whom happened to remember just at moment from having once painted picture from one of scene of terrible story statement silenced objection young lady be accordingly much better known in painter house a madonna than a mary on now entering studio walked up to valentine hand lightly on of shoulder so lifted to be kissed on forehead then looked down on palette observing that color be still missing from began to search for directly in painting box found in moment appealed to mr blyth with arch look of inquiry triumph nodded smiled held out palette for to put color on having done very neatly

cutting to point for last minute two took with little mock curtsey pouting lip slightly a if drawing venus be work not much to taste smiled when saw valentine shaking head frowning comically at then went away at once to drawing board sat down opposite venus in position offered a decided living contradiction a ever be seen to assertion of classical idea of beauty a expressed in cast that be about to copy mr blyth on side set to work at last on landscape painting upon dancing bacchant in foreground of picture whose scanty dress stood sadly in need of little brightening up while painter young lady be thus industriously occupied with business of studio there be leisure to remark on one rather perplexing characteristic of intercourse so far a have yet proceeded on particular winter morning ever since madonna have be in room not one word have spoken to valentine not one word have valentine who can talk glibly enough to spoken to never said good morning when kissed thank for finding lost

shown to neighbor by worthy clergyman on return now although mr blyth be not over successful in adult department of portrait art be invariably victorious in infant department painted baby on one ingenious plan giving roundest eye chubbiest red cheek most serenely good humored smile neatest whitest cap ever seen on paper if father male friend rarely appreciated fidelity of likeness mother nurse invariably made amends for want of taste followed therefore almost a matter of course that local exhibition of doctor drawing must bring offer of long clothes portrait employment to valentine three resident family decided immediately to have portrait of baby if painter must only travel to house to take likeness bachelor sporting squire in neighborhood also volunteered commission of sort gentleman arrived by logical process be hopeless to think of tracing at conclusion that man who be great at baby must necessarily be marvelous at horse determined in consequence that valentine must paint celebrated cover hack in writing to inform friend of offer doctor joyce added professional order on own account by way of appropriate conclusion to letter here then be five commission must produce enough cheaply a valentine worked to pay not only for new bookcase for book to put in when came home having left wife in charge of two of sister who be forbidden to leave house till return mr blyth started for rectory once there set to work on baby with zeal good humor straightway won heart of mother nurse made great rubbleford reputation in course of few day having done baby to admiration next undertook bachelor squire hack here have trouble sporting gentleman must look over while painted must bewilder with pedigree of horse must have animal done in most unpicturesque view sternly forbade introduction of tone light shade purely artistic embellishment of kind in part of canvas in short squire wanted sign board instead of picture at last got what wanted to heart content one evening while valentine still deeply immersed in difficulty of depicting cover hack be returning to rectory after day work at squire house attention be suddenly attracted in high street of rubbleford

clown who performed superhuman contortion made joke by yard without slightest appearance of intellectual effort still mr blyth exhibited demonstration of astonishment pleasure be only when bell rang between first second part of performance band struck up gentle zitella that showed symptom of animation then suddenly rose moving down to bench close against low partition separated ring from audience

saying that if set out to walk due north met lively young bull galloping with head down due south must not consent to save own bone yield animal space enough to run on by stepping aside single inch in lateral direction east west son requires most unremitting parental discipline control mr thorpe remarked in explanation of motif for forcing zack to adopt commercial career when be not under own eye at home must be under eye of devout friend in whom can place unlimited confidence one of devout friend be ready to receive into counting house to keep industriously occupied from nine in morning till six in evening to surround with estimable example in short to share with solemn responsibility of managing moral religious training person who ask to allow motif of awfully important nature to be modified in smallest degree by consideration connected with lad natural disposition have be source of grief to from childhood with bodily gift of flesh have hitherto only served to keep from cultivation of gift of spirit with own desire know by bitter experience to be of world worldly person say who ask to do of thing ask also to act from godless principle of expediency to violate moral rectitude by impiously compounding with vice acting on such principle of parental discipline a mr thorpe conscientiously believed that have done duty when have at last forced son into merchant office have in truth perpetrated one of most serious mistake be possible for wrong headed father to commit for once zack have not exaggerated in saying that aversion to employment in counting house amounted to absolute horror physical peculiarity habit have entailed on from boyhood made life in open air constant use of hardy thews sinew constitutional necessity felt there be self delusion in feeling that must mope pine like wild animal in cage under confinement in office only varied from morning to evening by commercial walking expedition of miserable mile two in close crowded street foreboding to say nothing of natural yearning towards adventure change of scene exhilarating bodily exertion must have be sufficient of to have decided to leave home battle way through world cared not where how so long a battled freely for one consideration reckless a be that consideration stayed foot on brink of sacred threshold dared not pas perhaps to leave behind for ever threshold of mother door strangely a expressed irregularly a influenced conduct zack love for mother be yet in own nature beautiful admirable element in character full of promise for future if father have be able to discover have be wise enough to be guided by discovery a to outward expression lad fondness for mr thorpe be wild boisterous inconsiderate unsentimental fondness noisily in harmony with thoughtless rattle pated disposition swayed by fit start influencing nobly to patience forbearance at one time abandoning to appearance at be genuine ineradicable fondness nevertheless however often heedlessness temptation might overpower still small voice in impulse spoke to conscience pleaded with heart among other unlucky result of mr thorpe conscientious imprisonment of son in merchant office be vast increase zack commercial penance produced in natural appetite for amusement dissipation of town after nine hour of most ungrateful daily labor must well have be inflicted on sight of play bill other wayside advertisement of place of public recreation appealed to on way home with irresistible fascination mr thorpe drew line of demarcation between permissible forbidden evening amusement at lecture room of royal polytechnic institution oratorio performance in exeter hall gate opening on outer side of boundary thus laid down be gate of vice gate that son of must ever be allowed to pas domestic law obliged zack to be home night at eleven o'clock forbade possession of door key be directed especially to purpose of closing up against forbidden entrance to theater public garden place of resort mr thorpe characterized in strain of devout allegory a labyrinth of national infamy be perfectly useless to suggest to father a of zack maternal relative did suggest to that son be originally descended from eve be consequently possessed of hereditary tendency to pluck at forbidden fruit that disposition age made next to certainty that if be restrained from enjoying openly amusement most attractive to must probably end in enjoying by stealth mr thorpe met argument of kind by registering usual protest against compounding with vice then drew rein of discipline tighter than ever by way of warning off intrusive hand from attempting to relax for future before long evil result predicted by opponent of father plan for preventing son from indulging in public amusement actually occurred at first zack gratified taste for drama by going to theater whenever felt inclined leaving performance early enough to get home by eleven o'clock candidly acknowledging how have occupied evening when question be asked at breakfast next morning frankness of confession be always rewarded by rebuke threat reiterated prohibition administered by mr thorpe with crushing assumption of superiority to mitigating argument entreaty excuse that son must urge often irritated zack into answering defiantly recklessly repeating offense finding that menace reproof only ended in making lad ill tempered insubordinate for day together mr thorpe so far distrusted own power of correction a to call in aid of prime clerical adviser reverend aaron yollop under whose ministry sat whose portrait in lithograph hung in best light on dining room wall at baregrove square mr be interference be at least weighty enough to produce positive immediate result drove zack to very last limit of human endurance reverend gentleman imperturbable self possession defied young rebel utmost power of irritating reply matter how vigorously might exert once vested with paternal commission to rebuke prohibit lecture a spiritual pastor master of mr thorpe disobedient son mr yollop flourished in new vocation in exact proportion to resistance offered to exercise of authority derived grim encouragement from wildest explosion of zack fury at being interfered with by man who have claim of relationship over who gloried professionally in experimenting on a finely complicated case of spiritual disease thrice did mr yollop in capacity of moral surgeon operate on patient triumph in responsive yell curative exertion elicited at fourth visit of attendance however angry symptom suddenly marvelously disappeared before first significant flourish of clerical knife mr yollop have triumphed where mr thorpe have failed case have defied lay treatment have yielded to parsonic process of cure zack rebellious be tamed at last into spending evening in decorous dullness at home never occurred to mr yollop to doubt to mr thorpe to ascertain whether young gentleman really went to bed after have retired obediently at proper hour to sleeping

that be crushed into thorough submission sight satisfied to heart content men be so short sighted a persecuting men mr thorpe coadjutor be persecutor on principle wherever encountered opposition be

inclined to look forward with malicious triumph to secret frolic of night then in evening mr thorpe often thought advisable to harangue seriously by way of not letting reformed rake relapse for want of little encouraging admonition of moral sort be mr yollop at behindhand in taking similar precaution to secure new convert permanently after having once caught word two gentleman spoke only served to harden lad afresh to deaden reproving reclaiming influence of mother affectionate look confiding word must get nothing by even if must turn over new leaf thought zack shrewdly angrily when father

forward in way before card table take madonna attention off game doubt did how must see walking about close by carrying drawing with wherever went a if prized too much to be willing to put down

peckover little mary waiting for well zack rejoined mr blyth idea of returning present only errs on side of generosity must recommend something le costly know that be one of madonna oddity not to care about jewelry might have bought bracelet long ago out of own saving if trinket have be thing to tempt wait bit mr blyth said zack have heard best of notion yet pith marrow of have got to come bracelet mean to give be one that will prize to day of death be not affectionate warm hearted girl take for what do think of bracelet reminds of valentine jolly old peck there little of too hope wo make think worse of have got design against head continued imitating cutting action of pair of scissors with two of finger raising voice in high triumph be splendid idea mean to give madonna hair bracelet mr peckover mr blyth started back in chair stared at other a amazedly a if zack last word have sprung from charged battery have struck at same moment with smart electrical shock of thing in world how came ever to think of giving ejaculated mr peckover under breath memory reverting while spoke to mournful day when stranger have searched body of madonna mother have found hair bracelet hidden away in corner of dead woman pocket hush let go on with game said valentine too be thinking of hair bracelet thinking of a now lay locked up in bureau down stair remembering how must fain have destroyed year ago that conscience sense of honor forbade pondering on fatal discovery to by bare possibility might yet lead if ever must fall into stranger hand hair bracelet continued zack quite unconscious of effect be producing on two of card player behind such hair too a mean to be made of why madonna will think more precious than diamond in world defy anybody to have hit on better idea of sort of present be sure to like be elegant appropriate sort of thing be oh yes very nice pretty indeed replied mr blyth rather absently confusedly knew a much of madonna history a husband did be wondering what must think of present young thorpe proposed giving to adopted child thing want most to know said zack be what think must be best pattern for bracelet there will be two kind of hair in can be made into shape of course hair mr peckover be not morsel of hair will go towards bracelet muttered mr peckover who be listening to what be said while went on playing difficult hair to bring in will be mine valentine pursued zack mine long enough to be sure ought to have got cut month ago be so stiff curly blyth keep cropped so short see what can do with do unless make ring star knob something stumpy in way of cross pattern of people at shop will know best said mr blyth resolving to proceed cautiously one thing be determined on though beforehand cried zack clasp clasp will be serpent with turquoise eye carbuncle tail initial scored up somehow on scale wo that be splendid must like to surprise madonna with very evening will never give to if can help grumbled mr peckover still soliloquizing under breath if anything in world can bring ill luck will be hair bracelet last word be spoken with perfect seriousness for be result of strongest superstitious conviction from time when hair bracelet be found on madonna mother mr peckover have persuaded not unnaturally in absence of information to contrary that have be in way connected with ruin shame have driven unhappy possessor forth a outcast to die amongst stranger to believe in consequence that hair bracelet have brought ill luck to mother to derive from belief conviction that hair bracelet must therefore also bring ill luck to child be perfectly direct inevitable deductive process to mr peckover superstitious mind motif have formerly influenced to forbid little mary ever to begin anything important on friday ever to imperil prosperity by walking under ladder be precisely motif by be now actuated in determining to prevent presentation of young thorpe ill omened gift although valentine have only caught word here there to guide to subject of mr peckover muttering to herself while game be going on guessed easily enough general tenor of thought suspected that must ere long begin to talk louder than be at desirable if zack proceeded much further with present topic of conversation accordingly took advantage of pause in game of relapse into restless fit of walking about room on young thorpe part to approach wife couch a if wanted to find something lying near to whisper to stop talking more about present to madonna will tell why time mr blyth very readily easily complied with injunction by telling zack with perfect truth that have be already little too much excited by event of evening that must put off further listening talking on part till next night when promised to advise about bracelet to best of power be however still too full of subject to relinquish easily under stronger influence than influence of polite hint having lost one listener in mr blyth boldly tried experiment of inviting two others to replace by addressing to player at card table dare say have heard have be talking about to mr blyth began lord master zack said mr peckover do think have have something else to do here besides listening to there now talk to please till be done will throw out altogether sir on account because be playing for money sixpence game repelled on side zack be obliged to give way walked off to try amuse at book case mr peckover with very triumphant air nodded winked several time at valentine across table desiring by sign to show that must not only be silent when conversation be in danger of approaching forbidden subject must make other people hold tongue too room be now perfectly quiet game at cribbage proceeded smoothly enough not so pleasantly a usual on other occasion valentine did not regain customary good spirit mr peckover relapsed into whispering discontentedly to herself now then looking towards bookcase where young thorpe be sitting sleepily with volume of engraving on knee be more le relief to everybody when supper tray came up card be put away for night zack becoming quite lively again at prospect of little eating drinking tried to return to dangerous subject of hair bracelet addressing on occasion directly to valentine be interrupted however before have spoken three word mr blyth suddenly remembered that have important communication of own to make to young

trusting old gossip like alone with visitor last word be intended a sarcasm be whispered into valentine ear understood allusion to private conversation together easily enough felt that unless let have own way without further contest must risk offending old friend by implying mistrust of must be simply ridiculous under circumstance in be placed so when wife nodded to to take advantage of offer just made accepted forthwith now will stop giving mary hair bracelet thought mr peckover a bustled out after young thorpe closed room door behind wait bit young gentleman said arresting further progress on

blyth door one thing be determined on little mary sha have hair bracelet even a mr peckover walked thinking way up stair so did zack walk wondering way home what deuce must extraordinary remonstrance about present to madonna possibly mean be not at least clear from mr peckover terror when talked of asking blyth whether madonna really have hair bracelet that have told truth after be not even plainer still that have let out secret in telling that truth blyth must have ordered to keep why keep be mysterious hair bracelet mixed up somehow with grand secret about madonna past history valentine have always kept from from everybody very likely be why cudgel brain about what did concern be not considering fact previously forgotten that have fifteen shilling threepence of disposable money in world rather lucky than otherwise mr peckover have taken into head to stop from buying what have mean of paying for what other present must buy for madonna be pretty cheap enough to suit

without previously leaning against area railing at side steady muttered zack be done for if make noise here felt for keyhole guided key elaborately with left hand into proper place next opened door so quietly that be astonished at entered passage with marvelous stealthiness then closed door again cried hush when found that have let lock go little too noisily listened before attempted to light candle air of house felt strangely close hot after air out of door dark stillness above around be instinct with awful virtuous repose be deepened ominously by solemn tick tick of kitchen clock never audible from passage in day time terribly incomprehensibly distinct at moment wo bolt door whispered to till have struck here unreliability of brandy a curative agent in case of fermentation in stomach be palpably demonstrated by sudden return of hiccuping fit hush cried zack for second time terrified at violence suddenness of relapse clapping hand to mouth when be too late after groping on knee with extraordinary perseverance round rim of bed room candlestick stood on one of hall chair succeeded not in finding box of match in knocking off chair sending rolling over stone floor until be stopped by opposite wall with difficulty captured struck light never in zack experience have former match caught flame with shrill report a be produced from one disastrous match happened to select to light candle with next thing to be done be to bolt door succeeded very well with bolt at top failed signally with bolt at bottom appeared particularly difficult to deal with night first of creaked fiercely on being moved then stuck spitefully just at entrance of staple then slipped of sudden under moderate pressure ran like lightning into appointed place with bang of malicious triumph if doe bring father down thought zack listening with ear stifling hiccup with might be harder sleeper than take for door opened voice called sound of kind broke mysterious stillness of bedroom region zack sat down on stair took boot off got up again with little difficulty listened took candlestick listened once more whispered to now for began perilous ascent to own room held tight by banister only falling against making crack from top to bottom once before reached drawing room landing ascended second flight of stair without casualty of kind until got to top step close by father bed room door here by dire fatality stifled hiccup burst beyond control distinctly asserted by one convulsive yelp betrayed zack into start of horror start shook candlestick extinguisher lay loose in dropped out hopped playfully down stone stair rolled over landing with loud lively ring devilish brazen flourish of exultation in honor of own activity oh lord faintly ejaculated zack a heard somebody voice speaking somebody body moving in bed room remembered that have to mount flight of stair wooden stair time before got to own quarter on garret floor went up however directly with recklessness of despair separate stair creaking cracking under a if young elephant have be retiring to bed instead of young man blew out light tore off clothes slipping between sheet began to breathe elaborately a if

bewildered half deafened bed room house whole world tore round round heaved up down frantically with ceased to be human being became giddy atom spinning drunkenly in illimitable space started up in bed be recalled to sense of humanity by cold perspiration deathly qualm hiccup burst from no longer be succeeded by louder series of sound sound familiar to everybody who have ever be at sea sound nautically lamentably associated with white basin whirling wave misery of mortal stomach wailing in emetic despair in momentary pause between rapidly successive attack of malady now overwhelmed attributed in after life entirely to dyspeptic influence of toasted cheese zack be faintly conscious of sound of slippered foot ascending stair back be to door have strength to move courage to look round voice to raise in supplication knew that door be opened that light came into room that voice cried degraded beast that door be suddenly shut again with bang that be left once more in total darkness did not care for light voice banging of door did not think of afterwards did not mourn over past speculate on future just sank back on pillow with gasp drew clothes over with groan fell asleep blissfully reckless of retribution be to come with coming daylight when woke late next morning conscious of nothing at first except that be thawing fast out of door that have violent headache gradually recalled to remembrance of memorable fight in snuggery by sense of soreness in rib growing conviction that nose have become too large for face zack memory began correctly though confusedly to retrace circumstance attending return home disastrous journey up stair to bed with recollection be mingled others of light have penetrated into room after own candle be out of voice have denounced a degraded beast of banging of door have followed there must be doubt that be father who have entered room apostrophized in briefly emphatic term be now calling to mind never have mr thorpe on former occasion be known to call name bang door be quite clear that have discovered everything be exasperated with son a have never be exasperated with other human being before in life just a zack arrived at conclusion heard rustling of mother dress on stair mr thorpe with handkerchief to eye presented woefully at bedside profoundly penitently wretched tried to gain mother forgiveness before encountered father wrath to do justice be so thoroughly ashamed to meet eye that turned face to wall in position appealed to mother compassion in most moving term with most vehement protestation have ever addressed to only effect produced on mr thorpe be to make walk up down room in violent agitation sobbing bitterly now then few word burst lamentably incoherently from lip be just articulate enough for to gather from that father have discovered everything have suffered in consequence from attack of palpitation of heart have felt on rising that morning so unequal in mind body to deal unaided with enormity of son offense that have just gone out to request co operation of reverend aaron yollop on discovering zack penitence changed instantly into curious mixture of indignation alarm turned round quickly towards mother before must open lip informed speaking with unexampled severity of tone that be on account to think of going to office a usual be to wait at home until father return then hurried from room fact be that mr thorpe distrusted own inflexibility if stayed too long in presence of penitent son zack must not unhappily know must only see that left abruptly after delivering ominous message must only place gloomiest interpretation on conduct when mother turn against have lost last chance stopped before ended sentence sat up in bed deliberating with for minute two must make up mind to bear anything from father because have right to be angry with after what have done if stand old yollop again will be here whatever zack said be smothered in sound of blow expressive of fury despair administered to mattress on be sitting having relieved thus jumped out of bed pronouncing at last in real earnest few word of fatal slang have often burst from lip in other day a empty threat be over with must bolt from home refreshed mind body by good wash still resolution did not falter hurried on clothes looked out of window listened at door time purpose never changed remembering too well persecution have already suffered at hand of mr yollop conviction that must now be repeated with fourfold severity be enough of to keep firm to desperate intention when have done dressing

astonished to hear madonna suddenly clap hand at window a signal that first punctual visitor have passed garden gate mr blyth raised eye from print directly smiled a saw girl puckering up fresh rosy face into childish imitation of old age bending light figure gravely in succession of formal bow kissing hand several time with extreme suavity deliberation sign be meant to indicate mr blyth father

nothing compared with rapturous activity now that be fairly assembled not once have stood still ceased talking since first spectator entered room not once probably must have permitted leg tongue to

change position moved accordingly to door post even here be not left in repose fresh relay of visitor arrived obliged to make way for to pas into room did by politely rolling round door post into passage a disappeared in way mr blyth bustled up to place where mat have be standing received guest there with great cordiality also with appearance of flurry perplexity of mind fact be that lady brambledown have just remembered that have not examined valentine work yet through one of artistic tube effectively concentrate ray of light on picture when applied to eye knowing by former experience that studio be furnished with one of little instrument ladyship now intimated ardent desire to use instantly on columbus valentine promised to get with usual ready politeness have not slightest idea where actually be for among litter of small thing have be cleared out of way when painting room be put in order there be several vaguely remembered having huddled together for safety in bottom of bureau tube might possibly have be among so in place determined to look for being quite ignorant if search turned out unsuccessful where ought to look next after begging new visitor to walk in opened bureau be large old fashioned with little bright key hanging by chain that unhooked from watch guard began searching inside amid infinite confusion attention concentrated in effort to discover lost tube be not to be found in bottom of bureau next looked after little preliminary hesitation into long narrow drawer opening beneath pigeon hole recess at back tube be not there either shut drawer to again carefully gently for inside be hair bracelet have belonged to madonna lying on white handkerchief have also be taken from dead woman pocket just a closed drawer heard footstep at right hand turned in direction rather suspiciously locking down lid of bureau a looked round be only civil mr gimble wanting to know what mr blyth be searching for whether must help valentine mentioned loss of tube mr gimble immediately volunteered to make one of pasteboard ten thousand thanks said mr blyth hooking key to watch guard again a returned to lady brambledown with friend ten thousand thanks worst of be know where to find pasteboard if instead of turning to right hand to speak to mr gimble valentine have turned to left must have seen just a opened bureau began to search in mr marksman finding way into painting room clear once more have rolled quietly round door post again have then just a quietly bent forward little so a to look sideways into bureau with observant eye of nothing must escape have be trained by old indian experience to be always unscrupulously at work watching something little did mr blyth think a walked away talking with mr gimble carefully hooking key on to swivel again that zack strange friend have seen a much of inside of bureau a have seen of shut up big box uncommon sharp when smilin little chap come near thought mat yet there did seem nothing in that stranger might see there be money there at least none set eye on well be not business let have look at picter in affair of art a in other matter important discovery be sometimes made great event occasionally accomplished by very ignoble agency mat deplorable ignorance of painting in general grossly illiterate misunderstanding of subject represented by columbus in particular seemed to mark out a last man in world who must possibly be associated with art mystic in character of guardian genius yet such be proud position be now selected by fate to occupy in plain word mr blyth greatest historical work have be for little time in imminent danger of destruction by falling mat look at picter be important look enabled to be first person in room who perceived that be in peril eye with mr marksman now regarded picture be certainly eye of barbarian eye with afterwards examined support by be suspended be eye of sailor of good practical carpenter to boot saw directly that one of two iron clamp to frame line of columbus be attached have be carelessly driven into part of wall be not strong enough to hold against downward stress of heavy frame little warning driblet of loosened plaster have be trickling down rapidly behind canvas nobody heard fall in general buzz of talking nobody noticed thin fine crack above iron clamp be now lengthening stealthily minute by minute just let by will said quietly to of neighbor want to stop flying woman man in crank ship from coming down by long run dozen of alarmed lady gentleman started up from chair mat pushed through unceremoniously be indebted to want of politeness for being in time to save picture with grating crack accompanying descent of perfect slab of plaster loose clamp came clean out of wall just a mat seized unsupported end side of frame in sturdy hand so prevented picture from taking fatal swing downwards must have infallibly torn from remaining fastening precipitated on chair beneath prodigious confusion clamoring of tongue ensued mr blyth being louder wilder more utterly useless in present emergency than of neighbor mat cool a ever kept hold of picture taking notice of confused advice cumbersome help offered to called to zack to fetch ladder failing that to get hoist on chair cut rope from clamp remained firm wooden step a young thorpe knew be usually kept in painting room where have be removed to now mr blyth memory be lost altogether in excitement zack made speculative dash at flowing drapery concealed lumber in one corner dragged out step in triumph right take time young there be knife in left hand breech pocket said mat now then cut away at bit of rope end hold on tight at top while lower away at bottom steady take easy there be with word guardian genius left art mystic resting safely on floor began to shake coattail free of plaster have dropped on dear sir have saved finest picture ever painted cried valentine warmly seizing by hand ca find word to express gratitude admiration worry about answered mat suppose must understand if must find if want picter put up again will do if want carpenter muddle head punched who put up before must much mind doing that added mat looking at hole from clamp have be torn with expression of profoundest workmanlike disgust new commotion in room near door time prevented mr blyth from giving immediate answer to two friendly proposition just submitted to at first alarm of danger lady headed by dowager countess in whom instinct of self preservation be largely developed have got a far away a must from falling picture before ventured to look round at process by be at last safely landed on floor just a have be accomplished lady brambledown who stood nearest to doorway caught sight of madonna in passage led to mr blyth have heard noise confusion downstairs finding that bell be not answered by servant that be next to impossible to overcome father nervous horror of confronting company alone have sent madonna down stair with to assist in finding out what have happened in studio while descending stair with companion girl have anticipated that might easily discover whether anything be amiss without going further than passage by merely peeping through studio door chance of escaping ordeal of painting room be lost moment lady brambledown set eye on dowager countess be one of madonna warmest admirer now expressed that admiration by pouncing on with immense affection enthusiasm from painting room door way other people to whom deaf dumb girl be much more interesting sight than columbus golden age crowded round trying together with great amiability small intelligence to explain what have happened by sign human being must possibly understand fortunately for madonna zack who ever since have cut picture down have be assailed by incessant fire of question about strange friend from dozen of inquisitive gentleman happened to look towards over lady head came directly to explain danger from columbus have escaped tried hard to get away bear intelligence to mr blyth lady brambledown feeling amiably unwilling to resign too soon pitched on poor engraver standing tremulous in passage a being quite clever enough to carry message up stair sent off to take latest news from studio to daughter immediately thus be that when mr blyth left zack friend to see what be going on near door found madonna in painting room surrounded by sympathizing admiring lady first word of explanation by lady brambledown answered mute look of inquiry reminded of anxiety alarm that wife must have suffered ran up stair directly promising to be back again in minute two mat carelessly followed valentine to group at doorway carelessly looked over lady bonnet saw madonna offering slate to dowager countess at moment sweet feminine gentleness youthful softness of girl face looked inexpressibly lovely a now stood shy confused under eager eye be gazing on dress too have never more powerfully aided natural attraction of face figure by own loveable charm of simplicity modesty than now when plain grey merino gown neat little black silk apron always wore be contrasted with fashionable frippery of fine color shining around be rough mr marksman lured at first sight into acknowledging influence if be face manner showed very strangely almost at instant when eye fell on that clay cold change have altered color of swarthy cheek in hosier shop at dibbledean passed over again first amazed look that cast on slowly darkened while eye rested on face into fixed heavy vacant stare of superstitious awe never moved hardly seemed to breathe until head of person before accidentally intercepted view then stepped back few pace looked about bewildered a if have forgotten where be turned quickly towards door a if resolved to leave room immediately there be inexplicable influence at work in heart that drew back in spite of own will retraced step to group round madonna looked at once more from moment never lost sight of till went up stair again whichever way face turned followed direction outside circle so a to be always in front of when valentine re appeared in studio madonna besought by look to set free from general admiration send back to mr blyth mat be watching over painter shoulder when young thorpe who have devoted to helping in communicating with visitor nodded to a left room friend from backwoods be close behind chapter vi

continued zack pitilessly carrying on joke in first place always remember that must go beyond admiration at respectful distance to begin with at second interview may make amorous face at close quarter what call looking unutterable thing know at third may get bold try with little present lot of people have done that before gimble tried bullivant wanted to blyth must let mean to give oh by bye have important caution for here indulged in fresh burst of laughter excited by remembrance of interview with mr peckover in mr blyth hall remember that whole round of present be open for to choose from except one one be hair bracelet zack laughter came to abrupt termination mat have raised head suddenly be now staring full in face again with bright searching look expression in suspicious amazement doubting curiosity be very strangely mingled together be not angry with for cracking few respectable old joke said zack have said anything stop yes have though did mean looked up at in savage manner when warned not to give hair bracelet surely think brute enough to make fun of not having hair on own head to give anybody surely have better opinion of than give word of honor never thought of head that infernal scalping business when said what did be true happened to how did happen said mat with eager angry curiosity only in way wanted to give hair bracelet hair blyth so on addle headed old woman who seems to know madonna be name give a well a blyth keep what know just a close got into corner talked nonsense about whole thing a old woman will what did say asked mat more eager more angry

hair bracelet said vacantly be sulky cried zack clapping on shoulder hair bracelet be unlucky to young woman be got one already be weighing attentively lightest word that zack have spoken to what be like asked aloud turning suddenly to young thorpe what be what like hair bracelet still harping on after explanation like why be hair plaited up made to fasten round wrist with gold at end to clasp by what be stopping for again will tell what mat can make allowance for man in love struck situation if did know how have be spending morning must say be drunk have be walking along quickly while mat asked what hair bracelet be like sooner have zack told than came to dead pause started changed color opened lip to speak then checked remained silent information have just received have recalled to certain object that have seen in drawer of mr blyth bureau resemblance between two have at once flashed upon importance discovery assumed in eye in connection with what have already heard may be easily estimated when be remembered that barbarian life have kept totally ignorant that hair bracelet be in england one of commonest ornament of woman wear be going to stop here day asked zack if be turning from sulky to sentimental again will go back to blyth pave way for with madonna old boy turned gaily in direction of valentine house a said word mat did not offer to detain did not say word at parting passed hand wearily over eye a zack left be sober said vacantly to be not dreaming be not light headed though feel abeost like saw that young woman a plain a see house in front of now by god if have be mary ghost must have be more like stopped hand fell to side then fastened mechanically on railing of house near rough misshapen finger trembled round iron recollection have slumbered for year year past be awakening again awfully to life within through obscurity oblivion of long absence through changeless darkness of tomb there be shining out now vivid solemn on memory image a have be in youth time of dead woman whose name be mary be only sight of young girl of poor shy gentle deaf dumb creature have wrought miracle tried to shake clear of influence be now at work on moved forward step two looked up zack where be zack away at other end of solitary suburban street just visible sauntering along swinging stick in hand without knowing why did so mat turned instantly walked after calling to to come back third summons reached stopped hesitated made comic gesticulation with stick in air then began to retrace step effort of walking calling after have turned mat thought in direction now occupied again with hint zack have dropped of incomprehensible connection between hair bracelet young girl who be called by strange name of madonna with remembrance of there came back also recollection of letter about bracelet enclosure of hair have examined in lonely cattle shed at dibbledean still lay in little box bearing on name of mary grice well cried zack speaking a came on well cupid what do want with now mat did not immediately answer thought be still traveling back cautiously over ground have already explored once more be pondering on little circle of plaited hair having gold at end looking just big enough to go round woman wrist have seen in drawer of mr blyth bureau once again identity between object ornament young thorpe have described a being thing called hair bracelet began surely more surely to establish in mind now then keep waiting continued zack laughing again a came nearer clap hand on heart give tender message for future mr marksman be on tip of mat tongue to emulate communicativeness of young thorpe to speak unreservedly of what have seen in drawer of bureau suddenly restrained word just a be dropping from lip at same moment eye began to lose vacant perturbed look to brighten again with something of craft cunning added to customary watchful expression what be young woman real name asked carelessly just a zack be beginning to banter for third time be that called back for real name mary mat have made inquiry with air of man whose thought be far away from word who only spoke because felt obliged to say something zack reply to question startled into instant anxious attention mary repeated in tone of surprise what else besides mary how must know did try beat into muddled old head hour ago blyth wo tell friend anything about there be pause secrecy in mr blyth chose to conceal madonna history sequestered place in innermost drawer of bureau where kept hair bracelet began vaguely to connect together in mat mind curious smile hovered about lip cunning look brightened in eye painter man wo tell anything about wo perhaps that thing in drawer will muttered word to putting hand in pocket mechanically kicking away stone happened to lie at foot on pavement what be grumbling about now asked zack do think be going to stop here day for pleasure of hearing talk to a spoke vivaciously rapped friend on shoulder with stick trust to pave way for with madonna called out mischievously a turned back in direction of mr blyth house trust to have look at friend hair bracelet said mat quietly to will handle time before be many day older nodded over shoulder at zack walked away quickly in direction of kirk street chapter vii box of letter first thing mat did when got to lodging be to fill light pipe then sat down on bear skin dragged box close to have brought from dibbledean although machinery of mat mind be constructed of very clumsy barbaric material although book learning have never oiled wise men talk have never quickened nevertheless always contrived to work on much a be working now until reached sooner later practical result solitude peril be stern schoolmaster do duty for good evil thoroughly with men have done thoroughly amid rock wilderness of great american continent with mat many pipe did empty fill again many dark change passed over heavy feature a now pondered long laboriously over word of dialogue have just be held between zack not so much a five minute out of time thus consumed be in true sense of word time wasted have sat down to first pipe resolved that if human mean must compass must find out how young girl whom have seen in mr blyth studio have first come there who really be when rose up at last put pipe away to cool have thought matter fairly out from beginning to end have arrived at conclusion have definitely settled future plan reflection have strengthened in resolution to follow first impulse when parted from zack in street begin attempt to penetrate suspicious secret hid from from one origin of valentine adopted child by getting possession of hair bracelet have seen laid away in inner drawer of bureau a for assignable reason for justifying in associating hair bracelet with madonna found to own satisfaction in young thorpe account of strange word spoken by mr peckover in mr blyth suspicion resulting from hint being also immensely strengthened by recollection of letter signed jane holdsworth containing enclosure of hair have examined in cattle shed at dibbledean according to letter hair bracelet easily recognizable if still in existence by comparing with hair enclosed in jane holdsworth note have once be property of mary grice according to what zack have said there be apparently incomprehensible confusion mystery in connection with hair bracelet young woman whose extraordinary likeness to what mary grice have be in girlhood have first suggested to purpose be now pursuing lastly according to what now knew there be actually hair bracelet lying in innermost drawer of mr blyth bureau latter fragment of evidence assuming in mind a have be already remarked undue significance in relation to fragment preceding from not knowing that hair bracelet be found in most house where there be woman in position to wear jewelry ornament at vague a might be coincidence be sufficient to startle at first then to fill with eager devouring curiosity then to suggest to uncertain desperate course be now firmly resolved to follow how be to gain possession of hair bracelet without mr blyth knowledge without exciting slightest suspicion in painter family have not yet determined be resolved to have be perfectly unscrupulous a to mean felt certain beforehand of attaining object whither to what excess object might lead never stopped never cared to consider awful face of dead woman now fixed for ever in memory by living copy of that own eye have beheld seemed to be driving on swiftly into unknown darkness to bring out into unexpected light at end influence be thus sternly at work in be not to be questioned be to be obeyed resolution in reference to hair bracelet be not more firmly settled than resolution to keep real sensation on seeing madonna purpose have grown out of profound secret from young thorpe who be too warmly mr blyth friend to be trusted word that zack have let slip have be of vital importance hitherto word might yet escape might be of most precious use for future guidance if be fun fancy mused mat to go on thinking be sweet on girl let think more think more will talk have got to do be to hold in then be sure to let out while schooling thus a to future conduct towards zack did not forget person who be le close at hand certainly who might also be turned to good account before fairly decided on plan of action debated with propriety of returning to dibbledean forcing from old woman joanna grice more information than have be willing to give at first interview on reflection considered that be better to leave a resource to be tried in case of failure of first experiment with hair bracelet one look at one close comparison of hair be made of with surplus hair have not be used by jeweler in mary grice bracelet have be returned to in friend letter be wanted in first place for must be enough to clear up present uncertainty suspicion connected with ornament in drawer of mr blyth bureau be mainly resolution to long meditation have now crookedly clumsily conducted next immediate business be to examine letter in box have hitherto not opened also to posse of enclosure of hair in letter to mary grice that might have always about ready for emergency before opened box however took quick impatient turn two up down miserable little room not once since have set forth to return to own country to civilization from for more than twenty year have be outcast have felt to use favorite expression that be own man again until now thrill of old breathless fierce suspense of day of deadly peril ran through a thought on forbidden secret into be about to pry for discovery of be ready to dare hazard use mean go through through abeost like dodging for life again among bloody indian muttered mat to a trod restlessly to fro in cage of room rubbing while at scar on face a way be when new excitement got better of at very moment when thought be rising ominously in mind valentine be expounding anew

once more to cold clay color have overspread in hosier shop at dibbledean a returned to bear skin opened box have belonged to mary grice took out first letter with enclosure of hair placed carefully in breast pocket of coat next searched moment two for letter superscribed signed by joanna grice having found placed on one side of on floor after paused moment looking into box with curious scowling sadness on face while hand vacantly stirred hither thither different object lay about among paper gaily bound album lace collar dried flower leaf other little womanly possession have once belonged to mary grice then began to collect together letter in box having got into hand tied up in packet loose spread out before on lap first drawing up end of one of bear skin over leg for to lie on conveniently began by examining address be directed to mary grice in same clear careful sharply shaped handwriting though be letter in form proved to be only note in substance when opened writing in not extending to more than four five line at least fifteen twenty be expressed with unimportant variation in form dearest mary pray try can to meet to morrow evening at usual place have be waiting longing for in vain to day only think of love a be now always thinking of know will come ever only yours c note be signed in same way merely with initial letter contained nothing in shape of date except day of week on have be written have evidently be delivered by private mean for there did not appear to be post mark on of one after mat opened glanced at then tossed aside into heap pursued employment quietly methodically a went on with strange look flashed into eye from time to time giving to certain sinister brightness altered very remarkably whole natural expression of face other letter somewhat longer than note already quoted fared better at hand dry leaf dropped out of a threw aside little water color drawing of rare flower fluttered out of others hard botanical name must not spell through description of plant must not understand occurred here there in postscript detached passage of longer letter still whether long short bore signature initial c still date afforded information of year month place in have be written still mat quietly quickly tossed aside one after other without so much a word sigh escaping with sinister brightness flashing into eye from time to time out of whole number of letter there be only two that read more than once through then pondered over anxiously before threw from like rest first of two be expressed thus will bring dried fern

bring home again have be born in house at dibbledean mother before have be born there family have lived in old place honestly reputably without so much a breath of ill report ever breathing over for generation generation back when thought of then thought of bare possibility that abandoned woman might soon be admitted bastard child born in house where so many of relation have lived virtuously died

contrary direction to london be to say far out bangbury way have be constantly asking sort of question of ellen gough who told of about road town people in distant part of country be only reason for thinking have taken away in direction though be matter of bare suspicion at best still deceived brother a to real opinion when asked of be sin now humbly truly repent of thought of helping by so little even a likely guess to bring infamy home to own door by actually bringing degraded daughter back with into presence in face of whole town thought say be too much for believed that day when crossed threshold again must be day of death a well a day of farewell to home under conviction concealed from joshua what real opinion be deserved to suffer for did suffer for two three day after lonely christmas day passed in utter solitude at house in dibbledean received letter from joshua lawyer in london telling to come up see brother immediately for be taken dangerously ill in course of inquiry must pursue although lawyer who knew better what ought to be done be doing utmost to help have be misled by false information have be robbed ill used in place near river then turned out at night in storm of snow sleet be useless now to write about what suffered from fresh blow to speak of awful time passed by bed side in london let be enough to say that escaped out of very jaw of death that be end of february before be well enough to be taken home to dibbledean soon got better in own air better a to body mind be in sad way morning used to ask if news of mary have come when heard there be none used to sigh then hardly say word so much a hold up head for rest of day at one time showed little anxiety now then about letter reaching destination being duly received peevishly refusing to mention to even so much a address on guessed who have be sent to easily enough when lawyer told that have written in london have mentioned to that be going to place beyond sea soon seemed to forget though to forget everything except regular question about mary sometimes repeated in dazed condition even after have broken to that be dead news of death came in march month of new year

appreciate friendly nature of business on came when informed that be confidentially employed by mr arthur carr instant spoke felt name go to heart like knife then indignation got better of told to tell mr carr that miserable creature whom villainy have destroyed have fled away from home have died away from home be buried away from home with shut door in face agitation sort of terror must not account for so overpowered be obliged to lean against wall of passage be unable for minute to stir step towards going up stair a soon a got little better began to think about what have taken place doubt came across a to whether might not have acted wrong remembered that joshua lawyer in london have made great point that mr carr must be traced though since then situation have be altered by niece death still felt uncertain uneasy must hardly tell why at what have done be a if have taken responsibility on ought not to have be mine in short ran back to door opened looked up down street be too late strange man be out of sight never set eye on again be in march same month in advertisement appeared be particular in repeating date because mark time of last information have to give in connection with disgraceful circumstance have here forced to relate of child mentioned in advertisement never heard anything from time to even know when be born only know that guilty mother left home in december of whether lived after date of advertisement whether died never discovered never wished to discover have kept retired since day of humiliation hiding sorrow in own heart asking question answering at place mat once more suspended perusal of letter have now read on for unusually long time with unflagging attention with same stern sadness always in face except when name of arthur carr occurred in course of narrative almost on occasion when finger by guided along close line of letter came to word trembled little dangerous look grew ever brighter brighter in eye be in now a dropped letter on knee turning round took from wall behind against leaned certain leather bag already alluded to a part of personal property that brought with on installing in kirk street opened took out

down from elevation by coat tail not before quick eye have traveled over garden have ascended step leading from to studio have risen above a high a brass handle of door by be approached from painting room in second place when have be prevailed on to start fairly for walk mat began to ask question with same pertinacious inquisitiveness have already displayed on day of picture show set out with wanting to know whether there be to be strange visitor at mr blyth that evening then on being reminded that valentine have expressly said at parting nobody asked if be likely to see painter wife downstairs after inquiry have of necessity be answered in negative went on to third question desired to know whether young woman a persisted in calling madonna might be expected to stay upstairs with mr blyth to show occasionally in painting room zack answered inquiry also in negative with running accompaniment of bad joke a usual madonna except under extraordinary circumstance never came down into studio in evening when mr blyth have company there satisfied on point mat now wanted to know at what time mr blyth family be accustomed to go to bed explained when zack expressed astonishment at inquiry that have only asked question in order to find out hour at must be proper to take leave of host night on hearing young thorpe answered a readily carelessly a usual that painter family be early people who went to bed before eleven o'clock adding that be of course particularly necessary to leave studio in good time on occasion referred to because valentine must most probably start for country next day by one of morning train mat next question be preceded by silence of few minute possibly be thinking in what term might best put if be case certainly decided on using briefest possible form of expression for when spoke again asked in so many word what sort of woman painter wife be zack characteristically answered inquiry by torrent of most superlative eulogy on mr blyth then passing from lady to chamber that inhabited wound up with magnificent exaggerated description of splendor of room mat listened to attentively then said supposed mr blyth must be fond of curiosity sort of knick knack thing from foreign part young thorpe not only answered question in affirmative added a private expression of own opinion that believed said curiosity knick knack have helped in way to keep alive by keeping amused from digressed to long narrative of poor mr blyth first illness having exhausted that sad subject at last ended by calling on friend to change conversation to le mournful topic just at point seemed that mat be perversely determined to let lapse into silent fit not only made attempt to change conversation entirely ceased asking question indeed hardly uttered word of kind good bad zack after vainly trying to rally into talking lit cigar in despair two walked on together silently mat having hand in pocket keeping eye bent on ground altogether burying a be from outer world in inner most recess of deep brown study a returned got near kirk street mat gradually began to talk again only on indifferent subject asking more question about mr blyth one else arrived at lodging at half past five o'clock zack went into bed room to wash hand while be thus engaged mat opened that leather bag of have be already described a lying in corner with bear skin taking out feather fan indian tobacco pouch wrapped up separately in paper having done called to zack saying that be about to step over to shaving shop to get face scraped clean before going to mr blyth left house with two

a to admire morning a said must here be on painting stand if must like to look at mat whose first glance at garden door have assured that be bolted locked for night wheeled round immediately to mr blyth great delight inspected sketch of old five barred gate with most extraordinary flattering attention want doing up said mat referring to picturesquely ruinous original of gate represented yes indeed answered valentine thinking spoke of creased ragged condition of paper on sketch be made morsel of paste sheet of fresh paper to stretch on must make quite thing of mat stared paste paper for five barred gate nice carpenter must make felt inclined to say zack however spoke at moment so left sketch wisely held tongue now then mat strip to chest put arm in position blyth tell remember be going to be drawn a hercules mind look a if be bringing erymanthian boar to king eurystheus for rest of evening said young thorpe composedly warming at fire while mat awkwardly with many expression of astonishment at strange piece of service required from by host divested of upper garment valentine unrolled on floor paper cartoon of classical composition having refreshed memory from put model forthwith into position of hercules with chair to hold instead of erymanthian boar zack to look at a only available representative of king eurystheus done mr blyth wasted little time a usual before began to work in looking for drawing material in course of search over littered studio table accidentally laid hand on two envelope with enclosure after examining address gave immediately to young thorpe here zack said belong to large envelope contains permission to draw at british museum small one have letter of introduction inside presenting with best recommendation to friend mr strather very

fervor of voice manner that must repair past fault by unflagging future industry a student of art after little longer delay valentine at last collected drawing material fairly began to work mat displaying from first most extraordinary admirable steadiness a model while work of studio thus proceeded with smoothness expedition must be desired incidental conversation by mean kept pace with in spite of young thorpe must say do talk lagged more more grew duller duller valentine be evidently out of spirit hercules of evening have stolidly abandoned to most inveterate silence at length zack gave up further effort to be sociable left painting room to go up stair visit lady mat looked after a quitted studio seemed about to speak then glancing aside at bureau checked suddenly did not utter word mr blyth present depression of spirit be not entirely attributable to certain ominous reluctance to leave home have be vainly trying to shake off since morning have secret reason for uneasiness happened to be intimately connected with model whose herculean chest arm be now busily engaged in drawing plain fact be that mr blyth tender conscience smote sorely when remembered trust mr thorpe placed in promised supervision over son when afterwards reflected that still knew a little of zack strange companion a zack did visit to kirk street undertaken for express purpose of guarding lad best interest by definitely ascertaining who mr mathew marksman really be have ended in what be now ashamed to dwell over even to call to mind dear dear thought mr blyth while worked away silently at outline of drawing ought to find out whether very friendly good natured useful man be fit to be trusted with zack now lad be out of room might very well do might will acting immediately on conscientious resolve simple hearted mr blyth actually set to ask important question of who really be mat be candor in answering inquiry related to wandering over american continent confessed with utmost frankness that have be sent to sea a wild boy whom be impossible to keep steady at home quite readily admitted that have not introduced to zack under real name at point communicativeness stopped did not quibble prevaricate just bluntly simply declared that must tell nothing more than have told already said to young concluded mat when first come together have heard sound of own name for better than twenty year past care if never hear again ' be what said to be what say to be rough 'un know hav' broke out of prison cheated gallows dear sir interposed valentine eagerly alarmedly pray imagine such offensive idea ever entered head might perhaps have thought that family trouble that be mat broke in quickly family trouble drop there will leave right before mr blyth must make attempt to shift conversation to le delicate topic be interrupted to own great relief by return of young thorpe to studio zack announced approaching arrival of supper tray warned hercules to cover up neck shoulder immediately unless wished to frighten housemaid out of wit at hint mr blyth laid aside drawing board mat put on flannel waistcoat not listening while to one word of many fervent expression of gratitude addressed to by painter appearing to be in violent hurry to array in coat again a soon a have got on put hand in one of pocket looked hard at valentine just then however servant came in with tray upon turned round impatiently walked away once again to lower end of room when door have closed on departing housemaid returned to mr blyth with feather fan in hand saying in usual downright way that have heard from zack of mr blyth invalid condition of fondness for curiosity bluntly asked painter if thought wife must like such fan a now produced got plaything for woman in old country many long year ago said mat pressing fan roughly into mr blyth hand when come back thought for to give be dead gone there be not woman in england a care about know about if be too proud to let wife have thing throw into fire hav' got nobody to give to ca keep by wo keep by no longer in utterance of word there be certain rough pathos bitter reference to past calamity touched valentine in one of tender place generous instinct overcame prudent doubt in moment moved not merely to accept present also to predict warmly that mr blyth must be delighted with zack said speaking in undertone to young thorpe who have be listening to mat last speech observing production of fan in silent curiosity surprise zack will run up stair with fan to lavvie at once so a not to seem careless about friend gift mind do honor of supper table with proper hospitality while be away speaking word mr blyth bustled out of room a nimbly a usual minute two after departure mat put hand into pocket once more mysteriously approached young thorpe opened before paper containing indian tobacco pouch be made of scarlet cloth be very prettily decorated with colored bead do think young woman must fancy for kind of plaything asked zack with shout of laughter snatched pouch out of hand began to rally friend more unmercifully than ever for first time mat seemed to be irritated by boisterous merriment of be made object cut tormentor short quite fiercely with frown oath lose temper amorous old savage cried zack with incorrigible levity will take pouch upstairs to beloved object if blyth will let have will bring down here to thank for saying young thorpe ran laughing out of room with scarlet pouch in hand mat listened intently till sound of zack rapid footstep died away upstairs then walked quickly softly down studio to garden door gently unlocked gently drew bolt back gently opened ascertained that must also be opened from without merely by turning handle then quietly closing again left to appearance a fast for night a before provided one went near enough have sufficiently sharp eye to observe that be neither bolted locked now for big chest thought mat taking false key out of pocket hastening back to bureau if zack painter man come down before have time to get at drawer inside have made sure of second chance with garden door have key in lock of bureau a thought passed through mind be just about to turn when sound of rapidly descending footstep upon stair struck on quick ear too late muttered mat must chance after with garden door putting key into pocket again a said walked back to fireplace moment after got there mr blyth entered studio be quite shocked that must have be so unceremoniously left alone said valentine whose naturally courteous nature prompted to be just a scrupulously polite in behavior to rough guest a if mat have be civilized gentleman of most refined feeling most exalted rank be so sorry must have be left through zack carelessness without anybody to ask to take little supper continued valentine turning to table mr blyth dear sir do take sandwich desire to express best thanks for very pretty present be brandy in bottle next to admires design spongecake ah care about sweet think color of center feather at moment door opened mr blyth abruptly closing lip looked towards with expression of blankest astonishment for beheld madonna entering painting room in company with zack valentine have be persuaded to let deaf dumb girl accept scarlet pouch by wife zack have said word before upstairs about taking madonna into studio when painter be well out of earshot young thorpe have confided to mr blyth new freak in wanted to engage signing unscrupulously to madonna that be wanted in studio to be presented to generous man who have given tobacco pouch took out of room without stopping to hear to end somewhat faint remonstrance by proposition be met to confess truth mr blyth seeing great impropriety in girl being introduced to stranger while valentine be present in room having moreover very strong curiosity to hear must about zack odd companion be secretly anxious to ascertain what impression madonna must bring away of mat personal appearance manner thus be that zack by seizing opportunity at right moment exerting little of cool assurance in be never very deficient now actually entered painting room in glow of mischievous triumph with madonna on arm valentine gave look a entered found convenient not to appear to see painter felt strongly inclined at moment to send adopted child upstairs again directly restrained out of feeling of delicacy towards guest for mat have not only seen madonna have hesitatingly advanced step two to meet instant came into room few social test for analyzing female human nature can be more safely relied on than moral investigator may easily apply by observing how woman conduct towards man who show symptom of confusion on approaching for first time if have nothing at in awkwardly forgets advantage of sex grows more confused than be if have nothing brain in cruelly abuse advantage treat with quiet contempt if have plenty of heart in instinctively turn advantage to right use forthwith set at ease by timely charity of word mute encouragement of look now madonna perceiving that stranger showed evident sign on approaching of what appeared like confusion to apprehension quietly drew arm out of zack to unmeasured astonishment stepped forward in front of looked up brightly into grim scarred face of mat dropped usual curtsey wrote line hurriedly on slate then offered to with smile nod to read if pleased to write on in return who must ever have thought cried zack giving vent to amazement have taken to old rough tough made prime favorite at first sight valentine be standing near did not appear to hear speech be watching scene before closely curiously accustomed a be to innocent candor with deaf dumb girl always showed approval dislike of stranger at first interview a also to apparent perversity in often displaying decided liking for very people whose look manner have be previously considered certain to displease be now almost a much surprised a zack when witnessed reception of mat be infallible sign of madonna approval if followed up introduction by handing slate of own accord to stranger when be presented to people whom disliked invariably kept by side until be formally asked for eccentric in everything else mat be consistently eccentric even in confusion men who be bashful in young lady presence show by blushing mat color sank instead of rising other men similarly affected burdensome modesty by fidgeting incessantly mat be a still a statue eye wandered heavily vacantly over girl beginning with soft brown hair then resting for moment on face then descending to gay pink ribbon on breast to crisp black silk apron with smart lace pocket then dropping at last to neat little shoe to thin bright line of white stocking just separated from hem of favorite grey dress only looked up again when touched hand put slate pencil into at signal raised eye once more read line have written to thank for scarlet pouch tried to write something in return hand shook thought seemed to fail gave back slate pencil looking full in eye a did so curious change came over face at same time change like have altered so remarkably in hosier shop at dibbledean zack might after have made many worse friend than man thought mr blyth still attentively observing mat vagabond behave in presence of young girl a be behaving now with idea in mind valentine advanced to help guest by showing mat how to communicate with painter be interrupted however by young thorpe who moment recovered from first sensation of surprise began to talk nonsense again at top of voice with mischievous intention of increasing mat embarrassment while mr blyth be attempting to silence zack by leading to supper table madonna be trying best to reassure great bulky sunburnt man who seemed to be absolutely afraid of moved to stool stood near second table in corner by fireplace sitting down produced scarlet pouch intimating by gesture mat be to look at what be now doing then laid pouch open on lap put into several little work box toy tonbridge silk reel ivory needle case silver thimble with enameled rim tiny pair of scissors other thing of same kind took first from one pocket of apron then from while be engaged in filling pouch zack standing at supper table drummed on floor with foot to attract attention interrogatively held up decanter of wine glass started a sound struck on delicate nerve looking at young thorpe directly signed that did not wish for wine sudden movement of body thus occasioned shook off lap little mother of pearl bodkin case lay more than half out of one of pocket of apron bodkin case rolled under stool without seeing for be looking towards supper table without being observed by mat for eye be following direction of without being heard by mr blyth

pointed to looked at mat with very significant nod action expressed idea wished to communicate plainly enough see seemed to say see what pretty work bag can make of tobacco pouch mat to appearance be not able to find out meaning of one of gesture easy a be to interpret sens seemed to grow more more perturbed longer looked at a curtseyed to again moved away in despair stepped forward little suddenly awkwardly held out hand big man seems to be getting little le afraid of thought madonna turning directly meeting clumsy advance towards with smile instant took hand lip closed shivered through whole body a if dead finger have touched oh thought now how cold hand be how cold hand be if have felt warm to touch must have be dreaming to night 'd seen mary ghost be grim fancy darkly troubled mat mind at very same moment when madonna be thinking how cold hand be turned away impatiently from wine offered to just then by zack looking vacantly into fire drew coat cuff several time over eye forehead chill from strange man hand still lingered icily about madonna finger made anxious though hardly knew why to leave room advanced hastily to valentine made sign indicated mr blyth by laying hand on heart then pointed up stair valentine understanding what wanted gave leave directly to return to wife room before zack must make even gesture to detain have slipped out of studio after not having remained in much longer than five minute zack whispered mr blyth a door closed be anything pleased with for bringing madonna down stair have broken through rule in doing so besides that

trebly determined now be use looking about for young lady said zack behaved so clumsily queerly that frightened out of room nothing of sort interposed valentine good naturedly pray take something to warm be quite ashamed of want of consideration in keeping standing so long when ought to have remembered that be not used to being painter model hope have not given cold given cold repeated mat amazedly seemed about to add sufficiently indignant assertion of superiority to such civilized bodily weakness a liability to catch cold just a word be on lip looked fixedly at mr blyth checked be afraid must be tired with long sitting have so kindly given added valentine answered mat after moment consideration not tired only sleepy 'd best go home what be o'clock reference to young thorpe

actually not too much to say that be sober subdued enough to have borne inspection by president council of royal academy a model student of fine art be rather surprise to not to hear friend snoring when let into passage surprise rose to blank astonishment when entered front room saw employment on fellow lodger be engaged mat be sitting by table with rifle laid across knee be scouring barrel bright with piece of sand paper by side be unsnuffed candle empty bottle tumbler with little raw brandy left in bottom of face when looked up showed that have be drinking hard there be stare in eye be at once fierce vacant hard fixed unnatural smile on lip zack did not at like to see why mat old boy said soothingly look little out of sort what be wrong mat scoured away at barrel of gun harder than ever gave answer what in name of wonder can be scouring rifle for to night continued young thorpe have never yet touched since brought into house what can possibly want with now shoot bird in england with rifle bullet rifle bullet will do for game if put up said mat suddenly fiercely fixing eye on zack what game doe mean thought young thorpe be be drinking pretty nearly drunk can anything have happened to since parted company at theater must like to find out be such old savage when brandy in head that half like to question here zack reflection be interrupted by voice of eccentric friend did ever meet with man of name of carr asked mat looked away from young thorpe keeping eye steadily on rifle rubbing hard at barrel a put question said zack not that can remember mat left off cleaning gun began to fumble awkwardly in one of pocket after little time produced what appeared to zack to be inordinately long letter written in cramped hand superscribed apparently with two long line of inscription instead of ordinary address opening strange looking document mat guided little way down line on first page with very unsteady forefinger stopped read somewhat anxiously with evident difficulty then put letter back in pocket dropped eye once more on gun in lap said with strong emphasis on christian name arthur carr returned zack never met with man of name be friend of yours mat went on scouring rifle barrel young thorpe said nothing more have be little puzzled early in evening when friend have exhibited fan tobacco pouch neither of have be produced before have mentioned to mr blyth that be once intended for woman who be now dead zack have thought conduct rather odd at time now when be followed by strangely abrupt reference to name of carr by mysterious scouring of rifle desperate brandy drinking in solitude began to feel perplexed in last degree about mat behavior be about arthur carr secret of old boy zack asked with sort of bewildered curiosity be letting out more than ought wonder now be little in liquor while young thorpe be pondering thus mat be still industriously scouring barrel of rifle after silence in room have lasted minute suddenly threw away morsel of sand paper spoke again zack said familiarly smacking stock of rifle have talk once about going away to wild country over water together be ready to sail when be if have glanced up at young thorpe with vacant bloodshot eye a spoke last word checked almost at same moment looked away again quickly at gun if what asked zack if can lay hand first on arthur carr answered mat with very unusual lowness of tone only let do will be game to tramp at hour notice may be dead buried for anything know then what be use of looking after interposed zack use be have got into head that be alive that will find returned mat 'well said young thorpe eagerly mat became silent again head drooped slowly forward body followed till rested elbow on gun sitting in crouched up position abstractedly began to amuse by snapping lock of rifle zack suspecting that brandy have swallowed be beginning to stupefy determined with characteristic recklessness to rouse into talking at hazard what devil be mystery about cried boldly ever since pulled out that feather fan tobacco pouch at blyth well what of interrupted mat looking up instantly with fierce suspicious stare nothing particular pursued zack undauntedly except that be odd never brought out before odder still that must tell blyth never say word here to about getting for woman what of broke out mat rising to foot with flushed face threatening eye making room ring again a grounded rifle on floor nothing what friend ought to say replied zack feeling that in mat present condition have ventured little too far be sorry for sake that never lived to have present meant for there be offense hope in saying that much in asking after what told blyth whether death happened lately happened afore ever be born gave answer amazed zack in curiously smothered abstracted tone a if be talking to laying aside rifle suddenly a spoke sitting down by table again resting head on hand young thorpe took chair near wisely refrained from saying anything just at moment silence seemed to favor change be taking place for better in mat temper looked up after awhile regarded zack with rough wistfulness anxiety working in swarthy face like zack said laying one hand on lad arm mechanically stroking down cloth of sleeve like let two part company let always pull together a brotherly pleasant a can paused hand tightened round young thorpe arm hot dry tearless look in eye began to soften a added take kind in zack saying be sorry for just now died afore ever be born hand relaxed grasp when have repeated last word turned little away said more astonishment curiosity impelled young thorpe to hazard question be sweetheart of yours asked unconsciously sinking voice to whisper relation kin to kin to said mat quickly yet not impatiently reaching out hand again to zack arm without looking up be mother sister yes for minute two zack be silent after answer a soon a began to speak again companion shook arm little impatiently time stopped drop said mat peremptorily let talk more head anything wrong with head asked zack mat rose to foot again change began to appear in face flash have tinged from first deepened palpably spread up to very rim of black skull cap confusion dimness seemed to be stealing over eye thickness heaviness to be impeding articulation when spoke again have overdone with brandy said head getting hot under place where scalped give holt of hat show light zack ca stop indoors no longer talk let out of house at once young thorpe took up candle directly leading way down stair let out into street by private door not venturing to irritate by saying anything waiting on door step watching with great curiosity a started for walk be just getting out of sight when zack heard stop strike stick on pavement in le than minute have turned be back again at door of tobacconist shop zack whispered ask about among friend if of ever knowed man with name told of do mean 'arthur carr ' be talking about just now inquired young thorpe yes arthur carr said mat very earnestly then turning away before zack must ask more question disappeared rapidly time in darkness of street chapter xiii search for arthur carr mr blyth be astir betimes on morning after mat young thorpe have visited in studio manfully determined not to give way inch to own continued reluctance to leave home packed up brush color started on portrait painting tour by early train have originally settled to travel by although have chance of spending time during absence agreeably a well a profitably inexplicable sense of uneasiness at being away from home remained with even on railway defying exhilarating influence of rapid motion change of scene oppressing a inveterately a have oppressed night before bad however a spirit now be must have be much worse if have known of two remarkable domestic event have be policy of household to keep strictly concealed from on day of departure when mr blyth cook descended first thing in morning to air studio in usual way by opening garden door be not little amazed alarmed to find that although be closed be neither bolted locked communicated circumstance reproachfully of course to housemaid who answered indignantly a be only natural by reiterating assertion of past night that have secured door properly at six o'clock in evening polly appealing to contradictory visible fact rejoined that thing be impossible patty holding fast to affirmatory personal knowledge retorted that thing have be done upon two have violent quarrel followed by sulky silence succeeded by affectionate reconciliation terminated by politic resolution to say nothing more about matter especially to abstain from breathing word in connection with to ruling authority above stair thus happened that valentine wife knew anything of suspicious appearance presented that morning by garden door though mr blyth be ignorant on point be well enough informed on of equal if not greater domestic importance while husband be down stair taking early breakfast madonna came into room communicated confidentially particular of terrible fright that have suffered while looking for bodkin case in studio on night before how candle must possibly have gone out a did in instant must not say be quite sure that nobody be in room when entered quite sure that felt draught of wind in direction in short knew nothing of own experience that candle suddenly went out that remained for little time half dead with fright in darkness that then managed to grope way back to bedroom in night light be always burning mr blyth followed progress of strange story on madonna finger with great interest to end then after suggesting that candle might have gone out through defect in make of might really have be extinguished by puff of air girl be too much occupied in looking for bodkin case to attend to earnestly charged not to say word on subject of adventure to valentine when went to help in packing up painting material be nervous uncomfortable enough already poor fellow at idea of leaving home thought mr blyth if heard story about candle going out must only make more uneasy still to explain consideration to madonna be to ensure discretion accordingly kept adventure in studio so profound secret from mr blyth that more suspected what have happened to than suspected what have happened to hair bracelet when hastily assured that be leaving bureau properly locked by trying lid of last thing before going away such be circumstance under valentine left home be not however only traveler of reader acquaintance whose departure from london took place on morning after mysterious extinguishing of madonna light in painting room by whimsical coincidence so happened that at very same hour when mr blyth be journeying in one direction to paint portrait mr matthew marksman now perhaps also recognizable a mr matthew grice be journeying in to pay second visit to dibbledean not visit of pleasure by mean visit of business business in particular mat have especially intended to keep secret from zack inkling of have nevertheless allowed to escape during past night conversation with lad in kirk street when young thorpe met on morning after conversation be sufficiently aware of fact that overdose of brandy have set talking in very unguarded manner desired zack a bluntly a usual to repeat to that have let out while liquor be in head after request have be complied with volunteered additional confidence simply said that what have slipped from tongue be more than truth that must add nothing to explain nothing about until have first discovered whether arthur carr be alive dead on being asked how when intended to discover answered that be going into country to make attempt very morning that if succeeded must on return tell fellow lodger unreservedly that latter might wish to know favored with additional promise zack be left alone in kirk street to quiet curiosity a well a must with reflection that might hear something more about friend secret when mat returned from trip to country in order to collect little more information on subject of secret than be at present possessed by zack will be necessary to return for moment to lodging in kirk street at particular period of night when mr marksman be sitting alone in front room be holding hair bracelet crumpled up tight in one of hand first glance at letter engraved on clasp not only showed to whom bracelet have once belonged set at rest in mind further doubt a to identity of young woman whose face have so startled impressed in mr blyth studio be neither logical enough legal enough in mode of reasoning to see that although have found sister bracelet in valentine bureau did not actually follow a matter of proof though might a matter of suspicion that have also found sister child in valentine house such objection a occurred to be now perfectly satisfied that madonna be what have suspected to be from first mary child to next question that asked concerning girl unknown father answer be not so easy to be found who be arthur carr where be be still alive first hasty suspicion valentine might have assumed name of arthur carr might therefore be man be set at rest immediately by look at bracelet knew that lightest in color of two kind of hair of be made be carr hair because exactly resembled surplus lock sent back by jeweler enclosed in jane holdsworth letter made comparison discovered resemblance at glance evidence of own eyesight be enough for be also enough to satisfy immediately that arthur carr hair be in color a nearly a possible exact opposite of mr blyth hair still though painter be assuredly not father might not know who father be have be how must otherwise have got possession of mary grice bracelet mary grice child two question suggested third in mat mind must discover at once to mr blyth compel by fair mean foul to solve doubt disclose what knew not at once must be playing at outset desperate dangerous move in game have best be reserved to last besides be useless to think of questioning mr blyth just now except by uncertain indiscreet process of following into country for have settled to take departure from london early next morning be now impossible to rest after have be already discovered without beginning in one direction attempt to find out arthur carr mat purpose of doing sprang from strongest of resolution vindictive resolution dangerous part of man nature life among savage wandering in wild place of earth have be stealthily nurturing for many long year past be beginning to assert now that have succeeded in penetrating mystery of madonna parentage by mother side placed in position tender thought of sister child must at particular crisis have be uppermost in many men heart one deadly thought of villain who have be mary ruin be uppermost in mat pondered little while on course that must pursue before idea of returning to dibbledean compelling joanna grice to tell more than have told at last interview occurred to disbelieved passage in narrative stated that have seen heard nothing of arthur carr in year have elapsed since flight death of niece have own conviction rather own presentiment have mentioned to zack that man be still alive somewhere felt confident that have in power a last resource to awe old woman into confessing everything that knew to dibbledean therefore in first instance resolved to go if failed there in finding clue to object of inquiry determined to repair next to rubbleford to address boldly to mr peckover remembered that when zack have first mentioned extraordinary behavior about hair bracelet in mr blyth hall have prefaced word by saying that knew apparently a much of madonna history a painter did that kept that knowledge just a close secret woman therefore doubtless possessed information might be entrapped forced into communicating there must be difficulty about finding out where lived for on evening when have mimicked young thorpe have said that kept dairy muffin shop at rubbleford to town then proposed to journey in event of failing in purpose at dibbledean if by evil chance must end in ascertaining more from mr peckover than from joanna grice what course must take next there must be nothing to be done then to return to london to try last great hazard to discover to mr blyth come what might with hair bracelet to vouch for in hand be thought a sat alone in lodging in kirk street at night have ended in fatal consolation of brandy bottle in desperate solitary excess have so cheated of self control that lurking taint life among savage have left in disposition deadly rancor recent discovery of sister fate have stored up in heart escaped from concealment betrayed in half drunken half sober occupation of scouring rifle barrel have so greatly amazed zack to witness lad have so suddenly strangely suspended by few chance word of sympathizing reference to mary death in morning mat head be clear dangerous instinct be held once more under cunning control in morning therefore declined explaining to young thorpe started quietly for country by first train on being set down at dibbledean station mat lingered little looked about just a have lingered looked on occasion of first visit subsequently took same road to town have then taken on gaining church stopped a have formerly stopped at churchyard gate time however seemed to have intention of passing entrance intention indeed of doing anything unless standing vacantly by gate mechanically swinging backwards forward with hand can be considered in light of occupation a for churchyard hardly looked at now there be two three people at little distance walking about among graf who might have be thought must have attracted attention never took smallest notice of be evidently meditating about something for soon began to talk to being like most men who have passed much of time in solitude unconsciously in habit of thinking aloud

best serve purpose of tracing arthur carr by endeavoring forthwith to get information that mr peckover might be able to afford in event of resource proving useless there must be plenty of time to return to dibbledean discover to mr tatt ascertain whether law must not give to joshua grice son right of examining joanna grice paper come to office cried mr tatt enthusiastically can give prime bit

of pocket looked at hair enclosed in be fourth fifth time have done during few hour have passed since have possessed of mary bracelet from period there have grown within vague conviction that possession of carr hair might in way lead to discovery of carr knew perfectly well that there be not slightest present practical use in examining hair yet there be something seemed to strengthen afresh in purpose to encourage anew after unexpected check at dibbledean merely in act of looking at if ca track other way muttered replacing hair in pocket have got notion into head somehow that will track by mat found very easy business to reach rubbleford have to go back little way on dibbledean line then to diverge by branch line then to get upon main line travel along distance before reached destination be dark by time reached rubbleford however by inquiring of one two people easily found dairy muffin shop when be once in town saw to great delight that be not shut up for night looked in

except that be useless to look near where be digging for be respectable townspeople buried about there mat walked round to other side of church here graf be thicker than ever for here poor be buried went on slowly through with eye fixed on ground towards tree marked limit of churchyard looking out for place to begin search in where graf might be comparatively few where head might not get confused at outset place found at last in damp corner under tree about spot thin grass languished mud distilled into tiny water pool bramble briar dead leaf lay thickly foully between few ragged turf mound must have laid here must be last refuge to mary ran after fled from home few of mound have stained moldering tomb stone at head looked at first finding only strange name on turned next to mound marked out by cross board of wood at one of graf cross board have be torn have rotted away from upright support lay on ground weather stained split still faintly showing that have once have few letter cut in

bangbury churchyard if know grave tell in plain word be here breathless a be with astonishment mr peckover managed to stammer faint answer in affirmative to add that initial m g must be found somewhere on broken board lying at foot then tried to ask question two in turn word died away in faint exclamation of surprise to think of meeting together be must say own brother too oh to think of only to think of mat looked down at mud bramble rotting grass lay over what have once be living loving human creature dangerous brightness glittered in eye cold change spread fast over cheek scar of arrow wound began to burn redly more redly a whispered to will be even yet mary with man who laid here doe mr blyth know who be sir asked mr peckover hesitating trembling a put question did give

mat promising to call again in evening at dawson building when presented at timber merchant after having carefully measured old board in churchyard came in humor to be easily satisfied never be fine lady more difficult to decide about texture pattern color to be chosen for new dress than mat be when arrived at timber merchant about grain thickness kind of wood to be chosen for cross board at head of mary grave at last selected piece of walnut wood having paid price demanded for without haggling inquired next for carpenter of whom might hire set of tool man who have money to spare have thing at command before evening mat have complete set of tool dry shed to use in comfortable living room at public house near at own sole disposal being skillful enough at carpenter work of ordinary kind must under most circumstance have completed in day two such employment a have now undertaken strange fastidiousness most uncharacteristic anxiety about smallest matter delayed through stage of present undertaking mr peckover who came morning to see how be getting on be amazed at slowness of progress be from first morbidly scrupulous in keeping board smooth clean after have shaped fitted to upright support after have cut in by mr peckover advice same inscription have be placed on old board simple initial m g with year of mary death after have done thing be seized with unreasonable obstinate fancy for decorating board at side in spite of mr peckover must say to prevent carved anchor at one side tomahawk at other being object with be most familiar therefore object chose to represent even when carving of extraordinary ornament have be completed must not be prevailed on to set new cross board up in proper place fondly a artist author linger over last loving touch to picture book did mat now linger day after day over poor monument to sister memory own rough hand have made smoothed carefully with bit of sand paper rubbed industriously with leather polished anxiously with oil until at last mr peckover lost patience trusting in influence have already gained over fairly insisted on bringing work to close even while obeying be still true to first resolution have said that man hand must help in labor have now undertaken be a good a word for carried cross board to churchyard time never once looked at lock of hair have be accustomed to take so frequently from pocket few day back perhaps there be nothing in common between thought of tracing arthur carr thought of mary came to while be at work on walnut wood plank when cross board have be set up when have cleared away mud bramble about mound have made smooth little path round when have looked at work from point of view have satisfied that must hing more to perfect active restless violent element in nature seemed to awake a be on sudden finger began to search again in pocket for fatal lock of hair when mr peckover next met first word addressed to announced immediate departure for dibbledean have strengthened hold on gratitude by getting permission through rector of bangbury to occupy without molestation in work of repairing sister grave have persuaded to confide to many of particular concerning have refused to communicate at first interview when tried at parting to fathom what ultimate intention really be now that be leaving bangbury with avowed purpose of discovering arthur carr failed to extract from single sentence of explanation even so much a word of reply when took farewell charged not to communicate meeting to mr blyth till heard from saw again tried once more to thank in a fit word a must command for pity kindness have shewn towards mary grice to very last closed lip resolutely on ominous subject of arthur carr have be fortnight absent from london when set forth once more for dibbledean to try last chance of tracing out hidden man might be afforded by search among paper of joanna grice astonishment delight of mr tatt when matthew appearing in character of client at desolate office door actually announced a sole surviving son of old joshua grice flowed out in such torrent of congratulatory word mat be at first literally overwhelmed by soon recovered however while mr tatt be still haranguing fluently about proving client identity securing client right of inheritance silenced solicitor by declaring a bluntly a usual that have not come to dibbledean to be helped to get hold of money to be helped to get hold of joanna grice paper extraordinary announcement produced long explanation still longer discussion in middle of mat lost patience declared that must set aside legal obstacle delay forthwith by going to mr nawby office demanding of gentleman a official guardian of late miss grice paper permission to look over different document old woman might have left behind be to earthly purpose that mr tatt represented course of proceeding a unprofessional injudicious against etiquette utterly ruinous looked at from point of view while be still expostulating matthew be stepping out at door mr tatt who must not afford to lose even most outrageous unmanageable of client have other alternative to make best of run after mr nawby be remarkably lofty solemn ceremonious gentleman feeling a bitter hatred scorn for mr tatt a be well possible for one legal human being to entertain toward there be doubt that must have received irregular visit of be now object with most chilling contempt if have only be allowed time to assert own dignity before must utter single word matthew in defiance of mr tatt must say to silence first announced in proper character then after premising that came to worry nobody about money matter coolly added that wanted to look over late joanna grice letter paper directly for purpose be not of smallest consequence to anyone under ordinary circumstance mr nawby must have simply declined to hold communication with mat until identity have be legally proved prosperous solicitor of dibbledean have grudge against audacious adventurer who have set up in practice against therefore resolved to depart little on occasion from strictly professional course for express purpose of depriving mr tatt of a many prospective six eight pences a possible waving hand solemnly when mat have done speaking said wait moment sir then rang bell ordered in head clerk now mr scutt said mr nawby loftily addressing clerk have goodness to be witness in first place protest against visit on mr tatt part a being indecorous unprofessional unbusiness like in second place be witness also that admit identity of party pointing to mat that what be now about to say to say under protest denying pro forma that be party represents to be thoroughly understand mr scutt mr scutt bowed reverently mr nawby went on if business connection sir with party said addressing matthew indicating mr tatt be only entered into to forward purpose have just mentioned to beg to inform denying will understand at same time right to ask for such information that may wind up matter with solicitor whenever please late miss grice have left letter paper destroyed by own wish in own presence under own written authority during last illness head clerk here who be present to assist will corroborate statement if wish mat listened attentively to word listened to nothing more sturdy legal altercation immediately ensued between two solicitor hardly reached ear mr tatt took arm led out talking more fluently than ever have not poorest trifle of attention to bestow on mr tatt faculty together seemed to be absorbed by one momentous consideration have really truly lost last chance of tracing arthur carr when got into high street mind somewhat recovered freedom of action began to feel necessity of deciding at once on future movement now that final resource have failed what must do next be useless to go back to bangbury useless to remain at dibbledean yet fit be on to be moving again somewhere better even to return to kirk street than to remain irresolute inactive on scene of defeat stopped suddenly saying be good waiting here now will go back to london impatiently shook free of mr tatt arm in moment found by mean so easy however to shake free of mr tatt legal service depend on zeal cried energetic solicitor following matthew pertinaciously on way to station if there be law in identity will be proved right respected intend to throw into case heart soul money justice law morality be concerned one moment dear sir if must really go back to london oblige at rate with address just state in cursory way whether be christened not at dibbledean church want nothing more to begin with absolutely nothing more on word of honor a professional man willing in present mood to say do anything to get rid of volunteer solicitor mat mentioned address in kirk street name by be known there impatiently said yes to inquiry a to whether have be christened at dibbledean church then abruptly turning away left mr tatt standing in middle of high road excitably making note of evidence just collected in new legal memorandum book a soon a mat be alone ominous question suggested to again have lost last chance of tracing arthur carr although inexorable fact seemed now to prove past contradiction that have even yet held to old superstition more doggedly desperately than ever once more on way to station pulled out lock of hair obstinately pondered over once more while journeyed to london that strange conviction upheld have already supported under previous check will find thought mat whirling along in train care where be hid away from will find yet chapter xv discovery of arthur carr while matthew grice be traveling backwards forward between town town in midland county life led by young friend comrade in metropolis be by mean devoid of incident change zack have met with adventure a well a mat one of in particular being of nature rather leading to such result a materially altered domestic aspect of lodging in kirk street

picturesque in personal appearance with whom contrived to become intimate directly here to crown be model sitting for chest arm who have be great prize fighter with whom zack joyfully cemented bond of eternal pugilistic friendship on first night of admission to mr strather academy through second day of probation a student labored at drawing with immense resolution infinitesimal progress through evening daubed away industriously under mr strather supervision until academy sitting be suspended must have be well for if have gone home a soon a laid down brush in evil hour lingered after study of

benefit after being conducted in orderly manner enough for little time pugilistic proceeding of evening be suddenly interrupted by one of patron present who be also student at drawing academy declaring that pocket have be picked insisting that room door must be closed police summoned immediately great confusion disturbance ensued amid zack supported demand of fellow student perhaps little too warmly at rate gentleman sitting opposite to with patch over one eye nose broken in three place swore that young thorpe have personally insulted by implying that be thief vindicated moral character by throwing cheese plate at zack head missile struck mark at side however instead of in front breaking when struck inflicted what appeared to unprofessional eye that looked at injury like very extensive dangerous wound chemist to whom zack be taken in first instance to be bandaged thought little of hurt local doctor who be called in after lad removal to kirk street did not take so reassuring view of patient case wound be certainly not situated in very dangerous part of head have be inflicted at time when zack naturally full blooded constitution be in very unhealthy condition from effect of much more ardent spirit drinking than be at good for bad fever symptom set in immediately appearance became visible in neighborhood of wound at medical head shook ominously in short
