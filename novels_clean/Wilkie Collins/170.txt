completely by surprise became conscious of mysteriously offensive odour in room entirely new in experience of revolting smell be composed if such thing must be of two mingling exhalation be separately discoverable exhalation nevertheless strange blending of odour consisted of something faintly unpleasantly aromatic mixed with underlying smell so unutterably sickening that threw open window put head out into fresh air unable to endure horribly infected atmosphere for moment longer french proprietor joined english friend with cigar already lit started back in dismay at sight terrible to countryman in general sight of open window english people be perfectly mad on subject of fresh air exclaimed 'we will catch death of cold francis turned looked at in astonishment 'be really not aware of smell

to understand superstitious purpose that have in view 'be educated woman really of same opinion a sister maid ' exclaimed 'assuming absurd superstition to be serious thing be taking wrong mean to prove true if brother sister have seen nothing how must agnes lockwood discover what be not revealed to be only distantly related to montbarrys be only cousin ' be nearer to heart of montbarry who be dead than of ' countess answered sternly 'to last day of life miserable husband repented desertion of will see what none of have seen will have room francis listened utterly at loss to account for motif animated ' see what interest have in trying extraordinary experiment said 'it be interest not to try be interest to fly from venice never set eye on agnes lockwood of family again 'what prevents from doing that ' started to foot looked at wildly ' know more what prevents than do ' burst out beome will be stronger than mine drive on to destruction in spite of own self suddenly sat down again

event in lady montbarry eldest child be concerned little marian have be got ready for bed a usual have so far taken hardly notice of new room a knelt down to say prayer happened to look up at part of ceiling above be just over head of bed next instant alarmed agnes by starting to foot with cry of terror pointing to small brown spot on one of white panelled space of carved ceiling be spot of blood ' child exclaimed away wo sleep here ' seeing plainly that must be useless to reason with while be in room agnes hurriedly wrapped marian in dressing gown carried back to mother in drawing room here lady did best to soothe reassure trembling girl effort proved to be useless impression have be produced on young sensitive mind be not to be removed by persuasion marian must give explanation of panic of terror have seized be quite unable to say why spot on ceiling looked like colour of spot of blood only knew that must die of terror if saw again under circumstance one alternative be left be arranged that child must pas night in room occupied by two younger sister nurse in hour more marian be peacefully asleep with arm around sister neck lady montbarry went back with agnes to room to see spot on ceiling have so strangely frightened child be so small a to be only just perceptible have in probability be caused by carelessness of workman by dripping from water accidentally spilt on floor of room above ' really can not understand why marian must place shocking interpretation on trifling thing ' lady montbarry remarked ' suspect nurse be in way answerable for what have happened ' agnes suggested behe may quite possibly have be telling marian tragic nursery story have left mischievous impression behind person in position be sadly ignorant of danger of exciting child imagination have better caution nurse to morrow ' lady montbarry looked round room with admiration 'be not prettily decorated ' said ' suppose agnes mind sleeping here by ' agnes laughed feel so tired ' replied 'that be thinking of bidding good night instead of going back to drawing room ' lady montbarry turned towards door see jewel case on table resumed ' forget to lock other door there in dressing room ' have

of shadow dimly relieved against starless moonless sky at long interval warning cry of belated gondolier be just audible a turned corner of distant canal called to invisible boat might be approaching in darkness now then nearer dip of oar in water told of viewless passage of other gondola bringing guest back to hotel excepting rare sound mysterious night silence of venice be literally silence of grave leaning on parapet of balcony agnes looked vacantly into black void beneath thought reverted to miserable man who have broken pledged faith to who have died in house change seemed to have come over since arrival in venice new influence appeared to be at work for first time in experience of herself compassion regret be not only emotion aroused in by remembrance of dead montbarry keen sense of wrong that have suffered never yet felt by gentle forgiving nature be felt by now found thinking of bygone day of humiliation almost a harshly a henry westwick have thought of who have rebuked last

attributable by chance to long separation from other embittered perhaps by own vain regret when remembered harsh reception of in paris suddenly conscious of bold question of self abandonment implied returned mechanically to book distrusting unrestrained liberty of own thought what lurking temptation to forbidden tenderness find hiding place in woman dressing gown when be alone in room at night with heart in tomb of dead montbarry must agnes even think of man think of love how shameful how unworthy of for second time tried to interest in guide book once more tried in vain throwing book aside turned desperately to one resource be left to luggage resolved to fatigue without mercy until be weary enough sleepy enough to find safe refuge in bed for little time persisted in monotonous occupation of transferring clothes from trunk to wardrobe large clock in hall striking mid night reminded that be getting late sat down for moment in arm chair by bedside to rest silence in house now caught attention held held disagreeably be everybody in bed asleep surely be time for to follow general example with certain irritable nervous haste rose again undressed ' have lost two hour of rest

trivial question about amusement of venice facetious discussion on relative merit of french italian cookery be proceeding on other little by little sound of talking grew fainter visitor having arranged plan of amusement for day be on way out of hotel in minute two there be silence once more henry turned to window thinking to relieve mind by looking at bright view over canal soon grew wearied of familiar scene morbid fascination seems to be exercised by horrible sight drew back again to ghastly object on floor dream reality how have agnes survived sight of a question passed through mind noticed for first time something lying on floor near head looking closer perceived thin little plate of gold with three false teeth attached to have apparently dropped out loosened by shock when manager let head fall on floor importance of discovery necessity of not too readily communicating to others instantly struck henry here surely be chance if chance remained of identifying shocking relic of humanity lay before dumb witness of crime acting on idea took possession of teeth purposing to use a last mean of inquiry when other attempt at investigation have be tried have failed went back again to window solitude of room began to weigh on spirit a looked out again at view there be soft knock at door hastened to open checked in act doubt occurred to be manager who have knocked called out 'who be there ' voice of agnes answered 'have anything to tell henry ' be hardly able to reply 'not just now ' said confusedly 'forgive if open door will speak to little later ' sweet voice
