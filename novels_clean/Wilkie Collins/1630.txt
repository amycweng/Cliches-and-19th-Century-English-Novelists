secret sense of guilt innocence can not even imagine alone know cause of husband sudden death feigned anxiety about health be adopted a safest mean of enticing into house if formidable conclusion have

here none of know do how soon may want friend offense hope thank sir good morning there be nothing in woman eye indicated unsettled mind nothing in appearance of lip suggested habit of intoxication that strange outburst of familiarity proceeded from strong motive seemed to be more than probable putting together what mr zant have already told what have observed mr rayburn suspected that motive might be found in housekeeper jealousy of master xi reflecting in solitude of own room mr rayburn felt that one prudent course to take must be to persuade mr zant to leave st sallins tried to prepare for strong proceeding when came next day to take lucy out for walk if still regret having forced to accept brother in law invitation be ventured to say forget that be perfect mistress of own action

attempt to resist indeed indeed be not mean person by nature at first thought of speaking to michael not with special motive simply because felt drawn toward a guide helper in whom heart trusted at crisis in life little consideration however suggested to that might be seen speaking to might so do injury while be still hesitating thought came to that aunt motive for sending to bookseller might be to get out of way out of way in house place be not in house out of way in stable next instant idea flashed across mind of watching stable door best bedroom room included be in front of house went up to maid room looked on courtyard ready with excuse if happened to be there be not there placed at window in full view of stable opposite interval elapsed long short can not say be too much excited to

have returned to ladyship mind have recovered tranquillity ix left house for morning ride michael be not in customary spirit with difficulty induced to tell reason have decided on giving notice to leave situation in general employment a soon a must command asked what have happened to justify incomprehensible proceeding on part silently offered letter be written by master whom have served before came to announced that employment a secretary be offered to in house of gentleman who be interested in creditable effort to improve position in world what cost to preserve outward appearance of composure a handed back letter be ashamed to tell spoke to with bitterness wish be gratified said wonder that be eager to leave place reined back horse repeated word eager to leave place be heart broken at leaving be reckless enough to ask why head sank dare tell said went on from one imprudence to what be afraid of asked suddenly looked up at eye answered be possible to fathom folly of woman

return fresh air have not entirely removed smell of burning what be more found heap of ash in grate a to person who have done injury why have be done be mystery beyond fathoming beg pardon miss be sure be not well might advise to return to house accepted advice turned back in tumult of horror amazement filled mind must still feel faint triumph stirring in through when saw how alarmed how anxious be about nothing more passed between on way back confronted by dreadful discovery have now made be silent helpless of guilty person concerned in concealment of birth in desertion of infant nobly born highly bred irreproachable aunt now stood revealed before a one older woman than might have be hard put to to preserve presence of mind in position a mine instinct not reason served in sore need instinct not reason kept passively stupidly silent when got back to house will talk about to morrow be must say to michael when gently lifted from horse excused from appearing at luncheon table drew down blind in sitting room so that face might not betray when lady claudia maternal duty brought upstairs to make inquiry same excuse served in case ride have failed to relieve of headache aunt brief visit led to one result be worth mentioning indescribable horror of felt forced conviction on mind that two must live no longer under same roof while be still trying to face alternative with needful composure uncle presented in anxiety about continued illness must certainly have burst out cry when kind dear old man condoled with if have not brought news with turned back thought on aunt michael have shown general letter have given notice to leave lady claudia be present at time to husband amazement abruptly interfered with personal request to michael to think better of to remain in

hardly know what to do being groom begs to ask if there be impropriety in leaving difficulty to decision tell of request mina strongly advise to decline taking responsibility on answered mechanically accepting uncle suggestion while thought be wholly absorbed in last of many extraordinary proceeding on lady claudia part since michael have entered house there be limit out of book play to innocence of young unmarried woman after what have just heard doubt have thus far perplexed be suddenly completely cleared up said to secret self have human feeling left if son go away know that may never meet again from moment when mind emerged from darkness recovered use of such intelligence courage a naturally possessed from point will find right wrong saw way before took to say that felt for general with whole heart be merely to own must be commonly grateful sat on knee laid cheek against cheek thanked for long long year of kindness to stopped in simple generous way why mina talk a if be going to leave started up went to window opening complaining of heat so concealing from that have unconsciously anticipated event be indeed to come when returned to chair helped to recover by alluding once more to wife feared that health be in way impaired in time when have first met be subject to nervous malady having origin in calamity be never mentioned by of in later day might possibly be suffering again from other form of nervous derangement seriously thought of persuading to send for medical advice under ordinary circumstance vague reference to calamity must not have excited special interest in mind be now in state of morbid suspicion have not heard how long uncle aunt have be married remembered that michael have described a being twenty six year old bearing circumstance in mind struck that might be acting wisely in michael interest if persuaded general to speak further of what have happened at time when met woman whom evil destiny have bestowed on for wife nothing consideration of serving man loved must have reconciled to making own secret use of recollection uncle might innocently confide to a be thought mean must in case for once justified by end before part have little doubt that will think so too found easier task than have anticipated to turn talk back again to day when general have seen lady claudia for first time be proud of circumstance under have won wife ah how heart ached for a saw eye sparkle color mount in fine rugged face be substance of what heard from tell briefly because be still painful to to tell at uncle have met lady claudia at father country

receive address man address favorably to surprise proved to be wrong young lady be touched by simplicity delicacy with lover urged suit have lived among worldly people be man whose devotion must believe to be sincere be married have unusual circumstance occurred have nothing happened general have forgotten nothing x be surely needle must stop here to draw plain inference from event just related person who remembers that shawl in infant be wrapped came from eastern region be associated with french nobleman diplomatic service also that fault of composition in letter found on child be exactly fault likely to have be committed by french maid person who follows trace can find way to truth a found mine returning for moment to hope have formed of being of service to michael have only to say that be at once destroyed when heard of death by drowning of man to whom evidence pointed a father prospect looked equally barren when thought of miserable mother that must openly acknowledge son in position be perhaps not to be expected of woman have courage enough in plainer word heart enough to acknowledge privately called to mind again of apparent caprice contradiction in lady claudia conduct on memorable day when michael have presented to fill vacant place look back with to record of what said did on occasion by light of present knowledge will see that likeness to father must have struck when entered room that statement of age must have correctly described age of son recall action followed after have be exhausted by first successful effort at control withdrawal to window to conceal face clutch at curtain when felt sinking harshness of manner under concealed emotion when ventured to speak to reiterated inconsistency vacillation of conduct followed alike due to protest of nature desperately resisted to last say if did injustice when believed to be incapable of running smallest risk of discovery at prompting of maternal love there remained then only michael to think of remember how have spoken of unknown parent whom neither expected cared to discover still must not reconcile to conscience to accept chance outbreak of temper a sufficient justification for keeping in ignorance of discovery so nearly concerned seemed at least to be duty to make acquainted with true state of feeling before decided to bear burden of silence with to grave what felt duty to do in serious matter determined to do at once besides let honestly own felt lonely desolate oppressed by critical situation in be placed eager for relief that must be to only to hear sound of michael voice

wrote very modestly prettily to say that mother have heard of illness from mr rothsay to express hope must soon be restored to health few day later mr rymer politeness carried to length of taking

to retail dealer over great britain to say nothing of foreign part a to finding out person who have engraved imperfect inscription without knowing where by whom knife have be purchased might a well have looked for proverbial needle in bundle of hay last resource be to have knife photographed with inscribed side uppermost to send copy to police station in kingdom at same time reckoned up mr deluc mean that made investigation into past life on chance that murdered man might have known other might have have quarrel rivalry about woman on former occasion such discovery rewarded found deluc to have led dissipated life to have mixed with very bad company have kept out of reach of law man may be profligate vagabond may insult lady may say threatening thing to in first stinging sensation of
