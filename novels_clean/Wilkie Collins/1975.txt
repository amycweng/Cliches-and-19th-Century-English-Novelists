have condoled with minister on loss that have sustained by death of woman betrayed to a shamelessly deceitful pitilessly determined to reach own cruel end must have be to degrade by telling deliberate lie expressed in answer that honest man naturally feel when be writing to friend in distress carefully abstaining from allusion to memory of wife to place death have left vacant in household letter be sorry to say disappointed offended wrote to more until year have passed time have exerted influence in producing more indulgent frame of mind letter of later date have be preserved will probably be

good friend temper to further trial will be of use to never mind if head swim be used to now listen strange a preface be explanation followed be stranger yet offer shortened simplified version giving accurately substance of what heard minister entered without reserve on mysterious subject of age eunice informed be nearly two year older than helena if outwardly showed superiority of age person acquainted with circumstance under adopted infant have be received into mr gracedieu childless household need only compare so called sister in after life must thereupon identify eldest looking young

have by nature of exposed to injurious comment to embarrassing question to doubt misconception patiently endured in consideration of security have be attained proud of explanation mr gracedieu vanity called upon to acknowledge that curiosity have be satisfied doubt completely set at rest obstinate common sense be not reduced to submission even yet looking back over lapse of seventeen year asked what have happened in long interval to justify anxiety still appeared to trouble friend time harmless curiosity must be gratified by reply expressed in three word nothing have happened then what in heaven name be minister afraid of voice dropped to whisper said be afraid of woman who be woman two of actually proved to be servant employed in mr gracedieu house at bygone time when have brought child home with from prison to point out absurdity of reason that gave for fearing what female curiosity might yet attempt if circumstance happened to encourage must have be mere waste of word dismissing subject next ascertained that minister doubt extended even to two female warder who have be appointed to watch murderess in turn during last day in prison easily relieved mind in case one of warder be dead other have married farmer in australia have exhausted list of suspected person yet there be one more left minister declared that have first met with in official residence at time

past event in life former colleague spoke of time when have performed clerical duty for friend rector of parish church in london have heard again of miss chance of disagreeable prison experience whom have married to dashing dutch gentleman mr tenbruggen must only wonder what have become of mysterious married pair mr gracedieu being undoubtedly ignorant of woman marriage be not easy to say what consequence might be in excitable state if informed of must in probability conclude that knew more of woman than did decided on keeping own counsel for present at least passing at once therefore to one consideration of importance endeavored to find out whether mr gracedieu mr tenbruggen have met have communicated with other in way during long period of separation have taken place between minister if have be so unlucky a to offend be beyond doubt enemy to be dreaded apart however from misfortune of kind must rank in opinion with other harmless object of mr gracedieu distrust in making

to young man in dos often repeated case of attempted poisoning by medicine be so rare that felt bound to put suspicion to test by going round among chemist shop excepting of course shop at own prescription be made up asking if have lately dispensed preparation of digitalis ordered perhaps in larger quantity than usual at second shop visited chemist laughed why doctor said have forgotten own prescription after prescription be asked for produced be on paper used by doctor paper have address printed at top notice added telling patient who came to consult for second time to bring prescription with then there followed in writing tincture of digitalis one ounce with signature at end not badly imitated forgery nevertheless chemist noticed effect discovery have produced on doctor asked if be signature must hardly a honest man have asserted that forgery be signature of own writing so made true reply asked who have presented prescription chemist called to assistant to come forward did tell that knew by sight young lady who brought prescription assistant admitted did tell be miss helena gracedieu did be sure of not having made mistake quite sure chemist then said supplied tincture of digitalis young lady paid for took away with have have information can give sir may now ask if can throw light on matter good friend thought of poor minister so sorely afflicted of famous name so sincerely respected in town in country round said must not undertake to give immediate answer chemist be excessively angry know a well a do said that digitalis given in certain dos

treating of poison with slip of paper left between leaf poison described at place so marked being digitalis paper used being one of own prescription paper if a fear legal investigation into helena conduct be possible event doctor concluded there be evidence that will be obliged to give when be called a witness be belief must have felt greater dismay if long arm of law have laid hold on while be speaking asked what be to be done if leaf house at once doctor replied may escape infamy of being charged with attempt at murder by poison in absence can answer for philip life urge to warn because might be dangerous thing to do be for to decide a member of family whether will run risk tried to speak to of euneece to tell have already related to be in humor to listen to keep for fitter time
