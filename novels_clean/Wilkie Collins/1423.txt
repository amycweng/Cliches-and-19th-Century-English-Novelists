to be done there be absolutely choice to go back to london defeated at point from time to time on return journey wine merchant looked at copy of entry in foundling register there be one among many form of despair perhaps most pitiable of persists in disguising a hope wilding checked in act of throwing useless morsel of paper out of carriage window may lead to something yet thought while live wo part with when die executor will find sealed up with will now mention of will set good wine merchant on new track of thought without diverting mind from engrossing subject must make will immediately application of phrase thoroughfare to case have originated with mr bintrey in first long conference following discovery that sagacious personage have hundred time repeated with obstructive shake of head thoroughfare sir thoroughfare belief be that there be way out of at time of day advice be make comfortable where be in course of protracted consultation magnum of forty five year old port wine have be produced for wetting of mr bintrey legal whistle more clearly saw way through wine more emphatically did not see way through case repeating a often a set glass down empty mr wilding thoroughfare rest be thankful be certain that honest wine merchant anxiety to make will originated in profound conscientiousness though be possible quite consistent with rectitude that may unconsciously have derived feeling of relief from prospect of delegating own difficulty to two other men who be to come after be that a may pursued new track of thought with great ardour lost time in begging george vendale mr bintrey to meet in cripple corner share confidence being three assembled with closed door said mr bintrey addressing new partner on occasion wish to observe before friend client entrusts with further view have endorsed what understand from to have be advice mr vendale what must be advice of sensible man have told that positively must keep secret have spoken with mr goldstraw in presence in absence if anybody be to be trusted be very large if think be to be trusted to extent have pointed out to friend client that to set on foot random inquiry must not only be to raise devil in likeness of swindler in kingdom must also be to waste estate now see mr vendale friend client doe not desire to waste estate on contrary desire to husband for what considers ca say do rightful owner if such rightful owner must ever be found be very much mistaken if ever will be never mind that mr wilding be at least agreed that estate be not to be wasted now have yielded to mr wilding desire to keep advertisement at interval flowing through newspaper cautiously inviting person who may know anything about adopted infant taken from foundling hospital to come to office have pledged that such advertisement will regularly appear have gathered from friend client that meet here to day to take instruction not to give advice be prepared to receive instruction to respect wish will please observe that doe not imply approval of a matter of professional opinion thus mr bintrey talking quite be much at wilding a to vendale yet in spite of care for client be so amused by client quixotic conduct a to eye from time to time with twinkling eye in light of highly comical curiosity nothing observed wilding can be clearer only wish head be a clear a yours mr bintrey if feel that singing in coming on hinted lawyer with alarmed glance put off mean interview not at thank said wilding what be going to excite mr wilding urged lawyer be going to said wine merchant mr bintrey george

remains said lawyer with one shrug of shoulder to get into technical binding form to execute attest now doe that press be there hurry about be not going to die yet sir mr bintrey answered wilding gravely when be going to die be within other knowledge than yours mine will be glad to have matter off mind if please be lawyer client again rejoined bintrey who for nonce have become almost sympathetic if day week here at same hour will suit mr vendale will enter in diary that attend accordingly appointment be made in due sequence kept will be formally signed sealed delivered witnessed

suspect that have won heart soul did care to think at about so did did up down gamut above line below line dear dear poor restless heart of humanity to think that men who be mummy thousand of year ago did same ever found secret how to be quiet after do think george wilding asked next day of mr obenreizer wo ask what think of miss obenreizer know said vendale never did know what to think of be well informed clever said wilding certainly clever good musician have played very well sung very well overnight unquestionably good musician talk well yes said george vendale ruminating talk well do know wilding oddly occurs to a think about that doe keep silence well how do mean be not obtrusively talkative mean when be silent can hardly help vaguely though perhaps most unjustly mistrusting take people whom know like take one know like soon done good fellow said wilding take did bargain for foresee returned vendale laughing however take reflect for moment be approving knowledge of interesting face mainly founded however various momentary expression may include on face when be silent think be said wilding think so too now see when obenreizer speaks in other word when be allowed to explain away come out right enough when have not opportunity of explaining away come out rather wrong therefore be that say doe not keep silence well passing hastily in review such face a know trust be inclined to think now give mind to that none of keep silence well proposition in physiognomy being new to wilding be at first slow to admit until asking question whether mr goldstraw kept silence well remembering that face in repose decidedly invited trustfulness be a glad a men usually be to believe what desire to believe a be very slow to regain spirit health partner a mean of setting up perhaps also with contingent obenreizer view reminded of musical scheme of in connection with family how singing class be to be formed in house choir in neighbouring church class be established speedily two three of people having already musical knowledge singing tolerably choir soon followed latter be led chiefly taught by wilding who have hope of converting dependent into so many foundling in respect of capacity to sing sacred chorus now obenreizers being skilled musician be easily brought to pas that must be asked to join musical union guardian ward consenting guardian consenting for be necessarily brought to pas vendale life became life of absolute thraldom enchantment for in mouldy christopher wren church on sunday with dearly beloved brother assembled met together five twenty strong be not that voice that shot like light into darkest place thrilling wall pillar a though be piece of heart what time too madame dor in corner of high pew turning back upon everybody everything

come far away from crowd pursue a mount higher higher higher melting into azure distance rise to supremest height of love here then must pretty bodice clocked stocking silver buckled shoe be like

to muddle harmony by taking share in evincing supremest contempt for scale such like rudiment of music indeed seldom captivate mere listener joey did at first give up whole business for bad job whole of performer for set of howling dervish descrying trace of unmuddled harmony in part song one day gave two under cellarmen faint hope of getting on towards something in course of time anthem of handel led to further encouragement from though objected that great musician must have be down in of foreign cellar pretty much for to go say same thing so many time over took in how might considered certain sign of having took in somehow on third occasion public appearance of mr jarvis with flute of odd man with violin performance of duet by two did so astonish that solely of own impulse motion became

obenreizer dropped back into chair mr vendale said petrify will wait rejoined vendale until have recovered one word before recover have said nothing about to niece have opened whole heart to niece have reason to hope what interposed obenreizer have made proposal to niece without first asking for authority to pay address to struck hand on table lost hold over for first time in vendale experience of sir exclaimed indignantly what sort of conduct be a man of honour speaking to man of honour how can justify can only justify a one of english institution said vendale quietly admire english institution ca honestly tell mr obenreizer regret have done can only assure have not acted in matter with intentional disrespect towards said may ask to tell plainly what objection see to favouring suit see immense objection answered obenreizer that niece be not on social equality together niece be daughter of poor peasant be son of gentleman do honour added lowering again gradually to customary polite level deserves have most grateful acknowledgment inequality be too glaring sacrifice be too great english be proud people mr vendale have observed enough of country to see marriage a propose must be scandal here not hand must be held out to peasant wife best friend must desert one moment said vendale interposing on side may claim without great arrogance to know more of country people in general of own friend in particular than do in estimation of everybody whose opinion be worth having wife must be one sufficient justification of marriage if did not feel certain observe say certain that be offering position can accept without so much a shadow of humiliation must never cost what might have asked to be wife be there other obstacle that see have personal objection to obenreizer spread out hand in courteous protest personal objection exclaimed dear sir bare question be painful to be men of business pursued vendale naturally expect to satisfy have mean of supporting wife can

said vendale of knowing that love obenreizer stood silent for moment with film over eye faintly perceptible beat becoming visible again in cheek if will excuse for few minute said with ceremonious politeness must like to have opportunity of speaking to niece with word bowed quitted room left by vendale thought a necessary result of interview thus far turned instinctively to consideration of obenreizer motif have put obstacle in way of courtship be now putting obstacle in way of marriage marriage offering advantage even ingenuity must not dispute on face of conduct be incomprehensible what did mean seeking under surface for answer to question remembering that obenreizer be man of about own age also that marguerite be strictly speaking half niece only vendale asked with lover ready jealousy whether have rival to fear a well a guardian to conciliate thought just crossed mind more sense of marguerite kiss still lingering on cheek reminded gently that even jealousy of moment be now treason to on reflection seemed most likely that personal motive of kind might suggest true explanation of obenreizer conduct marguerite grace beauty be precious ornament in little household gave special social attraction special social importance armed obenreizer with certain influence in reserve must always depend upon to make house attractive might always bring more le to bear on forwarding of own private end be sort of man to resign such advantage a be here implied without obtaining fullest possible compensation for loss connection by marriage with vendale offered solid advantage beyond doubt there be hundred of men in london with far greater power far wider influence than vendale possessed be possible that man ambition secretly looked higher than highest prospect must be offered to by alliance now proposed for niece a question passed through vendale mind man reappeared to answer not to answer a event might prove marked change be visible in obenreizer when resumed place manner be le assured there be plain trace about mouth of recent agitation have not be successfully composed have said something referring to vendale to have raised marguerite spirit have placed for first time face to face with resolute assertion of niece will might might not be only be certain looked like man who have met with repulse have spoken to niece began find mr vendale even influence have not entirely blinded to social objection to proposal may ask returned vendale if be only result of interview with miss obenreizer momentary flash leapt out through obenreizer film be master of situation

best grace submit with best grace on certain condition let revert to statement of pecuniary position have objection to dear sir most amazing most audacious objection from man in position to man in what be have honoured by making proposal for niece hand for present with best thanks respect beg to decline why because be not rich enough objection a speaker have foreseen took vendale completely by surprise for moment be speechless income be fifteen hundred year pursued obenreizer in miserable country must fall on knee before income say 'what princely fortune ' in wealthy england sit a be say ' modest independence dear sir nothing more enough perhaps for wife in own rank of life who have social prejudice to conquer not more than half enough for wife who be meanly born foreigner who have social prejudice against sir if niece be ever to marry will have what call uphill work of in taking place at starting yes yes be not view remains immovably remains view for for niece sake claim that uphill work will be made a smooth a possible material advantage can have to help ought in common justice to be hers now tell mr vendale on fifteen hundred year can wife have house in fashionable

accepts term in other word submits to be guided by guardian regard for welfare by guardian superior knowledge of world threw back in chair in firm reliance on position in full possession of excellent temper open assertion of own interest in situation in vendale be now placed seemed to be for present at least hopeless found literally left with ground to stand on whether obenreizer objection be genuine product of obenreizer own view of case whether be simply delaying marriage in hope of ultimately breaking off altogether in of event present resistance on vendale part must be equally useless there be help for to yield making best term that must on own side protest against condition impose on began naturally said obenreizer dare say must protest in place say however pursued vendale accept term in case must be permitted to make two stipulation on part in first place will expect to be allowed to see niece aha to see niece to make in a great hurry to be married a be suppose say must see perhaps without permission decidedly how delightfully frank how exquisitely english will see mr vendale on certain day will appoint together what next objection to income proceeded vendale have taken
