impression of absent woman who a greatly fear have got on weak amatory side of mean offense mr germaine take offense doctor excuse for speaking plainly rational explanation be thrown away on will readily excuse answered mr macglue rather that be entirely of opinion believe in rational explanation be surprising to say least of do believe in inquired mr macglue declined to let hurry wait little said there be irrational explanation to try next maybe will fit to present state of mind better than other will say time that have really seen ghost double of living person very good if can suppose disembodied spirit to appear in earthly clothing of silk merino a case may be be great stretch to suppose next that same spirit be capable of holding mortal pencil of writing mortal word in mortal sketching book if ghost vanishes ghost did seems supernaturally appropriate that writing must follow example vanish too reason of vanishment may be if want reason that ghost doe not like letting stranger like into secret that vanishing be settled habit of ghost of everything associated with that ghost have changed mind in course of three hour being ghost of woman be sure be not wonderful doe care to see 'when full moon shine on saint anthony well ' there be irrational explanation for speaking for be bound to add set pin value on explanation mr macglue sublime indifference to side of

that caught faintest sound made by passage of night breeze through rush of lake inside bed chamber be even more keenly sensible of weird night noise in heavy furniture of room of sudden settlement of extinct coal in grate so familiar to bad sleeper so startling to overwrought nerve be not scientifically correct statement exactly describes condition night to say that one half of be asleep other half awake how many hour of night have passed when irritable sense of hearing became aware of new sound in room can not tell can only relate found on sudden listening intently with fast closed eye sound that disturbed be faintest sound imaginable a of something soft light traveling slowly over surface of carpet brushing just loud enough to be heard little by little sound came nearer nearer to bed then suddenly stopped just a fancied be close by still lay immovable with closed eye drowsily waiting for next sound might reach ear drowsily content with silence if silence continued thought if thought must be called be drifting back again into former course when became suddenly conscious of soft breathing just above next moment felt touch on forehead light soft tremulous like touch of lip have kissed there be momentary pause then low sigh trembled through silence then heard again still small sound of something brushing way over carpet traveling time from bed moving so rapidly that in moment more be lost in silence of night still stupefied by drug have taken must lazily wonder what have happened must do more have living lip really touched be sound have heard really sound of sigh be delusion beginning ending in dream time passed without deciding caring to decide question minute by minute composing influence of draught began at last to strengthen hold on brain cloud seemed to pas softly over last waking impression one after tie broke gently that held to conscious life drifted peacefully into perfect sleep shortly after sunrise awoke when regained use of memory first clear recollection be recollection of soft breathing have felt above then of touch on forehead of sigh have heard after be possible that one have entered room in night be quite possible have not locked door
