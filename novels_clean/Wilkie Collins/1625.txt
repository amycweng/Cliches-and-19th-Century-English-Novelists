reason first everybody loved crayford be too going on dark way that others have taken before forced to seat on one of locker steady old fellow said kindly steady crayford yielded writhing inwardly under sense of own helplessness what in god name must do must denounce wardour to captain helding on bare suspicion without so much a shadow of proof to justify what said captain must decline to insult one of officer by even mentioning monstrous accusation to captain must conclude a others have already concluded that crayford mind be giving way under stress of cold privation hope literally
