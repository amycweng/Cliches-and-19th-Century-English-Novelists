quite new to then come see man be now in london be entirely at service in hour more romayne be presented to well bred amiable gentleman in prime of life smoking reading newspaper bowl of long pipe

run on errand for muse of history do smoke not even tobacco must soothe romayne wasted irritable nerve father benwell thing to men cheerfully accepted cigar from box on table father benwell posse social virtue mr winterfield ran on will have coffee largest sugar basin that hotel can produce can quite understand literary labor have tried nerve said to romayne when have ordered coffee mere title of work overwhelms idle man like 'the origin of religion what immense subject how far must look back to find out first worshiper of human family where be hieroglyphic mr romayne will give earliest information in unknown center of africa among ruined city of yucatan own idea a ignorant man be that first of form of worship must have be worship of sun be shocked father benwell confess have certain sympathy with sun worship in east especially rising of sun be surely grandest of object visible symbol of beneficent deity who give life warmth light to world of creation very grand doubt remarked father benwell sweetening coffee not to be compared with noble sight at rome when pope blesses christian world from balcony of st peter so much for professional feeling said mr winterfield surely something depends on what sort of man pope be if have lived in time of alexander sixth must have called part of noble sight certainly at proper distance father benwell briskly replied ah heretic only know worst side of most unhappy pontiff mr winterfield have reason to believe that felt privately truest remorse must require very good evidence to persuade of touched romayne on sad side of own personal experience perhaps said believe in remorse pardon mr winterfield rejoined only distinguish between false remorse true remorse will say more of alexander sixth father benwell if want illustration will supply give offense true remorse depends to mind on man accurate knowledge of own motif far from common knowledge in experience say for instance have committed serious offense romayne must not resist interrupting say have killed one of fellow creature suggested very well if know that really meant to kill for vile purpose of own if by mean always follows be really capable of feeling enormity of own crime be a think true remorse murderer a be have in case moral worth still left in if did not mean to kill man if death be misfortune a well a if a frequently happens be nevertheless troubled by remorse true cause lie in own inability fairly to realize own motif before look to result be ignorant victim of false remorse if will only ask boldly what have blinded to true state of case will find mischief due to misdirected appreciation of own importance be nothing egotism in disguise entirely agree with said father benwell have have occasion to say same thing in confessional mr winterfield looked at dog changed subject do like dog mr romayne asked see spaniel eye saying that like tail begging to take notice of romayne caressed dog rather absently new friend have unconsciously presented to new view of darker aspect of own life winterfield refined pleasant manner generous readiness in placing treasure of library at stranger disposal have already appealed irresistibly to romayne sensitive nature favorable impression be now greatly strengthened by briefly bold treatment have just heard of subject in be seriously interested must see more of man be thought a patted companionable spaniel father benwell trained observation followed vivid change of expression on romayne face marked eager look in eye a lifted head from dog to dog master priest saw opportunity took do remain long at ten acre lodge said to romayne hardly know a yet have other plan at present inherit place think from late aunt lady berrick tone of reply be not encouraging romayne felt interest in talking of ten acre lodge father benwell persisted be told by mr eyrecourt went on lady berrick have fine picture be still at lodge certainly must live in house without picture father benwell looked at winterfield taste in common between mr romayne said besides liking for dog at once produced desired result romayne eagerly invited winterfield to see picture there be not many of said be really worth looking at when will come sooner better winterfield answered cordially will to morrow do by noonday light whenever please time be mine among other accomplishment benwell be chess player if thought at moment have be expressed in language must have said check to queen chapter iv end of honeymoon on next morning winterfield arrived alone at romayne house having be included a matter of course in invitation to see picture father benwell have made excuse have asked leave to defer proposed visit from point of view have nothing further to gain by being present at second meeting between two men in absence of stella have on romayne own authority that be in constant attendance on mother that husband be alone either mr eyrecourt will get better will die father benwell reasoned will make constant inquiry after health in case will know when mr romayne return to ten acre lodge after domestic event next time mr winterfield visit mr romayne will go see picture be one of defect of super subtle intellect to trust too implicitly to calculation to leave nothing to chance once twice already father benwell have be in popular phrase little too clever chance have thrown out a event happened chance be destined to throw out once more of most modest pretension in regard to number size picture collected by late lady berrick be masterly work of modern art with few exception have be produced by matchless english landscape painter of century since there be formal gallery here picture be so few that must be hung in excellent light in different living room of villa turner constable collins danby callcott linnell master of beaupark house passed from one to other with enjoyment of man who thoroughly appreciated truest finest landscape art that world have yet seen have better not have asked here said to romayne in quaintly good humored way ca part with picture when say good by to day will find calling here again again till be perfectly sick of look at sea piece who think of brush palette of painter there truth to nature poetical feeling go hand in hand together be absolutely lovely must kiss picture be in romayne study when odd outburst of enthusiasm escaped winterfield happened to look toward writing table next page of manuscript blotted interlined with correction at once attracted attention be that forthcoming history asked be not one of author who perform process of correction mentally revise improve with pen in hand romayne looked at in surprise suspect mr winterfield have used pen for other purpose than writing letter indeed pay undeserved compliment when come to see in devonshire can show manuscript corrected proof left by great writer collected by father knowledge of secret of craft have be gained by examining literary treasure if public only knew that writer worthy of name be severest critic of own book before ever get into hand of reviewer how surprised must be man who have worked in full fervor of composition yesterday be same man who sits in severe merciless judgment to day on what have produced what fascination there must be in art exacts receives such double labor a romayne thought not unkindly of wife stella have once asked how long time be usually occupied in writing one page reply have filled with pity wonder why do take trouble have gently remonstrated must be just same to people darling if did in time by way of changing topic romayne led visitor into room have picture here said belongs to newer school of painting have be talking of hard work in one art there be in yes said winterfield there be misdirected hard work have be guided by critical faculty doe know where to stop try to admire end in pitying poor artist look at leafless felled tree in middle distance little twig on smallest branch be conscientiously painted result be like colored photograph look at landscape a series of separate part discover twig on tree see whole in nature want to see whole in picture canvas present triumph of patience pain produced exactly a piece of embroidery be produced in little separate bit worked with same mechanically complete care turn away from to shrubbery there with ungrateful sense of relief walked to window a spoke looked out on ground in front of house at same moment noise of rolling wheel became audible on drive open carriage appeared at turn in road winterfield called romayne to window visitor began suddenly drew back without saying word more romayne looked out recognized wife excuse for one moment said be mr romayne on morning improvement in fluctuating state of mr eyrecourt health have given stella of opportunity of passing hour two with husband so highly prized romayne withdrew to meet at door too hurriedly to notice winterfield standing in corner to have retreated like man petrified stella have got out of carriage when husband reached porch ascended few step led to hall a slowly painfully a if have be infirm old woman delicately tinted color in face have faded to ashy white have seen winterfield at window for moment romayne looked at in speechless consternation led into nearest room opened out of hall took in arm love nursing of mother have completely broken down said with tenderest pity for if wo think of must think of for sake remain here take rest that need will be tyrant stella for first time wo let go back roused tried to smile hid sad result from in kiss do feel anxiety fatigue said mother be really improving if only continues blessed sense of relief will make strong again paused roused courage in anticipation of next word so trivial so terrible that must sooner later be pronounced have visitor said did see at window really delightful man know will like under other circumstance must have introduced be not well enough to see stranger today be too determined to prevent winterfield from ever entering house again to shrink from meeting be not so ill a think lewis said bravely when go to new friend will go with be little tired that be romayne looked at anxiously let get glass of wine said consented really felt need of a turned away to ring bell put question have be in mind from moment when have seen winterfield how did become acquainted with gentleman through father benwell be not surprised by answer suspicion of priest have remained in mind from night of lady loring future of married life depended on capacity to check growing intimacy between two men in conviction found courage to face winterfield how must meet impulse of moment pointed to shortest way out of dreadful position in be placed be to treat like stranger drank glass of wine took romayne arm must keep friend waiting longer resumed come a crossed hall looked suspiciously toward house door have taken opportunity of leaving villa at other time must have remembered that plainest law of good breeding compelled to wait for romayne return own knowledge of world must tell that act of gross rudeness committed by well bred man must inevitably excite suspicion of unworthy motive might perhaps connect that motive with unexpected appearance at house romayne opened door entered room together mr winterfield let introduce to mr romayne bowed to other spoke conventional word proper to occasion effort that cost showed romayne perceived unusual formality in wife manner strange disappearance of winterfield easy grace of address be one of few men in day who be shy in presence of woman be change in stella attributable perhaps to state of health explanation might in case be right one tried to set at ease mr winterfield be so pleased with picture that mean to come see again said to wife one of favorite happens to be favorite too tried to look at winterfield eye sank must turn toward be be sea piece in study said to faintly yes answered with formal politeness seems to to be one of painter finest work romayne looked at in unconcealed wonder to what flat commonplace winterfield lively enthusiasm have sunk in stella presence perceived that unfavorable impression have be produced on husband interposed with timely suggestion motive be not only to divert romayne attention from winterfield to give reason for leaving room little water color drawing in bedroom be by same artist said mr winterfield might like to see if will ring bell lewis will send maid for romayne have never allowed servant to touch work of art since day when zealous housemaid have tried to wash one of plaster cast made reply wife have anticipated no said will fetch drawing turned gayly to winterfield prepare for work that must like to kiss smiled left room instant door be closed stella approached winterfield beautiful face became distorted by mingled expression of rage contempt spoke to in fierce peremptory whisper have consideration for left look at a put question revealed most complete contrast between face hers compassionate sorrow be in eye tender forbearance respect spoke in tone a answered have more than consideration for stella angrily interrupted how dare call by christian name remonstrated with gentleness might have touched heart of woman do still refuse to believe that never deceived have time not softened heart to yet be more contemptuous toward than ever spare protestation said heard enough of two year since will do what ask of know will put end to acquaintance with husband put end to repeated vehemently from day at once forever can trust to do do think must have entered house if have known be husband made that reply with sudden change in with rising color in firm tone of indignation in moment more voice softened again kind blue eye rested on sadly devotedly may trust to do more than ask resumed have made mistake what mistake when mr romayne introduced met like stranger left choice to do a did wish to be stranger sharpest reply made change in manner spoke a kindly a patiently a ever forget that mother be guest at beaupark two year ago stella understood what meant more in instant remembered that father benwell have be at beaupark house have heard of visit clasped hand in speechless terror winterfield gently reassured must not be frightened said be in last degree unlikely that mr romayne will ever find out that be at house if doe if deny will do for must do for other human creature will deny too be safe from discovery be happy forget for first time showed sign of relenting turned head away sighed although mind be full of serious necessity of warning against father benwell have not even command enough over own voice to ask how have become acquainted with priest manly devotion perfect pathetic sincerity of respect pleaded with in spite of herself for moment paused to recover composure in moment romayne returned to with drawing in hand there said be nothing time child gathering flower on outskirt of wood what do think of thought of larger work winterfield answered must look at by hour together consulted watch time be hard master tell that visit must come to end thank most sincerely bowed to stella romayne thought guest might have taken english freedom of shaking hand when will come look at picture again asked will dine with see how bear lamplight be sorry to say must beg to excuse plan be altered since met yesterday be obliged to leave london romayne be unwilling to part with on term will let know when be next in town said certainly with short answer hurried away romayne waited little in hall before went back to wife stella reception of winterfield though not positively ungracious be nevertheless reverse of encouraging what extraordinary caprice have made insensible to social attraction of man so unaffectedly agreeable be not wonderful that winterfield cordiality must have be chilled by cold welcome that have received from mistress of house at same time allowance be to be made for influence of stella domestic anxiety sympathy be claimed by state of health although husband shrank from distressing by immediate reference to reception of friend must not disguise from that have disappointed when went back to room stella be lying on sofa with face turned toward wall be in tear be afraid to let see wo disturb said withdrew to study precious volume winterfield have so kindly placed at disposal be on table waiting for father benwell have lost little by not being present at introduction of winterfield to stella have witnessed plainer betrayal of emotion when met unexpectedly in lord loring picture gallery if have seen romayne reading in study stella cry secretly on sofa might have written to rome by day post might have announced that have sown first seed of disunion between husband wife chapter v father benwell correspondence to secretary s j rome in last few hasty line be only able to inform of unexpected arrival of mr romayne while

only answer how do like mr romayne inquired next laid down pipe looked at attentively face flatter defied discovery inhaled mouthful of tobacco began to play with dog if must answer question burst out suddenly did get very gracious reception from mr romayne there abruptly stopped be thoroughly transparent man see straight into mind through eye perceived that be only telling part perhaps very small part of truth can account for such reception a describe asked answered shortly perhaps can account for went on did mr romayne tell wife be mean of introducing to fixed searching look on mr romayne might have said so when left to receive wife at door in case mr winterfield explanation be a plain a sun at noonday mr romayne be strong protestant be catholic priest accepted method of accounting for reception with alacrity must not have imposed on child see have relieved from further necessity of accounting for conduct of mr romayne lady religious prejudice proceeded in friendliest way be never taken seriously by sensible man have placed mr romayne under obligation to kindness be eager to improve acquaintance with will go again to ten acre lodge gave short answer think not said be sorry to

again since last met first conventional civility be dedicated of course to wife be still in attendance on mother mr eyrecourt be now considered to be out of danger good lady who be ready enough to recommend doctor to other people persists in thinking that be too robust person to require medical help herself physician in attendance trust entirely to daughter to persuade to persevere with necessary course of medicine suppose that trouble by mentioning trumpery circumstance without reason will have occasion to return to mr eyrecourt doctor before have be five minute in company romayne asked if have seen winterfield since visit to ten acre lodge said have seen waited anticipating next question romayne fulfilled expectation inquired if winterfield have left london there be certain case a be told by medical authority in dangerous system of bleeding patient still have advantage there be other case in dangerous system of telling truth becomes equally judicious said to romayne if

there be something so cheering attractive in manner have just boldness novelty of view in opinion appeal to man like be pleasant future to look forward to must be sacrificed to what to woman caprice from point of view be frame of mind to be encouraged tried experiment of modestly taking blame on suggested that might be quite innocently answerable for romayne disappointment looked at thoroughly puzzled repeated what have said to winterfield did mention to mr romayne be mean of introducing be too impatient to let finish sentence did mention to mr romayne said what of pardon for reminding that mr romayne have protestant prejudice rejoined mr winterfield must fear not be very welcome to a friend of catholic priest be almost angry with for suggesting very explanation have proved so acceptable to winterfield nonsense cried wife be far too well bred woman to let prejudice express in way winterfield personal appearance must have inspired with unreasonable antipathy stopped turned away

can there be asked turned on sharply know do ventured on courteous remonstrance dear sir if ca find reason how can must have be sudden antipathy a say such thing do happen between stranger suppose be right in assuming that mr romayne mr winterfield be stranger eye flashed with sudden sinister brightness new idea have caught light in mind met a stranger said there stopped again returned to window

being in hurry be not in hurry now time sometimes brings opportunity opportunity be worth waiting for let make clear by example man of headlong disposition in place must have probably spoken of miss

wife have be winterfield guest in devonshire when affected to meet former host on footing of stranger in meanwhile give penrose ample opportunity for innocently widening breach between husband wife
