wild fitful glare of torch when heightened colour worn feature eager expression of woman be beheld here shadowed there brightened in close opposition to pale youthful reposing countenance of girl

quick instinct of terror ran up to side of young goth then seizing hand hand still grasped battle axe knelt down kissed uttering hurried broken ejaculation a clasped to bosom tremulousness of voice

at fearful moment divinity of mercy have now braced determination of young goth to meet emergency bright steady eye quailed not for instant a encountered frantic glance of fury before with one hand barred goisvintha from advancing step other must not disengage from girl who now clasped kissed more eagerly than before 'you do to tempt to anger ' said goisvintha altering manner with sudden palpable cunning more ominous of peril to fugitive than fury have hitherto displayed jest at because have failed in patience like child will shed blood be honourable will hold to promise will shed blood continued exultingly seating on oaken chest that have previously occupied resting clenched hand on knee will wait to see ' at moment voice step be heard outside tent hermanric instantly raised trembling girl from ground supporting by arm advanced to ascertain cause of disturbance be confronted next instant by old warrior of superior rank attached to person of alaric who be followed by small party of ordinary soldiery of camp 'among woman appointed by king to office of tending for night sick wounded on march be goisvintha sister of hermanric if be here let approach follow ' said chief of

remained silent during interval thought of numerian wandered from reflection have hitherto occupied few mournful word daughter have spoken have be sufficient to banish fulness of joy from heart to turn from happy contemplation of present to dark recollection of past vague doubt fear now mingled with gratitude hope involuntarily thought reverted to what must fain have forgotten for ever to morning when have driven antonina from home baseless apprehension of return of treacherous pagan profligate employer with return of victim despairing conviction of own helplessness infirmity rose startlingly in mind eye wandered vacantly round room hand closed trembling over daughter form then suddenly releasing arose a one panic stricken exclaiming 'the door must be secured ulpius may be near

entered house ere hurriedly closed barred cast momentary glance on street beyond gaunt figure of slave still moved wearily to fro amid mockery of festal preparation in vetranio palace here there few ghastly figure lay on ground contemplating in languid amazement over other part of street deadly tranquillity of plague famine still prevailed hurriedly ascending step antonina hastened to assure father that have obeyed command that be now secure from intrusion from without during brief absence new more ominous prospect of calamity have presented before old man mind a entered room saw that have returned to couch that be holding before little wooden bowl have contained last supply of food be now empty addressed not word to when heard enter feature be rigid with horror despair a looked down on empty bowl muttered vacantly 'it be last provision remained be that exhausted beast of forest carry food to young have taken last morsel from child ' in instant utter desolateness of situation forgotten in first joy of meeting forced with appalling vividness upon antonina mind endeavoured to speak of comfort hope to father fearful reality of famine in city now rose palpably before suspended vain word of solace on lip in midst of still populous rome within sight of surrounding plain where creative sun ripened hour by hour vegetation of teeming earth where field granary displayed profusely abundant store father daughter now looked on other a helpless to replace exhausted provision of food a if have be abandoned on raft of shipwrecked in unexplored sea banished to lonely island whose inland product be withered by infected wind around whose arid shore ran such destroying water a seethe over 'cities of plain ' silence have long prevailed in room bitter reflection still held despairing father patient daughter speechless alike be at length interrupted by hollow melancholy voice from street pronouncing in form of public notice word publius dalmatius messenger of roman senate proclaim that in order to clear street from dead three thousand sestertii will be given by prefect for ten body be cast over wall be true decree of senate ' voice ceased sound of applause murmur of popular tumult be heard in answer then after interval be once more faintly audible a messenger passed on repeated decree in street then silence again sank down over thing more awfully pervading than before word of proclamation when repeated in distance a when spoken under window have clearly reached numerian ear mind already sinking in despair be riveted on what have heard from woe boding voice of herald with fascination a absorbing a rivet eye of traveller already giddy on summit of precipice upon spectacle of yawning gulf beneath when sound of proclamation have finally died away unhappy father dropped empty bowl have hitherto mechanically continued to hold before glancing affrightedly at daughter groaned to 'the corps be to be cast over wall dead be to be flung forth to wind of heaven there be help for in city o god god may die body may be cast away like rest may live to see ' rose suddenly from couch reason seemed for moment to be shaken a tottered to window cry 'food food will give house contains for morsel of food have nothing to support own child will starve before by tomorrow if have food be citizen of rome demand help from senate food food ' in tone

on for day day past such fruitless appeal a have be heard heard unconcernedly at hour in street of rome now ringing through heavy air in shriek of delirium now faintly audible in last faltering murmur of exhaustion despair thus vainly entreating help pity from populace who have ceased to give one to feel other numerian might long have remained now daughter approached side drawing gently towards couch said in tender solemn accent father that god sent raven to feed elijah replenished widow cruse will not desert for have restored to other have sent not to perish in famine to watch over ' have

feeble power unequal to sustain a fell back panting upon seat eye assumed wild unnatural expression despair of mind weakness of body have together partially unhinged faculty when daughter affrightedly approached to soothe succour impatiently waved back began to speak in dull hoarse monotonous voice pressing hand firmly over brow directing eye backwards forward incessantly on object after object in

goisvintha be in sight a numerian looked around after having carefully viewed empty street be advancing towards at quickened pace for instant father looked on steadily a approached in instant determination be formed flight of step at foot led to narrow doorway of small temple nearest building to ignorant whether goisvintha might not be secretly supported by companion in ceaseless pursuit resolved to secure place for antonina a temporary refuge at least while standing before must oblige woman to declare purpose if followed even there in moment have begun ascent of step with exhausted girl by side arrived at summit guided before into doorway stopped on threshold to look round again goisvintha be nowhere to be seen not duped by woman sudden disappearance into belief that have departed from street persisting in resolution to lead daughter to place of repose where might most immediately feel secure might therefore most readily recover self possession numerian drew antonina with into temple lingered there for moment ere departed to watch street from portico outside light in building be dim be admitted only from small aperture in roof through narrow doorway where be intercepted by overhanging bulk of outer portico crooked pile of dark heavy looking substance on floor rose high towards ceiling in obscure interior irregular in form flung together one over other in strange disorder for most part dusky in hue yet here there gleaming at point with metallic brightness object presented mysterious indefinite startling appearance be impossible on first view of confused arrangement to discover what be to guess for what purpose must have be pile together on floor of deserted temple from moment when have first attracted numerian observation attention be fixed on a looked faint thrill of suspicion vague inexplicable without apparent cause object struck chill to heart have moved step forward to examine hidden space at back of pile when further advance be instantly stopped by appearance of man who walked forth from dressed in floating purple edged robe white fillet of pagan priest before father daughter must speak even before must move to depart stepped up to placing hand on shoulder of confronted in silence at moment when stranger approached numerian raised hand to thrust back in so doing fixed eye on man countenance a ray of light from doorway floated over instantly arm remained outstretched rigid then dropped to side expression of horror on face of child became reflected a be on face of parent moved under hand of dweller in temple

when ulpius slowly removed grasp from shoulder separated locking hand of in cold bony finger began to speak voice be deep solemn accent in hard unvarying tone seemed to express human emotion eye far from brightening a spoke relapsed into dull vacant insensibility connection between action of speech accompanying explaining action of look be observable in men seemed lost in be fearful to behold

quickening of lofty obscure idea of celebrity success of priestly honour influence of splendour glory of god have prompted last word moved suddenly drew victim of dangerous caprice few step farther into interior of temple then led close up to lofty pile of object have first attracted numerian eye on entering building 'kneel adore ' cried madman fiercely replacing hand on shoulder pressing to ground stand before god in presence of high priest ' girl head sank forward hid face in hand father looked up tremblingly at pile eye have insensibly become more accustomed to dim light of temple now saw more distinctly object composing mass rose above hundred of image of god in gold silver wood many in latter material being larger than life canopy vestment furniture utensil of ancient pagan form be heaped together without order arrangement on floor to height of full fifteen foot there be something at once hideous grotesque in appearance of pile monstrous figure of idol with rude carved drapery symbolic weapon lay in wild variety of position presented startling eccentricity of line more especially towards higher portion of mass where have evidently be flung up from ground by hand have raised structure drapery mixed among image furniture be here coiled serpent like around there hung down towards ground waving slow solemn in breeze wound through temple doorway smaller object of gold silver scattered irregularly over mass shone out from like gleaming eye while pile seen in such place under dusky light looked like vast misshapen monster gloomy embodiment of bloodiest superstition of paganism growth of damp air teeming ruin of shadow darkness of accursed infected solitude even in position a well a in object of be composed pile wore ominous startling aspect crooked outline expanding towards top be bent over fearfully in direction of doorway seemed a if single hand might sway in uncertain balance hurl instantly in one solid mass to floor many toilsome hour have passed away long secret labour have be expended in erection of weird tottering structure be work of one hand night after night have pagan entered deserted temple in surrounding street pillaged of content to enrich favoured shrine removal of idol from appointed place must have be sacrilege in meaner man be in eye dread privilege of high priest alone have borne heavy burden torn asunder strong fastening journeyed journeyed again for hour together over same gloomy street without loitering in task have raised treasure image one above have strengthened base heightened summit of precious sacred heap have repaired rebuilt whenever crumbled fell new babel that longed to rear to olympus of temple roof with resolute patience perseverance that failure fatigue must overcome be dearest purpose of dreamy superstition to surround with innumerable deity a well a to assemble innumerable worshipper to make sacred place of habitation mighty pantheon a well a point of juncture for scattered congregation of pagan world be ambition in madness expanded to fiercest fanaticism a now stood erect with captive beneath glaring eye looked awe struck when fixed on idol uplifted arm in solemn ecstatic triumph in low tone poured forth invocation wild intermingled fragmentary a barbarous altar solitary exertion have reared be effect on numerian of savage confused ejaculation be unnoticed even unheard by antonina for now while madman voice softened to undertone while hid surrounding object from eye sens be awakened to sound in temple have never remarked before rapid current of tiber washed foundation wall of one side of building within clear lulling bubble of water be audible with singular distinctness besides shriller sound caught ear on summit of temple roof still remained several row of little gilt bell originally placed there partly with intention of ornamenting portion of outer structure partly in order that noise produced when agitated by wind might scare bird from settling in flight on consecrated edifice sound produced by bell be silvery high pitched now when breeze be strong rang together merrily continuously now when fell note be faint separate irregular almost plaintive in pure metallic softness however tone might vary under capricious influence of wind seemed always wonderfully mingled within temple with low eternal bubbling of river filled up slightest pause in pleasant chiming of bell ever preserved gentle monotonous harmony just audible beneath there be something in quaint unwonted combination of sound a be heard in vaulted interior of little building strangely simple attractive spiritual longer be listened to more completely did mind lose recollection of real origin gradually shape out of wilder wilder fancy until bell a rang small peal seemed like happy voice of heavenly stream borne lightly onward on airy bubble ever rejoicing over gliding current murmured to a ran spite of peril of position of terror still fixed speechless crouching on ground effect on antonina of strange mingled music of running water bell be powerful enough when first heard to suspend other emotion in momentary wonder doubt withdrew hand from face glanced round mechanically to doorway a if imagined that sound proceeded from street when looked declining sun gliding between two of outer pillar surrounded temple covered with bright glow smooth pavement before entrance swarm of insect flew drowsily round round in warm mellow light faint monotonous humming deepened rather than interrupted perfect silence prevailing over thing without change be soon destined to appear in repose of quiet vacant scene hardly minute have elapsed while antonina still looked on before saw stealing over sunny pavement dark shadow same shadow that have last beheld when stopped in flight to look behind in empty street at first slowly grew lengthened then remained stationary then receded vanished a gradually a have advanced then girl heard fancied that heard faint sound of footstep retiring along lateral colonnade towards river side of building low cry of horror burst from lip a sank back towards father be unheeded voice of ulpius have resumed in interval hollow loudness of tone have raised numerian from ground strong cold grasp seemed to penetrate to old man heart held motionless helpless a if by fatal spell be on arm 'hear hear ' cried pagan waving disengaged hand a if be addressing vast concourse of people advance man to be one of servant of high priest have travelled from far country to sacred shrine be docile obedient before altar of god lot be cast for future life dwelling will be in temple to day of death will minister before in white robe swing smoking censer slay sacrifice at foot stopped dark sinister expression appeared in eye a word beacrifice passed lip muttered doubtingly to 'the sacrifice be yet hour of sacrifice looked round towards doorway sun still shone gaily on outer pavement insect still circled slowly in mellow light shadow be now visible distant footstep be heard there be nothing audible happy music of bubbling water chiming silvery bell for few moment madman looked out anxiously towards street without uttering word moving muscle raving fit be nearly possessing again a thought of sacrifice flashed over darkened mind once more approach be delayed slowly turned head in direction of interior of temple sun be still bright in outer court murmured in undertone hour of sacrifice be not yet come ' continued in louder voice shaking numerian by arm 'it be time that servant of temple must behold place of sacrifice sharpen knife for victim before sunset arouse thee bondman follow a yet numerian have spoken attempted to escape preceding event though space have be occupied in describing passed in so short period of time that have not hitherto recovered from first overwhelming shock of meeting with ulpius now awed though still be felt that moment of struggle for freedom have arrived 'leave let depart there can be fellowship between again ' exclaimed with reckless courage of despair taking hand of antonina striving to free from madman grasp effort be vain ulpius tightened hold laughed in triumph 'what servant of temple be in terror of high priest shrink from walking in place of sacrifice cried 'fear not bondman mighty one who rule over life death time futurity deal kindly with servant of choice onward onward to place of darkness doom where alone be omnipotent others be creature who tremble obey to thy lesson learner by sunset victim must be crowned looked round on numerian for instant a prepared to drag forward eye met in fierce command of action savage exultation of glance father saw repeated in wilder form very attitude expression have beheld in pagan on morning of loss of child circumstance of miserable hour vacant bed chamber banished daughter triumph of betrayer anguish of betrayed rushed over mind rose up before vivid a pictured scene before eye struggled more power of resistance in mind body be crushed alike made effort to remove antonina from side a if in forgetfulness of hidden enemy without designed to urge flight through open door while madman attention be yet distracted from beyond last exertion of strong instinct of paternal love other active emotion seemed dead within vainly have striven to disentangle child from fate might be in store for parent to dread of dark shadow on pavement be superior to other apprehension now clung more closely to father tightened clasp round hand so when pagan advanced into interior of temple be not numerian alone who followed to place of sacrifice antonina a well moved to back of pile of idol behind appeared high partition of gilt inlaid wood reaching to ceiling separating outer from inner part of temple low archway passage protected by carved gate similar to at front of building have be formed in partition through ulpius prisoner now passed into recess beyond apartment be considerably smaller than first hall of temple have just left ceiling floor sloped downwards together here rippling of water of tiber be more distinctly audible to than in outer division of building at moment when entered place be very dark pile of idol intercepted even little light must have be admitted through narrow entrance dense obscurity be soon dissipated dragging numerian after to left side of recess ulpius drew back sort of wooden shutter vivid ray of sunlight immediately streamed in through small circular opening pierced in part of temple then there became apparent at lower end of apartment vast yawning cavity in wall high enough to admit man without stooping running downwards almost perpendicularly to lower region be impossible to see for light shot upwards from precipitous artificial abyss in darkness of eye be lost after have penetrated to distance of few foot only from opening at base of confined space thus visible appeared commencement of flight of step evidently leading far downwards into cavity on abruptly sloping wall bounded on side be painted in brilliant hue of ancient fresco representation of deity of mythology in attitude of descending into vault followed by figure of nymph bearing wreath of flower beautiful bird other similar adjunct of votive ceremony of paganism repulsive contrast between bright colour graceful form presented by fresco perilous gloomy appearance of cavity decorated increased remarkably startling significance in character of whole structure past evil us seemed ineradicably written over part of a past crime torment remain ineradicably written on human face mind imbibed from terrifying idea of deadly treachery of secret atrocity of frightful refinement of torture uninitiated eye have ever beheld human resolution have ever be powerful enough to resist impression thus received be not produced only by what be seen in around strange vault by what be heard there besides wind penetrated cavity at distance through opening must not be beheld be apparently intercepted in passage for whistled upwards towards entrance in shrill winding note sometimes producing nearer sound resembling clashing of many small metallic substance violently shaken together noise of wind a well a bubbling of current of tiber seemed to proceed from greater distance than appeared compatible with narrow extent of back part of temple proximity of river to low foundation wall be evident that vault only reached outlet after have wound backwards underneath building in strange complication of passage labyrinth of artificial cavern might have be built long since a dungeon for living a sepulchre for dead place of sacrifice aha place of sacrifice cried pagan exultingly a drew numerian to entrance of cavity solemnly pointed into darkness beneath father gazed steadily into chasm never turning now to look on antonina never moving to renew struggle for freedom earthly love earthly hope began to fade away from heart be praying solemn word of christian supplication fell in low murmuring sound from lip in place of idolatry bloodshed mingled with incoherent ejaculation of madman who kept captive who now bent glaring eye on darkness of vault half forgetful in gloomy fascination exercised even over of prisoner whom held at mouth single ray of light admitted from circular aperture of wall fell wild fantastic over widely differing figure of three a stood so strangely united together before abyss opened beneath shadow be above shadow be around there be light in ill omened place one vivid ray streamed over gaunt figure of ulpius a still pointed into darkness over rigid feature of numerian praying in bitterness of expected death over frail youthful form of antonina a nestled trembling at father side be unearthly solemn scene meanwhile shadow girl have observed on pavement before doorway of temple now appeared there again not to retire a before for instant after goisvintha stealthily entered outer apartment of building left vacant by first occupant passed softly around pile of idol looked into inner recess of temple saw three figure standing together in ray of light gloomy motionless before mouth of cavity first glance fixed on pagan whom instinctively doubted dreaded whose purpose in keeping captive father daughter must not divine next be directed on antonina girl position be guarded one still holding
