mind innocent of suspicion of truth there sat opposite to unconscious witness of unhappy man final struggle to be true to brother whom loved to master devouring passion consumed so long a lucilla falsely believed to be disfigured by drug so long commonest consideration for tranquillity must in estimation of others excuse explain keeping out of presence in separation lay last chance of raising

chapter thirty third day between interval day before second appearance of herr grosse experiment on lucilla sight be to follow be marked by two incident ought to be noticed in place first incident be arrival early in morning of letter addressed to privately by oscar dubourg like many other shy people have perfect mania where embarrassing circumstance be concerned for explaining with difficulty by mean of pen in preference to explaining with ease by mean of tongue oscar present communication informed that have left for london by first morning train that object in taking sudden journey be to state present position towards lucilla to gentleman especially conversant with peculiarity of blind people in plain word have resolved on applying to mr sebright for advice like mr sebright oscar wrote a cordially a detest herr grosse short conversation have with have left with pleasantest impression of delicacy kindness if freely reveal to skillful surgeon sad situation in be placed believe experience will throw entirely new light on present state of lucilla mind on change may expect to see produced in if really doe recover sight result may be of incalculable benefit in teaching how may own truth most harmlessly to a well a to myself pray suppose undervalue advice only want to be doubly fortified before risk confession by advice of scientific man took to mean in plain english that vacillating oscar wanted to quiet conscience by gaining time that absurd idea of consulting mr sebright be nothing le than new plausible excuse for putting off evil day letter ended by pledging to secrecy by entreating so to manage matter a to grant private interview on return to dimchurch by evening train confess felt curiosity a to what must come of proposed consultation between unready oscar precise mr sebright accordingly arranged to take walk alone towards eight o'clock evening on road led to distant railway station second incident of day may be described a confidential conversation between lucilla on subject now equally absorbed momentous subject of restoration to blessing of sight joined at breakfast table with ready distrust newly excited poor thing by oscar have accounted to for journey to london by putting forward commonplace excuse of business instantly suspected knowing how felt about that be secretly bent on interfering with performance of operation by herr grosse contrived to compose anxiety thus aroused in mind by informing on oscar own authority that personally disliked distrusted german oculist make mind easy said answer for not venturing near herr grosse long silence between followed word when lucilla next referred to oscar in connection with coming operation depressed state of spirit seemed to have quite altered view of own prospect of people in world now spoke in disparagement of blessing conferred on blind by recovery of sight do know one thing said if have not be going to be married to oscar doubt if must have cared to put oculist native foreign to trouble of coming to dimchurch think understand answered can not surely mean to say that must not have be glad under circumstance to recover sight be just what do mean to say what who have written to grosse to hurry operation care to see only care to see oscar what be more only care to see because be in love with for really feel a if must give particular pleasure to use eye have be blind so long have learnt to do without yet looked perfectly entranced when nugent first set doubting whether be blind for life nugent took by surprise answered nugent startled out of sens have have time to think since be not carried away by enthusiasm of moment now people who can see attach such absurd importance to eye set touch dear against eye a much most trustworthy much most intelligent sense of two if oscar be not a have said uppermost feeling with will tell must have infinitely preferred to recovering sight supposing must have be done shook head with comic resignation to circumstance unfortunately ca be done what ca be done suddenly held out arm over breakfast table stretching out of to enormous unheard of length be what must have liked answered must find out better be going on at distance with hand than must with eye telescope what doubt might set at rest for instance about planetary system among people who can see if must only stretch out far enough to touch star be talking sheer nonsense lucilla be just tell know best in dark touch eye who have got sense that can always trust to serve equally well through whole four twenty hour for oscar to speak in sober earnest time tell must much rather perfect sense in have already got than have sense given to have not got until knew oscar think ever honestly envied of use of eye astonish lucilla rattled teaspoon impatiently in empty cup can always trust eye even in broad daylight burst out how often do deceive in simplest thing what did hear disputing about other day in garden be looking at view yes at view down alley of tree at other end of churchyard wall object in alley have attracted general notice have not yes object at further end of heard up here differed in opinion in spite of wonderful eye father said moved said stood still oscar said be man mr finch said be calf nugent ran off examined amazing object at close quarter what did turn out to be stump of old tree blown across road in night why be to envy people possession of sense play such trick a herr grosse be going to 'cut into cataract a call because be going to be married to man love fancy like fool may love better still if can see may be quite wrong added archly may end in not loving half a well a do now thought of oscar face felt sickening fear that might be speaking far more seriously than suspected tried to change subject imaginative nature have found way into new region of speculation before must open lip associate light said thoughtfully with be beautiful heavenly dark with be vile horrible devilish wonder how light dark will look to when see believe will astonish answered by being entirely unlike what fancy to be now started have alarmed without intending will oscar face be utterly unlike what fancy to be now asked in suddenly altered tone do mean to say have not have right image of in mind time tried again to draw off to topic what more must do with tongue tied by german warning to not to agitate in face of operation to be performed on next day be quite useless went on a before without heeding have mean of judging rightly what oscar be like said touch own face know how long be how broad be know how big different feature be where be then touch oscar compare face with knowledge of own face not single detail escape see in mind a plainly a see across table do mean to say when see with eye that will discover something perfectly new to believe started up impatiently took turn in room oh exclaimed with stamp of foot why ca take laudanum enough chloroform enough to kill for next six week then come to life again when german take bandage off eye sat down once more drifted on sudden into question of pure morality tell said be greatest virtue virtue be most difficult to practice suppose so answered drummed with hand on table petulantly viciously a hard a must then madame pratolungo said greatest of virtue be patience oh friend how hate greatest of virtue at moment ended there conversation found way into other topic at last thinking afterwards of new side of mind lucilla have shown to derived one consolation from what have passed at breakfast table if mr sebright proved to be right if operation failed after have lucilla word for blindness of be not terrible affliction to blind rest of fancy to be because can see towards past seven in evening went out alone a have planned to meet oscar on return from london at long straight stretch of road saw advancing towards be walking more rapidly than usual singing a walked even through livid discoloration poor fellow face looked radiant with happiness a came nearer waved walking stick exultingly in air good news called out at top of voice mr sebright have made happy man again have never before seen so like nugent in manner a now saw when met shook hand with tell about said gave arm talking way walked back slowly to dimchurch in first place began mr sebright hold to own opinion more firmly than ever feel absolutely certain that operation will fail be that good news asked reproachfully no said though mind own to shame there be time when almost hoped must fail mr sebright have put in better frame of mind have little nothing to dread from success of operation if by extraordinary chance must succeed remind of mr sebright opinion merely to give right idea of tone took with at starting only consented under protest to contemplate event lucilla herr grosse consider to be certainty 'if statement of position requires ' said ' will admit that be barely possible may be able to see two month hence now begin ' began by informing of marriage engagement will tell how mr sebright received information said held tongue made bow oscar laughed quite true answered told next of lucilla extraordinary antipathy to dark people dark shade of color of kind can guess what said to when have done owned that observation of mr sebright character did not extend to guessing that said be common antipathy in experience of blind be one among many strange influence exercised by blindness on mind physical affliction have mysterious moral influence ' said 'we can observe ca explain special antipathy mention be incurable antipathy except on one condition recovery of sight there stopped entreated to go on declined to go on until have finished what have to say to first have confession still to make to made concealed nothing nothing laid weakness bare before told that lucilla be still firmly convinced that nugent be discolored face instead of mine then put question what be to do how did reply in word ask what be to do in event of remaining blind tell again will be event decline to advise own conscience own sense of honor must decide question on other hand if ask what be to do in event of recovering sight can answer unreservedly in plainest term leave thing a be wait till see ' be own word oh load that took off mind made repeat declare be almost afraid to trust evidence of own ear understood motive of oscar good spirit better than understood motive of mr sebright advice did give reason asked will hear reason directly insisted on first satisfying that thoroughly understood position at moment prime condition of success a herr grosse have told ' said 'be perfect tranquillity of patient if make confession to young lady when get back to night to dimchurch throw into state of excitement will render impossible for german colleague to operate on to morrow if defer confession medical necessity of case force to be silent until professional attendance of oculist have ceased there be position advice to be to adopt last alternative wait make other person in secret wait until result of operation have declared ' there stopped 'do mean that be to be present on first occasion when be able to use eye asked 'be to let see without word beforehand to prepare for color of face ' be now getting to interesting part of english people when be out walking be carrying on conversation with friend never come to standstill at point of interest foreigner on other hand invariably stop surprised oscar by suddenly pulling up in middle of road what be matter asked go on said impatiently ca go on rejoined be holding held tighter than ever ordered more resolutely than ever to go on oscar resigned to halt foreign fashion on high road mr sebright met question by putting question on side resumed asked how proposed to prepare for color of face what did tell said have planned to make excuse for leaving dimchurch once away to prepare by writing for what might expect to see when returned what did say to that must hear of said ' strongly recommend to be present on first occasion when be capable if ever be capable of using sight attach greatest importance to being able to correct hideous absurd image now in mind of face like yours by seeing a really be at earliest available opportunity be just walking on again when certain word in last sentence startled stopped short once more hideous absurd image repeated thinking instantly of conversation of morning with lucilla what did mr sebright mean by using such language a just what asked reply will interest led into explanation of motif inquired for just now will walk on petrified foreign foot recovered activity went on again when have spoken to mr sebright of lucilla inveterate prejudice oscar continued have surprised by saying that be common in experience be only curable by restoration to sight in support of assertion now told of two interesting case have occurred in professional practice first be case of little daughter of indian officer blind from infancy like lucilla after operating successfully time came when must permit patient to try sight be to say to try if must see sufficiently well at first to distinguish dark object from light among member of household assembled to witness removal of bandage be indian nurse who have accompanied family to england first person child saw be mother fair woman clasped little hand in astonishment be at next turn of head saw dark indian nurse instantly screamed with terror mr sebright owned to that must not explain child must have possible association with color yet there nevertheless be most violent hatred horror of dark object hatred horror peculiar to blind expressing unmistakably in child of ten year old first thought while be telling be of of chance with lucilla first question be 'did child get used to nurse can give answer in own word week time found child sitting in nurse lap a composedly a be sitting in chair be encouraging be most encouraging nobody can deny second instance be more curious still time case be case of grown man object be to show what strange fantastic image utterly unlike reality blind form of people about patient be married be to see wife a lucilla be one day to see for first time have be told before married that be personally disfigured by scar of wound on one of cheek poor woman ah how well can understand trembled for consequence man who have loved dearly while be blind might hate when saw scarred face husband have be first to console when operation be determined on declared that sense of touch description given to by others have enabled to form in own mind most complete faithful image of wife face nothing mr sebright must say must induce to believe that be physically impossible for to form really correct idea of object animate inanimate have never seen must hear of be so certain of result that held wife hand in to encourage when bandage be removed from at first look at uttered cry of horror fell back in chair in swoon wife poor thing be distracted mr sebright did best to compose waited till husband be able to answer question put to then appeared that blind idea of wife of disfigurement have be something so grotesquely horribly unlike reality that be hard to know whether to laugh to tremble at be a beautiful a angel by comparison with husband favorite idea of yet because be idea be absolutely disgusted terrified at first sight of in few week be able to compare wife with other woman to look at picture to understand what beauty be what ugliness be from time have lived together a happy married couple a in kingdom be not quite sure way last example pointed alarmed when thought of lucilla came to standstill again how did mr sebright apply second case to lucilla to asked will hear said oscar first appealed to case a supporting assertion that lucilla idea of must be utterly unlike what be asked if be now satisfied that must have correct conception of what face color be really like if agreed with in believing that image in mind of man with blue face be in probability something fantastically hideously unlike reality after what have heard agreed with a matter of course havery well say mr sebright let remember that there be one important difference between case of miss finch case have just mentioned husband blind idea of wife be husband favorite idea shock of first sight of be plainly shock to on account now miss finch blind idea of blue face be on contrary hateful idea to image be image that loathes be not fair to conclude from that first sight of a really be be likely to be in case relief to instead of shock reasoning from experience reach that conclusion advise in own interest to be present when bandage be taken off even if prove to be mistaken even if be not immediately reconciled to sight of there be other example of child indian nurse to satisfy that be only question of time sooner later will take discovery a other young lady must take at first will be indignant with for deceiving then if be sure of place in affection will end in forgiving there be view of position there be ground on form in meantime own opinion remains unshaken firmly believe that will never have occasion to act on advice have given to when bandage be taken off chance be five hundred to one that be nearer to seeing then than be now ' be last word on that parted oscar walked on again for little way in silence have nothing to say against mr sebright reason be impossible to question professional experience from be drawn a to blind people in general felt doubt that advice be good that conclusion be arrived at correctly lucilla be ordinary character experience of be better experience than mr sebright more thought of future le inclined felt to share oscar hopeful view be just person to say something do something at critical moment of experiment must take wisest previous calculation by surprise oscar prospect never have looked darker to than looked at moment must have be useless cruel to have said to what have just said here put a bright face on a must asked if proposed to follow mr sebright advice yes said with certain reservation of own occurred to after have left house may ask what be certainly mean to beg nugent to leave dimchurch before lucilla try sight for first time will do know to please when have done what then then mean to be present a mr sebright suggested when bandage be taken off previously telling lucilla interposed that be who be in room there take precaution alluded to just now propose to leave lucilla under impression that be who have left dimchurch nugent face be face see if mr sebright prof to be right if first sensation be sensation of relief will own truth to same day if not will wait to make confession until have become reconciled to sight of plan meet possible emergency be one of few good idea stupid head have hit on since have be at dimchurch said last word with innocent air of triumph really must not find in heart to damp ardor by telling what thought of idea said be forget oscar that cleverest plan be at mercy of circumstance at last moment accident may happen will force to speak out came in sight of

away from rectory where there be always danger off gossip reaching ear must rely on to protect from harm in present to preserve for oscar in future with heart agreed to arrangement a grosse proposed when parted in garden went round to rector side of house to announce in medical capacity decision at have arrived while on side went back to lucilla to make best excuse must invent for oscar to prepare for speedy removal from dimchurch gone without coming to say good bye gone without even writing to there be first impression produced on when have done best to account harmlessly for oscar absence have a thought taken shortest simplest way out of difficulty by merely inverting truth in other word by telling nugent have got into serious embarrassment abroad that oscar have be called away at moment notice to follow help be in vain that reminded of oscar well known horror of leave taking of kind in vain represented urgency of matter a leaving alternative to confide excuse farewell to in vain promised for that must write to at first opportunity listened without conviction more perseveringly tried to account for more perseveringly dwelt on oscar unaccountable disregard of claim on consideration for a for journey to ramsgate be impossible to interest in subject gave up in despair surely oscar have left address at can write to said must only answer that be not sure enough of movement to be able to do before went away be more provoking than think went on believe oscar be afraid to bring unfortunate brother into presence blue face startled when saw know have quite got over feel none of absurd terror of poor man felt when be blind now have seen for what be really like can feel for wanted to tell oscar wanted to say that might bring brother to live with if liked wanted to prevent just what have happened going away from when wish to see brother be using very hardly among have reason to complain of while be talking in mortifying manner felt consolation nevertheless oscar disfigured complexion must not be terrible obstacle in way of restoration to lucilla have feared comfort reflection must give wanted badly enough there be open hostility towards on lucilla part there be coolness found more distressing to bear than hostility breakfasted in bed next morning only rose towards noon just in time to say good bye to grosse before returned to london be in high good spirit about patient eye be better instead of worse for exertion to have subjected on previous day bracing air of ramsgate be be wanting to complete success of operation mr finch have started objection turning on question of expense with daughter who be own mistress who have own fortune objection mattered nothing by next day day after at latest be to start for ramsgate promised to write to good surgeon a soon a be established engaged on side to visit immediately after let use eye for two goot hour day said grosse at parting may do what like with except that must not peep into book take up pen till come to at ramsgate be most wonderful beautiful to see how new eye of hers do get along when next meet goot mr sebrights hey how will cock crow over spick span respectable man felt little nervous a to how day must pas when german left alone with lucilla to amazement not only met with needful excuse for behavior on previous day showed to be perfectly resigned to temporary loss of oscar society be not who remarked that must not have chosen better time for being away from than humiliating time when be learning to distinguish between round square be not who welcomed little journey to ramsgate a pleasant change in dull life must help to reconcile to oscar absence in brief if have actually received letter from oscar relieving of anxiety about word look must hardly have offered completer contrast than now showed to word look of previous day if have noticed no other alteration in than welcome change for better record of day must have ended here a record of unmixed happiness grieve to say have something unpleasant to add while be making excuse to speaking in sensible satisfactory term have just repeated noticed curious underlying embarrassment in manner entirely unlike previous embarrassment have ever intruded between stranger still on first occasion when zillah came into room while be in observed that lucilla embarrassment be reflected when old woman spoke to in face manner of lucilla nurse one conclusion must possibly follow from what saw be concealing something from be more le ashamed of what be doing somewhere not very far back in page have said of be not by nature woman who be easily ready to suspect others on very account when find suspicion absolutely forced on a be now be apt to fly into opposite extreme in present case fixed on person to suspect more readily from having be slow to suspect in bygone day in way other said to myself nugent dubourg be at bottom of be communicating with privately in name in character of oscar bare idea of hurried headlong into letting know have noticed change in lucilla said have anything happened what do mean asked coldly fancy see change began understand answered walking away from a spoke said more if intimacy have be le close le affectionate might have openly avowed to what be passing in mind how must say to lucilla be deceiving must have be end of sisterhood end of friendship when confidence be withdrawn between two people who love other everything be withdrawn be on footing of stranger from moment must stand on ceremony delicate mind will understand why accepted check have administered to said more went into village alone managing matter so a to excite surprise contrived to have little gossip about nugent with gootheridge at inn with servant at browndown if nugent have returned secretly to dimchurch one of two men in little village must almost certainly have seen of have seen inferred from that have not tried to communicate with personally have attempted more cunningly more safely by letter went back to rectory be close on hour have appointed with lucilla now that responsibility rested on shoulder for allowing to use eye on taking off bandage noticed circumstance confirmed conclusion at have already arrived eye deliberately avoided looking into mine suppressing a well a must pain new discovery caused repeated grosse word prohibiting from attempting to look into book to use pen until have seen again there be need for to forbid to do said have attempted already inquired looked into little book of engraving answered must distinguish nothing line mingled together swam before eye have tried to write asked next be ashamed of for laying trap for although serious necessity of discovering whether be privately in correspondence with nugent might surely have excused replied have not tried to write changed color when made that answer be necessary to own in putting question be too much excited to call to mind what must have remembered in calmer state there be necessity for trying to use eye even if be really carrying on correspondence wished to keep secret from zillah have be in habit of reading letter to before appeared at rectory must write short note a have already mentioned by feeling way on paper with finger besides having learnt to read by touch be to say with raised character just a have learnt to write even if eye have be sufficiently recovered to enable to distinguish small object nothing practice must have taught to use for purpose of correspondence consideration though did not strike at time occurred to later in day altered opinion to certain extent now interpreted change of color have noticed in a outward sign of suspicion on side suspicion have motive of own in interrogating for rest doubt of nugent remained unmoved try a might must not divest mind of idea that be playing false in one way have contrived not only to communicate with lucilla to persuade to keep in ignorance of what have done deferred to next day attempt at making further discovery last thing at night have momentary impulse to question zillah reflection soon checked experience of nurse character told that must take refuge in flat denial must then inform mistress of what have happened knew enough of lucilla to know after have already passed between that quarrel with must follow thing be bad enough already without making worse in way when morning came resolved to keep watchful eye on village post office on movement of nurse when morning came there be letter for from abroad address be in handwriting of one of sister usually wrote to other at interval of fortnight three week letter have followed predecessor after interval of le than one week what did mean good news bad opened letter enclosed telegram announcing that poor dear father be lying dangerously wounded at marseille sister have already gone to implored to follow without one moment of needle delay be necessary to tell story of horrible calamity of course begin with woman elopement of course end with young man duel have not told already papa be so susceptible papa be so brave oh dear dear old story over again have english proverb what be bred in bone etcetera etcetera let drop veil mean let end chapter chapter forty first hard time for madame pratolungo ought to have be prepared for calamity have now fallen on sister if have looked own experience of poor father fairly in face must not have be plain to that habit of life be not likely to be altered at end of life surely if have exerted intelligence might have foreseen that longer reformation lasted nearer be to relapse more obviously probable became that must fail to fulfill hopeful expectation have cherished of conduct in future grant where be pattern people who can exert intelligence when intelligence point to one conclusion interest to ah dear lady gentleman there be such fine strong foundation of stupidity at bottom of common humanity if only knew must feel hesitation a soon a have recovered about what be duty to do duty be to leave dimchurch in time to catch fast mail train from london to continent at eight o'clock night leave lucilla yes not even lucilla interest dearly a loved alarmed a felt about be a sacred a interest called to father bedside have hour to spare before must be necessary for to leave must do be to employ hour in taking strictest precaution must think of to protect in absence must not be long parted from one way other miserable doubt whether father must live die must at age soon be over sent for to see in room showed letter be honestly grieved when read for moment when spoke few word of sympathy painful constraint in manner towards passed away returned again when announced intention of starting for france day expressed regret felt at being obliged to defer visit to ramsgate for present not only answered restrainedly forming a fancied thought at moment in own mind left with commonplace excuse must have much to think of in sad affliction wo intrude on longer if want know where to find with more than word walked out of room never remember at other time such sense of helplessness confusion a came over when have closed door set to work to pack up few thing wanted for journey feeling instinctively that if did not occupy in doing something must break down altogether accustomed in other emergency of life to decide rapidly be not even clear enough in mind to see fact a be a to resolving on anything be about a capable of doing that a baby in mr finch arm effort of packing aided to rally little did more towards restoring to customary tone of mind sat down helplessly when have done feeling serious necessity of clearing matter up between lucilla before went away still a ignorant a ever how to do to own indescribable disgust actually felt tear beginning to find way into eye have just enough of pratolungo widow left in to feel heartily ashamed of past vicissitude danger in day of republican life with husband have made sturdy walker with gypsy relish like little jicks for open air snatched up hat went out to see what exercise must do for tried garden no garden be for inscrutable reason not big enough have still hour to spare tried hill next turning towards left passing church heard through open window boom boom of reverend finch voice catechizing village child thank heaven be out of way at rate mounted hill hurrying on a fast a must air movement cleared mind after more than hour of hard walking returned to rectory feeling like old self again perhaps there be dreg of irresolution still left in perhaps there be enervating influence in affliction made feel more sensitively than ever change in relation between lucilla having by time resolved to come to plain explanation before left unprotected at rectory shrank even yet from confronting possible repulse by speaking to personally taking leaf out of poor oscar book wrote what wanted to say to in note rang bell once twice nobody answered went to kitchen zillah be not there knocked at door of bed room there be answer bed room be empty when looked in awkward a must be found obliged either to give note to lucilla with own hand to decide on speaking to after must not prevail on to speak to so went to room with note knocked at door here again there be reply knocked once more with same result looked in there be one in room on little table at foot of bed there lay letter addressed to writing be in zillah hand lucilla have written name in corner in usual way to show that have dictated letter to nurse load be lifted off heart a took up same idea concluded have occurred to have occurred to too have shrunk from embarrassment of personal explanation too have written be keeping out of way until letter have spoken for have united again a friend before left house with pleasant anticipation opened letter judge what felt when found what really contained dear madame pratolungo will agree with that be very important after what herr grosse have said about recovery of sight that visit to ramsgate must not be delayed a be unable through circumstance sincerely regret to accompany to sea side have determined to go to london to aunt miss batchford to ask to be companion instead of have have experience enough of sincere affection for to be quite sure that will gladly take charge of off hand a time be to be lost start for london without waiting for return from walk to wish good bye so thoroughly understand necessity of dispensing with formal farewell in case of emergency be sure will not feel offended at taking leave of in way with best wish for father recovery believe yours very truly lucilla p s need be under apprehension about zillah go with a far a london will communicate with herr grosse when arrive at aunt house for one sentence in must most assuredly have answered cruel letter by instantly resigning situation a lucilla companion sentence to refer contained word cast in teeth excuse have made for oscar absence sarcastic reference to recent connection with case of emergency to experience of necessity of dispensing with formal farewell removed last lingering doubt of nugent treachery now felt not suspicion only positive conviction that have communicated with in brother name that have contrived by mean at be impossible for to guess so to work on lucilla mind so to excite that indwelling distrust blindness have rooted in character a to destroy confidence in for time being arriving at conclusion must still feel compassionately generously towards lucilla far from blaming poor deluded sister

in time said other day used to see young gentleman only see young animal now well fed well washed well dressed riding animal rowing animal betting animal nothing more oscar on side seems to like miss batchford on better acquaintance when first presented to rather surprised by changing color looking very uneasy be almost distressingly nervous on certain occasion suppose aunt grand manner daunted note really must break in here aunt grand manner make sick be nothing between ourselves hook nose stiff pair of stay what daunted nugent dubourg when first found in old lady presence be fear of discovery must no doubt have learnt from brother that oscar miss batchford have never met will see if look back that be in nature of thing impossible must have met be equally clear that nugent must find out beforehand that miss batchford have be left in ignorance of what have happened at dimchurch must hing of sort must feel assurance of security from exposure until have tried ground in own proper person first risk here be certainly serious enough to make even nugent dubourg feel uneasy lucilla talk of aunt grand manner poor innocent leave to go on p a soon a aunt left together first word said to oscar referred of course to letter about madame pratolungo made little sign of entreaty looked distressed why must spoil pleasure of first meeting by talking of said be so inexpressibly painful to to let return to in day two not now lucilla not now brother be next subject in mind be not at sure how must take speaking about risked question however for that made sign of entreaty looked distressed again brother understand other lucilla will remain abroad for present will drop that subject too let hear own news want to know what be going on at rectory have heard nothing since wrote word that be here with aunt that madame pratolungo have gone abroad to father be mr finch well be coming to ramsgate to see be unwilling to tell of misunderstanding at home have not heard from father since have be here said now have come back can write announce return get news from rectory looked at rather strangely in way led to fear that saw objection to writing to father suppose must like mr finch to come here said then stopped suddenly looked at again there be very little chance of coming here answered oscar seemed to be wonderfully interested about father very little chance repeated why be obliged to refer to family quarrel still however saying nothing of unjust manner in father have spoken of aunt a long a be with miss batchford said be useless to hope that father will come here be on bad term be afraid there be prospect at present of being friend again do object to writing home to say have come to ramsgate asked exclaimed looking picture of astonishment what must possibly make think that write by mean leave little space for will add few line to letter be impossible to say how answer relieved be quite plain that have stupidly misinterpreted oh new eye new eye will ever be able to depend on a must once depend on touch note must intrude again will burst with indignation while be copying journal if relieve mind at certain place in remark before go farther how skillfully nugent contrives to ascertain exact position at ramsgate see with what fatal unanimity chance of personating oscar without discovery declare in favor miss batchford a have seen be entirely at mercy not only know nothing operates a check on mr finch who must otherwise have joined daughter at ramsgate have instantly exposed conspiracy on side of nugent be to appearance safe be away in one direction oscar be away in mr finch be anchored immovably in nursery zillah have be sent back from london to rectory dimchurch doctor who attended oscar who might have proved awkward witness be settled in india a will see if refer to twenty second chapter london doctor with whom consulted have long since ceased to have relation with former patient a for herr grosse if appears on scene can be trusted to shut eye professionally to be going on to let matter take course in only interest recognizes interest of lucilla health there be literally obstacle in nugent way sort of protection for lucilla except in faithful instinct persists in warning that be wrong man though speaks in unknown tongue will end in understanding warning before be too late friend note be intended to relieve mind not yours have to do be to read on here be journal wo stand moment in way p september nd rainy day very little said be worth recording between oscar aunt whose spirit be always affected by bad weather kept long time in sitting room amusing by making exercise sight oscar be present by special invitation assisted old lady in setting new seeing sense of mine sort of task tried hard to prevail on to let see writing refused be improving a fast a can be not good enough yet notice here what dreadfully difficult thing be to get back in such case a mine to exercise of one sight have cat dog in house must be credited if be telling to world instead of telling to journal that actually mistook one for other to day after seeing so well too a do now being able to write with so few false stroke in making letter be nevertheless true that did mistake two animal having trusted to nothing memory to inform eye be instead of helping memory by touch have now set right caught up pus shut eye oh that habit when will get over felt soft fur so different from dog hair opened eye again associated feel of fur for ever afterwards with sight of cat to day experience have also informed that make slow progress in teaching to judge correctly of distance in spite of drawback however there be nothing enjoy so much in using sight a looking at great wide prospect of kind provided be not asked to judge how far how near object may be seems like escaping out of prison to look after having be shut up in blindness at view over town bold promontory of pier grand sweep of sea beyond visible from window moment aunt begin to question about distance make toil of pleasure be worse still when be asked about relative size of ship boat when see nothing boat fancy larger than be when see boat in comparison with ship then look back at boat instantly go to other extreme fancy smaller than be setting right still vexes almost a keenly a stupidity vexed time since when saw first horse cart from upper window took for dog drawing wheelbarrow let add in own defence that horse cart be figured at least five time proper size in blind fancy make mistake think not so very stupid after well amused aunt effect did produce on oscar if must trust eye must say produced exactly contrary effect on made melancholy trust eye must be deceiving when tell that looked in company moping anxious miserable man be that see feel something changed in must scream with vexation rage against here be oscar yet be not oscar knew when be blind contradictory a seems used to understand how looked at when be unable to see now that can see ask be really love be looking at in eye be something else how must know knew when have only own fancy to tell now try a may can not make old fancy new sight serve in harmony together be afraid see that understand oh dear dear why did not meet good old grosse become new creature that have made before met oscar must have have blind memory prepossession to get over then will become used to new self hope believe with time will accustom to new impression of oscar so may come right in end be wrong enough now put arm round gave little tender squeeze while be following miss batchford down to dining room afternoon nothing in answered to must have felt over few month since here be tear on paper what fool be why ca write about something else sent second letter to father to day telling of oscar return from abroad taking notice of not having replied to first letter only way to manage father be not to take notice to let come right by showed oscar letter with space left at end for postscript while be writing asked to get something happened to be up stair in room when came back have sealed envelope forgetting to show postscript be not worth while to open letter again told what have written did just a well note must trouble with copy of what nugent really did write show why sent out of room closed envelope before must come back postscript be also worthy of notice in respect that play part in page of narrative be still to come thus nugent writes in oscar name character to rector of dimchurch have already mentioned a will see in twenty second chapter that close similarity of handwriting be one among other striking point of resemblance between twin dear mr finch lucilla letter will have told have come to sens be again paying address to a affianced husband principal object in adding line be to propose that must forget past go on again a if nothing have happened nugent have behaved nobly absolves from engagement towards into so rashly entered at last interview before left browndown most generously amply have redeemed pledge to madame pratolungo to discover place of retreat to restore to lucilla for present remains abroad if favor with reply to must warn to be careful how write for lucilla be sure to ask to see letter remember that only supposes to have returned to after brief absence from england caused by necessity for joining brother on continent will be also desirable to say nothing on subject of unfortunate peculiarity of complexion have made right with lucilla be getting accustomed to still subject be sore one le be referred to better truly yours oscar unless add word of explanation here will hardly appreciate extraordinary skillfulness with deception be continued by mean of postscript written in oscar character representing nugent a having done that have promised to do designedly omits customary courtesy of oscar style object of be to offend mr finch with what end in view will presently see rector be last man in existence to dispense with necessary apology expression of regret from man engaged to daughter who have left a oscar have left matter how circumstance might appear to excuse curt off hand postscript signed oscar be very thing to exasperate wound already inflicted on mr finch self esteem to render at least probable that must reconsider intention of performing marriage ceremony in event of refusal what must happen stranger entirely ignorant of be nugent be oscar must officiate in place do see now even cleverest people be not always capable of providing for emergency completest plot generally have weak place postscript a have seen be little masterpiece nevertheless exposed writer to danger a journal will tell only appreciated at true value when be too late to alter mind finding forced for sake of appearance to permit lucilla to inform father of arrival at ramsgate be now obliged to run risk of having important piece of domestic news communicated either by mr finch by wife to le person than will remember that worthy mr finch when parted at rectory have asked to write to while be abroad will see after hint have given that clever mr nugent be beginning already to walk upon delicate ground say more lucilla turn now p september rd oscar have suppose forgotten something ought to have included in postscript to letter more than two hour after have sent to post asked if letter have gone for moment looked annoyed when said yes soon recovered mattered nothing said must easily write again talking of letter added do expect madame pratolungo to write to time be who referred to told that there be not much chance after what have passed on side on mine of writing to then tried to put of question about have once already requested not to press yet for second time entreated to defer discussion of unpleasant subject for present yet with curious inconsistency made inquiry relating to subject in same breath do think be likely to be in correspondence with father stepmother while be out of england asked must doubt writing to father said might correspond with mr finch considered little then turned talk to topic of residence at ramsgate next how long do stay here inquired depends on herr grosse answered will ask when come next turned away to window suddenly a if be little put out be tired of ramsgate already asked came back to took hand cold insensible hand wo feel touch a ought let be husband lucilla whispered will live at ramsgate if like for sake although there be everything to please in word there be something startled can not describe in look manner when said made answer at moment went on why must not be married at once asked be of age have only ourselves to think of note alter word a follows why must not be married before madame pratolungo can hear of arrival at ramsgate will rightly interpret motif situation be now fast reaching climax of peril nugent one chance be to persuade lucilla to marry before discovery can reach ear before grosse considers sufficiently recovered to leave ramsgate p forget answered more surprised than ever have father to think of be always arranged that be to marry at dimchurch oscar smiled not at charming smile used to imagine when be blind will wait long time be afraid said if wait until father marries do mean asked when enter on painful subject of madame pratolungo replied will tell in meantime do think mr finch will answer letter hope so do think will answer postscript be sure will same unpleasant smile showed again in face abruptly dropped conversation went to play piquet with aunt happened yesterday evening went to bed sadly dissatisfied with somebody be with oscar with with fancy with to day went out together for walk on cliff what delight be to move through fresh briny air see lovely sight on side of oscar enjoyed too through first part of walk be charming be more in love with than ever on return little incident occurred altered for worse made spirit sink again happened in manner proposed returning by sand ramsgate be still crowded with visitor animated scene on beach in later part of day have attraction for after blind life doe not dare say posse for people who have always enjoyed use of eye oscar who have nervous horror of crowd who shrink from contact with people not so refined a be surprised at wishing to mix with what called mob on sand however said must go if particularly wished did particularly wish so went there be chair on beach hired two sat down to look about sort of diversion be going on monkey organ girl on stilt conjurer troop of negro minstrel be at work to

beach herd of snob while be still muttering under breath about mixture of low people suddenly cast side look at person thing must not at moment tell rising placed so a to intercept view of promenade on sand immediately before happened to have noticed at same moment lady approaching in dress of peculiar color pulled oscar on one side to look at a passed in front of why do get in way asked before must answer question lady passed with two lovely child with tall man at side eye looking first at lady child found way next to gentleman saw repeated in face same black blue complexion have startled in face of oscar brother when first opened eye at rectory for moment felt startled again more a believe by unexpected repetition of blue face in face of stranger than by ugliness of complexion at rate

measure for protection of lucilla while be living under care of aunt be greatly interested in watching effect disclosure produced on oscar observation led to form two conclusion first conclusion that time absence have not produced slightest change in love poor fellow bore to lucilla second conclusion that nothing absolute proof must induce to agree in unfavorable opinion of brother character be in vain declared that nugent have quitted england pledged to find have left to a event now proved to make discovery owned readily that have seen nothing heard nothing of nugent nevertheless confidence in brother remained unshaken nugent be soul of honor repeated again again with side look at suggested that frankly avowed opinion of brother have hurt offended have barely time to notice before reached

interest in man welfare if be too great effort be so good a to remember that lucilla farewell letter to at dimchurch be now followed by equally ungracious expression of oscar distrust at time when
