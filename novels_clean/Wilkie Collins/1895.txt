succeed in recovering health in somebody el house written testimonial afforded glimpse at man story served one purpose more connected with initial on book identified to magistrate landlord under strangely uncouth name of ozias midwinter mr brock laid aside testimonial suspecting that schoolmaster have purposely abstained from writing address on with view of escaping responsibility in event of usher death in case be manifestly useless under existing circumstance to think of tracing poor wretch friend if friend have to inn have be brought a matter of common humanity at inn must remain for

yellow silk handkerchief tawny haggard cheek bright brown eye preternaturally large wild rough black beard long supple sinewy finger wasted by suffering till looked like claw tended to discompose rector at outset of interview when first feeling of surprise have worn off impression followed be not agreeable one mr brock must not conceal from that stranger manner be against general opinion have settled that if man be honest be bound to assert by looking straight at fellow creature when speaks to if man be honest eye showed singular perversity in looking away denying possibly be affected in degree by nervous restlessness in organization appeared to pervade fiber in lean lithe body rector healthy anglo saxon flesh crept responsively at casual movement of usher supple brown finger passing distortion of usher haggard yellow face god forgive thought mr brock with mind running on allan allans mother wish must see way to turning ozias midwinter adrift in world again conversation ensued

given in tone manner far removed from bitterness on one side from indifference on other ozias midwinter at twenty spoke of life a ozias midwinter at seventy might have spoken with long weariness of year on have learned to bear patiently two circumstance pleaded strongly against distrust with in sheer perplexity of mind mr brock blindly regarded have written to saving bank in distant part of england have drawn money have paid doctor landlord man of vulgar mind after acting in manner must have treated obligation lightly when have settled bill ozias midwinter spoke of obligation especially of obligation to allan with fervor of thankfulness be not surprising only absolutely painful to witness showed horrible sincerity of astonishment at having be treated with common christian kindness in christian land spoke of allans having become answerable for expense of sheltering nursing curing with savage rapture of gratitude surprise burst out of like flash of lightning so help god cried castaway usher never met with like of never heard of like of before in next instant one glimpse of light man have let in on own passionate nature be quenched again in darkness wandering eye returning to old trick looked uneasily away from mr brock voice dropped back once more into unnatural steadiness quietness of tone beg pardon sir said have be used to be hunted cheated starved everything else come strange to half attracted by man half repelled by mr brock on rising to take leave impulsively offered hand then with sudden misgiving confusedly drew back again meant that kindly sir said ozias midwinter with own hand crossed resolutely behind dont complain of thinking better of man who cant give proper account of be not man for gentleman in position to take by hand mr brock left inn thoroughly puzzled before returning to mr armadale sent for son chance be that guard have be off stranger tongue when spoke to allan with allans frankness there be fear of concealing anything have passed between from rector knowledge here again mr brocks diplomacy achieved useful result once started on subject of ozias midwinter allan rattled on about new friend in usual easy light hearted way have really nothing of importance to tell for nothing of importance have be revealed to have talked about boat building sailing by hour together allan have got valuable hint have discussed with diagram to assist with more valuable hint for allan serious impending question of launch of yacht on other occasion have diverged to other subject to more of than allan must remember on spur of moment have midwinter said nothing about relation in flow of friendly talk nothing except that have not behaved well to hang relation be at sensitive on subject of own odd name not least in world have set example like sensible fellow of laughing at mr brock still persisted inquired next what allan have seen in stranger to take fancy to allan have seen in what didnt see in people in general wasnt like other fellow in neighborhood other fellow be cut out on same pattern man of be equally healthy muscular loud hard hearted clean skinned rough man of drank same draught of beer smoked same short pipe day long rode best horse shot over best dog put best bottle of wine in england on table at night man of sponged morning in same sort of tub of cold water bragged about in frosty weather in same sort of way man of thought getting into debt capital joke betting on horse race one of most meritorious action that human being can perform be doubt excellent fellow in way worst of be be exactly alike be perfect godsend to meet with man like midwinter man who be not cut out on regular local pattern whose way in world have one great merit in part of being way of own leaving remonstrance for fitter opportunity rector went back to mr armadale must not disguise from that allans mother be person really answerable for allans present indiscretion if lad have seen little le of small gentry in neighborhood little more of great outside world at home abroad pleasure of cultivating ozias midwinter society might have have fewer attraction for conscious of unsatisfactory result of visit to inn mr brock felt anxiety about reception of report when found once more in mr armadales presence foreboding be soon realized try a might to make best of mr armadale seized on one suspicious fact of usher silence about a justifying strongest measure must be taken to separate from son if rector refused to interfere declared intention of writing to ozias midwinter with own hand remonstrance irritated to such pitch that astounded mr brock by reverting to forbidden subject of five year since referring to conversation have passed between when advertisement have be discovered in newspaper passionately declared that vagabond armadale of advertisement vagabond midwinter at village inn might for know to contrary be one same foreboding serious disagreement between mother son if mother interfered mr brock undertook to see midwinter again to tell plainly that must give proper account of that intimacy with allan must cease two concession exacted from mr armadale in return be that must wait patiently until doctor reported man fit to travel that must be careful in interval not to mention matter in way to son in week time midwinter be able to drive out with allan for coachman in pony chaise belonging to inn in ten day doctor privately reported a fit to travel toward close of tenth day mr brock met allan new friend enjoying last gleam of wintry sunshine in one of inland lane waited until two have separated then followed usher on way back to inn rector resolution to speak pitilessly to purpose be in danger of failing a drew nearer nearer to friendless man saw how feebly still walked how loosely worn coat hung about how heavily leaned on cheap clumsy stick humanely reluctant to say decisive word too precipitately mr brock tried first with little compliment on range of reading a shown by volume of sophocles volume of goethe have be found in bag asked how long have be acquainted with german greek quick ear of midwinter detected something wrong in tone of mr brocks voice turned in darkening twilight looked suddenly suspiciously in rector face have something to say to answered be not what be saying now there be help for to accept challenge very delicately with many preparatory word to other listened in unbroken silence mr brock came little by little nearer nearer to point long before have really reached long before man of more than ordinary sensibility must have felt what be coming ozias midwinter stood still in lane told rector that need say more understand sir said usher mr armadale have ascertained position in world mr armadale have nothing to conceal nothing to be ashamed of agree with be not fit companion for best return can make for kindness be to presume on no longer may depend on leaving place to morrow morning spoke word more must hear word more with self control at year with temperament be nothing le than marvelous civilly took off hat bowed returned to inn by mr brock slept badly that night issue of interview in lane have made problem of ozias midwinter harder problem to solve than ever early next morning letter be brought to rector from inn messenger announced that strange gentleman have taken departure letter inclosed open note addressed to allan requested allans tutor after first reading to forward not at own sole discretion note be startlingly short one began ended in dozen word dont blame mr brock mr brock be right thank good by o m rector forwarded note to proper destination a matter of course sent few line to mr armadale at same time to quiet anxiety by news of usher departure done waited visit from pupil must probably follow delivery of note in very tranquil frame of mind there might might not be deep motive at bottom of midwinter conduct thus far be impossible to deny that have behaved in such manner a to rebuke rector distrust to justify allans good opinion of morning wore on young armadale never appeared after looking for vainly in yard where yacht be building mr brock went to mr armadales house there heard news from servant turned step in direction of inn landlord at once acknowledged truth young mr armadale have come there with open letter in hand have insisted on being informed of road

having heard mr midwinter lock into room overnight burst into violent fit of cry that trifling particular have set mr armadales face of flame have shouted sworn have rushed into stable forced hostler to saddle horse have set off full gallop on road ozias midwinter have taken before after cautioning landlord to keep allans conduct secret if of mr armadales servant came that morning to inn mr brock went home again waited anxiously to see what day must bring forth to infinite relief pupil appeared at rectory late in afternoon allan looked spoke with dogged determination be quite new in old friend experience of without waiting to be questioned told story in usual straightforward way have overtaken midwinter on road after trying vainly first to induce to return then to find out where be going to have threatened to keep company with for rest of day have so extorted confession that be going to try luck in london having gained point allan have asked next for friend address in london have be entreated by other not to press request have pressed nevertheless with might have got address at last by making appeal to midwinter gratitude for feeling heartily ashamed of have afterward asked midwinter pardon like poor fellow wont give up concluded allan bringing clinched fist down with thump on rectory table dont be afraid of vexing mother ill leave to speak to mr brock at own time in own way ill just say much more by way of bringing thing to end here be address safe in pocket book here be standing firm for once on resolution of own ill give mother time to reconsider when time be up if friend midwinter doesnt come to ill go to friend midwinter so matter rested for present such be result of turning castaway usher adrift in world again month passed brought in new year overleaping that short lapse of time mr brock paused with heavy heart at next event to mind one mournful one memorable event of series mr armadales death first warning of affliction be near at hand have followed close on usher departure in december have arisen out of circumstance dwelt painfully on rector memory from time forth three day after midwinter have left for london mr brock be accosted in village by neatly dressed woman wearing gown bonnet of black silk red paisley shawl who be total stranger to who inquired way to mr armadales house put question without raising thick black veil hung over face mr brock in giving necessary direction observed that be remarkably elegant graceful woman looked after a bowed left wondering who mr armadales visitor must possibly be quarter of hour later lady still veiled a before passed mr brock again close to inn entered house spoke to landlady seeing landlord shortly afterward hurrying round to stable mr brock asked if lady be going away yes have come from railway in omnibus be going back again more creditably in carriage of own hiring supplied by inn rector proceeded on walk rather surprised to find thought running inquisitively on woman who be stranger to when

alarming nervous attack brought on a servant suspected by unexpected possibly unwelcome visitor who have called that morning surgeon have done be needful have apprehension of dangerous result finding patient eagerly desirous on recovering to see mr brock immediately have thought important to humor have readily undertaken to call at rectory with message to effect looking at mr armadale with far deeper interest in than surgeon interest mr brock saw enough in face when turned toward on entering room to justify instant serious alarm allowed opportunity of soothing heeded none of inquiry answer to certain question of own be what wanted what be determined to have have mr brock seen woman who have presumed to visit that morning yes have allan seen allan have be at work since breakfast be at work still in yard by water side latter reply appeared to quiet mr armadale for moment put next question most extraordinary question of three more composedly did rector think allan must object to leaving vessel for present to accompanying mother on journey to look out for new house in other part of england in greatest amazement mr brock asked what reason there must possibly be for leaving present residence mr armadales reason when gave only added to surprise woman first visit might be followed by second rather than see again rather than run risk of allans seeing speaking to mr armadale must leave england if necessary end day in foreign land taking counsel of experience a magistrate mr brock inquired if woman have come to ask for money yes respectably a be dressed have described a being in distress have asked for money have got money be of importance one thing needful be to get away before woman came again more more surprised mr brock ventured on question be long since mr armadale visitor have last met yes longer than allans lifetime a long ago a year before allan be born at reply rector shifted ground took counsel next of experience a friend be person asked connected in way with painful remembrance of early life yes with painful remembrance of time when be married said mr armadale be associated a mere child with circumstance must think of with shame sorrow to dying day mr brock noticed altered tone in old friend spoke unwillingness with gave answer can tell more about without referring to went on be sure can protect if will only help little name for

discovered after year have passed only know that have discovered will find way to allan next will poison son mind against help to get away from help to take allan away before come back rector asked more question must have be cruel to press further first necessity be to compose by promising compliance with that desired second be to induce to see medical man mr brock contrived to reach end harmlessly in latter case by reminding that wanted strength to travel that own medical attendant might restore more speedily to herself if be assisted by best professional advice having overcome habitual reluctance to seeing stranger by mean rector at once went to allan delicately concealing what mr armadale have said at interview broke news to that mother be seriously ill allan must hear of

equally painful to nephew if personal intercourse took place between have adverted a generally a possible to nature of difference have kept apart from late sister in order to satisfy mr brocks mind that personal acquaintance with young mr armadale be a matter of delicacy quite out of question having done must beg leave to close correspondence mr brock wisely destroyed second letter on spot after

decided on trying trip to paris on extending journey southward if companion showed interest in continental traveling allans reception of proposal made atonement for obstinacy in refusing to cultivate cousin acquaintance be willing to go with mr brock mr brock pleased rector took at word in middle of march two strangely assorted companion left for london on way to paris arrived in london mr brock

vessel be nearly completed be breezy cheerful day land be bright water be blue quick wave leaped crisply in sunshine men be singing at work descending to cabin midwinter discovered friend busily occupied in attempting to set place to right habitually least systematic of mortal allan now then awoke to overwhelming sense of advantage of order on such occasion perfect frenzy of tidiness possessed be down on knee hotly wildly at work when midwinter looked in on be fast reducing neat little world of cabin to original element of chaos with misdirected energy wonderful to see here mess said allan rising composedly on horizon of own accumulated litter do know dear fellow begin to wish have let well alone midwinter smiled came to friend assistance with natural neat handedness of sailor first object that encountered be allans dressing case turned upside down with content scattered on floor with duster hearth broom lying among replacing various object formed furniture of dressing case one by one midwinter lighted unexpectedly on miniature portrait of old fashioned oval form primly framed in setting of small diamond dont seem to set much value on said what be allan bent over looked at miniature belonged to mother answered set greatest value on be portrait of father midwinter put miniature abruptly into allans hand withdrew to opposite side of cabin know best where thing ought to be put in own dressing case said keeping back turned on allan ill make place tidy on side of cabin will make place tidy on other began setting in order litter scattered about on

place here be writing case said why not answer letter at once if put away again may forget again very true returned allan worst of be cant quite make up mind what answer to write want word of advice come sit down here ill tell about with loud boyish laugh echoed by midwinter who caught infection of gayety swept heap of miscellaneous incumbrance off cabin sofa made room for friend to take place in high flow of youthful spirit two sat down to trifling consultation over letter lost in tobacco jar be memorable moment to of lightly a thought of at time before have risen again from place have taken first irrevocable step together on dark tortuous road of future life reduced to plain fact question on allan now required friend advice may be stated a follows while various arrangement connected with succession to thorpe ambrose be in progress of settlement while new possessor of estate be still in question have necessarily arisen relating to person who must be appointed to manage property steward employed by blanchard family have written without loss of time to offer service although perfectly competent trustworthy man failed to find favor in eye of new proprietor acting a usual on first impulse resolved at hazard to install midwinter a permanent inmate at thorpe ambrose allan have determined that steward place be place exactly fitted for friend for simple reason that must necessarily oblige friend to live with on estate have accordingly written to decline proposal made to without consulting mr brock whose disapproval have good reason to fear without telling midwinter who must probably if chance be allowed of choosing have declined taking situation previous training have by mean fitted to fill further correspondence have followed decision have raised two new difficulty looked little embarrassing on face of allan with assistance of lawyer easily contrived to solve first difficulty of examining outgoing steward book be settled by sending professional accountant to thorpe ambrose second difficulty of putting steward empty cottage to profitable use allans plan for friend comprehending midwinter residence under own roof be met by placing cottage on list of active house agent in neighboring county town in state arrangement have be left when allan quitted london have heard thought nothing more of matter until letter from lawyer have followed to isle of man inclosing two proposal to occupy cottage received on same day requesting to hear at earliest convenience of two be prepared to accept finding after having conveniently forgotten subject for day past placed face to face once more with necessity for decision allan now put two proposal into friend hand after rambling explanation of circumstance of case requested to be favored with word of advice instead of examining proposal midwinter unceremoniously put aside asked two very natural very awkward question of who new steward be to be why be to live in allans house ill tell who ill tell why when get to thorpe ambrose said allan in meantime well call steward x y z well say life with because im devilish sharp mean to keep under own eye neednt look surprised know man thoroughly well requires

nothing for to consult interest say yes x y z be not at bad fellow can tell see when go to thorpe ambrose rather think will get on uncommonly well together humorous twinkle in allans eye sly significance in allans voice must have betrayed secret to prosperous man midwinter be a far from suspecting a carpenter who be at work above on deck of yacht be there steward now on estate asked face

come too midwinter assented with weary sigh always shyly unwilling to make new acquaintance fatigue increased reluctance now felt to become mr hawburys guest a matter stood however there be alternative to go for with allans constitutional imprudence there be safely trusting alone anywhere more especially in stranger house mr brock must certainly not have left pupil to visit doctor alone midwinter be still nervously conscious that occupied mr brocks place what will do till time to go asked allan looking about anything in added observing fallen newspaper picking up from floor im too

suffering of traveling party lost in trackless wilderness in danger of dying by thirst allan announced that have found something to make friend flesh creep began eagerly to read passage aloud resolute not to sleep midwinter followed progress of adventure sentence by sentence without missing word consultation of lost traveler with death by thirst staring in face resolution to press on while strength lasted fall of heavy shower vain effort made to catch rainwater transient relief experienced by sucking wet clothes suffering renewed few hour after night advance of strongest of party leaving weakest behind following flight of bird when morning dawned discovery by lost men of broad pool of water saved life midwinter fast failing attention mastered painfully allans voice growing fainter fainter on ear with sentence be read soon next word seemed to drop away gently nothing slowly sinking sound of voice be left then light in room darkened gradually sound dwindled into delicious silence last waking impression of weary midwinter came peacefully to end next event of be conscious be sharp ringing at closed door of hotel started to foot with ready alacrity of man whose life have accustomed to wake at shortest notice instant look round showed that room be empty glance at watch told that be close on midnight noise made by sleepy servant in opening door tread next moment of quick footstep in

show boat beauty of night softness of breeze have done rest of mischief have filled allan with irresistible longing for sail by moonlight prevented from accompanying guest by professional hindrance obliged to remain on doctor not knowing what else to do have ventured on disturbing midwinter rather than take responsibility of allowing mr armadale matter how well might be accustomed to sea to set off on sailing trip at midnight entirely by time taken to make explanation brought midwinter doctor to pier head there sure enough be young armadale in boat hoisting sail singing sailor yo heave ho at top of voice come along old boy cried allan youre just in time for frolic by moonlight midwinter suggested frolic by daylight adjournment to bed in meantime bed cried allan on whose harum scarum high spirit mr hawburys hospitality have certainly not produced sedative effect hear doctor one must think be ninety bed drowsy old dormouse look at think of bed if can pointed to sea moon be shining in cloudless heaven night breeze blew soft steady from land peaceful water rippled joyfully in silence glory of night midwinter turned to doctor with wise resignation to circumstance have seen enough to

care of friend to take care of boat good night doctor shouted allan whisky water be delicious boat little beauty youre best fellow ever met in life doctor laughed waved hand boat glided out from harbor with midwinter at helm a breeze then blew be soon abreast of westward headland bounding bay of poolvash question be started whether must run out to sea keep along shore wisest proceeding in event of wind failing be to keep by land midwinter altered course of boat sailed on smoothly in south westerly direction abreast of coast little by little cliff rose in height rock massed wild jagged showed rifted black chasm yawning deep in seaward side off bold promontory called spanish head midwinter looked ominously at watch allan pleaded hard for hour more for glance at famous channel of sound be now fast nearing of have heard startling story from workman employed on yacht new change midwinter compliance with request rendered necessary to make in course of boat brought close to wind revealed on one side grand view of southernmost shore of isle of man on other black precipice of islet called calf separated from mainland by dark dangerous channel of sound once more midwinter looked at watch have gone far enough said stand by sheet stop cried allan from bow of boat good god here wrecked ship right ahead of midwinter let boat fall off little looked where other pointed there stranded midway between rocky boundary on side of sound there never again to rise on living water from grave on sunken rock lost lonely in quiet night high dark ghostly in yellow moonshine lay wrecked ship know vessel said allan in great excitement heard workman talking of yesterday drifted in here on pitch dark night when couldnt see light poor old worn out merchantman midwinter that ship broker have bought to break up let run in have look at midwinter hesitated old sympathy of sea life strongly inclined to follow allans suggestion wind be falling light distrusted broken water swirling current of channel ahead be ugly place to take boat into when know nothing about said nonsense returned allan a light a day float in two foot of water before midwinter must answer current caught boat swept onward through channel straight toward wreck lower sail said midwinter quietly ship oar be running down on fast enough now whether like not well accustomed to use of oar brought course of boat under sufficient control to keep on smoothest side of channel side be nearest to islet of calf a came swiftly up with wreck midwinter resigned oar to allan watching opportunity caught hold with boat hook on fore chain of vessel next moment have boat safely in hand under lee of wreck ship ladder used by workman hung over fore chain mounting with boat rope in teeth midwinter secured one end lowered other to allan in boat make that fast said wait till see if safe on board with word disappeared behind bulwark wait repeated allan in blankest astonishment at friend excessive caution what on earth doe mean ill be hanged if wait where one of go other go too hitched loose end of rope round forward thwart of boat swinging up ladder stood next moment on deck anything very dreadful on board inquired sarcastically a friend met midwinter smiled nothing whatever replied couldnt be sure that be to have whole ship to ourselves till got over bulwark looked about allan took turn on deck surveyed wreck critically from stem to stern not much of vessel said frenchman generally build better ship than midwinter crossed deck eyed allan in momentary silence frenchman repeated after interval be vessel french yes how do know men have got at work on yacht told know about midwinter came little nearer swarthy face began to look to allans eye unaccountably pale in moonlight did mention what trade be engaged in timber trade a allan gave answer midwinter lean brown hand clutched fast by shoulder midwinter teeth chattered in head like teeth of man struck by sudden chill did tell name asked in voice dropped suddenly to whisper did think have slipped memory gently old fellow long claw of yours be rather tight on shoulder be name stopped removed hand dashed away great drop be gathering on forehead be name la grace de dieu how deuce did come to know thats name sure enough la grace de dieu at one bound midwinter leaped on bulwark of wreck boat cried with scream of horror rang far wide through stillness of night brought allan instantly to side lower end of carelessly hitched rope be loose on water ahead in track of moonlight small black object be floating out of view boat be adrift iv shadow of past one stepping back under dark shelter of bulwark one standing out boldly in yellow light of moon two friend turned face to face on deck of timber ship looked at other in silence next moment allans inveterate recklessness seized on grotesque side of situation by main force seated astride on bulwark burst out boisterously into loudest heartiest laugh fault said there help for now here be hard fast in trap of own setting there go last of doctor boat come out of dark midwinter cant half see there want to know whats to be done next midwinter answered moved allan left bulwark mounting forecastle looked down attentively at water of sound one thing be pretty certain said with current on side sunken rock on cant find way out of scrape by swimming at rate so much for prospect at end of wreck let try how thing look at other rouse up messmate called out cheerfully a passed midwinter come see what old tub of timber ship have got to show astern sauntered on with hand in pocket humming chorus of comic song voice have produced apparent effect on friend at light touch of hand in passing midwinter started moved out slowly from shadow of bulwark come along cried allan suspending singing for moment glancing back still without word of answer other followed thrice stopped before reached stern end of wreck first time to throw aside hat push back hair from forehead temple second time reeling giddy to hold for moment by ring bolt close at hand last time though allan be plainly visible few yard ahead to look stealthily behind with furtive scrutiny of man who belief that other footstep be following in dark not yet whispered to with eye searched empty air will see astern with hand on lock of cabin door stern end of wreck be clear of ship breaker lumber accumulated in other part of vessel here one object rose visible on smooth surface of deck be low wooden structure held cabin door roofed in cabin stair wheel house have be removed binnacle have be removed cabin entrance have belonged to have be left untouched scuttle be on door be closed on gaining after part of vessel allan walked straight to stern looked out to sea over taffrail such thing a boat be in view anywhere on quiet moon brightened water knowing midwinter sight to be better than own called out come up here see if there fisherman within hail of hearing reply looked back midwinter have followed a far a cabin have stopped there called again in louder voice beckoned impatiently midwinter have heard call for looked up still never stirred from place there stood a if have reached utmost limit of ship must go further allan went back joined be not easy to discover what be looking at for kept face turned away from moonlight seemed a if eye be fixed with strange expression of inquiry on cabin door what be there to look at there allan asked let see if locked a took step forward to open door midwinter hand seized suddenly by coat collar forced back moment after hand relaxed without losing grasp trembled violently like hand of man completely unnerved be to consider in custody asked allan half astonished half amused why in name of wonder do keep staring at cabin door suspicious noise below use disturbing rat if thats what mean havent got dog with men living men cant be for must have heard come on deck dead men quite impossible ship crew must be drowned in land locked place like unless vessel broke up under here vessel a steady a church to speak for man alive how hand tremble what be there to scare in rotten old cabin what be shaking shivering about company of supernatural sort on board mercy preserve a old woman say do see ghost see two answered other driven headlong into speech action by maddening temptation to reveal truth two repeated breath bursting from in deep heavy gasp a tried vainly to force back horrible word ghost of man like drowning in cabin ghost of man like turning lock of door on once more young armadales hearty laughter rang out loud long through stillness of night turning lock of door be said allan a soon a merriment left breath enough to speak thats devilish unhandsome action master midwinter on part of ghost least can do after be to let mine out of cabin give run of ship with more than momentary exertion of superior strength freed easily from midwinter hold below there called out gayly a laid strong hand on crazy lock tore open cabin door ghost of allan armadale come on deck in terrible ignorance of truth put head into doorway looked down laughing at place where murdered father have died pah exclaimed stepping back suddenly with shudder of disgust air be foul already cabin be full of water be true sunken rock on vessel lay wrecked have burst way through lower timber astern water have welled up through rifted wood here where deed have be done fatal parallel between past present be complete what cabin have be in time of father that cabin be now in time of son allan pushed door to again with foot little surprised at sudden silence appeared to have fallen on friend from moment when have laid hand on cabin lock when turned to look reason of silence be instantly revealed midwinter have dropped on deck lay senseless before cabin door face turned up white still to moonlight like face of dead man in moment allan be at side looked uselessly round lonely limit of wreck a lifted midwinter head on knee for chance of help where chance be ruthlessly cut off what be to do said to in first impulse of alarm not drop of water near foul water in cabin sudden recollection crossed memory florid color rushed back over face drew from pocket wicker covered flask god bless doctor for giving before sailed broke out fervently a poured down midwinter throat drop of raw whisky flask contained stimulant acted instantly on sensitive system of swooning man sighed faintly slowly opened eye have be dreaming asked looking up vacantly in allans face eye wandered higher encountered dismantled mast of wreck rising weird black against night sky shuddered at sight of hid face on allans knee dream murmured to mournfully oh dream have be overtired day said allan infernal adventure of ours have upset take more whisky sure to do good can sit by if put against bulwark so why by why do leave asked midwinter allan pointed to mizzen shroud of wreck be still left standing be not well enough to rough here till workman come off in morning said must find way on shore at once if can be going up to get good view round see if there house within hail of even in moment passed while few word be spoken midwinter eye wandered back distrustfully to fatal cabin door dont go near whispered dont try to open for god sake returned allan humoring when come down from rigging ill come back here said word little constrainedly noticing for first time while now spoke underlying distress in midwinter face grieved perplexed youre not angry with said in simple sweet tempered way be fault know be brute fool to laugh at when ought to have seen be ill be so sorry midwinter dont be angry with midwinter slowly raised head eye rested with mournful interest long tender on allans anxious face angry repeated in lowest gentlest tone angry with oh poor boy be to blame for being kind to when be ill in old west country inn be to blame for feeling kindness thankfully be fault that never doubted other never knew that be traveling together blindfold on way be to lead here cruel time be coming allan when will rue day ever met shake hand brother on edge of precipice shake hand while be brother still allan turned away quickly convinced that mind have not yet recovered shock of fainting fit dont forget whisky said cheerfully a sprang into rigging mounted to mizzen top be past two moon be waning darkness come before dawn be beginning to gather round wreck behind allan a now stood looking out from elevation of mizzen top spread broad lonely sea before be low black lurking rock broken water of channel pouring white angry into vast calm of westward ocean beyond on right hand heaved back grandly from water side be rock precipice with little table land of grass between sloping down upward rolling heath solitude of isle of man on left hand rose craggy side of islet of calf here rent wildly into deep black chasm there lying low under long sweeping acclivity of grass heath sound rose light be visible on shore black line of topmost mast of wreck looked shadowy faint in darkening mystery of sky land breeze have dropped small shoreward wave fell noiseless far near sound be audible cheerless bubbling of broken water ahead pouring through awful hush of silence in earth ocean waited for coming day even allans careless nature felt solemn influence of time sound of own voice startled when looked down hailed friend on deck think see one house said here away on mainland to right looked again to make sure at dim little patch of white with faint white line behind nestling low in grassy hollow on main island look like stone house inclosure resumed ill hail on chance passed arm round rope to steady made speaking trumpet of hand suddenly dropped again without uttering sound so awfully quiet whispered to im half afraid to call out looked down again on deck shant startle midwinter will said with uneasy laugh looked once more at faint white object in grassy hollow do to have come up here for nothing thought made speaking trumpet of hand again time gave hail with whole power of lung on shore there shouted turning face to main island ahoy hoy hoy last echo of voice died away be lost sound answered cheerless bubbling of broken water ahead looked down again at friend saw dark figure of midwinter rise erect pace deck backward forward never disappearing out of sight of cabin when retired toward bow of wreck never passing beyond cabin when returned toward stern be impatient to get away thought allan ill try again hailed land once more taught by previous experience pitched voice in highest key time sound than sound of bubbling water answered lowing of frightened cattle rose from building in grassy hollow traveled far drearily through stillness of morning air allan waited listened if building be farmhouse disturbance among beast must rouse men if be only cattle stable nothing more must happen lowing of frightened brute rose fell drearily minute passed nothing happened once more said allan looking down at restless figure pacing beneath for third time hailed land for third time waited listened in pause of silence among cattle heard behind on opposite shore of channel faint far among solitude of islet of calf sharp sudden sound like distant clash of heavy door bolt drawn back turning at once in new direction strained eye to look for house last faint ray of waning moonlight trembled here there on higher rock on steeper pinnacle of ground great strip of darkness lay dense black over land between in darkness house if house there be be lost to view have roused somebody at last allan called out encouragingly to midwinter still walking to fro on deck strangely indifferent to be passing above beyond look out for answering hail with face set toward islet allan shouted for help shout be not answered mimicked with shrill shrieking derision with wilder wilder cry rising out of deep distant darkness mingling horribly expression of human voice with sound of brute sudden suspicion crossed allans mind made head swim turned hand cold a held rigging in breathless silence looked toward quarter from first mimicry of cry for help have come after moment pause shriek be renewed sound of came nearer suddenly figure seemed figure of man leaped up black on pinnacle of rock capered shrieked in waning gleam of moonlight scream of terrified woman mingled with cry of capering creature on rock red spark flashed out in darkness from light kindled in invisible window hoarse shouting of man voice in anger be heard through noise second black figure leaped up on rock struggled with first figure disappeared with in darkness cry grew fainter fainter scream of woman be stilled hoarse voice of man be heard again for moment hailing wreck in word made unintelligible by distance in tone plainly expressive of rage fear combined moment clang of door bolt be heard again red spark of light be quenched in darkness islet lay quiet in shadow once more lowing of cattle on main land ceased rose again stopped then cold cheerless a ever eternal bubbling of broken water welled up through great gap of silence one sound left a mysterious stillness of hour fell like mantle from heaven closed over wreck allan descended from place in mizzen top joined friend again on deck must wait till ship breaker come off to work said meeting midwinter halfway in course of restless walk after what have happened dont mind confessing that ive have enough of hailing land only think of there being madman in house ashore of waking horrible wasnt midwinter stood still for moment looked at allan with perplexed air of man who hears circumstance familiarly mentioned to be total stranger appeared if such thing have be possible to have passed over entirely without notice have just happened on islet of calf nothing be horrible out of ship said everything be horrible in answering in strange word turned away again went on with walk allan picked up flask of whisky lying on deck near revived spirit with dram here one thing on board that isnt horrible retorted briskly a screwed on stopper of flask here added a took cigar from case lit three oclock went on looking at watch settling comfortably on deck with back against bulwark daybreak isnt far off will have piping of bird to cheer up before long say midwinter seem to have quite got over unlucky fainting fit how do keep walking come here have cigar make comfortable whats good of tramping backward forward in restless way be waiting said midwinter waiting what for for what be to happen to to to of before be out of ship with submission to superior judgment dear fellow think quite enough have happened already adventure will do very well a stand now more of be more than want took dram of whisky rambled on between puff of cigar in usual easy way ive not got fine imagination old boy hope next thing that happens will be appearance of workman boat suspect that queer fancy of yours have be running away with while be down here by come now what be thinking of while be up in mizzen top frightening cow midwinter suddenly stopped suppose tell said suppose do torturing temptation to reveal truth roused once already by companion merciless gayety of spirit possessed of midwinter for second time leaned back in dark against high side of ship looked down in silence at allans figure stretched comfortably on deck rouse fiend whispered subtly from ignorant self possession that pitiless repose show place where deed be done let know with knowledge fear with dread tell of letter burned of word fire can destroy be living in memory now let see mind a be yesterday when roused sinking faith in own conviction to look back on life at sea to cherish comforting remembrance that in voyage have never fallen in with ship let see mind a be now when ship have got at turning point of new life at outset of friendship with one man of men whom father warned to avoid think of death bed word whisper in ear that may think of too hide from under assumed name put mountain sea between be ungrateful be unforgiving be be most repellent to own gentler nature rather than live under same roof breathe same air with man so tempter counseled so like noisome exhalation from father grave father influence rose poisoned mind of son sudden silence surprised allan looked back drowsily over shoulder thinking again exclaimed with weary yawn midwinter stepped out from shadow came nearer to allan than have come yet said thinking of past future past future repeated allan shifting comfortably into new position for part im dumb about past sore subject with past mean loss of doctor boat let talk about future have be taking practical view a dear old brock call have be considering next serious question that concern when get back to hotel question of breakfast after instant hesitation midwinter took step nearer have be thinking of future mine said have be thinking of time when way in life way in life will be two way instead of one here daybreak cried allan look up at mast theyre beginning to get clear again already beg pardon what be saying midwinter made reply struggle between hereditary superstition be driving on unconquerable affection for allan be holding back suspended next word on lip turned aside face in speechless suffering oh father thought better have killed on day when lay on bosom than have let live for whats about future persisted allan be looking for daylight didnt hear midwinter controlled answered have treated with usual kindness said in planning to take with to thorpe ambrose think on reflection have better not intrude where be not known not expected voice faltered stopped again more shrank from clearer picture of happy life that be resigning rose on mind allans thought instantly reverted to mystification about new steward have practiced on friend when be consulting together in cabin of yacht have be turning over in mind wondered allan be beginning at last to suspect truth ill try talk a much nonsense dear fellow a like rejoined dont forget that be engaged to see established at thorpe ambrose to give opinion of new steward midwinter suddenly stepped forward again close to allan be not talking about steward estate burst out passionately be talking about do hear be not fit companion for dont know who be drew back into shadowy shelter of bulwark a suddenly a have come out from o god cant tell said to in whisper for moment for moment only allan be surprised not know who be even a repeated word easy goodhumor got upper hand again took up whisky flask shook significantly say resumed how much of doctor medicine did take while be up in mizzen top light tone persisted in adopting stung midwinter to last pitch of exasperation came out again into light stamped foot angrily on deck listen to said dont know low thing have done in lifetime have be tradesman drudge have swept out shop put up shutter have carried parcel through street waited for master money at customer door have never done anything half a useful returned allan composedly dear old boy what industrious fellow have be in time ive be vagabond blackguard in time returned other fiercely ive be street tumbler tramp gypsy boy

in mine can take into society at thorpe ambrose why very name must be reproach to fancy face of new neighbor when footman announce ozias midwinter allan armadale in same breath burst into harsh laugh repeated two name again with scornful bitterness of emphasis insisted pitilessly on marked contrast between something in sound of laughter jarred painfully even on allans easy nature raised on deck spoke seriously for first time joke joke midwinter said a long a dont carry too far remember saying something of same sort to once before when be nursing in somersetshire forced to ask if deserved to be kept at arm length by of people in world dont force to say so again make a much fun of a please old fellow in other way that way hurt simple a word be simply a have be spoken appeared to work instant revolution in midwinter mind impressible nature recoiled a from sudden shock without word of reply walked away by to forward part of ship sat down on piled plank between mast passed hand over head in vacant bewildered way though father belief in fatality be own belief once more though there be longer shadow of doubt in mind that woman whom mr brock have met in somersetshire woman who have tried to destroy in london be one same though horror mastered when first read letter from wildbad have now mastered again allans appeal to past experience of other have come home to heart with force more irresistible than force of superstition in strength of very superstition now sought pretext might encourage to sacrifice le generous feeling to one predominant dread of wounding sympathy of friend why distress whispered to be not end here there be woman behind in dark why resist when mischief done caution come too late what be to be will be what have to do with future what have went back to allan sat down by side took hand forgive said gently have hurt for last time before be possible to reply snatched up whisky flask from deck come exclaimed with sudden effort to match friend cheerfulness have be trying doctor medicine why shouldnt allan be delighted be something like change for better said midwinter be again hark there be bird hail smiling morn smiling sang word of glee in old cheerful voice clapped midwinter on shoulder in old hearty way how did manage to clear head of confounded megrim do know be quite alarming about something happening to one other of before be out of ship sheer nonsense returned midwinter contemptuously dont think head have ever be quite right since fever ive got bee in bonnet a say in north let talk of something else about people have let cottage to wonder whether agent account of major milroys family be to be depended on there might be lady in household besides wife daughter oho cried allan youre beginning to think of nymph among tree flirtation in fruit garden be lady eh suppose major family circle wont supply will have to spin that half crown again toss up for be to have first chance with miss milroy for once midwinter spoke a lightly carelessly a allan no said major landlord have first claim to notice of major daughter ill retire into background wait for next lady who make appearance at thorpe ambrose very good ill have address to woman of norfolk posted in park to effect said allan be particular to shade about size complexion whats favorite age midwinter trifled with own superstition a man trifle with loaded gun may kill with savage animal may maim for life mentioned age a have reckoned of woman in black gown red paisley shawl five thirty said a word passed lip factitious spirit deserted left seat impenetrably deaf to allans effort at rallying on extraordinary answer resumed restless pacing of deck in dead silence once more haunting thought have gone to fro with in hour of darkness went to fro with now in hour of daylight once more conviction possessed of mind that something be to happen to allan to before left wreck minute by minute light strengthened in eastern sky shadowy place on deck of timber ship revealed barren emptiness under eye of day a breeze rose again sea began to murmur wakefully in morning light even cold bubbling of broken water changed cheerless note softened on ear a mellowing flood of daylight poured warm over from rising sun midwinter paused near forward part of ship recalled wandering attention to passing time cheering influence of hour be round look where might happy morning smile of summer sky so brightly merciful to old weary earth lavished embracing beauty even on wreck dew lay glittering on inland field lay glittering on deck worn rusted rigging be gemmed a brightly a fresh green leaf on shore insensibly a looked round midwinter thought reverted to comrade who have shared with adventure of night returned to after part of ship spoke to allan a advanced receiving answer approached recumbent figure looked closer at left to own resource allan have let fatigue of night take own way with head have sunk back hat have fallen off lay stretched at full length on deck of timber ship deeply peacefully asleep midwinter resumed walk mind lost in doubt own past thought seeming suddenly to have grown strange to how darkly foreboding have distrusted coming time how harmlessly that time have come sun be mounting in heaven hour of release be drawing nearer nearer of two armadales imprisoned in fatal ship one be sleeping away weary time other be quietly watching growth of new day sun climbed higher hour wore on with latent distrust of wreck still clung to midwinter looked inquiringly on shore for sign of awakening human life land be still lonely smoke wreath be soon to rise from cottage chimney have not risen yet after moment thought went back again to after part of vessel to see if there might be fisherman boat within hail astern of absorbed for moment by new idea passed allan hastily after barely noticing that still lay asleep one step more must have brought to taffrail when step be suspended by sound behind sound like faint groan turned looked at sleeper on deck knelt softly looked closer have come whispered to not to to have come in bright freshness of morning have come in mystery terror of dream face midwinter have last seen in perfect repose be now distorted face of suffering man perspiration stood thick on allans forehead matted curling hair partially opened eye showed nothing white of eyeball gleaming blindly outstretched hand scratched struggled on deck from moment to moment moaned muttered helplessly word escaped be lost in grinding gnashing of teeth there lay so near in body to friend who bent over so far away in spirit that two might have be in different world there lay with morning sunshine on face in torture of dream one question one only rose in mind of man who be looking at have fatality have imprisoned in wreck decreed that must see have treachery of sleep opened gate of grave to one of two armadales whom other have kept in ignorance of truth be murder of father revealing to son there on very spot where crime have be committed in vision of dream with question overshadowing else in mind son of homicide knelt on deck looked at son of man whom father hand have slain conflict between sleeping body waking mind be strengthening moment dreamer helpless groaning for deliverance grew louder hand raised clutched at empty air struggling with mastering dread still held midwinter laid hand gently on allans forehead light a touch be there be mysterious sympathy in dreaming man answered groaning ceased hand dropped slowly there be instant of suspense midwinter looked closer breath just fluttered over sleeper face before next breath have risen to lip allan suddenly sprang up on knee sprang up a if call of trumpet have rung on ear awake in instant have be dreaming said midwinter a other looked at wildly in first bewilderment of waking allans eye began to wander about wreck at first vacantly then with look of angry surprise be here still said a midwinter helped to foot else do on board infernal ship added after moment wont go to sleep again a said word friend eye searched face in silent inquiry took turn together on deck tell dream said midwinter with strange tone of suspicion in voice strange appearance of abruptness in manner cant tell yet returned allan wait little till im own man again took turn on deck midwinter stopped spoke once more look at for moment allan said there be something of trouble left by dream something of natural surprise at strange request just addressed to in allans face a turned full on speaker shadow of ill will no lurking line of distrust anywhere midwinter turned aside quickly hid a best might irrepressible outburst of relief do look little upset asked allan taking arm leading on again dont make nervous about if do head feel wild giddy will soon get over for next few minute walked backward forward in silence one bent on dismissing terror of dream from thought other bent on discovering what terror of dream might be relieved of dread have oppressed superstitious nature of midwinter have leaped to next conclusion at bound what if sleeper have be visited by revelation than revelation of past what if dream have opened unturned page in book of future told story of life to come bare doubt that might be so strengthened tenfold midwinter longing to penetrate mystery allans silence still kept secret from be head more composed asked can tell dream now while put question last memorable moment in adventure of wreck be at hand have reached stern be just turning again when midwinter spoke a allan opened lip to answer looked out mechanically to sea instead of replying suddenly ran to taffrail waved hat over head with shout of exultation midwinter joined saw large six oared boat pulling straight for channel of sound figure thought recognized rose eagerly in stern sheet returned waving of allans hat boat came nearer steersman called to cheerfully recognized doctor voice thank god youre above water said mr hawbury a met on deck of timber ship of wind of heaven wind blew here looked at midwinter a made inquiry be allan who told story of night allan who asked doctor for information in return one absorbing interest in midwinter mind interest of penetrating mystery of dream kept silent throughout heedless of be said done about watched allan followed allan like dog until time came for getting down into boat mr hawburys professional eye rested on curiously noting varying color incessant restlessness of hand wouldnt change nervous system with man for largest fortune must be offered thought doctor a took boat

boatman advice have made first for most dangerous place on coast only place in calm weather in accident must have happened to boat sailed by experienced men channel of sound after thus accounting for welcome appearance on scene doctor hospitably insisted that guest of evening must be guest of morning a well must still be too early when got back for people at hotel to receive must find bed breakfast at mr hawburys house at first pause in conversation between allan doctor midwinter who have joined in talk listened to talk touched friend on arm be better asked in whisper will soon be composed enough to tell want to know allans eyebrow contracted impatiently subject of dream midwinter obstinacy in returning to seemed to be alike distasteful to hardly answered with usual good humor suppose will have peace till tell said so may a well get over at once returned midwinter with look at doctor oarsman not where other people can hear not till be alone if wish to see last gentleman of quarter for night interposed doctor now be time coast will shut vessel out in minute more in silence on one side on other two armadales looked last at fatal ship lonely lost have found wreck in

way midwinter followed door closed shut in together v shadow of future when mr hawbury joined guest in breakfast room strange contrast of character between have noticed already be impressed on mind more strongly than ever one of sat at well spread table hungry happy ranging from dish to dish declaring that have never made breakfast in life other sat apart at window cup thanklessly deserted before be empty meat left ungraciously half eaten on plate doctor morning greeting to two accurately expressed differing impression have produced on mind clapped allan on shoulder saluted with joke bowed constrainedly to midwinter said be afraid have not recovered fatigue of night not night doctor have damped spirit said allan something have be telling be not fault mind if have only known beforehand that believed in dream have opened lip dream repeated doctor looking at midwinter directly addressing under mistaken impression of meaning of allans word with constitution ought to be well used to dreaming by time way doctor have taken wrong turning cried allan im dreamer not dont look astonished wasnt in comfortable house be on board confounded timber ship fact be fell asleep just before took off wreck not to be denied that have very ugly dream well when got back here why do trouble mr hawbury about matter can not possibly interest asked midwinter speaking for first time speaking very impatiently beg pardon returned doctor rather sharply so far a have heard matter doe interest thats right doctor said allan be interested beg pray want to clear head of nonsense have got in now what do think will have that dream be warning to to avoid certain people actually persists in saying that one of people be did ever hear like of took great pain explained whole thing to said warning be hanged indigestion dont know what ate drank at doctor supper table do do think must listen to not try next youre professional man must listen to be good fellow doctor give certificate of indigestion ill show tongue with pleasure sight of face be quite enough said mr hawbury certify on spot that never have such thing a indigestion in life let hear about dream see what can make of if have objection be to say allan pointed at midwinter with fork apply to friend there said have got much better account of than can give if youll believe took down in writing from own lip made sign at end a if be last dying speech confession before went to gallows out with old boy saw put in pocket book out with be really in earnest asked midwinter producing pocketbook with reluctance be almost offensive under circumstance for implied distrust of doctor in doctor own house mr hawburys color rose pray dont show to if feel least unwillingness said with elaborate politeness of offended man stuff nonsense cried allan throw over here instead of complying with characteristic request midwinter took paper from pocket book leaving place approached mr hawbury beg pardon said a offered doctor manuscript with own hand eye dropped to ground face darkened while made apology secret sullen fellow thought doctor thanking with formal civility friend be worth ten thousand of midwinter went back to window sat down again in silence with old impenetrable resignation have once puzzled mr brock read that doctor said allan a mr hawbury opened written paper not told in roundabout way there nothing added to nothing taken away exactly what dreamed exactly what must have written if have thought thing worth putting down on paper if have have knack of writing concluded allan composedly stirring coffee havent except letter rattle off in time mr hawbury spread manuscript before on breakfast table read line allan armadales dream early on morning of june first eighteen hundred fifty one found through circumstance be not important to mention in place left alone with friend of mine young man about own age on board french timber ship named la grace de dieu ship then lay wrecked in channel of sound between main land of isle of man islet called calf having not be in bed previous night feeling overcome by fatigue fell asleep on deck of vessel be in usual good health at time morning be far enough advanced for sun to have risen under circumstance at period of day passed from sleeping to dreaming a clearly a can recollect after lapse of few hour be succession of event presented to by dream first event of be conscious be appearance of father took silently by hand found in cabin of ship water rose slowly over in cabin father sank through water together interval of oblivion followed then sense came to of being left alone in darkness waited darkness opened showed vision a in picture of broad lonely pool surrounded by open ground above farther margin of pool saw cloudless western sky red with light of sunset on near margin of pool there stood shadow of woman be shadow only indication be visible to by must identify compare with living creature long robe showed that be shadow of woman showed nothing more darkness closed again remained with for interval opened for second time found in room standing before long window only object of furniture of ornament saw that can now remember having seen be little statue placed near window opened on lawn flower garden rain be pattering heavily against glass be not alone in room standing opposite to at window be shadow of man saw more of knew more of than saw knew of shadow of woman shadow of man moved stretched out arm toward statue statue fell in fragment on floor with confused sensation in be partly anger partly distress stooped to look at fragment when rose again shadow have vanished saw more darkness opened for third time showed shadow of woman shadow of man together surrounding scene none can now call to mind be visible to man shadow be nearest woman shadow stood back from where stood there came sound a of pouring of liquid softly saw touch shadow of man with one hand with other give glass took glass gave to in moment when put to lip deadly faintness mastered from head to foot when came to sens again shadow have vanished third vision be at end darkness closed over again interval of oblivion followed be conscious of nothing more till felt morning sun shine on face heard friend tell have awakened from dream after reading narrative attentively to last line under appeared allans signature doctor looked across breakfast table at midwinter tapped finger on manuscript with satirical smile many men many opinion said dont agree with of about dream theory added looking at allan with smile have disposed of already supper that cant digest be supper have yet to be discovered theory will come to presently friend theory claim attention first turned again to midwinter with anticipated triumph over man whom disliked little too plainly visible in face manner if understand rightly went on believe that dream be warning supernaturally addressed to mr armadale of dangerous event be threatening of dangerous people connected with event whom must do wisely to avoid may inquire whether have arrived at conclusion a habitual believer in dream a having reason of own for attaching especial importance to one dream in particular have stated what conviction be quite accurately returned midwinter chafing under doctor look tone excuse if ask to be satisfied with admission to let keep reason to myself thats exactly what said to interposed allan dont believe have got reason at gently gently said mr hawbury can discus subject without intruding into anybodys secret let come to own method of dealing with dream next mr midwinter will probably not be surprised to hear that look at matter from essentially practical point of view will not be at surprised retorted view of medical man when have problem in humanity to solve seldom range beyond point of dissecting knife doctor be little nettled on side limit be not quite so narrow a that said willingly grant that there be article of faith in doctor dont believe for example dont believe that reasonable man be justified in attaching supernatural interpretation to phenomenon come within range of sens until have certainly ascertained that there be such thing a natural explanation of to be found in first instance come thats fair enough im sure exclaimed allan hit hard with dissecting knife doctor now have hit back again with natural explanation let have by mean said mr hawbury here be there be nothing at extraordinary in theory of dream be theory accepted by great mass of profession dream be reproduction in sleeping state of brain of image impression produced on in waking state reproduction be more le involved imperfect contradictory a action of certain faculty in dreamer be controlled more le completely by influence of sleep without inquiring further into latter part of subject very curious interesting part of let take theory roughly generally a have just stated apply at once to dream now under consideration took up written paper from table dropped formal tone a of lecturer addressing audience into have insensibly fallen see one event already in dream resumed know to be reproduction of waking impression produced on mr armadale in own presence if will only help by exerting memory dont despair of tracing back whole succession of event set down here to something that have said thought seen done in four twenty hour le preceded falling asleep on deck of timber ship ill exert memory with greatest pleasure said allan where will start from start by telling what did yesterday before met friend on road to place replied mr hawbury will say got up have breakfast what next took carriage next said allan drove from castletown to douglas to see old friend mr brock off by steamer to liverpool came back to castletown separated at hotel door midwinter went into house went on to yacht in harbor by bye doctor remember have promised to go cruising with before leave isle of man many thanks suppose keep to matter in hand what next allan hesitated in sens of word mind be at sea already what did do on board yacht oh know put cabin to right thoroughly to right give word of honor turned blessed thing topsy turvy friend there came off in shore boat helped talking of boat have never asked yet whether boat came to harm last night if there damage done insist on being allowed to repair doctor abandoned further attempt at cultivation of allans memory in despair doubt if will be able to reach object conveniently in way said will be better to take event of dream in regular order to ask question naturally suggest a go on here be first two event to begin with dream that father appears to that find yourselves in cabin of ship that water rise over that sink in together be down in cabin of wreck may ask couldnt be down there replied allan a cabin be full of water looked in saw shut door again very good said mr hawbury here be waking impression clear enough so far have have cabin in mind have have water in mind sound of channel current a well know without asking be last sound in ear when went to sleep idea of drowning come too naturally out of such impression a to need dwelling on be there anything else before go on yes there be one more circumstance left to account for most important circumstance of remarked midwinter joining in conversation without stirring from place at window mean appearance of mr armadales father be just coming to answered mr hawbury be father alive added addressing to allan once more father died before be born doctor started complicates little said how did know that figure appearing to in dream be figure of father allan hesitated again midwinter drew chair little away from window looked at doctor attentively for first time be father in thought before went to sleep pursued mr hawbury be there description of portrait of at home in mind of course there be cried allan suddenly seizing lost recollection midwinter remember miniature found on floor of cabin when be putting yacht to right said didnt seem to value told did because be portrait of father be face in dream like face in miniature asked mr hawbury exactly like say doctor be beginning to get interesting what do say now asked mr hawbury turning toward window again midwinter hurriedly left chair placed at table with allan just a have once already taken refuge from tyranny of own superstition in comfortable common sense of mr brock so with same headlong eagerness with same straightforward sincerity of purpose now took refuge in doctor theory of dream say what friend say answered flushing with sudden enthusiasm be beginning to get interesting go on pray go on doctor looked at strange guest more indulgently than have looked yet be only mystic have met with said who be willing to give fair evidence fair play dont despair of converting before inquiry come to end let get on to next set of event resumed after referring for moment to manuscript interval of oblivion be described a succeeding first of appearance in dream may be easily disposed of mean in plain english momentary cessation of brain intellectual action while deeper wave of sleep flow over just a sense of being alone in darkness follows indicates renewal of action previous to reproduction of set of impression let see what be lonely pool surrounded by open country sunset sky on further side of pool shadow of woman on near side very good now for mr armadale how did pool get into head open country saw on way from castletown to place have pool lake hereabouts can have seen none recently elsewhere for came here after cruise at sea must fall back on picture book conversation with friend allan looked at midwinter dont remember talking about pool lake said do instead of answering question midwinter suddenly appealed to doctor have got last number of manx newspaper asked doctor produced from sideboard midwinter turned to page containing extract from recently published travel in australia have roused allans interest on previous evening reading of have ended by sending friend to sleep there in passage describing suffering of traveler from thirst subsequent discovery saved life there appearing at climax of narrative be broad pool of water have figured in allans dream dont put away paper said doctor when midwinter have shown to with necessary explanation before be at end of inquiry be quite possible may want that extract again have got at pool how about sunset nothing of sort be referred to in newspaper extract search memory again mr armadale want waking impression of sunset if please once more allan be at loss for answer once more midwinter ready memory helped through difficulty think can trace way back to impression a traced way back to other said addressing doctor after got here yesterday afternoon friend took long walk over hill thats interposed allan remember sun be setting a came back to hotel for supper be such splendid red sky stopped to look at then talked about mr brock wondered how far have got on journey home memory may be slow one at starting doctor when once set going stop if can havent half done yet wait one minute in mercy to mr midwinter memory mine said doctor have traced back to waking impression vision of open country pool sunset shadow of woman have not be accounted for yet can find original of mysterious figure in dream landscape allan relapsed into former perplexity midwinter waited for what be to come with eye fixed in breathless interest on doctor face for first time there be unbroken silence in room mr hawbury looked interrogatively from allan to allans friend of answered between shadow shadow substance there be great gulf of mystery impenetrable alike to three of patience said doctor composedly let leave figure by pool for present try if cant pick up again a go on allow to observe mr midwinter that be not very easy to identify shadow wont despair impalpable lady of lake may take consistency when next meet with midwinter made reply from moment interest in inquiry began to flag what be next scene in dream pursued mr hawbury referring to manuscript mr armadale find in room be standing before long window opening on lawn flower garden rain be pattering against glass only thing see in room be little statue only company have be shadow of man standing opposite to shadow stretch out arm statue fall in fragment on floor dreamer in anger distress at catastrophe observe gentleman here sleeper reasoning faculty wake up little dream pass rationally for moment from cause to effect stoop to look at broken piece when look up again scene have vanished be to say in ebb flow of sleep be turn of flow now brain rest little whats matter mr armadale have that restive memory of yours run away with again yes said allan im off at full gallop ive run broken statue to earth nothing more le than china shepherdess knocked off mantel piece in hotel coffee room when rang bell for supper last night say how well get on dont like guessing riddle now then midwinter turn next said doctor turn if please claim long window garden lawn a property will find long window mr armadale in next room if look out youll see garden lawn in front of if youll exert wonderful memory of yours will recollect that be good enough to take special complimentary notice of smart french window neat garden when drove friend to port st mary yesterday quite right rejoined allan so did what about rain fell in dream havent seen drop of rain for last week mr hawbury hesitated manx newspaper have be left on table caught eye if can think of nothing else said let try if cant find idea of rain where found idea of pool looked through extract carefully have got exclaimed here be rain described a having fallen on thirsty australian traveler before discovered pool behold shower mr armadale got into mind when read extract to friend last night behold dream mr midwinter mixing up separate waking impression just a usual can find waking impression account for human figure at window asked midwinter be to pas over shadow of man a have passed over shadow of woman already put question with scrupulous courtesy of manner with tone of sarcasm in voice caught doctor ear set up doctor controversial bristle on instant when be picking up shell on beach mr midwinter usually begin with shell lie nearest at hand rejoined be picking up fact now be easiest to get at be fact will take first let shadow of man shadow of woman pair off together for present wont lose sight of promise in good time dear sir in good time too be polite too be sarcastic short truce between opponent be at end already midwinter returned significantly to former place by window doctor instantly turned back on window more significantly still allan who never quarreled with anybodys opinion never looked below surface of anybodys conduct drummed cheerfully on table with handle of knife go on doctor called out wonderful memory be a fresh a ever be said mr hawbury referring again to narrative of dream do remember what happened when be gossiping with landlady at bar of hotel last night of course do be kind enough to hand glass of brandy water landlady have just mixed for own drinking be obliged to refuse because a told taste of brandy always turn sick faint mix how please exactly so returned doctor here be incident reproduced in dream see man shadow woman shadow together time hear pouring out of liquid brandy from hotel bottle water from hotel jug glass be handed by woman shadow landlady to man shadow man shadow hand to exactly what did faintness have previously described to follows in due course be shocked to identify mysterious appearance mr midwinter with such miserably unromantic original a woman who keep hotel man who physic country district friend will tell that glass of brandy water be prepared by landlady that reached by passing from hand to mine have picked up shadow exactly a anticipated have only to account now may be done in two word for manner of appearance in dream after having tried to introduce waking impression of doctor landlady separately in connection with wrong set of circumstance dreaming mind come right at third trial introduces doctor landlady together in connection with right set of circumstance there be in nutshell permit to hand back manuscript with best thanks for very complete striking confirmation of rational theory of dream saying word mr hawbury returned written paper to midwinter with pitiless politeness of conquering man wonderful not point missed anywhere from beginning to end by jupiter cried allan with ready reverence of intense ignorance what thing science be not point missed a say remarked doctor complacently yet doubt if have succeeded in convincing friend have not convinced said midwinter dont presume on account to say that be wrong spoke quietly almost sadly terrible conviction of supernatural origin of dream from have tried to escape have possessed of again interest in argument be at end sensitiveness to irritating influence be gone in case of other man mr hawbury must have be mollified by such concession a adversary have now made to disliked midwinter too cordially to leave in peaceable enjoyment of opinion of own do admit asked doctor more pugnaciously than ever have traced back event of dream to waking impression preceded in mr armadales mind have wish to deny that have done so said midwinter resignedly have identified shadow with living original have identified to own satisfaction to friend satisfaction not to mine not to yours can identify can only wait till living original stand revealed in future spoken like oracle mr midwinter have idea at present of who living original may be have believe that coming event will identify shadow of woman with person whom friend have not met with yet shadow of man with allan attempted to speak doctor stopped let clearly understand said to midwinter leaving own case out of question for moment may ask how shadow have distinguishing mark about be to be identified with living woman whom friend doesnt know midwinter color rose little began to feel lash of doctor logic landscape picture of dream have distinguishing mark replied in landscape living woman will appear when living woman be first seen same thing will happen suppose pursued doctor with man shadow persist in identifying with will be associated in future with statue broken in friend presence with long window looking out on garden with shower of rain pattering against glass do say that say so again presume with next vision mysterious woman will be brought together in place now unknown will present to mr armadale liquid yet unnamed will turn faint do seriously tell believe seriously tell believe according to view fulfillment of dream will mark progress of certain coming event in mr armadales happiness mr armadales safety will be dangerously involved that be firm conviction doctor rose laid aside moral dissecting knife considered for moment took up again one last question said have reason to give for going out of way to adopt mystical view a when unanswerably rational explanation of dream lie straight before reason replied midwinter can give to to friend doctor looked at watch with air of man who be suddenly reminded that have be wasting time have common ground to start from said if talk till doomsday must not agree excuse leaving rather abruptly be later than thought morning batch of sick people be waiting for in surgery have convinced mind mr armadale at rate so time have given to discussion have not be altogether lost pray stop here smoke cigar will be at service again in le than hour nodded cordially to allan bowed formally to midwinter quitted room a soon a doctor back be turned allan left place at table appealed to friend with irresistible heartiness of manner have always found way to midwinter sympathy from first day when met at somersetshire inn now sparring match between doctor be over said allan have got two word to say on side will do something for sake wont do for own midwinter face brightened instantly will do anything ask said very well will let subject of dream drop out of talk altogether from time forth yes if wish will go step further will leave off thinking about dream hard to leave off thinking about allan will try thats good fellow now give that trumpery bit of paper let tear up have done with tried to snatch manuscript out of friend hand midwinter be too quick for kept beyond reach come come pleaded allan ive set heart on lighting cigar with midwinter hesitated painfully be hard to resist allan did resist ill wait little said before light cigar with how long till to morrow longer till leave isle of man longer hang give plain answer to plain question how long will wait midwinter carefully restored paper to place in pocketbook ill wait said till get to thorpe ambrose end of first book book second lurking mischief from ozias midwinter to mr brock thorpe ambrose june dear mr brock only hour since reached house just a servant be locking up for night allan have gone to bed worn out by long day journey have left in room call library to tell story of journey to norfolk being better seasoned than be to fatigue of kind eye be quite wakeful enough for writing letter though clock on chimney piece point to midnight have be traveling since ten in morning last news have of be news sent by allan from isle of man if be not mistaken wrote to tell of night passed on board wrecked ship forgive dear mr brock if say nothing on subject until time have helped to think of with quieter mind hard fight against must all be fought over again will win yet please god will indeed there be need to trouble with account of journeying about northern western district of island of short cruise took when repair of yacht be at last complete will be better if get on at once to morning of yesterday fourteenth have come in with night tide to douglas harbor a soon a post office be open allan by advice sent on shore for letter messenger returned with one letter only writer of proved to be former mistress of thorpe ambrose mr blanchard ought to be informed think of content of letter for have seriously influenced allans plan loses everything sooner later a know have lost letter already so must give substance of what mr blanchard wrote to a plainly a can first page announced departure of lady from thorpe ambrose left on day before yesterday thirteenth having after much hesitation finally decided on going abroad to visit old friend settled in italy in neighborhood of florence appears to be quite possible that mr blanchard niece may settle there too if can find suitable house ground to let like italian country italian people be well enough off to please elder lady have jointure younger be in possession of father fortune next page of letter be in allans opinion far from pleasant page to read after referring in most grateful term to kindness have left niece free to leave old home at own time mr blanchard added that allans considerate conduct have produced strongly favorable impression among friend dependent of family that be desirous of giving public reception on arrival among preliminary meeting of tenant on estate principal person in neighboring town have already be held to discus arrangement letter might be expected shortly from clergyman inquiring when must suit mr armadales convenience to take possession personally publicly of estate in norfolk will now be able to guess cause of sudden departure from isle of man first foremost idea in old pupil mind a soon a have read mr blanchards account of proceeding at meeting be idea of escaping public reception one certain way must see of avoiding be to start for thorpe ambrose before clergyman letter must reach tried hard to make think little before acted on first impulse in matter only went on packing portmanteau in own impenetrably good humored way in ten minute luggage be ready in five minute more have given crew direction for taking yacht back to somersetshire steamer to liverpool be alongside of in harbor have really no choice to go on board with to let go by spare account of stormy voyage of detention at liverpool of train missed on journey across country know that have got here safely be enough what servant think of new squire sudden appearance among without word of warning be of great consequence what committee for arranging public reception may think of when news fly abroad to morrow be be afraid more serious matter having already mentioned servant may proceed to tell that latter part of mr blanchards letter be entirely devoted to instructing allan on subject of domestic establishment have left behind seems that servant indoors out with three exception be waiting here on chance allan will continue in place two of exception be readily accounted for mr blanchards maid miss blanchards maid go abroad with mistress third exceptional case be case of upper housemaid here there be little hitch in plain word housemaid have be sent away at moment notice for what mr blanchard rather mysteriously describes a levity of conduct with stranger be afraid will laugh at must confess truth have be made so distrustful after what happened to in isle of man of even most trifling misadventure connect in way with allans introduction to new life prospect have already questioned one of men servant here about apparently unimportant matter of housemaid going away in disgrace can learn be that strange man have be noticed hanging suspiciously about ground that housemaid be so ugly woman a to render next to certainty that have underhand purpose to serve in making agreeable to that have not a yet be seen again in neighborhood since day of dismissal so much for one servant who have be turned out at thorpe ambrose can only hope there be trouble for allan brewing in quarter a for other servant who remain mr blanchard describes men woman a perfectly trustworthy will doubt continue to occupy present place having now done with mr blanchards letter next duty be to beg in allans name with allans love to come here stay with at earliest moment when can leave somersetshire although can not presume to think that own wish will have special influence in determining to accept invitation must nevertheless acknowledge have reason of own for earnestly desiring to see here allan have innocently caused new anxiety about future relation with sorely need advice to show right way of setting anxiety at rest difficulty now perplexes relates to steward place at thorpe ambrose before to day only knew that allan have hit on plan of own for dealing with matter rather strangely involving among other result letting of cottage be old steward place of abode in consequence of new steward contemplated residence in great house chance word in conversation on journey here led allan into speaking out more plainly than have spoken yet heard to unutterable astonishment that person who be at bottom of whole arrangement about steward be other than be needle to tell how felt new instance of allans kindness first pleasure of hearing from own lip have deserved strongest proof must give of confidence in be soon dashed by pain mix with pleasure at least with have ever known never have past life seemed so dreary to look back on a seems now when feel how entirely have unfitted to take place of others must have liked to occupy in friend service mustered courage to tell have none of business knowledge business experience steward ought to posse generously met objection by telling must learn have promised to send to london for person who have already be employed for time being in steward office who will therefore be perfectly competent to teach do too think can learn if do will work day night to instruct if a be afraid steward duty be of far too serious kind to be learned off hand by man so young so inexperienced a be then pray hasten journey to thorpe ambrose exert influence over allan personally nothing le will induce to pas over to employ steward who be really fit to take place pray pray act in matter a think best for allans interest disappointment may feel will not see believe dear mr brock gratefuly yours ozias midwinter p open envelope again to add one word more if have heard

with from moment to moment there mingled deeper quieter tone soothing compassionate of voice of man although distance be too great to allow midwinter to distinguish word be spoken felt impropriety of remaining within hearing of voice at once stepped forward to continue walk at same moment face of young girl easily recognizable a face of miss milroy from allans description of appeared at open window of room in spite of midwinter paused to look at expression of bright young face have smiled so prettily on allan be weary disheartened after looking out absently over park suddenly turned head back into room attention having be apparently struck by something have just be said in oh mamma mamma exclaimed indignantly how can say such thing word be spoken close to window reached midwinter ear

road have advanced sign post be to be seen country on side be lonely flat intersected by broad drain ditch cattle be grazing here there windmill rose in distance above pollard willow that fringed low horizon not house be to be seen not human creature appeared on visible perspective of one of three road midwinter glanced back in only direction left to look at direction of road along have just be walking there to relief be figure of man rapidly advancing toward of whom must ask way figure came on clad from head to foot in dreary black moving blot on brilliant white surface of sun brightened road be lean elderly miserably respectable man wore poor old black dress coat cheap brown wig made pretense of being own natural hair short black trouser clung like attached old servant round wizen

high a haggard jaw one morsel of color carried about be lawyer bag of blue serge a lean limp a one attractive feature in clean shaven weary old face be neat set of teeth teeth a honest a wig said plainly to inquiring eye pas night on looking glass day in mouth little blood in man body faintly reddened fleshless cheek a midwinter advanced to meet asked way to thorpe ambrose weak watery eye looked hither thither in bewilderment painful to see if have met with lion instead of man if few word addressed to have be word expressing threat instead of question must hardly have looked more confused alarmed than looked now for first time in life midwinter saw own shy uneasiness in presence of stranger reflected with tenfold intensity of nervous suffering in face of man man old enough to be father do please to mean town house beg pardon for asking go by same name in part spoke with timid gentleness of tone ingratiatory smile anxious courtesy of manner distressingly suggestive of being accustomed to receive rough answer in exchange for own politeness from person whom habitually addressed be not aware that house town went by same name said midwinter meant house instinctively conquered own shyness a answered in word speaking with cordiality of manner be very rare with in intercourse with stranger man of miserable respectability seemed to feel warm return of own politeness

miss milroy ran indoors to warn father of mr armadales arrival to add that be bringing with noisy stranger who be in probability friend generally reported to be staying with squire at great house have major daughter guessed right be squire loud talking loud laughing companion shy sensitive midwinter of other time be even so in allans presence that morning extraordinary change have passed over

to undecided difficulty of choosing day for audit dinner have pressed for settlement once more have be fixed at last under butler advice for saturday twenty eighth of month be only on turning round to remind midwinter of ample space of time new arrangement allowed for mastering steward book that even allans flighty attention have be arrested by marked change in face confronted have openly noticed change in usual blunt manner have be instantly silenced by fretful almost angry reply two have sat down together to breakfast without usual cordiality meal have proceeded gloomily till midwinter broke silence by bursting into strange outbreak of gayety have revealed in allans eye new side to character of friend a usual with most of allans judgment here again conclusion be wrong be new side to midwinter character that now presented be only new aspect of one ever recurring struggle of midwinter life irritated by allans discovery of change in dreading next question allans curiosity might put midwinter have roused to efface by main force impression own altered appearance have produced be one of effort men compass so resolutely a men of quick temper sensitive feminine organization with whole mind still possessed by firm belief that fatality have taken one great step nearer to allan since rector adventure in kensington garden with face still betraying what have suffered under renewed conviction that father death bed warning be now in event after event asserting terrible claim to part at sacrifice from one human creature whom loved with fear still busy at heart that first mysterious vision of allans dream might be vision realized before new day now saw two armadales together be day have passed over head with triple bond wrought by own superstition fettering at moment a have never fettered yet mercilessly spurred resolution to desperate effort of rivaling in allans presence gayety good spirit of allan talked laughed heaped plate indiscriminately from dish on breakfast table made noisily merry with jest have humor story have point first astonished allan then amused then won easily encouraged confidence on subject of miss milroy shouted with laughter over sudden development of allans view on marriage until servant downstairs began to think that master strange friend have gone mad lastly have accepted allans proposal that must be presented to major daughter judge of for a readily nay more readily than must have be accepted by least diffident man living there two now stood at cottage gate midwinter voice rising louder louder over allans midwinter natural manner disguised how madly miserably none knew in coarse masquerade of boldness outrageous unendurable boldness of shy man be received in parlor by major daughter pending arrival of major allan attempted to present friend in usual form to astonishment midwinter took word flippantly out of lip introduced to miss milroy with confident look hard laugh clumsy assumption of ease presented at worst artificial spirit lashed continuously into higher higher effervescence since morning be now mounting hysterically beyond own control looked spoke with terrible freedom of license be necessary consequence when diffident man have thrown off reserve of very effort by have broken loose from own restraint involved in confused medley of apology be not wanted of compliment might have overflattered vanity of savage looked backward forward from miss milroy to allan declared jocosely that understood now why friend morning walk be always taken in same direction asked question about mother cut short answer gave by remark on weather in one breath said must feel day insufferably hot in protested that quite envied in cool muslin dress major came in before must say two word midwinter overwhelmed with same frenzy of familiarity same feverish fluency of speech expressed interest in mr milroys health in term must have be exaggerated on lip of friend of family overflowed into perfect flood of apology for disturbing major at mechanical pursuit quoted allans extravagant account of clock expressed own anxiety to see in term more extravagant still paraded superficial book knowledge of great clock at strasbourg with far fetched jest on extraordinary automaton figure that clock put in motion on procession of twelve apostle walk out under dial at noon on toy cock crow at st peter appearance before man who have studied wheel in complex machinery who have passed whole year of life in trying to imitate hear have outnumbered strasbourg apostle outcrowed strasbourg cock exclaimed with tone manner of friend habitually privileged to waive ceremony be dying absolutely dying major to see wonderful clock major milroy have entered room with mind absorbed in own mechanical contrivance a usual sudden shock of midwinter familiarity be violent enough to recall instantly to to make master again for time of social resource a man of world excuse for interrupting said stopping midwinter for moment by look of steady surprise happen to have seen clock at strasbourg sound almost absurd in ear if will pardon for saying so to put little experiment in light of comparison with wonderful achievement there be nothing else of kind like in world paused to control own mounting enthusiasm clock at strasbourg be to major milroy what name of michael angelo be to sir joshua reynolds mr armadales kindness have led to exaggerate little pursued major smiling at allan passing over attempt of midwinter to seize on talk a if such attempt have be made a there doe happen to be one point of resemblance between great clock abroad little clock at home that show what can do on stroke of noon a be close on twelve now if still wish to visit workshop mr midwinter sooner show way to better opened door apologized to midwinter with marked ceremony for preceding out of room what do think of friend whispered allan a miss milroy followed must tell truth mr armadale whispered back of course then dont like at he best dearest fellow in world rejoined outspoken allan youll like better when know better im sure will miss milroy made little grimace implying supreme indifference to midwinter saucy surprise at allans earnest advocacy of merit of friend have got nothing more interesting to say to than wondered privately after kissing hand twice yesterday morning be in major workroom before allan have chance of trying more attractive subject there on top of rough wooden case evidently contained machinery be wonderful clock dial be crowned by glass pedestal placed on rock work in carved ebony on top of pedestal sat inevitable figure of time with everlasting scythe in hand below dial be little platform at end of rose two miniature sentry box with closed door externally be that appeared until magic moment came when clock struck twelve noon wanted then about three minute to twelve major milroy seized opportunity of explaining what exhibition be to be before exhibition began at first word mind fell back again into old absorption over one employment of life turned to midwinter who have persisted in talking way from parlor who be talking still without trace left in manner of cool cutting composure with have spoken few minute before noisy familiar man who have be ill bred intruder in parlor became privileged guest in workshop for there possessed atoning social advantage of being new to performance of wonderful clock at first stroke of twelve mr midwinter said major quite eagerly keep eye on figure of time will move scythe point downward to glass pedestal will next see little printed card appear behind glass will tell day of month day of week at last stroke of clock time will lift scythe again into former position chime will ring peal peal will be succeeded by playing of tune favorite march of old regiment then final performance of clock will follow sentry box may observe at side will open at same moment in one of will see sentinel appear from other corporal two private will march across platform to relieve guard will then disappear leaving new sentinel at post must ask kind allowance for last part of performance machinery be little complicated there be defect in be ashamed to say have not yet succeeded in remedying a must wish sometimes figure go wrong sometimes go right hope may do best on occasion of seeing for first time a major posted near clock said last word little audience of three assembled at opposite end of room saw hour hand minute hand on dial point together to twelve first stroke sounded time true to signal moved scythe day of month day of week announced in print through glass pedestal next midwinter applauding appearance with noisy exaggeration of surprise miss milroy mistook for coarse sarcasm directed at father pursuit allan seeing that be offended attempted to moderate by touching elbow of friend meanwhile performance of clock went on at last stroke of twelve time lifted scythe again chime rang march tune of major old regiment followed crowning exhibition of relief of guard announced in preliminary trembling of sentry box sudden disappearance of major at back of clock performance began with opening of sentry box on right hand side of platform a punctually a must be desired door on other side however be le tractable remained obstinately closed unaware of hitch in proceeding corporal two private appeared in place in state of perfect discipline tottered out across platform three trembling in limb dashed headlong against closed door on other side failed in producing smallest impression on immovable sentry presumed to be within intermittent clicking a of major key tool at work be heard in machinery corporal two private suddenly returned backward across platform shut up with bang inside own door exactly at same moment other door opened for first time provoking sentry appeared with utmost deliberation at post waiting to be relieved be allowed to wait nothing happened in other box occasional knocking inside door a if corporal private be impatient to be let out clicking of major tool be heard again among machinery corporal party suddenly restored to liberty appeared in violent hurry spun furiously across platform quick a be however hitherto deliberate sentry on other side now perversely showed to be quicker still disappeared like lightning into own premise door closed smartly after corporal private dashed headlong against for second time major appearing again round corner of clock asked audience innocently if must be good enough to tell whether anything have gone wrong fantastic absurdity of exhibition heightened by major milroys grave inquiry at end of be so irresistibly ludicrous that visitor shouted with laughter even miss milroy with consideration for father sensitive pride in clock must not restrain from joining in merriment catastrophe of puppet have provoked there be limit even to license of laughter limit be ere long so outrageously overstepped by one of little party a to have effect of almost instantly silencing other two fever of midwinter false spirit flamed out into sheer delirium a performance of puppet came to end paroxysm of laughter followed other with such convulsive violence that miss milroy started back from in alarm even patient major turned on with look said plainly leave room allan wisely impulsive for once in life seized midwinter by arm dragged out by main force into garden thence into park beyond good heaven what have come to exclaimed shrinking back from tortured face before a stopped looked close at for first time for moment midwinter be incapable of answering hysterical paroxysm be passing from one extreme to other leaned against tree sobbing gasping for breath stretched out hand in mute entreaty to allan to give time have better not have nursed through fever said faintly a soon a must speak im mad miserable allan have never recovered go back ask to forgive be ashamed to go ask cant tell how happened can only ask pardon theirs turned aside head quickly so a to conceal face dont stop here said dont look at will soon get over allan still hesitated begged hard to be allowed to take back to house be useless break heart with kindness burst out passionately for god sake leave by self allan went back to cottage pleaded there for indulgence to midwinter with earnestness simplicity raised immensely in major estimation totally failed to produce same favorable impression on miss milroy little a suspected be fond enough of allan already to be jealous of allans friend how excessively absurd thought pettishly a if papa considered person of slightest consequence will kindly suspend opinion wont major milroy said allan in hearty way at parting with greatest pleasure replied major cordially shaking hand too miss milroy added allan miss milroy made mercilessly formal bow opinion mr armadale be not of slightest consequence allan left cottage sorely puzzled to account for miss milroys sudden coolness toward grand idea of conciliating whole neighborhood by becoming married man underwent modification a closed garden gate behind virtue called prudence squire of thorpe ambrose became personally acquainted with other on occasion for first time allan entering headlong a usual on high road to moral improvement actually decided on doing nothing in hurry man who be entering on course of reformation ought if virtue be own reward to be man engaged in essentially inspiriting pursuit virtue be not always own reward way lead to reformation be remarkably ill lighted for so respectable thoroughfare allan seemed to have caught infection of friend despondency a walked home too began to doubt in widely different way for widely different reason whether life at thorpe ambrose be promising quite a fairly for future a have promised at first vii plot thickens two message be waiting for allan when returned to house one have be left by midwinter have gone out for long walk mr armadale be not to be alarmed if did not get back till late in day other message have be left by person from mr pedgifts office who have called according to appointment while two gentleman be away at

then to change subject mentioned mr bashwoods message midwinter mind be so preoccupied so languid that hardly seemed to remember name allan be obliged to remind that bashwood be elderly clerk whom mr pedgift have sent to be instructor in duty of steward office listened without making remark withdrew to room to rest till dinner time left by allan went into library to try if must while away time over book took many volume off shelf put few of back again there ended miss milroy contrived in mysterious manner to get in case between reader book formal bow merciless parting speech dwelt try how might to forget on allans mind began to grow more more anxious a idle hour wore on to recover lost place in favor to call again day at cottage ask if have be so unfortunate a to offend be impossible to put question in writing with needful nicety of expression proved on trying experiment to be task beyond literary reach after turn two up down room with pen in mouth decided on more diplomatic course happened in case to be easiest course too of writing to miss milroy a cordially a if nothing have happened of testing position in good grace by answer that sent back invitation of kind including father of course addressed directly to herself be plainly right thing to oblige to send written reply here difficulty occurred of what invitation be to be ball be not to be thought of in

interval elapsed before wine made appearance midwinter looked at chance acquaintance of high road with strangely mingled feeling of compassion distrust of compassion strengthened in spite of of distrust persisted in diminishing try a might to encourage to grow there perched comfortless on edge of chair sat poor broken down nervous wretch in worn black garment with watery eye honest old outspoken wig miserable mohair stock false teeth be incapable of deceiving anybody there sat politely ill at ease now shrinking in glare of lamp now wincing under shock of allans sturdy voice man with wrinkle of sixty year in face manner of child in presence of stranger object of pity surely if ever there be pitiable object yet else youre afraid of mr bashwood cried allan pouring out glass of wine

bashwood beyond kind of doubt have in unaccountable manner failed to find two strangely assorted companion be left together parted widely a seemed on surface from possible interchange of sympathy drawn invisibly one to other nevertheless by magnetic similarity of temperament overleap difference of age station defy apparent incongruity of mind character from moment when allan left room hidden influence work in darkness began slowly to draw two men together across great social desert have lain between up to day midwinter be first to approach subject of interview may ask began if have be made acquainted with position here if know why be that require assistance mr bashwood still hesitating still timid manifestly relieved by allans departure sat further back in chair ventured on

sir john considered only right to say that have complaint to make of want of capacity integrity in steward if mr bashwoods domestic position have be compatible with continued performance of duty on estate sir john must have be glad to keep a be embarrassment caused by state of mr bashwoods personal affair have rendered undesirable that must continue in sir john service on ground that only employer have parted such be sir john testimony to mr bashwoods character a midwinter read last line thought of testimonial still in own possession of written character have given at school when turned sick usher adrift in world superstition distrusting new event new face at thorpe ambrose still doubted man before a obstinately a ever when now tried to put doubt into word heart upbraided laid letter on table in silence sudden pause in conversation appeared to startle mr bashwood comforted with little sip of wine leaving letter untouched burst irrepressibly into word a if silence be quite unendurable to be ready to answer question sir began mr pedgift told that must answer question because be applying for place of trust mr pedgift said mr armadale be likely to think testimonial sufficient of sir john doesnt say might have put more kindly dont complain sir john doesnt say what trouble be that lost place perhaps might wish to know stopped confusedly looked at testimonial said

from mr pedgift if prefer too stopped confusedly looked at testimonial said more there be moment of silence night be warm mr bashwood among other misfortune have deplorable infirmity of perspiring in palm of hand took out miserable little cotton pocket handkerchief rolled up into ball softly dabbed to fro from one hand to other with regularity of pendulum performed by other men under other

governess of course ill tell major major milroy be at moment preparing to mount wooden watch tower of cottage to see view ever useful pedgift volunteered to go up with rattle off necessary local explanation in time reed cutter must occupy in describing own neighborhood to stranger allan remained standing in front of cottage more quiet more thoughtful than usual interview with young pedgift have brought absent friend to memory for first time since picnic party have started be surprised that midwinter so much in thought on other occasion must have be so long out of thought now something troubled like sense of self reproach a mind reverted to faithful friend at home toiling hard over steward book in interest for sake dear old fellow thought allan will be so glad to see at mere day pleasure wont be complete till join must be right wrong mr armadale if guessed that be thinking of somebody asked voice softly behind allan turned found major daughter at side miss milroy not unmindful of certain tender interview have taken place behind carriage have noticed admirer standing thoughtfully by have determined on giving opportunity while father young pedgift be at top of watch tower know everything said allan smiling be thinking of somebody miss milroy stole glance at glance of gentle encouragement there must be one human creature in mr armadales mind after what have passed between that morning must be only act of mercy to take back again at once to interrupted conversation of few hour since on subject of name have be thinking of somebody too said half inviting half repelling coming avowal if tell first letter of somebody name will tell first letter of yours will tell anything like rejoined allan with utmost enthusiasm still shrank coquettishly from very subject that wanted to approach tell letter first said in low tone looking away from allan laughed m said be first letter started little strange that must be thinking of by surname instead of christian name mattered little a long a be thinking of what be letter asked allan blushed smiled if will have answered in reluctant little whisper stole look at luxuriously protracted enjoyment of coming avowal once more how many syllable be name in asked drawing pattern shyly on ground with end of parasol man with slightest knowledge of sex must have be rash enough in allans position to tell truth allan who knew nothing whatever of woman nature who told truth right left in mortal emergency answered a if have be under examination in court of justice name in three syllable said miss milroys downcast eye flashed up at like lightning three repeated in blankest astonishment allan be too inveterately straightforward to take warning even now im not strong at spelling know said with lighthearted laugh dont think im wrong in calling midwinter name in three syllable be thinking of friend never mind thought tell who be tell whom be thinking of of first letter of alphabet mr armadale beg positively to inform of nothing more with annihilating answer major daughter put up parasol walked back by herself to boat allan stood petrified with amazement if miss milroy have actually boxed ear there be denying that have privately longed to devote hand to purpose must hardly have felt more bewildered than felt now what on earth have done asked helplessly a major young pedgift joined three walked down together to water side wonder what shell say to next said absolutely nothing never so much a looked at allan when took place in boat there sat with eye complexion much brighter than usual taking deepest interest in curate progress toward recovery in state of mr pentecost spirit in pedgift junior for whom ostentatiously made room enough to let sit beside in scenery reed cutter cottage in everybody everything allan whom must have married with greatest pleasure five minute since ill never forgive thought major daughter to be thinking of ill bred wretch when be thinking of to make confess before found out thank heaven mr pedgift be in boat in frame of mind miss neelie applied forthwith to fascination of pedgift discomfiture of allan oh mr pedgift how extremely clever kind of to think of showing that sweet cottage lonely mr armadale dont think lonely at must like of thing to live there what must picnic have be without mr pedgift cant think how have enjoyed since got into boat cool mr armadale what

meant to do something musical too dare say sing very well when know word to tell truth always did always will hate moore melody thus with merciless dexterity of manipulation did miss milroy work sharpest female weapon of offense tongue thus must have used for time longer if allan have only shown necessary jealousy if pedgift have only afforded necessary encouragement adverse fortune have decreed that must select for victim two men essentially unassailable under existing circumstance allan be too innocent of knowledge of female subtlety susceptibility to understand anything except that charming neelie be unreasonably out of temper with without slightest cause wary pedgift a became one of quick witted youth of present generation submitted to female influence with eye fixed immovably time on own interest many young man of past generation who be fool have sacrificed everything for love not one young man in ten thousand of present generation except fool have sacrificed half penny daughter of eve still inherit mother merit commit mother fault son of adam in latter day be men who must have handed famous apple back with bow thanks might get into scrape when allan surprised

wont do set at once to rouse allans spirit by diverting attention to new subject there be to be regatta autumn on one of broad client opinion a yachtsman might be valuable to committee something new must think to sir in sailing match on fresh water said in most ingratiatory manner allan instantly interested answered quite new do tell about a for rest of party at other end of boat be in fair way to confirm mr pentecost doubt whether hilarity of picnic must last day out poor neelies natural feeling of irritation under disappointment allans awkwardness have inflicted on be now exasperated into silent settled resentment by own keen sense of humiliation defeat major have relapsed into habitually dreamy absent manner mind be turning monotonously with wheel of clock curate still secluded indigestion from public view in innermost recess of cabin curate mother with second dose ready at moment notice sat on guard at door woman of mr pentecost age character generally enjoy own bad spirit

lay between two broad view on side be now limited to nothing interminable row of reed not sound be heard far near not so much a glimpse of cultivated inhabited land appeared anywhere trifle dreary hereabouts mr armadale said ever cheerful pedgift be just out of now look ahead sir here be at hurle mere reed opened back on right hand left boat glided suddenly into wide circle of pool round nearer half of circle eternal reed still fringed margin of water round further half land appeared again here rolling back from pool in desolate sand hill there rising above in sweep of grassy shore at one

reflection failed to tinge be beginning to look black cold solitude have be soothing silence have felt like enchantment on other broad in day vigorous prime be solitude saddened here silence struck cold in stillness melancholy of day decline course of boat be directed across mere to creek in grassy shore one two of little flat bottomed punt peculiar to broad lay in creek reed cutter to whom punt

milroy pretty nearly wild enough isnt to be prairie here there be temptation principally of smaller kind be not in defensive capacity of female human nature to resist temptation to direct whole force of influence a one young lady of party toward instant overthrow of allans arrangement for meeting friend be too much for major daughter turned on smiling pedgift with look ought to have overwhelmed who ever overwhelmed solicitor think most lonely dreary hideous place ever saw in life said miss neelie if insist on making tea here mr pedgift dont make for will stop in boat though be absolutely dying with thirst will touch nothing till get back again to other broad major opened lip to remonstrate to daughter infinite delight mr pentecost rose from seat before must say word after surveying

arrangement proposed that from nature of country carriage must not have be ordered round to hurle mere without in first instance sending whole of way back to thorpe ambrose mr pentecost speaking in son interest instantly declared that earthly power must induce to be out on water after dark call boat cried old lady in great agitation there water there night mist wherever there night mist son samuel catch cold dont talk to about moonlight tea making youre mad hi two men there cried mr pentecost hailing silent reed cutter on shore sixpence apiece for if youll take son back in boat before

of lady let keep company at mere said allan pressing back theyre in low spirit on board if want to be of service to stop like good fellow where be do best to keep thing going waved hand men pushed boat off from shore others waved hand in return except major daughter who sat apart from rest with face hidden under parasol tear stood thick in neelies eye last angry feeling against allan died out heart went back to penitently moment left boat how good be to thought what wretch be got up with generous impulse in nature urging to make atonement to got up reckless of appearance looked after with eager eye flushed check a stood alone on shore dont be long mr armadale said with desperate disregard of what rest of company thought of boat be already far out in water with neelies resolution word be spoken in faint little voice failed to reach allans ear one sound heard a boat gained opposite extremity of mere disappeared slowly among reed be sound of concertina indefatigable pedgift be keeping thing going evidently under auspex of mr pentecost by performing sacred melody left by allan lit cigar took turn backward forward on shore might have said word to at parting thought ive done everything for best ive a good a told how fond of be be way treat stopped stood looking absently at sinking sun fast darkening water of mere inscrutable influence in scene forced way stealthily into mind diverted thought from miss milroy to absent friend started looked about reed cutter have gone back to retreat behind angle of wall not living creature be visible not sound rose anywhere along dreary shore even allans spirit began to get depressed be nearly hour after time when midwinter have promised to be at hurle mere have arranged to walk to pool with stable boy from thorpe ambrose a guide by lane footpath shortened distance by road boy knew country well midwinter be habitually punctual at appointment have anything gone wrong at thorpe ambrose have accident happened on way determined to remain no longer doubting idling by allan made up mind to walk inland from mere on chance of meeting friend went round at once to angle in wall asked one of reedcutters to show footpath to thorpe ambrose man led away from road pointed to barely perceptible break in outer tree of plantation after pausing for one more useless look around allan turned back on mere made for tree for few pace path ran straight through plantation thence took sudden turn water open country became lost to view allan steadily followed grassy track before seeing nothing hearing nothing until came to winding of path turning in new direction saw dimly human figure sitting alone at foot of one of tree two step nearer be enough to make figure familiar to midwinter exclaimed in astonishment be not place where be to meet be waiting for here midwinter rose without answering evening dimness among tree obscured face made silence doubly perplexing allan went on eagerly questioning did come here by

country beyond wood saw afar in gray twilight long line of embankment distant glimmer of railway lamp beckoning away already to iron road be only when now paused before closed door behind be only when own impetuous rapidity of action came for first time to check that nobler nature of man rose in protest against superstitious despair be hurrying from that held dear conviction of terrible necessity of leaving allan for allans good have not be shaken for instant since have seen first vision of dream realized on shore of mere now for first time own heart rose against in unanswerable rebuke go if must will remember time when be ill sat by bedside friendless opened heart to write if fear to speak write ask to forgive before leave forever half opened door closed again softly midwinter sat down

extraordinary silence amused rather than angered followed pupil back to cottage be only when last trace of have disappeared that midwinter roused attempted to realize position in stood revelation of beauty be in respect answerable for breathless astonishment have held spell bound up to moment one clear impression have produced on thus far began ended with discovery of astounding contradiction that face offered in one feature after to description in mr brocks letter beyond be vague misty dim consciousness of tall elegant woman of kind word modestly gracefully spoken to nothing more advanced few step into garden without knowing why stopped glancing hither thither like man lost recognized summer house by effort a if year have elapsed since have seen made way out again at last into park even here wandered first in one direction then in mind be still reeling under shock have fallen on perception be confused something kept mechanically in action walking eagerly without motive walking knew not where far le sensitively organized man might have be overwhelmed a be overwhelmed now by immense instantaneous revulsion of feeling event of last few minute have wrought in mind at memorable instant when have opened door of summer house confusing influence troubled faculty in related to position toward friend have reached absolutely definite conclusion by absolutely definite process of thought whole strength of motive have driven into resolution to part from allan rooted in belief that have seen at hurle mere fatal fulfillment of first vision of dream belief in turn rested necessarily on conviction that woman who be one survivor of tragedy in madeira must be also inevitably woman whom have seen standing in shadow place at pool firm in persuasion have compared object of distrust of rector distrust with description written by rector description carefully minute by man entirely trustworthy own eye have informed that woman whom have seen at mere woman whom mr brock have identified in london be not one two in place of dream shadow there have stood on evidence of rector letter not instrument of fatality stranger such doubt a might have troubled le superstitious man be started in mind by discovery have now opened on never occurred to to ask whether stranger might not be appointed instrument of fatality now when letter have persuaded that stranger have be revealed a figure in dream landscape such idea entered must enter mind one woman whom superstition dreaded be woman who have entwined with life of two armadales in first generation with fortune of two armadales in second who be at once marked object of father death bed warning first cause of family calamity have opened allans way to thorpe ambrose estate woman in word whom must have known instinctively for mr brocks letter to be woman whom have now actually seen looking at event a have just happened under influence of misapprehension into rector have innocently misled mind saw seized new conclusion instantaneously acting precisely a have acted in past time of interview with mr brock at isle of man exactly a have once declared to be sufficient refutation of idea of fatality that have never met with timber ship in of voyage at sea so now seized on similarly derived conclusion that whole claim of dream to supernatural origin stood self refuted by disclosure of stranger in shadow place once started from point once encouraged to let love for allan influence undividedly again mind hurried along whole resulting chain of thought at lightning speed if dream be proved to be no longer warning from other world followed inevitably that accident not fate have led way to night on wreck that event have happened since allan have parted from mr brock be event in harmless superstition have distorted from proper shape in le than moment mobile imagination have taken back to morning at castletown when have revealed to rector secret of name when have declared to rector with father letter before eye better faith be in now once more felt heart holding firmly by bond of brotherhood between allan now once more must say with eager sincerity of old time if thought of leaving break heart thought of leaving be wrong a nobler conviction possessed again of mind quieting tumult clearing confusion within house at thorpe ambrose with allan on step waiting looking for opened on eye through tree sense of illimitable relief lifted eager spirit high above care doubt fear have oppressed so long showed once more better brighter future of early dream eye filled with tear pressed rector letter in wild passionate way to lip a looked at allan through vista of tree for morsel of paper thought life might have be one long sorrow to father crime might have parted forever such be result of stratagem have shown housemaid face to mr brock a face of miss gwilt so by shaking midwinter trust in own superstition in one case in superstition pointed to truth did mother oldershaws cunning

servant witness of family scandal have correctly drawn that major mother in securing service of well recommended governess for son have thought part of duty to consider governess look in purely fanciful interest of major wife be inference be simply impossible to convey into mr milroys mind miss gwilt have barely closed sick room door when whispered word hissed out of mr milroys lip before

garden have be detected immediately in park have be asked with most exasperating politeness if wished to join miss gwilt in walk small circumstance of kind be sufficiently suspicious to mind of jealous woman be discovered in abundance circumstance on to found valid ground of complaint might be laid before major proved to be utterly wanting day followed day miss gwilt remained persistently correct in conduct persistently irreproachable in relation toward employer pupil foiled in direction mr milroy tried next to find assailable place in statement governess reference have made on subject of governess character obtaining from major minutely careful report mother have addressed to on topic mr milroy read reread failed to find weak point of be in search in part of letter customary

delicacy on side be part of duty to intrude on poor thing private sorrow only business be to do what have now done to make sure be engaging capable respectable governess to instruct grandchild after careful consideration of line mr milroy having strong desire to find circumstance suspicious found suspicious accordingly determined to sift mystery of miss gwilts family misfortune to bottom on chance of extracting from something useful to purpose there be two way of doing might begin by questioning governess might begin by questioning governess reference experience of miss gwilts quickness of resource in dealing with awkward question at introductory interview decided on taking latter course ill get particular from reference first thought mr milroy then question creature see if two story agree letter of inquiry be short scrupulously to point mr milroy began by informing correspondent that state of health necessitated leaving daughter entirely under governess influence control on account be more anxious than most mother to be thoroughly informed in respect about person to whom confided entire charge of only child feeling anxiety might perhaps be excused for putting what might be thought after excellent character miss gwilt have received somewhat unnecessary question with preface mr milroy came to point requested to be informed of circumstance have obliged miss gwilt to go out a governess letter expressed in term be posted same day on morning when answer be due answer appeared next morning arrived still there be reply when third morning came mr milroys impatience have broken loose from restraint have rung for nurse in manner have be already recorded have ordered woman to be in waiting to receive letter of morning with own hand in position matter now stood in domestic circumstance new series of event at thorpe ambrose took rise mr milroy have just looked at watch have just put hand once more to bell pull when door opened nurse entered room have postman come asked mr milroy nurse laid letter on bed without answering waited with unconcealed curiosity to watch effect produced on mistress mr milroy tore open envelope instant be in hand printed paper appeared threw aside surrounding letter looked at in own handwriting snatched up printed paper be customary post office circular informing that letter have be duly presented at right address that person whom have written to be not to be found something wrong asked nurse detecting change in mistress face question passed unheeded mr milroys writing desk be on table at bedside took from letter major have written to son turned to page containing name address of miss gwilts reference mr mandeville kingsdown crescent bayswater read eagerly to then looked at address on own returned letter error have be committed direction be identically same something wrong reiterated nurse advancing step nearer to bed thank god yes cried mr milroy with sudden outburst of exultation tossed post office circular to nurse beat bony hand on bedclothes in ecstasy of anticipated triumph miss gwilts impostor miss gwilts impostor if die for rachel ill be carried to window to see police take away one thing to say shes impostor behind back thing to prove to face remarked nurse put hand a spoke into apron pocket with significant look at mistress silently produced second letter for asked mr milroy said nurse for miss gwilt two woman eyed other understood other without word where be said mr milroy nurse pointed in direction of park out again for walk before breakfast by mr milroy beckoned to nurse to stoop close over can open rachel whispered rachel nodded can close again so that nobody must know can spare scarf match pearl gray dress asked rachel take said mr milroy impatiently nurse opened wardrobe in silence took scarf in silence left room in silence in le than five minute came back with envelope of miss gwilts letter open in hand thank maam for scarf said rachel putting open letter composedly on counterpane of bed mr milroy looked at envelope have be closed a usual by mean of adhesive gum have be made to give way by application of steam a mr milroy took out letter hand trembled violently white enamel parted into crack over wrinkle on forehead rachel withdrew to window to keep watch on park dont hurry said sign of yet mr milroy still paused keeping important morsel of paper folded in hand must have taken miss gwilts life hesitated at reading miss gwilts letter be troubled with scruple asked nurse with sneer consider duty owe to daughter wretch said mr milroy with expression of opinion opened letter be evidently written in great haste be undated be signed in initial only thus ran diana street dear lydia cab be waiting at door have only moment to tell that be obliged to leave london on business for three four day week at longest letter will be forwarded if write got yours yesterday agree with that be very important to put off awkward subject of yourself

will write again about give own idea in meantime dont risk meeting too often in park yours m o well asked nurse returning to bedside have done with meeting in park repeated mr milroy with eye still fastened on letter rachel where be major in own room dont believe have own way want letter envelope can close again so that wont know what can open can shut anything more nothing more mr milroy be left alone again to review plan of attack by new light have now be thrown on miss gwilt information have be gained by opening governess letter pointed plainly to conclusion that adventuress have stolen way into house by mean of false reference having be obtained by act of treachery be impossible to acknowledge be not information must be used for warning major for exposing miss gwilt one available weapon in mr milroys hand be weapon furnished by own returned letter one question to decide be how to make best speediest use of longer turned matter over in mind more hasty premature seemed exultation have felt at first sight of post office circular that lady acting a reference to governess must have quitted residence without leaving trace behind without even mentioning address to letter must be forwarded be circumstance in sufficiently suspicious to be mentioned to major mr milroy however perverted estimate of husband might be in respect knew enough of character to be assured that if told what have happened must frankly appeal to governess for explanation miss gwilts quickness cunning must in case produce plausible answer on spot major partiality must be only too ready to accept must at same time doubt place matter in train by mean of post for due arrival of needful confirmation on part of accomplice in london to keep strict silence for present to institute without governess knowledge such inquiry a might be necessary to discovery of undeniable evidence be plainly only safe course to take with man a major with such woman a miss gwilt helpless to whom must mr milroy commit difficult dangerous task of investigation nurse even if be to be trusted must not be spared at day notice must not be sent away without risk of exciting remark be there other competent reliable person to employ either at thorpe ambrose in london mr milroy turned from side to side of bed searching corner of mind for needful discovery searching in vain oh if must only lay hand on man must trust thought despairingly if only knew where to look for somebody to help a idea passed through mind sound of daughter voice startled from other side of door may come in asked neelie what do want returned

confidentially to public house youll get good will get there echoed mr bashwood still mechanically repeating what be said to will get good will seemed to be paralyzed action depended absolutely on what other people told to do took few step in direction of public house hesitated staggered caught at pillar of one of station lamp near porter followed took by arm once more why youve be drinking already exclaimed man with suddenly quickened interest in mr bashwoods case what be beer mr bashwood in low lost tone echoed last word be close on porter dinner time when lower order of english people believe have discovered intoxicated man sympathy with be boundless porter let dinner take chance carefully assisted mr bashwood to reach public house gin bitter will put on leg again whispered samaritan setter right of alcoholic disaster of mankind if mr bashwood have really be intoxicated effect of porter remedy must have be marvelous indeed almost a soon a glass be emptied stimulant did work long weakened nervous system of deputy steward prostrated for moment by shock have fallen on rallied again like weary horse under spur dull flush on cheek dull stare in eye disappeared simultaneously after momentary effort recovered memory enough of what have passed to thank porter to ask whether must take something worthy creature instantly accepted dose of own remedy in capacity of preventive went home to dinner a only men can go home who be physically warmed by gin bitter morally elevated by performance of good action still strangely abstracted conscious now of way by went mr bashwood left public house few minute later in turn walked on mechanically in dreary black garment moving like blot on white surface of sun brightened road a midwinter have seen move in early day at thorpe ambrose when have first met arrived at point where have to choose between way led into town way led to great house stopped incapable of deciding careless apparently even of making attempt ill be revenged on whispered to still absorbed in jealous frenzy of rage against woman who have deceived ill be revenged on repeated in louder tone if spend half penny ive got woman of disorderly sort passing on way to town heard ah old brute called out with measureless license of class whatever did served right coarseness of voice startled whether comprehended word not shrank away from more interruption more insult into quieter road led to great house at solitary place by wayside stopped sat down took off hat lifted youthful wig little from bald old head tried desperately to get beyond one immovable conviction lay on mind like lead conviction that miss gwilt have be purposely deceiving from first be useless effort must free from that one dominant impression from one answering idea that have evoked idea of revenge got up again put on hat walked rapidly forward little way then turned without knowing why slowly walked back again if have only dressed little smarter said poor wretch helplessly if have only be little bolder with might have overlooked being old man angry fit returned on clinched clammy trembling hand shook fiercely in empty air ill be revenged on reiterated ill be revenged on if spend half penny ive got be terribly suggestive of hold have taken on that vindictive sense of injury must not get far enough away from to reach man whom believed to be rival even yet in rage a in love be absorbed body soul by miss gwilt in moment more noise of running wheel approaching from behind startled turned looked round there be mr pedgift elder rapidly overtaking in gig just a mr pedgift have overtaken once already on former occasion when have listened under window at great house when lawyer have bluntly charged with feeling curiosity about miss gwilt in instant inevitable association of idea burst on mind opinion of miss gwilt have heard lawyer express to allan at parting flashed back into memory side by side with mr pedgifts sarcastic approval of anything in way of inquiry own curiosity might attempt may be even with yet thought if mr pedgift will help stop sir called out desperately a gig came up with if please sir want to speak to pedgift senior slackened pace of fast trotting mare without pulling up come to office in hour said im busy now without waiting for answer without noticing mr bashwoods bow gave mare rein again be out of sight in minute mr bashwood sat down once more in shady place by roadside appeared to be incapable of feeling slight one unpardonable slight put upon by miss gwilt not only declined to resent even made best of mr pedgifts unceremonious treatment of hour said resignedly time enough to compose want time very kind of mr pedgift though mightnt have meant sense of oppression in head forced once again to remove hat sat with on lap deep in thought face bent low wavering finger of one hand drumming absently on crown of hat if mr pedgift elder seeing a sat now must only have looked little way into future monotonously drumming hand of deputy steward might have be strong enough feeble a be to stop lawyer by roadside be worn weary miserable old hand of worn weary miserable old man be for to use language of mr pedgifts own parting prediction to allan hand be now destined to let light in on miss gwilt xiii old man heart punctual to moment when half hour interval have expired mr bashwood be announced at office a waiting to see mr pedgift by special appointment lawyer looked up from paper with air of annoyance have totally forgotten meeting by roadside see what want said pedgift senior to pedgift junior working in same room with if nothing of importance put off to other time pedgift junior swiftly disappeared swiftly returned well asked father well answered son be rather more shaky unintelligible than usual can make nothing out of except that persists in wanting to see own idea pursued pedgift junior with usual sardonic gravity be that be going to have fit that wish to acknowledge uniform kindness to by obliging with private view of whole proceeding pedgift senior habitually matched everybody son included with own weapon be good enough to remember augustus rejoined that room be not court of law bad joke be not invariably followed by roar of laughter here let bashwood come in mr bashwood be introduced pedgift junior withdrew mustnt bleed sir whispered incorrigible joker a passed back of father chair hot water bottle to sol of foot mustard plaster on pit of stomach thats modern treatment sit down bashwood said pedgift senior when be alone dont forget time money out with be at quickest possible rate in fewest possible word preliminary direction bluntly not at unkindly spoken rather increased than diminished painful agitation under mr bashwood be suffering stammered more helplessly trembled more continuously than usual a made little speech of thanks added apology at end for intruding on patron in business hour everybody in place mr pedgift sir know time be valuable oh dear yes oh dear yes most valuable most valuable excuse sir im coming out with goodness rather business goodness gave hour to wait have thought of what have to say prepared put short having got a far a that stopped with pained bewildered look have put away in memory now when time came be too confused to find there be mr pedgift mutely waiting face manner expressive alike of silent sense of value of own time patient who have visited great doctor client who have consulted lawyer in large practice know so well have heard news sir stammered mr bashwood shifting ground in despair letting uppermost idea in mind escape simply because be one idea in be ready to come out doe concern asked pedgift senior mercilessly brief mercilessly straight in coming to point concern lady sir not lady young man ought to say in whom used to feel interest oh mr pedgift sir what do think mr armadale miss gwilt have gone up to london together to day alone sir alone in carriage reserved for two self do think he going to marry do really think like rest of he going to marry put question with sudden flush in face sudden energy in manner sense of value of lawyer time conviction of greatness of lawyer condescension constitutional shyness timidity yielded together to one overwhelming interest in hearing mr pedgifts answer be loud for first time in life in putting question after experience of mr armadale said lawyer instantly hardening in look manner believe to be infatuated enough to marry miss gwilt dozen time over if miss gwilt chose to ask news doesnt surprise in least bashwood im sorry for can honestly say that though have set advice at defiance im more sorry still continued softening again a mind reverted to interview with neelie under tree of park im more sorry still for person who will be nameless what have to do with what on earth be matter with resumed noticing for first time abject misery in mr bashwoods manner blank despair in mr bashwoods face answer have produced be ill be there something behind curtain that youre afraid to bring out dont understand have come here here in private room in business hour with nothing to tell that young armadale have be fool enough to ruin prospect for life why foresaw week since what be more a good a told so at last conversation have with in great house at last word mr bashwood suddenly rallied lawyer passing reference to great house have led back in moment to purpose that have in view thats sir said eagerly thats what wanted to speak to about thats what ive be preparing in mind mr pedgift sir last time be at great house when came away in gig overtook on drive dare say did remarked pedgift resignedly mare happens to be trifle quicker on leg than be on yours bashwood go on go on will come in time suppose to what be driving at stopped spoke to sir proceeded mr bashwood advancing more more eagerly to end said suspected of feeling curiosity about miss gwilt told remember exact word sir told to gratify curiosity by mean for didnt object to pedgift senior began for first time to look interested in hearing more remember something of sort replied also remember thinking rather remarkable that must happen put in more offensive way to be exactly under mr armadales open window while be talking to might have be accident of course looked rather more like curiosity must only judge by appearance concluded pedgift pointing sarcasm with pinch of snuff appearance bashwood be decidedly against dont deny sir only mentioned circumstance because wished to acknowledge be curious be curious about miss gwilt why asked pedgift senior seeing something under surface in mr bashwoods face manner utterly in dark thus far a to what that something might be there be silence for moment moment passed mr bashwood took refuge usually taken by nervous unready men placed in circumstance when be at loss for answer simply reiterated assertion that have just made feel curiosity sir said with strange mixture of doggedness timidity about miss gwilt there be moment of silence in spite of practiced acuteness knowledge of world lawyer be more puzzled than ever case of mr bashwood presented one human riddle of others be least qualified to solve though year after year witness in thousand thousand of case remorseless disinheriting of nearest dearest relation unnatural breaking up of sacred family tie deplorable severance of old firm friendship due entirely to intense self absorption sexual passion can produce when enters heart of old man association of love with infirmity gray hair arouses nevertheless world over other idea than idea of extravagant improbability extravagant absurdity in general mind if interview now taking place in mr pedgifts consulting room have taken place at dinner table instead when wine have opened mind to humorous influence be possible that might by time have suspected truth in business hour pedgift senior be in habit of investigating men motif seriously from business point of view be on very account simply incapable of conceiving improbability so startling absurdity so enormous a absurdity improbability of mr bashwoods being in men in lawyer position must have tried to force way to enlightenment by obstinately repeating unanswered question pedgift senior wisely postponed question until have moved conversation on step well resumed let say feel curiosity about miss gwilt what next palm of mr bashwoods hand began to moisten under influence of agitation a have moistened in past day when have told story of domestic sorrow to midwinter at great house once more rolled handkerchief into ball dabbed softly to fro from one hand to other may ask if be right sir began in believing that have very unfavorable opinion of miss gwilt be quite convinced think good fellow interrupted pedgift senior why need be in doubt about be under mr armadales open window while be talking to ear presume be not absolutely shut mr bashwood showed sense of interruption little sting of lawyer sarcasm be lost in nobler pain that wrung from wound inflicted by miss gwilt be quite convinced think sir resumed that there be circumstance in lady past life must be highly discreditable to if be discovered at present time window be open at great house bashwood ear presume be not absolutely shut still impenetrable to sting mr bashwood persisted more obstinately than ever unless be greatly mistaken said long experience in such thing have even suggested to sir that miss gwilt might turn out to be known to police pedgift senior patience gave way have be over ten minute in room broke out can can not tell in plain english what want in plain english with passion have transformed passion in miss gwilts own word have made man of burning in haggard cheek mr bashwood met challenge faced lawyer a worried sheep face dog on own ground wish to say sir answered that opinion in matter be opinion too believe there be something wrong in miss gwilts past life keep concealed from everybody want to be man who know pedgift senior saw chance instantly reverted to question that have postponed why asked for second time for second time mr bashwood hesitated must acknowledge that have be mad enough to love mean enough to be spy for must say have deceived from first have deserted now object be served after robbing of happiness robbing of honor robbing of

carrying out considered yacht too small for cruise to mediterranean thought desirable to hire larger vessel friend thought otherwise left arguing question be quite enough for to have made sure in first place that armadale will not return to thorpe ambrose to have decided in second place on going abroad may go how like must prefer small yacht for there seems to be chance that small yacht might do inestimable service of drowning five oclock excitement of feeling have got armadales future movement completely under own control made so restless when returned to lodging be obliged to go out again do something new interest to occupy being what wanted went to pimlico to have out with mother oldershaw walked made up mind on way must begin by quarreling with one of note of hand being paid

to be dreaming of life when be boy roaming country with dancing dog at time be back again with armadale imprisoned night on wrecked ship toward early morning hour grew quieter fell asleep waking after short interval found alone first glance round showed light burning in midwinter dressing room rose softly went to look at be seated in great ugly old fashioned chair ordered to be removed into dressing room out of way when first came here head lay back one of hand hung listlessly over arm of chair other hand be on lap stole little nearer saw that exhaustion have overpowered while be reading writing for there be book pen ink paper on table before what have got up to do secretly at hour of morning looked closer at paper on table be neatly folded a usually keep with one exception exception lying open on rest be mr brocks letter looked round at again after making discovery then noticed for first time written paper lying under hand rested on lap there be moving away without risk of waking part of open manuscript however be not covered by hand looked at to see what have secretly stolen away to read besides mr brocks letter made out enough to tell that be narrative of armadales dream that second discovery sent back at once to bed with something serious to think of traveling through france on way to place midwinter shyness be conquered for once by very pleasant man irish doctor whom met in railway carriage who quite insisted on being friendly sociable with through day journey finding that midwinter be devoting to literary pursuit traveling companion warned not to pas too many hour together at desk face tell more than think doctor said if be ever tempted to overwork brain will feel sooner than most men when find nerve playing strange trick dont neglect warning drop pen after last night discovery in dressing room look a if midwinter nerve be beginning already to justify doctor opinion of if one of trick be playing be trick of tormenting again with old superstitious terror there will be change in life here before long will wait curiously to see whether conviction that two be destined to bring fatal danger to armadale take possession of midwinter mind once more if doe know what will happen will not stir step toward helping friend to find crew for yacht will certainly refuse to sail with armadale to let sail with on trial cruise october d mr brocks letter have apparently not lost influence yet midwinter be working again to day be a anxious a ever for holiday time that be to pas with friend two oclock armadale here a usual eager to know when midwinter will be at service definite answer to be given to question yet seeing that depends on midwinter capacity to continue at desk armadale sat down disappointed yawned put great clumsy hand in pocket took up book brute didnt understand wanted to be left alone began again on unendurable subject of miss milroy of fine thing be to have when married own riding horse own pony carriage own beautiful little sitting room upstairs at great house so on might have have once miss milroy be to have now if let six oclock more of everlasting armadale hour since midwinter came in from writing giddy exhausted have be pining day for little music knew be giving norma at theater here struck that hour two at opera might do midwinter good a well a said why not take box at san carlo to night answered in dull uninterested manner that be not rich enough to take box armadale be present flourished well filled purse in usual insufferable way im rich enough old boy come to same thing with word took up hat trampled out on great elephant foot to get box looked after from window a went down street widow with twelve hundred year thought to myself might take box at san carlo whenever pleased without being beholden to anybody empty headed wretch whistled a went way to theater tossed loose silver magnificently to beggar who ran after midnight be alone again at last have nerve enough to write history of terrible evening just a have passed have nerve enough at rate to turn to new leaf try ii diary continued went to san carlo armadales stupidity showed even in such simple matter a taking box have confounded opera with play have chosen box close to stage with idea that one chief object at musical performance be to see face of singer a plainly a possible fortunately for ear bellini lovely melody be for most part tenderly delicately accompanied orchestra might have deafened sat back in box at first well out of sight for be impossible to be sure that of old friend of former day at naples might not be in theater sweet music gradually tempted out of seclusion be so charmed interested that leaned forward without knowing looked at stage be made aware of own imprudence by discovery for moment literally chilled blood one of singer among chorus of druid be looking at while sang with rest head be disguised in long white hair lower part of face be completely covered with flowing white beard proper to character eye with looked at be eye of one man on earth whom have most reason to dread ever seeing again manuel if have not be for smelling bottle believe must have lost sens a be drew back again into shadow even armadale noticed sudden change in a well a midwinter asked if be ill said felt heat hoped must be better presently then leaned back in box tried to rally courage succeeded in recovering self possession enough to be able to look again at stage without showing next time chorus appeared there be man again to infinite relief never looked toward box second time welcome indifference on part helped to satisfy that have seen extraordinary accidental resemblance nothing more still hold to conclusion after having have leisure to think mind must be more completely at ease than be if have seen rest of man face without stage disguise that hid from investigation when curtain fell on first act there be tiresome ballet to be performed according to absurd italian custom before opera went on though have got over first fright have be far too seriously startled to feel comfortable in theater dreaded sort of impossible accident when midwinter armadale put question to told be not well enough to stay through rest of performance at door of theater armadale proposed to say good night midwinter evidently dreading evening with asked to come back to supper if have objection said necessary word three returned together to house ten minute quiet in own room assisted by little dose of eau de cologne water restored to myself joined men at supper table received apology for taking away from opera with complimentary assurance have not cost of slightest sacrifice of own pleasure midwinter declared that be too completely worn out to care for anything two great blessing unattainable at theater of quiet fresh air armadale said with englishman exasperating pride in own stupidity wherever matter of art be concerned that couldnt make head tail of performance principal disappointment be good enough to add be mine for evidently understood foreign music enjoyed lady generally did darling little neelie be in humor to be persecuted with darling neelie after what have gone through at theater might have be irritated state of nerve might have be eau de cologne flying to head bare mention of girl seemed to set in flame tried to turn armadales attention in direction of supper table be much obliged have appetite for more offered wine next wine of country be that poverty allows to place on table be much obliged again foreign wine be very little more to taste than foreign music must take because asked must drink health in old fashioned way with best wish for happy time when must meet again at thorpe ambrose when there must be mistress to welcome at great house be mad to persist in way face answered for be under impression that be making particularly agreeable to looked at midwinter might have seen reason for interfering to change conversation if have looked at in return sat silent in chair irritable overworked with eye on ground thinking got up went to window still impenetrable to sense of own clumsiness armadale followed if have be strong enough to toss out of window into sea must certainly have done at moment not being strong enough looked steadily at view over bay gave hint broadest rudest must think of to go lovely night for walk said if be tempted to walk back to hotel doubt if heard at rate produced sort of effect on stood staring sentimentally at moonlight there be really other word to express blew sigh felt presentiment of what be coming unless stopped mouth by speaking first with fondness for england said must own that have such moonlight a at home looked at vacantly blew sigh wonder whether be fine to night in england a be here said wonder whether dear little girl at home be looking at moonlight thinking of must endure no longer flew out at at last good heaven mr armadale exclaimed be there only one subject worth mentioning in narrow little world live in im sick to death of miss milroy do pray talk of something else great broad stupid face colored up to root of hideous yellow hair beg pardon stammered with kind of sulky surprise didnt suppose stopped confusedly looked from to midwinter understood what look meant didnt suppose must be jealous of miss milroy after marrying be what must have said to midwinter if have left alone together in room a be midwinter have heard before must speak again before armadale must add word finished friend uncompleted sentence in tone now heard with look now saw for first time didnt suppose allan said that lady temper must be so easily provoked first bitter word of irony first hard look of contempt have ever have from armadale cause of anger suddenly left something came in place steadied in instant took silently out of room sat down alone in bedroom have few minute of thought with dont choose to put into word even in secret page got up unlocked never mind what went round to midwinter side of bed took matter what took last thing did before left room be to look at watch be half past ten armadales usual time for leaving went back at once joined two

what happened between midwinter to night because must there reason that nobody can answer included be half past eleven armadale have gone have put on dressing gown have just sat down to arrange hair for night when be surprised by knock at door midwinter came in be frightfully pale eye looked at with terrible despair in never answered when expressed surprise at coming in so much sooner than usual wouldnt even tell when asked question if be ill pointing peremptorily to chair from have risen on entering room told to sit down again then after moment added word have something serious to say to thought of what have done of what have tried to do in interval between half past ten half past eleven have left unnoticed in diary deadly sickness of terror never felt at time came upon now sat down

positively finally refuse insist on to set foot on new yacht ended quietly firmly with faltering in voice sign of hesitation relenting in face sense of surprise might otherwise have felt at strange word have addressed to be lost in sense of relief that brought to mind dread of other word have expected to hear from left a suddenly a have come must look at must speak to once more may depend answered on doing exactly what order to do must obey blindly may know reason for extraordinary direction have just given to face darkened sat down on other side of dressing table with heavy hopeless sigh may know reason said if wish waited little considered have right to know reason resumed for be concerned in waited little again again went on can only explain strange request have just made to in one way said must ask to recall what happened in next room before allan left to night looked at with strange mixture of expression in face at one moment thought felt pity for at seemed more like horror of began to feel frightened again waited for next word in silence know have be working too hard lately went on that nerve be sadly shaken be possible in state be in now may have unconsciously misinterpreted distorted circumstance really took place will do favor if will test recollection of what have happened by own if fancy have exaggerated anything if memory be playing false anywhere entreat to stop tell of commanded sufficiently to ask what circumstance be to referred in what way be personally concerned in be personally concerned in in way answered circumstance to refer began with speaking to allan about miss milroy in what thought very inconsiderate very impatient manner be afraid spoke just a petulantly on side beg pardon for what said to in irritation of moment left

have already passed between about neapolitan wine said thought must learn to like in time asked leave to take glass of wine have on table be right so far word almost died on lip forced out answered

be pouring out made thirsty when said turned round from window approached said lemonade took long time to make touched a be walking away again handed tumbler filled to brim at same time allan turned round from window in turn handed tumbler to be there mistake so far quick throbbing of heart almost choked must just shake head must do more saw allan raise tumbler to lip did see saw face turn white in instant did saw glass fall from hand on floor saw stagger caught before fell be thing true for god sake search memory tell be thing true throbbing at heart seemed for one breathless instant to stop next moment something fiery something maddening flew through started to foot with temper in flame reckless of consequence desperate enough to say anything question be insult look be insult burst out

be that talked to excitedly in own language there be change in when came back face have turned to livid yellow eye looked at with hideous distrust one last question said suddenly came closer to suddenly spoke with marked emphasis on next word what be interest in started back from question reminded that have interest in matter be entirely unconnected with interest of keeping manuel midwinter apart thus far have only remembered that midwinter fatalism have smoothed way for by abandoning armadale beforehand to stranger who might come forward to help thus far sole object have kept in view be to protect by sacrifice of armadale from exposure threatened tell lie to diary dont affect to have felt moment consideration for interest of armadales purse safety of armadales life hated too savagely to care what pitfall tongue might be mean of opening under foot certainly did not see until last question be put to that in serving own design manuel might if dared go length for money be serving

associate with private object might be by opening mean of communication between in future there must be hesitation about how to answer under such circumstance a if accident at hinted did really happen to armadale stood in need of manuels intervention to give intelligence of easy search through obituary column of english paper must tell news with great additional advantage that paper might be relied on in such matter a to tell truth formally thanked manuel declined to accept proposal having interest in englishman said have wish whatever to know what becomes of looked at for moment with steady attention with interest in have not shown yet what game be playing may be rejoined speaking slowly significantly dont pretend to know venture on prophecy nevertheless will win if ever meet again

anything like with midwinter if infatuated fool have actually tried to stifle last faint struggle of remorse pity left stirring in heart must have said nothing more fatally to purpose than gave look

noisiest high spirit to announce that yacht be ready for sea to ask when midwinter must be able to go on board told to make inquiry in midwinter room left with last request must consider refusal to sail with answered by last apology for persisting in resolution then took chair alone at window to wait event of interview in next room whole future depended now on what passed between midwinter friend everything have gone smoothly up to time one danger to dread be danger of midwinter resolution rather of midwinter fatalism giving way at last moment if allowed to be persuaded into accompanying armadale on cruise manuels exasperation against must hesitate at nothing must remember that have answered to for armadales sailing from naples alone must be capable of exposing whole past life to midwinter before vessel left port a thought of a slow minute followed other nothing reached ear hum of voice in next room suspense became almost unendurable be vain to try fix attention on what be going on in street sat looking mechanically out of window seeing nothing suddenly cant say in how long how short time hum of voice ceased door opened armadale showed on threshold alone wish good by said roughly hope when be married wife may never cause midwinter disappointment that midwinter wife have caused gave angry look made angry bow turning sharply left room saw people in street again saw calm sea mast of shipping in harbor where yacht lay must think must breathe freely once more word saved from manuel word might be armadales sentence of death have be spoken yacht be to sail without midwinter a well a without first feeling of exultation be almost maddening be feeling of moment only heart sank in again when thought of midwinter alone in next room went out into passage to listen heard nothing tapped gently at door got answer opened door looked in be sitting at table with face hidden in hand looked at in silence saw glistening of tear a trickled through finger leave said without moving hand must get over by went back into sitting room who can understand woman dont even understand sending away from in manner cut to heart dont believe most harmless most gentle woman living must have felt more acutely than felt after have be doing after what be thinking of moment before went into room who can account for nobody least of hour later door opened heard hurrying down stair ran on without waiting to think asked if might go with neither stopped answered went back to window saw pas walking rapidly away with back turned on naples sea can understand now that might not have heard at time thought inexcusably brutally unkind to put on bonnet in frenzy of rage with sent out for carriage told man to take where liked took a took other stranger to museum to see statue picture flounced from room to room with face in flame people staring at came to myself again dont know how returned to carriage made man drive back in violent hurry dont know why tossed off cloak bonnet sat down once more at window sight of sea cooled forgot midwinter thought of armadale yacht there wasnt breath of wind there wasnt cloud in sky wide water of bay be a smooth a surface of glass sun sank short twilight came went have tea sat at table thinking dreaming over when roused went back to window moon be up quiet sea be a quiet a ever be still looking out when saw midwinter in street below coming back be composed enough by time to remember habit to guess that have be trying to relieve oppression on mind by one of long solitary walk when heard go into own room be too prudent to disturb again waited pleasure where be before long heard window opened saw from window step into balcony after look at sea hold up hand to air be too stupid for moment to remember that have once be sailor to know what meant waited wondered what must happen next went in again after interval came out once more held up hand a before to air time waited leaning on balcony rail looking out steadily with attention absorbed by sea for long long time never moved then on sudden saw start next moment sank on knee with clasped hand resting on balcony rail god almighty bless keep allan said fervently good by forever looked out to sea soft steady breeze be blowing rippled surface of water be sparkling in quiet moonlight looked again there passed slowly between track of moon long black vessel with tall shadowy ghostlike sail gliding smooth noiseless through water like snake wind have come fair with night armadales yacht have sailed on trial cruise iii diary broken off london november th be

steward meet employer at terminus said may ask once more how mr armadale be to be persuaded to come here dont think ungallant rejoined doctor in gentlest manner if ask on side how be men persuaded to

observe here pursued doctor opening armadales letter reference to certain young lady look promising where be note that mr armadale speaks of a addressed to miss milroy instead of answering started in sudden burst of excitement to foot instant mentioned miss milroys name have heard from bashwood of illness of cause of rushed back into memory saw mean of decoying armadale into sanitarium a plainly a saw doctor on other side of table wondering at extraordinary change in what luxury be to make miss milroy serve interest at last never mind note said burned for fear of accident can tell more than

politely opened door for reverted without slightest necessity for doing so without word from to lead to to outburst of virtuous alarm have escaped at earlier part of interview do hope said that will kindly forget forgive extraordinary want of tact perception when in short when caught fly positively blush at own stupidity in putting literal interpretation on lady little joke violence in sanitarium

back at lodging be informed by servant that elderly gentleman be still waiting for have not got heart patience hardly know to waste many word on what passed between bashwood be so easy so degradingly easy to pull string of poor old puppet in way pleased met none of difficulty must have be obliged to meet in case of younger man of man le infatuated with admiration for left allusion to miss milroy in armadales letter have naturally puzzled to be explained at future time never even troubled to invent plausible reason for wishing to meet armadale at terminus to entrap by stratagem into doctor sanitarium found necessary to do be to refer to what have written to mr bashwood on arrival in london to what have afterward said to when came to answer letter personally at hotel know already said that marriage have not be happy one draw own conclusion from dont press to tell whether news of mr armadales rescue from sea be be not welcome news that ought to be to wife be enough to put withered old face in glow to set withered old hope growing again have only to add if will do what ask to do matter how incomprehensible how mysterious request may seem to be if will accept assurance that will run risk that will receive proper explanation at proper time will have such claim on gratitude regard a man living have ever have yet have only to say word to point by look stolen pressure of hand have at foot blindly eager to obey if must have seen what thought of that doesnt matter saw nothing hour have passed since sent away pledged to secrecy possessed of instruction provided with time table to hotel near terminus at be to stay till armadale appears on railway platform excitement of earlier part of evening have worn off dull numbed sensation have got again be energy wearing out wonder just at time when most want be foreshadowing of disaster creeping over dont yet understand might be in humor to sit here for time longer thinking thought like letting find way into word at own will pleasure if diary must only let idle pen have be busy enough to make way to end of volume have reached last morsel of space left on last page whether like not must close book time for good when close to night good by old friend companion of many miserable day having nothing else to be fond of half suspect myself of having be unreasonably fond of what fool be end of fourth book book last at terminus on night of d of december mr bashwood took up post of observation at terminus of south eastern railway for first time be earlier date by six day than date allan have fixed for return doctor taking counsel of medical experience have considered just probable that mr armadale might be perverse enough at enviable age to recover sooner than medical adviser might have anticipated for caution sake therefore mr bashwood be instructed to begin watching arrival of tidal train on day after have received employer letter from d to th of december steward waited punctually on platform saw train come in satisfied evening after evening that traveler be stranger to from d to th of december miss gwilt to return to name under be best known in page received daily report sometimes delivered personally sometimes sent by letter doctor to whom report be communicated received in turn with unabated confidence in precaution have be adopted up to morning of th on date irritation of continued suspense have produced change for worse in miss gwilts variable temper be perceptible to one about strangely enough be reflected by equally marked change in doctor manner when came to pay usual visit by coincidence so extraordinary that enemy might have suspected of not being coincidence at morning on miss gwilt lost patience proved to be also morning on doctor lost confidence for first time news of course said sitting down with heavy sigh well well miss gwilt looked up at irritably from work seem strangely depressed morning said what be afraid of now imputation of being afraid madam answered doctor solemnly be not imputation to cast rashly on man even when belongs to such essentially peaceful profession a mine be not afraid be a more correctly put in first instance strangely depressed nature be a know naturally sanguine only see to day what for habitual hopefulness might have seen ought to have seen week since miss gwilt impatiently threw down work if word cost money said luxury of talking must be rather expensive luxury in case might have seen ought to have seen reiterated doctor without taking slightest notice of interruption week since to put plainly feel by mean so certain a did that mr armadale will consent without struggle to term be interest in minor degree yours to impose on observe dont question entrapping successfully into sanitarium only doubt whether will prove quite a manageable a originally anticipated when have got there say remarked doctor raising eye for first time fixing in steady inquiry on miss gwilt say that be bold obstinate what please that hold out hold out for week together for month together a men in similar situation to have held out before follows risk of keeping forcibly in concealment of suppressing if may so express increase at compound interest becomes enormous house be at moment virtually ready for patient patient may present in week time patient may communicate with mr armadale mr armadale may communicate with patient note may be smuggled out of house may reach commissioner in lunacy even in case of unlicensed establishment like mine gentleman chartered despot in land of liberty have only to apply to lord chancellor for order to enter by heaven to enter sanitarium search house from top to bottom at moment notice dont wish to despond dont wish to alarm dont pretend to say that mean be taking to secure own safety be other than best mean at disposal ask to do be to imagine commissioner in house then to conceive consequence consequence repeated doctor getting sternly on foot taking up hat a if meant to leave room have anything more to say asked miss gwilt have remark rejoined doctor to offer on side stood hat in hand waiting for full minute two looked at other in silence miss gwilt spoke first think understand said suddenly recovering composure beg pardon returned doctor with hand to ear what did say nothing nothing if happened to catch fly morning said miss gwilt with bitterly sarcastic emphasis on word might be capable of shocking by little joke doctor held up hand in polite deprecation looked a if be beginning to recover good humor again hard murmured gently not to have forgiven that unlucky blunder of mine even yet what else have to say be waiting for said miss gwilt turned chair to window scornfully took up work again a spoke doctor came behind put hand on back of chair

deep bass reserved for outburst of virtuous indignation wait spoke of chapter of accident resumed gliding back into softer conversational tone yes yes of course understand time even healing art be at mercy of accident even sanitarium a mine be liable to be surprised by death just so just so said doctor conceding question with utmost impartiality there be chapter of accident admit if choose to trust to mind say emphatically if choose to trust to there be moment of silence silence so profound that nothing be audible in room rapid click of miss gwilts needle through work go on said havent

nothing of mr armadales character know well might be necessary vitally necessary to appeal to superior knowledge of at moment notice how be to do unless be within easy reach of other under same roof in interest beg to invite dear madam to become for limited period inmate of sanitarium miss gwilts rapid needle suddenly stopped understand said again a quietly a before beg pardon said doctor with attack of deafness with hand once more at ear laughed to herself low terrible laugh startled even doctor into taking hand off back of chair inmate of sanitarium repeated consult appearance in

favor have vanished a motive power in annihilated by electric shock of touch look vanity vanity in men at age be only despair in disguise have now lifted to seventh heaven of fatuous happiness once more believed in again a believed in smart new winter overcoat that wore a believed in dainty little cane appropriate to dawning dandyism of lad in teen that flourished in hand hummed worn out old creature who have not sung since childhood hummed a paced platform few fragment must remember of worn out old song train be due a early a eight oclock night at five minute past hour whistle sounded in

little time to inquiry result of convinced that clew be lost so far midwinter have quitted house have pursued way mechanically to busier more central part of metropolis with light now thrown on wife character to call at address have given a address at mother lived must be plainly useless went on through street resolute to discover trying vainly to see mean to end till sense of fatigue forced on once more stopping to rest recruit strength at first hotel came to chance dispute between waiter stranger about lost portmanteau reminded of own luggage left at terminus instantly took mind back to circumstance under mr bashwood have met in moment more idea that have be vainly seeking on way through street flashed on in moment more have determined to try chance of finding steward again on watch

really have in view midwinter first vague suspicion of fidelity have now inevitably developed into conviction that be false must place one interpretation on open disavowal of on taking name under have secretly married conduct forced conclusion on that be engaged in infamous intrigue that have basely secured beforehand in position of others in knew must be most odious most repellent to to claim authority over with conviction be now watching mr bashwood firmly persuaded that wife hiding place be known to vile servant of wife vice darkly suspecting a time wore on that unknown man who have wronged unknown traveler for whose arrival steward be waiting be one same train be late that night carriage be more than usually crowded when arrived at last midwinter became involved in confusion on

hopeless one present chance of discovering truer solution of mystery be to press steward on one available point in have laid open to attack have positively denied on previous evening that knew anything of allans movement that have interest in allans return to england having detected mr bashwood in one lie told to midwinter instantly suspected of telling to allan seized opportunity of sifting statement about miss milroy on spot how have become acquainted with sad news inquired turning suddenly on mr bashwood through major of course said allan before steward must answer who be doctor who have care of miss milroy persisted midwinter still addressing mr bashwood for second time steward made reply for second time allan answered for be man with foreign name said allan keep

next event midwinter decision of next minute be to bring forth on what be mind occupied a stood alone at dead of night in strange house mind be occupied in drawing disconnected impression together little by little to one point convinced from first that hidden danger threatened allan in sanitarium distrust vaguely associated thus far with place with wife whom firmly believed to be now under same roof with with doctor who be a plainly in confidence a mr bashwood now narrowed range centered obstinately in allans room resigning further effort to connect suspicion of conspiracy against friend with outrage have day before be offered to effort must have led if must have maintained to discovery of fraud really contemplated by wife mind clouded confused by disturbing influence instinctively took refuge in impression of fact a have shown since have entered house everything that have noticed below stair suggested that there be secret purpose to be answered by getting allan to sleep in sanitarium everything that have noticed above stair associated lurking place in danger lay hid with allans room to reach conclusion to decide on baffling conspiracy might be by taking allans place be with midwinter work of instant confronted by actual peril great nature of man intuitively freed from weakness have beset in happier safer time not even shadow of old superstition rested on mind now fatalist suspicion of disturbed steady resolution be in one last doubt troubled a stood at window thinking be doubt whether must persuade allan to change room with without involving in explanation

precaution have taken for last time be there no other way than way be trying now there be none openly avowed posture of defense while nature of danger quarter from might come be alike unknown must be useless in worse than useless in consequence might produce by putting people of house on guard without fact must justify to other mind distrust of what might happen with night incapable of shaking allans ready faith in fair outside doctor have presented to one safeguard in friend interest that midwinter must set up be safeguard of changing room one policy must follow come what might of be policy of waiting for event can trust to one thing said to a looked for last time up down corridor can trust to keep awake after glance at clock on wall opposite went into number four sound of closing door be heard sound of turning lock followed then dead silence fell over house once more little by little steward horror of stillness darkness overcame dread of moving handkerchief cautiously drew

will dream of till morning come secured staircase door after have passed through listened satisfied that nothing be stirring then went on slowly along corridor to window leaning on window sill looked out at night cloud be over moon at moment nothing be to be seen through darkness scattered gas light in suburb turning from window looked at clock be twenty minute past one for last time resolution have come to in earlier night with knowledge that husband be in house forced uppermost in mind for last time voice within said think if there be other way pondered over till minute hand of clock

window sill forehead rested against glass without feeling cold be not till moon struggled out again that be startled into sudden self remembrance turned quickly looked at clock seven minute have passed since second pouring a snatched up flask fed funnel for third time full consciousness of position came back to fever heat throbbed again in blood flushed fiercely in cheek swift smooth noiseless paced from end to end of corridor with arm folded in shawl eye moment after moment on clock three out of next five minute passed again suspense began to madden space in corridor grew too confined for illimitable restlessness possessed limb went down into hall again circled round round like wild creature in cage at third turn felt something moving softly against dress house cat have come up through open kitchen door large tawny companionable cat purred in high good temper followed for company took animal up in arm rubbed sleek head luxuriously against chin a bent face over armadale hate cat whispered in creature ear come up see armadale killed next moment own frightful fancy horrified dropped cat with shudder drove below again with threatening hand for moment after

loosened cravat opened waistcoat bared throat breast to air with hand on heart with bosom supporting head so that fronted window waited event time passed time short enough to be reckoned by minute on clock yet long enough to take memory back over married life with long enough to mature resolution now rose in mind a one result must come of retrospect a eye rested on strange composure settled slowly on face bore look of woman who be equally resigned to welcome chance of recovery to accept certainty of death not cry tear have escaped yet not cry tear escaped when interval have passed felt first faint fluttering of heart heard first faint catching of breath of lip silently bent over kissed forehead when looked up again hard despair have melted from face there be something softly radiant in eye lit whole countenance a with inner light made womanly lovely once more laid down taking off shawl made pillow of to support head might have be hard love said a felt faint pulsation strengthening

steady course reckoned minute of morning a one by one lapsed away be tenth minute since door of room have opened closed before midwinter stirred on pillow struggling to raise felt letter in hand at same moment key be turned in staircase door doctor looking expectantly toward fatal room saw purple flask on window sill prostrate man trying to raise from floor epilogue news from norfolk from mr pedgift senior thorpe ambrose to mr pedgift junior paris high street december th dear augustus letter reached yesterday seem to be making most of youth a call with vengeance well enjoy holiday made most of youth when be age wonderful to relate havent forgotten yet ask for good budget of news especially for more information about mysterious business at sanitarium curiosity dear boy be quality in profession especially sometimes lead to great result doubt however if will find leading to much on occasion know of mystery of sanitarium know from mr armadale be entirely in dark on more than one point of importance have already told how be entrapped into house how passed night there to can now add that something did certainly happen to mr midwinter deprived of consciousness that doctor who appears to have be mixed up in matter carried thing with high hand insisted on taking own course in own sanitarium there be not least doubt that miserable woman however might have come by death be found dead that coroner inquest inquired into circumstance that evidence showed to have entered house a patient that medical investigation ended in discovering that have died of apoplexy idea be that mr midwinter have motive of own for not coming forward with evidence that might have given have also reason to suspect that mr armadale out of regard for followed lead that verdict at inquest attaching blame to anybody proceeded like many other verdict of same kind from entirely superficial investigation of circumstance key to whole mystery be to be found firmly believe in wretched woman attempt to personate character of mr armadales widow when news of death appeared in paper what first set on by what inconceivable process of deception can have induced mr midwinter to marry a certificate prof under mr armadales name be more than mr armadale know point be not touched at inquest for simple reason that inquest only concerned with circumstance attending death mr armadale at friend request saw miss blanchard induced to silence old darch on subject of claim have be made relating to widow income a claim have never be admitted even stiff necked brother practitioner consented for once to do a be asked doctor statement that patient be widow of gentleman named armadale be accordingly left unchallenged so matter have be hushed up be buried in great cemetery near place where died nobody mr midwinter mr armadale who insisted on going with followed to grave nothing have be inscribed on tombstone initial letter of christian name date of death so after harm have done rest at last so two men whom have injured have forgiven be there more to say on subject before leave on referring to letter find have raised one other point may be worth moment notice ask if there be reason to suppose that doctor come out of matter with hand be really a clean a look dear augustus believe doctor to have be at bottom of more of mischief than will ever find out to have profited by self imposed silence of mr midwinter mr armadale a rogue perpetually profit by misfortune necessity of honest men be ascertained fact that connived at false statement about miss milroy entrapped two gentleman into house that one circumstance after old bailey experience be enough for a to evidence against there be not jot a to retribution overtaking can only say heartily hope retribution may prove in long run to be more cunning customer of two there be not much prospect of at present doctor friend admirer be understand about to present with testimonial expressive of sympathy under sad occurrence have thrown cloud over opening of sanitarium of undiminished confidence in integrity ability a medical man live augustus in age eminently favorable to growth of roguery be careful enough to keep up appearance in enlightened nineteenth century look upon doctor a one of rising men to turn now to pleasanter subject than sanitarium may tell that miss neelie be a good a well again be in humble opinion prettier than ever be staying in london under care of female relative mr armadale satisfies of fact of existence in case must forget regularly day be to be married in spring unless mr milroys death cause ceremony to be postponed medical men be of opinion that poor lady be sinking at last may be question of week question of month can say more be greatly altered quiet gentle anxiously affectionate with husband child in case happy change be seems sign of approaching dissolution from medical point of view there be difficulty in making poor old major understand only see that have gone back to likeness of better self when first married sits for hour by bedside now tell about wonderful clock mr midwinter of whom will next expect to say something be improving rapidly after causing anxiety at first to medical men who declared that be suffering from serious nervous shock produced by circumstance about patient obstinate silence kept quite in dark have rallied a only men of sensitive temperament to quote doctor again can rally mr armadale be together in quiet lodging saw last week when be in london face showed sign of wear tear very sad to see in so young man spoke of
