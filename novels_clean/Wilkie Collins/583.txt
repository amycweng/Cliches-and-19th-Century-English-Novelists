follow white winding path across lonely heath to approach london through most open suburb by striking into finchley road so getting back in cool of new morning by western side of regent park wound way down slowly over heath enjoying divine stillness of scene admiring soft alternation of light shade a followed other over broken ground on side of so long a be proceeding through first prettiest part

chance suggested idea that have be actually alive since hour of birth nature have so much to do in world be engaged in generating vast variety of co existent production that must surely be now then too flurried confused to distinguish between different process that be carrying on at same time starting from point of view will always remain private persuasion that nature be absorbed in making cabbage when mr vesey be born that good lady suffered consequence of vegetable preoccupation in mind of mother of now mr vesey said miss halcombe looking brighter sharper readier than ever by contrast with undemonstrative old lady at side what will have cutlet mr vesey crossed dimpled hand on edge of table smiled placidly said yes dear what be opposite mr hartright boiled chicken be not thought

later letter be not exhausted have three packet still left may confidently rely on spending whole evening over here then be one of anticipation of morning still unfulfilled began to wonder next whether introduction to miss fairlie must disappoint expectation have be forming of since breakfast time how did get on with mr fairlie inquired miss halcombe a left lawn turned into shrubbery be particularly nervous morning never mind considering about answer mr hartright mere fact of being obliged to consider be enough for see in face that be particularly nervous a be amiably unwilling to

most of heart die again in so many renew bright existence in so few there be one troubled perplexed one seemed strangely inconsistent unaccountably out of place in miss fairlie presence mingling with vivid impression produced by charm of fair face head sweet expression winning simplicity of manner be impression in shadowy way suggested to idea of something wanting at one time seemed like something wanting in at like something wanting in hindered from understanding a ought impression be always strongest in most contradictory manner when looked at in other word when be most conscious of harmony charm of face yet at same time most troubled by sense of incompleteness be impossible to discover something wanting something wanting where be what be must not say effect of curious caprice of fancy a thought then be not of nature to set at ease during first interview with miss fairlie few kind word of welcome spoke found hardly self possessed enough to thank in customary phrase of reply observing hesitation doubt attributing naturally enough to momentary shyness on part miss halcombe took business of talking a easily readily a usual into own hand look there mr hartright said pointing to sketch book on table to little delicate wandering hand be still trifling with surely will acknowledge that model pupil be found at last moment hears that be in house seizes inestimable sketch book look

hartright find looking over sketch a used to look over lesson when be little girl when be sadly afraid that must turn out not fit to be heard made confession very prettily simply with quaint childish earnestness drew sketch book away close to own side of table miss halcombe cut knot of little embarrassment forthwith in resolute downright way good bad indifferent said pupil sketch must pas through fiery ordeal of master judgment there be end of suppose take with in carriage laura let hartright see for first time under circumstance of perpetual jolting interruption if can only confuse through drive between nature a be when look up at view nature a be not when look down again at sketch book will drive into last desperate refuge of paying compliment will slip through professional finger with pet feather of vanity unruffled hope mr hartright will pay compliment said miss fairlie a left summer house may venture to inquire why express that hope asked because will believe that say to answered simply in few word unconsciously gave key to whole character to generous trust in others in nature grew innocently out of sense of own truth only knew intuitively then know by experience now merely waited to rouse good mr vesey from place still occupied at deserted luncheon table before entered open carriage for promised drive old lady miss halcombe occupied back seat miss fairlie sat together in front with sketch book open between fairly exhibited at last to professional eye serious criticism on drawing even if have be disposed to volunteer be rendered impossible by miss halcombe lively resolution to see nothing ridiculous side of fine art a practised by sister lady in general can remember conversation passed far more easily than sketch mechanically looked over part of talk especially in miss fairlie took share be still a vividly impressed on memory a if have heard only few hour ago yes let acknowledge on first day let charm of presence lure from recollection of myself

eye can range over be appointed to annihilation smallest human interest that pure heart can feel be appointed to immortality have be out nearly three hour when carriage again passed through gate of limmeridge house on way back have let lady settle for first point of view be to sketch under instruction on afternoon of next day when withdrew to dress for dinner when be alone again in little sitting room spirit seemed to leave on sudden felt ill at ease dissatisfied with hardly knew why perhaps be now conscious for first time of having enjoyed drive too much in character of guest too little in character of drawing master perhaps that strange sense of something wanting in miss fairlie in have perplexed when be first introduced to haunted still anyhow be relief to spirit when dinner hour called out of solitude took back to society of lady of house be struck on entering drawing room by curious contrast rather in material than in colour of dress now wore while mr vesey miss halcombe be richly clad in manner most becoming to age first in silver grey second in delicate primrose yellow colour match so well with dark complexion black hair miss fairlie be unpretendingly almost poorly dressed in plain white muslin be spotlessly pure be beautifully put on still be sort of dress wife daughter of poor man might have worn made so far a external went look le affluent in circumstance than own governess at later period when learnt to know more of miss fairlie character discovered that curious contrast on wrong side be due to natural delicacy of feeling natural intensity of aversion to slightest personal display of own wealth mr vesey miss halcombe must ever induce to let advantage in dress desert two lady who be poor to lean to side of one lady who be rich when dinner be over returned together to drawing room although mr fairlie emulating magnificent condescension of monarch who have picked up titian brush for have instructed butler to consult wish in relation to wine might prefer after dinner be resolute enough to resist temptation of sitting in solitary grandeur among bottle of own choosing sensible enough to ask lady permission to leave table

half in mysterious shadow bending intently over letter in lap while nearer to fair profile of player at piano be just delicately defined against faintly deepening background of inner wall of room outside on terrace clustering flower long grass creeper waved so gently in light evening air that sound of rustling never reached sky be without cloud dawning mystery of moonlight began to tremble already in region of eastern heaven sense of peace seclusion soothed thought feeling into rapt unearthly repose balmy quiet deepened ever with deepening light seemed to hover over with gentler influence still when there stole upon from piano heavenly tenderness of music of mozart be evening of sight sound never to forget sat silent in place have chosen mr vesey still sleeping miss fairlie

innocently over prospect in cumberland thought whose long banishment from heart be now shame reproach to realise for first time came back to with loving mournfulness of old neglected friend mother sister what must feel when returned to from broken engagement with confession of miserable secret who have parted from so hopefully on last happy night in hampstead cottage anne catherick again even memory of farewell evening with mother sister must not return to now unconnected with other memory of moonlight walk back to london what did mean be that woman to meet once more be possible at least did know lived in london yes have told so before after strange question of hers when have asked so distrustfully if knew many men of rank of baronet before after mind be not calm enough then to

from moment when have discovered that expected visitor at limmeridge be miss fairlie future husband have felt bitter curiosity burning envious eagerness to know who be be possible that future opportunity of putting question might not easily offer so risked asking on way back to house now that be kind enough to tell have understood other miss halcombe said now that be sure of gratitude for

when have discovered ominous likeness between have event of morning so unnerved already be at mercy of delusion common chance common coincidence might suggest to imagination impossible to say must only feel that what have passed between miss halcombe on way from summer house have affected very strangely foreboding of undiscoverable danger lying hid from in darkness of future be strong on doubt whether be not linked already to chain of event even approaching departure from cumberland must be powerless to snap asunder doubt whether of saw end a end must really be gathered more more darkly

illiterate letter said miss halcombe at same time be surely too incoherent to be letter of educated person in higher rank of life reference to bridal dress veil other little expression seem to point to a production of woman what do think mr hartright think so too seems to to be not only letter of woman of woman whose mind must be deranged suggested miss halcombe struck in light too did not answer while be speaking eye rested on last sentence of letter mother daughter have tender place in heart for mother be first best only friend word doubt have just escaped a to sanity of writer of letter acting together on mind suggested idea be literally afraid to express openly even to encourage secretly began to doubt whether own faculty be not in danger of losing balance seemed almost like monomania to be tracing back everything strange happened everything unexpected be said always to same hidden source same sinister influence resolved time in defence of own courage own sense to come to decision that plain fact did not warrant to turn back resolutely on everything that tempted in shape of surmise if have chance of tracing person who have written said returning letter to miss halcombe there can be harm in seizing opportunity moment offer think ought to speak to gardener again about elderly woman who gave letter then to continue inquiry in village first let ask question mentioned just now alternative of consulting mr fairlie legal adviser to morrow be there possibility of communicating with earlier why not to day can only explain replied miss halcombe by entering into certain particular connected with sister marriage engagement did not think necessary desirable to mention to morning one of sir percival glyde object in coming here on monday be to fix period of marriage have hitherto be left quite unsettled be anxious that event must take place before end of year doe miss fairlie know of wish asked eagerly have suspicion of after have happened will not take responsibility upon myself of enlightening sir percival have only mentioned view to mr fairlie who have told that be ready anxious a laura guardian to forward have written to london to family solicitor mr gilmore mr

better instinct began to think be hard to confess must suppress nothing from beginning to end of terrible story now stand committed to reveal began to think with hateful eagerness of hope of vague charge against sir percival glyde anonymous letter contained what if wild accusation rested on foundation of truth what if truth must be proved before fatal word of consent be spoken marriage settlement be drawn have tried to think since feeling then animated began ended in pure devotion to miss fairlie interest have never succeeded in deceiving into believing must not now attempt to deceive others feeling began ended in reckless vindictive hopeless hatred of man who be to marry if be to find out anything said speaking under new influence be now directing have better not let minute slip by unemployed can only suggest once more propriety of questioning gardener second time of inquiring in village immediately afterwards think may be of help to in case said miss halcombe rising let go mr hartright at once do best can together have door in hand to open for stopped on sudden to ask important question before set forth one of paragraph of anonymous letter said contains sentence of minute personal description sir percival glyde name be not mentioned know doe description at resemble accurately even in stating age to be forty five forty five be not yet twenty one men of age married wife of age day experience have shown marriage to be often happiest one knew that yet even mention of age when contrasted with hers added to blind hatred distrust of accurately miss halcombe continued even to scar on right hand be scar of wound that received year since when be travelling in italy there can be doubt that peculiarity of personal appearance be thoroughly well known

find occupied in exorcising ghost what doe mean have really happened that wicked boy have be frightening whole school miss halcombe by declaring that saw ghost yesterday evening answered master still persists in absurd story in spite of can say to most extraordinary said miss halcombe must not have thought possible that of boy have imagination enough to see ghost be new accession indeed to hard labour of forming youthful mind at limmeridge heartily wish well through mr dempster in meantime let explain why see here what be want then put same question to schoolmaster have asked already of almost one else in village be met by same discouraging answer mr dempster have not set eye on stranger of whom be in search may a well return to house mr hartright said miss halcombe information want be evidently not to be found have bowed to mr dempster be about to leave schoolroom when forlorn position of jacob postlethwaite piteously sniffing on stool of penitence attracted attention a passed made stop good humouredly to speak word to little prisoner before opened door foolish boy said why beg mr dempster pardon hold tongue about ghost eh saw t ghaist persisted jacob postlethwaite with stare of terror burst of tear stuff nonsense saw nothing of kind ghost indeed what ghost beg pardon miss halcombe interposed schoolmaster little uneasily think have better not question boy obstinate folly of story be beyond belief might lead into ignorantly ignorantly what inquired miss halcombe sharply ignorantly shocking feeling said mr dempster looking very much discomposed upon word mr dempster pay feeling great compliment in thinking weak enough to be shocked by such urchin a turned with air of satirical defiance to little jacob began to question directly come said mean to know about naughty boy when did see ghost yestere'en at gloaming replied jacob oh saw yesterday evening in twilight what be like arl in white a ghaist must be answered ghost seer with confidence beyond year where be away yander in t ' kirkyard where ghaist ought to be a 'ghaist must be where 'ghaist ' ought to be why little fool talk a if manner custom of ghost have be familiar to from infancy have got story at finger end at rate suppose will hear next can actually tell whose ghost be eh just can replied jacob nodding head with air of gloomy triumph mr dempster have already tried several time to speak while miss halcombe be examining pupil now interposed resolutely enough to make heard excuse miss halcombe said if venture to say that be only encouraging boy by asking question will merely ask one more mr dempster then will be quite satisfied well continued turning to boy whose ghost be t ' ghaist of mistress fairlie answered jacob in whisper effect extraordinary reply produced on miss halcombe fully justified anxiety schoolmaster have shown to prevent from hearing face crimsoned with indignation turned upon little jacob with angry suddenness terrified into fresh burst of tear opened lip to speak to then controlled addressed master instead of boy be useless said to hold such child a responsible for what say have little doubt that idea have be put into head by others if there be people in village mr dempster who have forgotten respect gratitude due from soul in to mother memory will find out if have influence with mr fairlie will suffer for hope indeed be sure miss

marble cross one else in limmeridge know to be monument over mr fairlie grave two circumstance be surely sufficient to have suggested to boy answer have so naturally shocked although miss halcombe did not seem to be convinced evidently felt that schoolmaster statement of case be too sensible to be openly combated merely replied by thanking for attention by promising to see again when doubt be satisfied said bowed led way out of schoolroom throughout whole of strange scene have stood apart listening attentively drawing own conclusion a soon a be alone again miss halcombe asked if have

why doe encourage because strengthens suspicion felt when gave letter to read suppose have reason mr hartright for concealing suspicion from till moment be afraid to encourage in thought be utterly preposterous distrusted a result of perversity in own imagination can do so no longer not only boy own answer to question even chance expression dropped from schoolmaster lip in explaining story have forced idea back into mind event may yet prove idea to be delusion miss halcombe belief be strong in at moment that fancied ghost in churchyard writer of anonymous letter be one same person stopped

sir percival statement on mind mine be only fancy said absently there be need to discus gilmore experience ought to be be best guide can desire did not altogether like thrusting whole responsibility in marked manner on shoulder if mr fairlie have done must not have be surprised resolute clear minded miss halcombe be very last person in world whom must have expected to find shrinking from expression of opinion of own if doubt still trouble said why not mention to at once tell plainly have reason to distrust sir percival glyde none do see anything improbable contradictory in explanation how can say do after proof have offered of truth of can there be better testimony in favour mr gilmore than testimony of woman mother none better if answer to note of inquiry prof to be satisfactory for one can not see what more friend of sir percival can possibly expect from then will post note said rising to leave room dismiss further reference to subject until answer arrives attach weight to hesitation can give better reason for than have be over anxious about laura lately anxiety mr gilmore unsettles strongest of left abruptly naturally firm voice faltering a spoke last word sensitive vehement passionate nature woman of ten thousand in trivial superficial time have known from earliest year have seen her tested a grew up in more than one trying family crisis long experience made attach importance to hesitation under circumstance here detailed must certainly not have felt in case of woman must see cause for uneasiness doubt have made little uneasy little doubtful nevertheless in youth must have chafed fretted under irritation of own unreasonable state of mind in age knew better went out philosophically to walk off ii met again at dinner time sir percival be in such boisterous high spirit hardly recognised a same man whose quiet tact refinement good sense have impressed so strongly at interview of morning only trace of former self must detect reappeared now then in manner towards miss fairlie look word from suspended loudest laugh checked gayest flow of talk rendered attention to to one else at table in instant although never openly tried to draw into conversation never lost slightest chance gave of letting drift into by accident of saying word to under favourable circumstance man with le tact delicacy must have pointedly addressed to moment occurred to rather to surprise miss fairlie appeared to be sensible of attention without being moved by be little confused from time to time when looked at spoke to never warmed towards rank fortune good breeding good look respect of gentleman devotion of lover be humbly placed at foot so far a appearance went be offered in vain on next day tuesday sir percival went in morning taking one of servant with a guide to todd corner inquiry a afterwards heard led to result on return have interview with mr fairlie in afternoon miss halcombe rode out together nothing else happened worthy of record evening passed a usual there be change in sir percival change in miss fairlie wednesday post brought with event reply from mr catherick took copy of document have preserved may a well present

percival glyde be such a to merit expression of gratitude towards gentleman be pleased to accept answer in affirmative to question believe to remain obedient servant jane anne catherick short sharp to point in form rather business like letter for woman to write in substance a plain confirmation a must be desired of sir percival glyde statement be opinion with certain minor reservation miss halcombe opinion also sir percival when letter be shown to did not appear to be struck by sharp short tone of told that mr catherick be woman of few word clear headed straightforward unimaginative person who wrote briefly plainly just a spoke next duty to be accomplished now that answer have be received be to acquaint miss fairlie with sir percival explanation miss halcombe have undertaken to do have left room to go to sister when suddenly returned again sat down by easy chair in be reading newspaper sir percival have gone out minute before to look at stable one be in room suppose have really truly done can said turning twisting mr catherick letter in hand if be friend of sir percival who know trust have done more than be necessary answered little annoyed by return of hesitation if be enemy who suspect that alternative be not even to be thought of interposed be sir percival friend if generosity forbearance can add to regard for ought to be sir percival admirer a well know that saw mr fairlie yesterday that afterwards went out with yes saw riding away together began ride by talking about anne catherick about singular manner in mr hartright met with soon dropped that subject sir percival spoke next in most unselfish term of engagement with laura said have observed that be out of spirit be willing if not informed to contrary to attribute to cause alteration in manner towards during present visit if however there be more serious reason for change must entreat that constraint might be placed on inclination by mr fairlie by asked in case be that must recall to mind for last time what circumstance be under engagement between be made what conduct have be from beginning of courtship to present time if after due reflection on two subject seriously desired that must withdraw pretension to honour of becoming husband if must tell so plainly with own lip must sacrifice by leaving perfectly free to withdraw from engagement man must say more than miss halcombe a to experience few men in situation must have said a much paused after have spoken word looked at with singular expression of perplexity distress accuse nobody suspect nothing broke out abruptly can not will not accept responsibility of persuading laura to marriage be exactly course sir percival glyde have requested to take replied in astonishment have begged not to force inclination indirectly obliges to force if give message how can possibly be consult own knowledge of laura mr gilmore if tell to reflect on circumstance of engagement at once appeal to two of strongest feeling in nature to love for father memory to strict regard for truth know that never broke promise in life know that entered on engagement at beginning of father fatal illness that spoke hopefully happily of marriage to sir percival glyde on deathbed own be little shocked at view of case surely said mean to infer that when sir percival spoke to yesterday speculated on result a have just mentioned frank fearless face answered for before spoke do think must remain instant in company of man whom suspected of such baseness a asked angrily liked to feel hearty indignation flash out on in way see so much malice so little indignation in profession in case said excuse if tell in legal phrase that be travelling out of record whatever consequence may be sir percival have right to expect that sister must carefully consider engagement from reasonable point of view before claim release from if unlucky letter have prejudiced against go at once tell that have cleared in eye in mine what objection can urge against after what excuse can possibly have for changing mind about man whom have virtually accepted for husband more than two year ago in eye of law reason mr gilmore excuse daresay if still hesitates if still hesitate must attribute strange conduct if like to caprice in case must bear imputation a well a can with word suddenly rose left when sensible woman have serious question put to evades by flippant answer be sure sign in ninety nine case out of hundred that have something to conceal returned to perusal of newspaper strongly suspecting that miss halcombe miss fairlie have secret between be keeping from sir percival keeping from thought hard on of especially on sir percival doubt to speak more correctly conviction be confirmed by miss halcombe language manner when saw again later in day be suspiciously brief reserved in telling result of interview with sister miss fairlie appeared have listened quietly while affair of letter be placed before in right point of view when miss halcombe next proceeded to say that object of sir percival visit at limmeridge be to prevail on to let day be fixed for marriage checked further reference to subject by begging for time if sir percival must consent to spare for present must undertake to give final answer before end of year pleaded for delay with such anxiety agitation that miss halcombe have promised to use influence if necessary to obtain there at miss fairlie earnest entreaty further discussion of marriage question have ended purely temporary arrangement thus proposed might have be convenient enough to young lady proved somewhat embarrassing to writer of line that morning post have brought letter from partner obliged to return to town next day by afternoon train be extremely probable must find second opportunity of presenting at limmeridge house during remainder of year in case supposing miss fairlie ultimately decided on holding to engagement necessary personal communication with before drew settlement must become something like downright impossibility must be obliged to commit to writing question ought always to be discussed on side by word of mouth said nothing about difficulty until sir percival have be consulted on subject of desired delay be too gallant gentleman not to grant request immediately when miss halcombe informed of told that must absolutely speak to sister before left limmeridge be therefore arranged must see miss fairlie in own sitting room next morning did not come down to dinner join in evening indisposition be excuse thought sir percival looked a well

percival glyde took hand off little album a suddenly a if have turned hot burnt finger twined together nervously in lap eye looked down again at floor expression of constraint settled on face looked almost like expression of pain be absolutely necessary to speak of marriage engagement asked in low tone be necessary to refer to answered not to dwell on let merely say that may marry that may not

might leave there must be harm if must die first paused again colour have spread over cheek suddenly a suddenly left hand on album resigned hold trembled little moved book away from looked at for instant then turned head aside in chair handkerchief fell to floor a changed position hurriedly hid face from in hand sad to remember a did liveliest happiest child that ever laughed day through to see now in flower of age beauty so broken so brought down a in distress that caused forgot year have passed change have made in position towards one moved chair close to picked up handkerchief from carpet drew hand from face gently cry love said dried tear be gathering in eye with own hand a if have be little laura fairlie of ten long year ago be best way must have taken to compose laid head on

ought mr gilmore can indeed dear replied will consider subject a done with for present have said enough to sanction taking best possible care of interest can settle detail at opportunity let have done with business now talk of something else led at once into speaking on other topic in ten minute time be in better spirit rose to take leave come here again said earnestly will try to be worthier of kind feeling for for interest if will only come again still clinging to past that past represented to in way a miss halcombe did in hers troubled sorely to see looking back at beginning of career just a look back at end of mine if do come again hope will find better said better happier god bless dear only answered by putting up cheek to to be kissed even lawyer have heart mine ached little a took leave of whole interview between have hardly lasted more than hour have not breathed word in presence to explain mystery of evident distress dismay at prospect of marriage yet have contrived to win over to side of question knew how why have entered room feeling sir percival glyde have fair reason to complain of manner in be treating left secretly hoping that matter might end in taking at word claiming release man of age experience ought to have known better than to vacillate in unreasonable manner can make excuse for myself can only tell truth say so be hour for departure be now drawing near sent to mr fairlie to say must wait on to take leave if liked that must excuse being rather in hurry sent message back written in pencil on slip of paper kind love best wish dear gilmore hurry of kind be inexpressibly injurious to pray take care of good bye just before left saw miss halcombe for moment alone have said wanted to laura asked yes replied be very weak nervous be glad have to take care of miss halcombe sharp eye studied face attentively be altering opinion about laura said be readier to make allowance for than be yesterday sensible man ever engages unprepared in fencing match of word with woman only answered let know what happens will hing till hear from still looked hard in face wish be over well over mr gilmore so do with word left sir percival most politely insisted on seeing to carriage door if be ever in neighbourhood said pray forget be sincerely anxious to improve acquaintance tried trusted old friend of family will be always welcome visitor in house of mine really irresistible man courteous considerate delightfully free from pride gentleman inch of a drove away to station felt a if must cheerfully do anything to promote interest of sir percival glyde anything in world except drawing marriage settlement of wife iii week passed after return to london without receipt of communication from miss halcombe on eighth day letter in handwriting be placed among other letter on table announced that sir percival glyde have be definitely accepted that marriage be to take place a have originally desired before end of year in probability ceremony must be performed during last fortnight in december miss fairlie twenty first birthday be late in march must therefore by arrangement become sir percival wife about three month before be of age ought not to have be surprised ought not to have be sorry be surprised sorry nevertheless little disappointment caused by unsatisfactory shortness of miss halcombe letter mingled with feeling contributed share towards upsetting serenity for day in six line correspondent announced proposed marriage in three more told that sir percival have left cumberland to return to house in hampshire in two concluding sentence informed first that laura be sadly in want of change cheerful society secondly that have resolved to try effect of such change forthwith by taking sister away with on visit to certain old friend in yorkshire there letter ended without word to explain what circumstance be have decided miss fairlie to accept sir percival glyde in one short week from time when have last seen at later period cause of sudden determination be fully explained to be not business to relate imperfectly on hearsay evidence circumstance came within personal experience of miss halcombe when narrative succeeds mine will describe in particular exactly a happened in meantime plain duty for to perform before in turn lay down pen withdraw from story be to relate one remaining event connected with miss fairlie proposed marriage in be concerned namely drawing of settlement be impossible to refer intelligibly to document without first entering into certain particular in relation to bride pecuniary affair will try to make explanation briefly plainly to keep free from professional obscurity technicality matter be of utmost importance warn reader of line miss fairlie inheritance be very serious part of miss fairlie story that mr gilmore experience in particular must be experience also if wish to understand narrative be yet to come miss fairlie expectation then be of twofold kind comprising possible inheritance of real property land when uncle died absolute inheritance of personal property money when came of age let take land first in time of miss fairlie paternal grandfather whom will call mr fairlie elder entailed succession to limmeridge estate stood thus mr fairlie elder died left three son philip frederick arthur a eldest son philip succeeded to estate if died without leaving son property went to second brother frederick if frederick died also without leaving son property went to third brother arthur a event turned out mr philip fairlie died leaving only daughter laura of story estate in consequence went in course of law to second brother frederick single man third brother arthur have died many year before decease of philip leaving son daughter son at age of eighteen be drowned at death left laura daughter of mr philip fairlie presumptive heiress to estate with chance of succeeding to in ordinary course of nature on uncle frederick death if said frederick died without leaving male issue except in event then of mr frederick fairlie marrying leaving heir two very last thing in world that be likely to do niece laura must have property on death possessing must be remembered nothing more than life interest in if died single died childless estate must revert to cousin magdalen daughter of mr arthur fairlie if married with proper settlement in other word with settlement meant to make for income from estate good three thousand year must during lifetime be at own disposal if died before husband must naturally expect to be left in enjoyment of income for lifetime if have son that son must be heir to exclusion of cousin magdalen thus sir percival prospect in marrying miss fairlie so far a wife expectation from real property be concerned promised two advantage on mr frederick fairlie death first use of three thousand year by wife permission while lived in own right on death if survived secondly inheritance of limmeridge for son if have one so much for landed property for disposal of income from on occasion of miss fairlie marriage thus far difficulty difference of opinion on lady settlement be at likely to arise between sir percival lawyer personal estate in other word money to miss fairlie must become entitled on reaching age of twenty one year be next point to consider part of inheritance be in comfortable little fortune be derived under father will amounted to sum of twenty thousand pound besides have life interest in ten thousand pound more latter amount be to go on decease to aunt eleanor father only sister will greatly assist in setting family affair before reader in clearest possible light if stop here for moment to explain why aunt have be kept waiting for legacy until death of niece mr philip fairlie have lived on excellent term with sister eleanor a long a remained single woman when marriage took place somewhat late in life when marriage united to italian gentleman named fosco rather to italian nobleman seeing that rejoiced in title of count mr fairlie disapproved of conduct so strongly that ceased to hold communication with even went length of striking name out of will other member of family thought serious manifestation of resentment at sister marriage more le unreasonable count fosco though not rich man be not penniless adventurer have small sufficient income of own have lived many year in england held excellent position in society recommendation however availed nothing with mr fairlie in many of opinion be englishman of old school hated foreigner simply solely because be foreigner utmost that must be prevailed on to do in after year mainly at miss fairlie intercession be to restore sister name to former place in will to keep waiting for legacy by giving income of money to daughter for life money if aunt died before to cousin magdalen considering relative age of two lady aunt chance in ordinary course of nature of receiving ten thousand pound be thus rendered doubtful in extreme madame fosco resented brother treatment of a unjustly a usual in such case by refusing to see niece declining to believe that miss fairlie intercession have ever be exerted to restore name to mr fairlie will such be history of ten thousand pound here again difficulty must arise with sir percival legal adviser income must be at wife disposal principal must go to aunt cousin on death preliminary explanation being now cleared out of way come at last to real knot of case to twenty thousand pound sum be absolutely miss fairlie own on completing twenty first year whole future disposition of depended in first instance on condition must obtain for in marriage settlement other clause contained in document be of formal kind need not be recited here clause relating to money be too important to be passed over few line will be sufficient to give necessary abstract of stipulation in regard to twenty thousand pound be simply whole amount be to be settled so a to give income to lady for life afterwards to sir percival for life principal to child of marriage in default of issue principal be to be disposed of a lady might by will direct for purpose reserved to right of making will effect of condition may be thus summed up if lady glyde died without leaving child half sister miss halcombe other relative friend whom might be anxious to benefit must on husband death divide among such share of money a desired to have if on other hand died leaving child then interest naturally necessarily superseded other interest whatsoever be clause one who read can fail think to agree with that meted out equal justice to party will see how proposal be met on husband side at time when miss halcombe letter reached be even more busily occupied than usual contrived to make leisure for settlement have drawn have sent for approval to sir percival solicitor in le than week from time when miss halcombe have informed of proposed marriage after lapse of two day document be returned to with note remark of baronet lawyer objection in general proved to be of most trifling technical kind until came to clause relating to twenty thousand pound against there be double line drawn in red ink following note be appended to not admissible principal to go to sir percival glyde in event of surviving lady glyde there being issue be to say not one farthing of twenty thousand pound be to go to miss halcombe to other relative friend of lady glyde whole sum if left child be to slip into pocket of husband answer wrote to audacious proposal be a short sharp a must make dear sir miss fairlie settlement maintain clause to object exactly a stand truly rejoinder came back in quarter of hour dear sir miss fairlie settlement maintain red ink to object exactly a stand yours truly in detestable slang of day be now at deadlock nothing be left for to refer to client on side a matter stood client miss fairlie not having yet completed twenty first year mr frederick fairlie be guardian wrote by day post put case before exactly a stood not only urging argument must think of to induce to maintain clause a have drawn stating to plainly mercenary motive be at bottom of opposition to settlement of twenty thousand pound knowledge of sir percival affair have necessarily gained when provision of deed on side be submitted in due course to examination have too plainly informed that debt on estate be enormous that income though nominally large one be virtually for man in position next to nothing want of ready money be practical necessity of sir percival existence lawyer note on clause in settlement be nothing frankly selfish expression of mr fairlie answer reached by return of post proved to be wandering irrelevant in extreme turned into plain english practically expressed to effect must dear gilmore be so very obliging a not to worry friend client about trifle a remote contingency be likely that young woman of twenty one must die before man of forty five die without child on other hand in such miserable world a be possible to over estimate value of peace quietness if two heavenly blessing be offered in exchange for such earthly trifle a remote chance of twenty thousand pound be not fair bargain surely yes then why not make threw letter away in disgust just a have fluttered to ground there be knock at door sir percival solicitor mr merriman be shown in there be many variety of sharp practitioner in world think hardest of to deal with be men who overreach under disguise of inveterate good humour fat well fed smiling friendly man of business be of party to bargain most hopeless to deal with mr merriman be one of class how be good mr gilmore began in glow with warmth of own amiability glad to see sir in such excellent health be passing door thought must look in in case might have something to say to do now pray do let settle little difference of ours by word of mouth if can have heard from client yet yes have heard from yours dear good sir wish have heard from to purpose wish with heart responsibility be off shoulder be obstinate let rather say resolute wo take off beerriman leave detail to do what think right for interest consider a having personally withdrawn from business until be over be sir percival word fortnight ago can get to do now be to repeat be not hard man mr gilmore a know personally privately do assure must like to sponge out that note of mine at very moment if sir percival wo go into matter if sir percival will blindly leave interest in sole care what course can possibly take except course of asserting hand be bound see dear sir hand be bound maintain note on clause then to letter said yes deuce take have other alternative walked to fireplace warmed humming fag end of tune in rich convivial bass voice what doe side say went on now pray tell doe side say be ashamed to tell attempted to gain time nay did worse legal instinct got better of even tried to bargain twenty thousand pound be rather large sum to be given up by lady friend at two day notice said very true replied mr merriman looking down thoughtfully at boot properly put most properly put compromise recognising interest of lady family a well a interest of husband might not perhaps have frightened client quite so much went on come come contingency resolve into matter of bargaining after what be least will take least will take said mr merriman be nineteen thousand nine hundred ninety nine pound nineteen shilling elevenpence three farthing have have have excuse mr gilmore must have little joke little enough remarked joke be just worth odd farthing be made for mr merriman be delighted laughed over retort till room rang again be not so good humoured on side came back to business closed interview be friday said give till tuesday next for final answer by mean replied mr merriman longer dear sir if like took up hat to go then addressed again by way said client in cumberland have not heard anything more of woman who wrote anonymous letter have nothing more answered have found trace of not yet said legal friend despair sir percival have suspicion that somebody be keeping in hiding be having that somebody watched mean old woman who be with in cumberland said quite party sir answered mr merriman happen to have laid hand on old woman yet somebody be man have got close under eye here in london strongly suspect have something to do with helping in first instance to escape from asylum sir percival wanted to question at once said 'no questioning will only put on guard watch wait ' will see what happens dangerous woman to be at large mr gilmore nobody know what may do next wish good morning sir on tuesday next will hope for pleasure of hearing from smiled amiably went out mind have be rather absent during latter part of conversation with legal friend be so anxious about matter of settlement have little attention to give to other subject moment be left alone again began to think over what next proceeding ought to be in case of other client must have acted on instruction however personally distasteful to have given up point about twenty thousand pound on spot must not act with business like indifference towards miss fairlie have honest feeling of affection admiration for remembered gratefully that father have be kindest patron friend to that ever man have have felt towards while be drawing settlement a might have felt if have not be old bachelor towards daughter of own be determined to spare personal sacrifice in service where interest be concerned writing second time to mr fairlie be not to be thought of

outburst of tenderness broke from with hysterical vehemence threw on sofa in paroxysm of sob tear shook from head to foot tried vainly to soothe reason with be past being soothed past being reasoned with be sad sudden end for two of memorable day when fit have worn out be too exhausted to speak slumbered towards afternoon put away book of drawing so that might not see when woke face be calm heart might be when opened eye again looked at said more to other about distressing interview of morning sir percival name be not mentioned walter hartright be not alluded to again by of for remainder of

word asking to be suicide of own hope conduct of day before have so strengthened unchangeable love admiration of two long year that active contention against feeling on part be henceforth entirely out of power must think weak selfish unfeeling towards very woman whom idolised must bow to opinion a resignedly a must only putting to at same time whether future a single woman pining under unhappily placed attachment must never acknowledge must be said to promise much brighter prospect than future a wife of man who worshipped very ground walked on in last case there be hope from time however slight might be in first case on own showing there be hope at answered more because tongue be woman must answer than because have anything convincing to say be only too plain that course laura have adopted day before have offered advantage if chose to take that have chosen to take felt at time feel just a strongly now while write line in own room one hope left be that motif really spring a say

baxter doings miss baxter dooty be almost wicked enough to wish that baxter have shot housemaid instead of dog seeing that be quite useless to expect densely impenetrable personage to give help in relieving suffering creature at foot told to request housekeeper attendance with compliment went out exactly a have come in grinning from ear to ear a door closed on said to softly be baxter doings baxter dooty be what be housekeeper person of education intelligence thoughtfully brought upstairs with milk warm water instant saw dog on floor started changed colour why lord bless cried housekeeper must be mr catherick dog whose asked in utmost astonishment mr catherick seem to know mr catherick miss halcombe not personally have heard of her doe live here have have news of daughter miss halcombe came here to ask for news when only yesterday said one have reported that stranger answering to description of daughter have be seen in neighbourhood such report have reached here such report be known in village when sent to make inquiry there on mr catherick account certainly brought poor little dog with when came saw trot out after when went away suppose creature strayed into plantation got shot where did find miss halcombe in old shed that look out on lake ah yes be plantation side poor thing dragged suppose to nearest shelter a dog will to die if can moisten lip with milk miss halcombe will wash clotted hair from wound be very much afraid be too late to do good however can try mr catherick name still rang in ear a if housekeeper have only that moment surprised by uttering while be attending to dog word of walter hartright caution to returned to memory if ever anne catherick cross path make better use of opportunity miss halcombe than made of finding of wounded spaniel have led already to discovery of mr catherick visit to blackwater park event might lead in turn to something more determined to make most of chance be now offered to to gain a much information a must did say that mr catherick lived anywhere in neighbourhood asked oh dear said housekeeper life at welmingham quite at other end of county five twenty mile off at least suppose have known mr catherick for year on contrary miss halcombe never saw before came here yesterday have heard of of course because have heard of sir percival kindness in putting daughter under medical care mr catherick be rather strange person in manner extremely respectable looking seemed sorely put out when found that there be foundation none at least that of must discover for report of daughter having be seen in neighbourhood be rather interested about mr catherick went on continuing conversation a long a possible wish have arrived here soon enough to see yesterday did stay for length of time yes said housekeeper stayed for time think must have remained longer if have not be called away to speak to strange gentleman gentleman who came to ask when sir percival be expected back mr catherick got up left at once when heard maid tell what visitor errand be said to at parting that there be need to tell sir percival of coming here thought that rather odd remark to make especially to person in responsible situation thought odd remark too sir percival have certainly led to believe at limmeridge that most perfect confidence existed between mr catherick if be case why must be anxious to have visit at blackwater park kept secret from probably said seeing that housekeeper expected to give opinion on mr catherick parting word probably thought announcement of visit might vex sir percival to purpose by reminding that lost daughter be not found yet did talk much on that subject very little replied housekeeper talked principally of sir percival asked great many question about where have be travelling what sort of lady new wife be seemed to be more soured put out than distressed by failing to find trace of daughter in part give up ' be last word said that can remember give up ma'be for lost from that passed at once to question about lady glyde wanting to know if be handsome amiable lady comely healthy young ah dear thought how must end look miss halcombe poor thing be out of misery at last dog be dead have given faint sobbing cry have suffered instant convulsion of limb just a last word comely healthy young dropped from housekeeper lip change have happened with startling suddenness in one moment creature lay lifeless under hand eight o'clock have just returned from dining downstairs in solitary state sunset be burning redly on wilderness of tree see from window be poring over journal again to calm impatience for return of traveller ought to have arrived by calculation before how still lonely house be in drowsy evening quiet oh how many minute more before hear carriage wheel run downstairs to find in laura arm poor little dog wish first day at blackwater park have not be associated with death though be only death of stray animal welmingham see on looking back through private page of mine that welmingham be name of place where mr catherick life note be still in possession note in answer to letter about unhappy daughter sir percival obliged to write one of day when can find safe opportunity will take note with by way of introduction try what can make of mr catherick at personal interview understand wishing to conceal visit to place from sir percival knowledge feel half so sure a housekeeper seems to do that daughter anne be not in neighbourhood after what must walter hartright have said in emergency poor dear hartright be beginning to feel want of honest advice willing help already surely heard something be bustle of footstep below stair yes hear horse foot hear rolling wheel ii june th confusion of arrival have have time to subside two day have elapsed since return of traveller interval have sufficed to put new machinery of life at blackwater park in fair working order may now return to journal with little chance of being able to continue entry in a collectedly a usual think must begin by putting down odd remark have suggested to since laura came back when two member of family two intimate friend be separated one go abroad one remains at home return of relative friend who have be travelling always seems to place relative friend who have be staying at home at painful disadvantage when two first meet sudden encounter of new thought new habit eagerly gained in one case with old thought old habit passively preserved in other seems at first to part sympathy of most loving relative fondest friend to set sudden strangeness unexpected by uncontrollable by between on side after first happiness of meeting with laura be over after have sat down together hand in hand to recover breath enough calmness enough to talk felt strangeness instantly must see that felt too have partially worn away now that have fallen back into most of old habit will probably disappear before long have certainly have influence over first impression have formed of now that be living together again for reason only have thought fit to mention here have found unaltered have found changed changed in person in one respect changed in character can not absolutely say that be le beautiful than used to be can only say that be le beautiful to others who look at with eye recollection must probably think improved there be more colour more decision roundness of outline in face than there used to be figure seems more firmly set more sure easy in movement than be in maiden day miss something when look at something once belonged to happy innocent life of laura fairlie can not find in lady glyde there be in old time freshness softness ever varying yet ever remaining tenderness of beauty in face charm of be not possible to express in word a poor hartright used often to say

percival back be turned have host of question to put to about mr catherick cause of visit to blackwater park must scarcely have asked in friend presence made answer a short a civilly must for have already determined to check least approach to exchanging of confidence between count fosco laura however unconsciously helped to extract information by making inquiry left alternative to reply to to

crochet scruple will humour hope in merciful consideration for suspicious italian character uneasy italian conscience bowed again stepped back few pace withdrew conscience from society a politely a have introduced count scruple might have be honourable reasonable enough there be something in manner of expressing increased unwillingness to be concerned in business of signature consideration of le importance than consideration for laura must have induced to consent to be witness at one look however at anxious face decided to risk anything rather than desert will readily remain in room said if find reason for starting small scruple on side may rely on a witness sir percival looked at sharply a if be about to say something at same moment madame fosco attracted attention by rising from chair have caught husband eye have evidently received order to leave room need go said sir percival madame fosco looked for order again got again said must prefer leaving to business resolutely walked out count lit cigarette went back to flower in window puffed little jet of smoke at leaf in state of deepest anxiety about killing insect meanwhile sir percival unlocked cupboard beneath one of book case produced from piece of parchment folded longwise many time over placed on table opened last fold only kept hand on rest last fold displayed strip of blank parchment with little wafer stuck on at certain place line of writing be hidden in part still held folded up under hand laura looked at other face be pale showed indecision fear sir percival dipped pen in ink handed to wife sign name there said pointing to place fosco be to sign afterwards miss halcombe opposite two wafer come here fosco witnessing signature be not to be done by mooning out of window smoking into flower count threw away cigarette joined at table with hand carelessly thrust into scarlet belt of blouse eye steadily fixed on sir percival face laura who be on other side of husband with pen in hand looked at too stood between holding folded parchment down firmly on table glancing across at a sat opposite to with sinister mixture of suspicion embarrassment on face that looked more like prisoner at bar than gentleman in own house sign there repeated turning suddenly on laura pointing once more to place on parchment what be be to sign asked quietly have time to explain answered dog cart be at door must go directly besides if have time must understand be purely formal document full of legal technicality sort of thing come come sign name let have done a soon a possible ought surely to know what be signing sir

for will sign will not still have pen in hand made approach to signing name with if signature pledge to anything said surely have claim to know what that pledge be lifted up parchment struck angrily on table speak out said be always famous for telling truth never mind miss halcombe never mind fosco say in plain term distrust count took one of hand out of belt laid on sir percival shoulder sir percival shook off irritably count put on again with unruffled composure control unfortunate temper percival said lady glyde be right right cried sir percival wife right in distrusting husband be unjust cruel to accuse of distrusting said laura ask marian if be not justified in wanting to know what writing requires of before sign wo have appeal made to miss halcombe retorted sir percival miss halcombe have nothing to do with matter have not spoken hitherto must much rather not have spoken now expression of distress in laura face when turned towards insolent injustice of husband conduct left other alternative than to give opinion for sake a soon a be asked for excuse sir percival said a one of witness to signature venture to think have something to do with matter laura objection seems to perfectly fair one speaking for only can not assume responsibility of witnessing signature unless first understands what writing be wish to sign cool declaration upon soul cried sir percival next time invite to man house miss halcombe recommend not to repay hospitality by taking wife side against in matter doe concern started to foot a suddenly a if have struck if have be man must have knocked down on threshold of own door have left house never on earthly consideration to enter again be only woman loved wife so dearly thank god faithful love helped sat down again without saying word

close silent attention interposed for second time percival said remember be in presence of lady be good enough if please to remember too sir percival turned on speechless with passion count firm hand slowly tightened grasp on shoulder count steady voice quietly repeated be good enough if please to remember too looked at other sir percival slowly drew shoulder from under count hand slowly turned face away from count eye doggedly looked down for little while at parchment on table then spoke with sullen submission of tamed animal rather than becoming resignation of convinced man want to offend anybody said wife obstinacy be enough to try patience of saint have told be merely formal document what more can want may say what please be part of woman duty to set husband at defiance once more lady glyde for last time will sign will not laura returned to side of table took up pen again will sign with pleasure said if will only treat a responsible being care little what sacrifice be required of if will affect one else lead to ill result who talked of sacrifice being required of broke in with half suppressed return of former violence only meant resumed must refuse concession must honourably make if have scruple about signing name to engagement of know nothing why must visit on so severely be rather hard think to treat count fosco scruple so much more indulgently than have treated mine unfortunate yet most natural reference to count extraordinary power over husband indirect a be set sir percival smouldering temper on fire again in instant scruple repeated scruple be rather late in day for to be scrupulous must have thought have got over weakness of sort when made virtue of necessity by marrying instant spoke word laura threw down pen looked at with expression in eye throughout experience of have never seen in before turned back on in dead silence strong expression of most open most bitter contempt be so entirely unlike so utterly out of character that silenced there be something hidden beyond doubt under mere surface brutality of word husband have just addressed to there be lurking insult beneath of be wholly ignorant have left mark of profanation so plainly on face that even stranger might have seen count who be stranger saw a distinctly a did when left chair to join laura heard whisper under breath to sir percival idiot laura walked before to door a advanced at same time husband spoke to once more positively refuse then to give signature said in altered tone of man who be conscious that have let own licence of language seriously injure after what have just said to replied firmly refuse signature until have read line in parchment from first word to last come away marian have remained here long enough one moment interposed count before sir percival must speak again one moment lady glyde implore laura must have left room without noticing stopped make enemy of count whispered do make enemy of count yielded to closed door again stood near waiting sir percival sat down at table with elbow on folded parchment head resting on clenched fist count stood between master of dreadful position in be placed a be master of everything else lady glyde said with gentleness seemed to address to forlorn situation instead of to ourselves pray pardon if venture to offer one suggestion pray believe that speak out of profound respect friendly regard for mistress of house turned sharply towards sir percival be absolutely necessary asked that thing here under elbow must be signed to day be necessary to plan wish returned other sulkily consideration a may have noticed have influence with lady glyde answer plain question plainly can business of signature be put off till to morrow yes yes if will have so then what be wasting time for here let signature wait till to morrow let wait till come back sir percival looked up with frown oath be taking tone with that like said tone wo bear from man be advising for good returned count with smile of quiet contempt give time give lady glyde time have forgotten that dog cart be waiting at door tone surprise have dare say doe be tone of man who can keep temper how many dos of good advice have given in time more than can count have ever be wrong defy to quote instance of go take drive matter of signature can wait till to morrow let wait renew when come back sir percival hesitated looked at watch anxiety about secret journey be to take day revived by count word be now evidently disputing possession of mind with anxiety to obtain laura signature considered for little while then got up from chair be easy to argue down said when have time to answer will take advice fosco not because want believe in because ca stop here longer paused looked round darkly at wife if give signature when come back to morrow rest be lost in noise of opening book case cupboard again locking up parchment once more took hat glove off table made for door laura drew back to let pas remember to morrow said to wife went out waited to give time to cross hall drive away count approached while be standing near door have just seen percival at worst miss halcombe said a old friend be sorry for ashamed of a old friend promise that will not break out to morrow in same disgraceful manner in have broken out to day laura have taken arm while be speaking pressed significantly when have done must have be hard trial to woman to stand by see office of apologist for husband misconduct quietly assumed by male friend in own house be trial to thanked count civilly let out yes thanked for felt already with sense of inexpressible helplessness humiliation that be either interest caprice to make sure of continuing to reside at blackwater park knew after sir percival conduct to that without support of count influence must not hope to remain there influence influence of others dreaded most be actually one tie now held to laura in hour of utmost need heard wheel of dog cart crashing on gravel of drive a came into hall sir percival have started on journey where be going to marian laura whispered fresh thing doe seems to terrify about future have suspicion after what have undergone that morning be unwilling to tell suspicion how must know secret said evasively wonder if housekeeper know persisted certainly not replied must be quite a ignorant a be laura shook head doubtfully did not hear from housekeeper that there be report of anne catherick having be seen in neighbourhood think may have gone away to look for must rather compose laura by not thinking about at after have happened have better follow example come into room rest quiet little sat down together close to window let fragrant summer air breathe over face be ashamed to look at marian said after what submitted to downstairs for sake oh own love be almost heartbroken when think of will try to make up to will indeed hush hush replied talk so what be trifling mortification of pride compared to dreadful sacrifice of happiness heard what said to went on quickly vehemently heard word know what meant know why threw down pen turned back on rose in sudden agitation walked about room have kept many thing from knowledge marian for fear of distressing making unhappy at outset of new life know how have used yet ought to know for saw how used to day heard sneer at presuming to be scrupulous heard say have made virtue of necessity in marrying sat down again face flushed deeply hand twisted twined together in lap ca tell about now said will burst out cry if tell now later marian when be more sure of poor head ache darling ache ache ache where be smelling bottle let talk to about wish have given signature for sake will give to to morrow must rather compromise than compromise after taking part against will lay blame on if refuse again what will do oh for friend to help advise friend must really trust sighed bitterly saw in face that be thinking of hartright saw more plainly because last word set thinking of too in six month only from marriage wanted faithful service have offered to in farewell word how little once thought that must ever want at must do what can to help ourselves said let try to talk over calmly laura let do in power to decide for best putting what knew of husband embarrassment what have heard of conversation with lawyer together arrived necessarily at conclusion that parchment in library have be drawn up for purpose of borrowing money that laura signature be absolutely necessary to fit for attainment of sir percival object second question concerning nature of legal contract by money be to be obtained degree of personal responsibility to laura might subject if signed in dark involved consideration lay far beyond knowledge experience that of possessed own conviction led to believe that hidden content of parchment concealed transaction of meanest most fraudulent kind have not formed conclusion in consequence of sir percival refusal to show writing to explain for refusal might well have proceeded from obstinate disposition domineering temper alone sole motive for distrusting honesty sprang from change have observed in language manner at blackwater park change convinced that have be acting part throughout whole period of probation at limmeridge house elaborate delicacy ceremonious politeness harmonised so agreeably with mr gilmore old fashioned notion modesty with laura candour with moderation with mr fairlie be artifice of mean cunning brutal man who have dropped disguise when practised duplicity have gained end have openly shown in library on very day say nothing of grief discovery caused on laura account for be not to be expressed by word of mine only refer to at because decided to oppose signing parchment whatever consequence might be unless be first made acquainted with content under circumstance one chance for when to morrow came be to be provided with objection to giving signature might rest on sufficiently firm commercial legal ground to shake sir percival resolution to make suspect that two woman understood law obligation of business a well a after pondering determined to write to only honest man within reach whom must trust to help discreetly in forlorn situation that man be mr gilmore partner mr kyrle who conducted business now that old friend have be obliged to withdraw from to leave london on account of health explained to laura have mr gilmore own authority for placing implicit confidence in partner integrity discretion accurate knowledge of affair with full approval sat down at once to write letter began by stating position to mr kyrle exactly a be then asked for advice in return expressed in plain downright term must comprehend without danger of misinterpretation mistake letter be a short a must possibly make be hope unencumbered by needle apology needle detail just a be about to put address on envelope obstacle be discovered by laura in effort preoccupation of writing have escaped mind altogether how be to get answer in time asked letter will not be delivered in london before to morrow morning post will not bring reply here till morning after only way of overcoming difficulty be to have answer brought to from lawyer office by special messenger wrote postscript to effect begging that messenger might be despatched with reply by eleven o'clock morning train must bring to station at twenty minute past one so enable to reach blackwater park by two o'clock at latest be to be directed to ask for to answer question addressed to by one else to deliver letter into hand mine in case sir percival must come back to morrow before two o'clock said to laura wisest plan for to adopt be to be out in ground morning with book work not to appear at house till messenger have have time to arrive with letter will wait here for morning to guard against misadventure mistake by following arrangement hope believe will avoid being taken by surprise let go down to drawing room now may excite suspicion if remain shut up together too long suspicion repeated whose suspicion can excite now that sir percival have left house do mean count fosco perhaps do laura be beginning to dislike a much a do marian not to dislike dislike be always more le associated with contempt can see nothing in count to despise be not afraid of be perhaps be little afraid of after interference in favour to day yes be more afraid of interference than be of sir percival violence remember what said to in library do laura make enemy of count went downstairs laura entered drawing room while proceeded across hall with letter in hand to put into post bag hung against wall opposite to house door be open a crossed past saw count fosco wife standing talking together on step outside with face turned towards countess came into hall rather hastily asked if have leisure enough for five minute private conversation feeling little surprised by such appeal from such person put letter into bag replied be quite at disposal took arm with unaccustomed friendliness familiarity instead of leading into empty room drew out with to belt of turf surrounded large fish pond a passed count on step bowed smiled then went at once into house pushing hall door to after not actually closing countess walked gently round fish pond expected to be made depositary of extraordinary confidence be astonished to find madame fosco communication for private ear be nothing more than polite assurance of sympathy for after what have happened in library husband have told of have passed of insolent manner in sir percival have spoken to information have so shocked distressed on account on laura that have made up mind if anything of sort happened again to mark sense of sir percival outrageous conduct by leaving house count have approved of idea now hoped that approved of too thought very strange proceeding on part of remarkably reserved woman a madame fosco especially after interchange of sharp speech have passed between during conversation in boat house on very morning however be plain duty to meet polite friendly advance on part of one of elder with polite friendly reply answered countess accordingly in own tone then thinking have said be necessary on side made attempt to get back to house madame fosco seemed resolved not to part with to unspeakable amazement resolved also to talk most silent of woman now persecuted with fluent conventionality on subject of married life on subject of sir percival laura on subject of own happiness on subject of late mr fairlie conduct to in matter of legacy on dozen other subject besides until have detained walking round round fish pond for more than hour have quite wearied out whether discovered not can not say stopped a abruptly a have begun looked towards house door resumed icy manner in moment dropped arm of own accord before must think of excuse for accomplishing own release from a pushed open door entered hall found suddenly face to face with count again be just putting letter into post bag after have dropped in have closed bag asked where have left madame fosco told went out at hall door immediately to join wife manner when spoke to be so unusually quiet subdued turned looked after wondering if be ill out of spirit why next proceeding be to go straight up to post bag take out own letter look at again with vague distrust on why looking at for second time instantly suggested idea to mind of sealing envelope for greater security be mystery be too deep too willow for to fathom woman a everybody know constantly act on impulse can not explain even to can only suppose that one of impulse be hidden cause of unaccountable conduct on occasion influence animated found cause to congratulate on having obeyed a soon a prepared to seal letter in own room have originally closed envelope in usual way by moistening adhesive point pressing on paper beneath when now tried with finger after lapse of full three quarter of hour envelope opened on instant without sticking tearing perhaps have fastened insufficiently perhaps there might have be defect in adhesive gum perhaps be quite revolting enough to feel that third conjecture stirring in mind must rather not see confronting in plain black white almost dread to morrow so much depends on discretion self control there be two precaution at event be sure not to forget must be careful to keep up friendly appearance with count must be well on guard when messenger from office come here with answer to letter v june th when dinner hour brought together again count fosco be in usual excellent spirit exerted to interest amuse a if be determined to efface from memory recollection of what have passed in library afternoon lively description of adventure in travelling amusing anecdote of remarkable people whom have met with abroad quaint comparison between social custom of various nation illustrated by example drawn from men woman indiscriminately over europe humorous confession of innocent folly of own early life when ruled fashion of second rate italian town wrote preposterous romance on french model for second rate italian newspaper flowed in succession so easily so gaily from lip addressed various curiosity various interest so directly so delicately that laura listened to with a much attention inconsistent a may seem with a much admiration also a madame fosco woman can resist man love man fame man personal appearance man money can not resist man tongue when know how to talk to after dinner while favourable impression have produced on be still vivid in mind count modestly withdrew to read in library laura proposed stroll in ground to enjoy close of long evening be necessary in common politeness to ask madame fosco to join time have apparently received order beforehand begged must kindly excuse count will probably want fresh supply of cigarette remarked by way of apology nobody can make to satisfaction cold blue eye almost warmed a spoke word looked actually proud of being officiating medium through lord master composed with tobacco smoke laura went out together alone be misty heavy evening there be sense of blight in air flower be drooping in garden ground be parched dewless western heaven a saw over quiet tree be of pale yellow hue sun be setting faintly in haze coming rain seemed near must fall probably with fall of night way will go asked towards lake marian if like answered seem unaccountably fond laura of dismal lake not of lake of scenery about sand heath fir tree be only object can discover in large place to remind of limmeridge will walk in other direction if prefer have favourite walk at blackwater park love one be same a to let go to lake may find cooler in open space than find here walked through shadowy plantation in silence heaviness in evening air oppressed when reached boat house be glad to sit down rest inside white fog hung low over lake dense brown line of tree on opposite bank appeared above like dwarf forest floating in sky sandy ground shelving downward from where sat be lost mysteriously in outward layer of fog silence be horrible rustling of leaf bird note in wood cry of water fowl from pool of hidden lake even croaking of frog have ceased to night be very desolate gloomy said laura can be more alone here than anywhere else spoke quietly looked at wilderness of sand mist with steady thoughtful eye must see that mind be too much occupied to feel dreary impression from without have fastened already on mine promised marian to tell truth about married life instead of leaving longer to guess for began that secret be first have ever have from love be determined will be last be silent a know for sake perhaps little for own sake a well be very hard for woman to confess that man to whom have given whole life be man of others who care least for gift if be married marian especially if be happily married must feel for a single woman can feel

to next day husband ' yes yes go on did tell about husband stopped again marian at point said more listened eagerly 'hush ' whispered still waving hand at 'hush ' moved aside out of doorway moved slowly stealthily step by step till lost past edge of boat house surely followed yes anxiety made bold enough to rise follow just a reached entrance appeared again suddenly round side of boat house secret ' whispered to 'wait tell secret caught hold of arm looked at with wild frightened eye now said 'we be not alone be watched come here to morrow at time by mind by ' pushed roughly into boat house again saw more oh laura laura chance lost if have only be near must not have escaped on side did lose sight of on left side where ground sink wood be thickest did run out again did call after how must be too terrified to move speak when did move when came out ran back here to tell have happened did see one hear one in plantation seemed to be still quiet when passed through waited for moment to consider be third person supposed to have be secretly present at interview reality creature of anne catherick excited fancy be impossible to determine one thing certain be that have failed again on very brink of discovery failed utterly irretrievably unless anne catherick kept appointment at boat house for next day be quite sure have told everything passed word be said inquired think so answered power of memory marian be not like yours be so strongly impressed so deeply interested that nothing of importance can possibly have escaped dear laura merest trifle be of importance where anne catherick be concerned think again did chance reference escape a to place in be living at present time none can remember did not mention companion friend woman named mr clements oh yes yes forgot that told mr clements wanted sadly to go with to lake take care of begged prayed that must not venture into neighbourhood alone be that said about mr clements yes be told nothing about place in took refuge after leaving todd corner nothing be quite sure where have lived since what illness have be no marian not word tell pray tell what think about know what to think what to do next must do love must carefully keep appointment at boat house to morrow be impossible to say what interest may not depend on seeing that woman again will not be left to yourself second time will follow at safe distance nobody will see will keep within hearing of voice if anything happens anne catherick have escaped walter hartright have escaped happens will not escape be eye read mine attentively believe said in secret that husband be afraid of suppose marian must only exist after in anne catherick fancy suppose only wanted to see to speak to for sake of old remembrance manner be so strange almost doubted must trust in other thing trust nothing laura own observation of husband conduct judge anne catherick word by action believe there be secret said more got up to leave room thought be troubling might have told if have spoken together longer might have be dangerous for to know influence of terrible dream from have awakened hung darkly heavily over fresh impression progress of narrative produced on mind felt ominous future coming close chilling with unutterable awe forcing on conviction of unseen design in long series of complication have now fastened round thought of hartright a saw in body when said farewell a saw in spirit in dream too began to doubt now whether be not advancing blindfold to appointed inevitable end leaving laura to go upstairs alone went out to look about in walk near house circumstance under anne catherick have parted from have made secretly anxious to know how count fosco be passing afternoon have rendered secretly distrustful of result of solitary journey from sir percival have returned few hour since after looking for in direction discovering nothing returned to house entered different room on ground floor one after be empty came out again into hall went upstairs to return to laura madame fosco opened door a passed in way along passage stopped to see if must inform of whereabouts of husband sir percival yes have seen from window more than hour since count have looked up with customary kindness have mentioned with habitual attention to in smallest trifle that friend be going out together for long walk for long walk have never yet be in other company with object in experience of sir percival cared for exercise riding count except when be polite enough to be escort cared for exercise at when joined laura again found that have called to mind in absence impending question of signature to deed in interest of discussing interview with anne catherick have hitherto overlooked first word when saw expressed surprise at absence of expected summons to attend sir percival in library may make mind easy on subject said for present at least resolution mine will be exposed to further trial sir percival have altered plan business of signature be put off put off laura repeated amazedly who told so authority be count fosco believe be to interference that be indebted for husband sudden change of purpose seems impossible marian if object of signing be a suppose to obtain money for sir percival that urgently wanted how can matter be put off think laura have mean at hand of setting doubt at rest have forgotten conversation heard between sir percival lawyer a be crossing hall remember do there be two alternative proposed one be to obtain signature to parchment other be to gain time by giving bill at three month last resource be evidently resource now adopted may fairly hope to be relieved from share in sir percival embarrassment for time to come oh marian sound too good to be true doe love complimented on ready memory not long since seem to doubt now will get journal will see if be right wrong went away got book at once on looking back to entry referring to lawyer visit found that recollection of two alternative presented be accurately correct be almost a great relief to mind a to laura to find that memory have served on occasion a faithfully a usual in perilous uncertainty of present situation be hard to say what future interest may not depend upon regularity of entry in journal upon reliability of recollection at time when make face manner suggested to that last consideration have occurred to a well a to anyway be only trifling matter be almost ashamed to put down here in writing seems to set forlornness of situation in such miserably vivid light must have little indeed to depend on when discovery that memory can still be trusted to serve be hailed a if be discovery of new friend first bell for dinner separated just a have done ringing sir percival count returned from walk heard master of house storming at servant for being five minute late master guest interposing a usual in interest of propriety patience peace evening have come gone extraordinary event have happened have noticed certain peculiarity in conduct of sir percival count have sent to bed feeling very anxious uneasy about anne catherick about result to morrow may produce know enough by time to be sure that aspect of sir percival be most false therefore mean worst be polite aspect that long walk with friend have ended in improving manner especially towards wife to laura secret surprise to secret alarm called by christian name asked if have heard lately from uncle inquired when mr vesey be to receive invitation to blackwater showed so many other little attention that almost recalled day of hateful courtship at limmeridge house be bad sign to begin with thought more ominous still that must pretend after dinner to fall asleep in drawing room that eye must cunningly follow laura when thought of suspected have never have doubt that sudden journey by took to welmingham to question mr catherick experience of to night have made fear that expedition be not undertaken in vain that have got information unquestionably left to collect if knew where anne catherick be to be found must be up to morrow with sunrise warn while aspect under sir percival presented to night be unhappily too familiar to aspect under count appeared be on other hand entirely new in experience of permitted evening to make acquaintance for first time in character of man of sentiment of sentiment a believe really felt not assumed for occasion for instance be quiet subdued eye voice expressed restrained sensibility wore a if there be hidden connection between showiest finery deepest feeling most magnificent waistcoat have yet appeared in be made of pale sea green silk delicately trimmed with fine silver braid voice sank into tenderest inflection smile expressed thoughtful fatherly admiration whenever spoke to laura to pressed wife hand under table when thanked for trifling little attention at dinner took wine with health happiness angel said with fond glistening eye ate little nothing sighed said good percival when friend laughed at after dinner took laura by hand asked if must be so sweet a to play to complied through sheer astonishment sat by piano with watch chain resting in fold like golden serpent on sea green protuberance of waistcoat immense head lay languidly on one side gently beat time with two of yellow white finger highly approved of music tenderly admired laura manner of playing not a poor hartright used to praise with innocent enjoyment of sweet sound with clear cultivated practical knowledge of merit of composition in first place of merit of player touch in second a evening closed in begged that lovely dying light might not be profaned just yet by appearance of lamp came with horribly silent tread to distant window at be standing to be out of way to avoid very sight of

pen in hand thinking over event of last twelve hour when at last addressed to task found difficulty in proceeding with have never experienced before in spite of effort to fix thought on matter in hand wandered away with strangest persistency in one direction of sir percival count interest tried to concentrate on journal centred instead in private interview between have be put off through day be now to take place in silence solitude of night in perverse state of mind recollection of what have passed since morning must not come back to there be resource to close journal to get away from for little while opened door led from bedroom into sitting room having passed through pulled to again to prevent accident in case of draught with candle left on dressing table sitting room window be wide open leaned out listlessly to look at night be dark quiet moon star be visible there be smell like rain in still heavy air put hand out of window rain be only threatening have not come yet remained leaning on window sill for nearly quarter of hour looking out absently into black darkness hearing nothing except now then voice of servant distant sound of closing door in lower part of house just a be turning away wearily from window to go back to bedroom make second attempt to complete unfinished entry in journal smelt odour of tobacco smoke stealing towards on heavy night air next moment saw tiny red spark advancing from farther end of house in pitch darkness heard footstep must see nothing spark travelled along in night passed window at be standing stopped opposite bedroom window inside have left light burning on dressing table spark remained stationary for moment then moved back again in direction from have advanced a followed progress saw second red spark larger than first approaching from distance two met together in darkness remembering who smoked cigarette who smoked cigar inferred immediately that count have come out first to look listen under window that sir percival have afterwards joined must have be walking on lawn must certainly have heard sir percival heavy footfall though count soft step might have escaped even on gravel walk waited quietly at window certain that must of see in darkness of room what be matter heard sir percival say in low voice why come in sit down want to see light out of window replied count softly what harm doe light do show be not in bed yet be sharp enough to suspect something bold enough to come downstairs listen if can get chance patience percival patience humbug be always talking of patience will talk of something else presently good friend be on edge of domestic precipice if let give woman one other chance on sacred word of honour will push over what devil do mean will come to explanation percival when light be out of window when have have one little look at room on side of library peep at staircase a well slowly moved away rest of conversation between have be conducted throughout in same low tone ceased to be audible be matter have heard enough to determine on justifying count opinion of sharpness courage before red spark be out of sight in darkness have made up mind that there must be listener when two men sat down to talk that listener in spite of count precaution to contrary must be wanted one motive to sanction act to own conscience to give courage enough for performing that motive have laura honour laura happiness laura life might depend on quick ear faithful memory to night have heard count say that meant to examine room on side of library staircase a well before entered on explanation with sir percival expression of intention be necessarily sufficient to inform that library be room in proposed that conversation must take place one moment of time be long enough to bring to conclusion be also moment showed mean of baffling precaution in other word of hearing what sir percival said to other without risk of descending at into lower region of house in speaking of room on ground floor have mentioned incidentally verandah outside on opened by mean of french window extending from cornice to floor top of verandah be flat rain water being carried off from by pipe into tank helped to supply house on narrow leaden roof ran along past bedroom be rather le must think than three foot below sill of window row of flower pot be ranged with wide interval between pot whole being protected from falling in high wind by ornamental iron railing along edge of roof plan have now occurred to be to get out at sitting room window on to roof to creep along noiselessly till reached that part of be immediately over library window to crouch down between flower pot with ear against outer railing if sir percival count sat smoked to night a have seen sitting smoking many night before with chair close at open window foot stretched on zinc garden seat be placed under verandah word said to other above whisper long conversation a know by experience can be carried on in whisper must inevitably reach ear if on other hand chose to night to sit far back inside room then chance be must hear little nothing in case must run far more serious risk of trying to outwit downstairs strongly a be fortified in resolution by desperate nature of situation hoped most fervently that might escape last emergency courage be only woman courage after be very near to failing when thought of trusting on ground floor at dead of night within reach of sir percival count went softly back to bedroom to try safer experiment of verandah roof first complete change in dress be imperatively necessary for many reason took off silk gown to begin with because slightest noise from on still night might have betrayed next removed white cumbersome part of underclothing replaced by petticoat of dark flannel over put black travelling cloak pulled hood on to head in ordinary evening costume took up room of three men at least in present dress when be held close about man must have passed through narrowest space more easily than little breadth left on roof of verandah between flower pot on one side wall window of house on other made serious consideration if knocked anything down if made least noise who must say what consequence might be only waited to put match near candle before extinguished groped way back into sitting room locked door a have locked bedroom door then quietly got out of window cautiously set foot on leaden roof of verandah two room be at inner extremity of new wing of house in lived have five window to pas before must reach position be necessary to take up immediately over

fosco window overlooked there at very place above library to course be directed there saw gleam of light countess be not yet in bed be too late to draw back be time to wait determined to go on at hazard trust for security to own caution to darkness of night for laura sake thought to myself a took first step forward on roof with one hand holding cloak close round other groping against wall of house be better to brush close by wall than to risk striking foot against flower pot within few inch of on other side passed dark window of spare room trying leaden roof at step with foot before risked resting weight on passed dark window of laura room god bless keep to night passed dark window of sir percival room then waited moment knelt down with hand to support so crept to position under protection of low wall between bottom of lighted window verandah roof when ventured to look up at window found that top of only be open that blind inside be drawn down while be looking saw shadow of madame fosco pas across white field of blind then pas slowly back again thus far must not have heard shadow must surely have stopped at blind even if have wanted courage enough to open window look out placed sideways against railing of verandah first ascertaining by touching position of flower pot on side of there be room enough for to sit between more sweet scented leaf of flower on left hand just brushed cheek a lightly rested head against railing first sound that reached from below be caused by opening closing most probably latter of three door in succession door doubt leading into hall into

michelson ma to do a must be done by on account will not say that mr rubelle struck a being small wiry sly person of fifty thereabouts with dark brown creole complexion watchful light grey eye will mention for reason just alleged thought dress though be of plainest black silk inappropriately costly in texture unnecessarily refined in trimming finish for person in position in life must not like thing to be said of therefore be duty not to say of mr rubelle will merely mention that manner be not perhaps unpleasantly reserved only remarkably quiet retiring that looked about great deal said

invited to meal in own room at count particular suggestion so like lordship forgiving kindness be arranged that mr rubelle must not enter on duty until have be seen approved by doctor next morning sat up that night lady glyde appeared to be very unwilling that new nurse must be employed to attend on miss halcombe such want of liberality towards foreigner on part of lady of education refinement

rubelle be sent to sitting room to be approved by doctor on way through to bedroom left lady glyde with miss halcombe who be slumbering at time joined mr rubelle with object of kindly preventing from feeling strange nervous in consequence of uncertainty of situation did not appear to see in light seemed to be quite satisfied beforehand mr dawson must approve of sat calmly looking out of window with appearance of enjoying country air people might have thought such conduct suggestive of brazen assurance beg to say that more liberally set down to extraordinary strength of mind instead of doctor coming up to be sent for to see doctor thought change of affair rather odd mr rubelle did not appear to be affected by in way left still calmly looking out of window still silently enjoying country air mr dawson be waiting for by in breakfast room about new nurse mr michelson said doctor yes sir find that have be brought here from london by wife of fat old foreigner who be always trying

came be younger man than mr dawson very serious very decided what thought of previous treatment can not say struck a curious that put many more question to myself to mr rubelle than put to doctor that did not appear to listen with much interest to what mr dawson said while be examining mr dawson patient began to suspect from what observed in way that count have be right about illness way through be naturally confirmed in idea when mr dawson after little delay asked one important question london doctor have be sent for to set at rest what be opinion of fever inquired typhus replied physician typhus fever beyond doubt that quiet foreign person mr rubelle crossed thin brown hand in front of looked at with very significant smile count must hardly have appeared more gratified if have be present in room have heard confirmation of own opinion after giving useful direction about management of patient mentioning that must come again in five day time physician withdrew to consult in

account rallied in most extraordinary manner showed firmness determination for must myself never have given credit insisted on coming into sick room two three time day to look at miss halcombe with own eye promising not to go too close to bed if doctor must consent to wish so far mr dawson very unwillingly made concession required of think saw that be hopeless to dispute with came in day self denyingly kept promise felt personally so distressing a reminding of own affliction during husband last illness to see how suffered under circumstance must beg not to dwell on part of subject longer be more agreeable to to mention that fresh dispute took place between mr dawson count lordship made inquiry by deputy remained continually in company with sir percival downstairs on fifth day physician came again gave little hope said tenth day from first appearance of typhus must probably decide result of illness arranged for third visit to take place on date interval passed a before

of nourishment be necessary to give to assist miss halcombe convalescence after exhaustion of fever mr dawson now that patient be safe be le inclined than ever to submit to unprofessional interference count can not imagine why lost self control have so judiciously preserved on former occasion taunted doctor over over again with mistake about fever when changed to typhus unfortunate affair ended in mr dawson appealing to sir percival threatening now that must leave without absolute danger to miss halcombe to withdraw from attendance at blackwater park if count interference be not peremptorily suppressed from moment sir percival reply though not designedly uncivil have only resulted in making matter worse mr dawson have thereupon withdrawn from house in state of extreme indignation at count fosco usage of have sent in bill next morning be now therefore left without attendance of medical man although there be actual necessity for doctor nursing watching being a physician have observed miss halcombe required must still if authority have be consulted have obtained professional assistance from other quarter for form sake matter did not seem to strike sir percival in light said must be time enough to send for doctor if miss halcombe showed sign of relapse in meanwhile have count to consult in minor difficulty need not unnecessarily disturb patient in present weak nervous condition by presence of stranger at bedside there be much that be reasonable doubt in consideration left little anxious nevertheless be quite satisfied in own mind of propriety of concealing doctor absence a did from lady glyde be merciful deception admit for be in state to bear fresh anxiety still be deception a such to person of principle at best doubtful proceeding second perplexing circumstance happened on same day took completely by surprise added greatly to sense of uneasiness be now weighing on mind be sent for to see sir percival in library count who be with when went in immediately rose left alone together sir percival civilly asked to take seat then to great astonishment addressed in term want to speak to mr michelson about matter decided on time ago must have mentioned before for

aspersion of most offensive kind on management have too much self respect to defend under so gross imputation christian consideration for helpless position of miss halcombe lady glyde for serious inconvenience sudden absence might inflict on alone prevented from resigning situation on spot rose immediately must have lowered in own estimation to have permitted interview to continue moment longer after last remark sir percival have nothing more to say direction will be attended to pronouncing word bowed head with most distant respect went out of room next day servant left in body sir percival dismissed groom stableman sending with horse one to london of whole domestic establishment indoors out there now remained only margaret porcher gardener last living in own cottage being wanted to take care of one horse remained in stable with house left in strange lonely condition with mistress of ill in room with miss halcombe still a helpless a child with doctor attendance withdrawn from in enmity be surely not unnatural that spirit must sink customary composure be very hard to maintain mind be ill at ease wished poor lady well again wished away from blackwater park ii next event occurred be of so singular nature that might have caused feeling of superstitious surprise if mind have not be fortified by principle against pagan weakness of sort uneasy sense of something wrong in family have made wish away from blackwater park be actually followed strange to say by departure from house be true that absence be for temporary period only coincidence be in opinion not le remarkable on account departure took place under following circumstance day two after servant left be again sent for to see sir percival undeserved slur have cast on management of

supposed anne catherick to be for second time confined have felt strong curiosity about woman in former day be now doubly interested first in ascertaining whether report of anne catherick attempted personation of lady glyde be true secondly if proved to be true in discovering for what poor creature real motif be for attempting deceit although count fosco letter to mr fairlie did not mention address of asylum important omission cast difficulty in miss halcombe way when mr hartright have met anne catherick at limmeridge have informed of locality in house be situated miss halcombe have noted down direction in diary with other particular of interview exactly a heard from mr hartright own lip accordingly looked back at entry extracted address furnished with count letter to mr fairlie

governess mr vesey agitation at sight of lost pupil nearest dearest friend be so distressing that miss halcombe considerately refrained from remaining in presence removed to respectable boarding house in neighbourhood recommended by mr vesey married sister next day proceeded to asylum be situated not far from london on northern side of metropolis be immediately admitted to see proprietor at first appeared to be decidedly unwilling to let communicate with patient on showing postscript to count fosco letter on reminding that be miss halcombe there referred to be near relative of deceased lady glyde that be therefore naturally interested for family reason in observing for extent of anne catherick delusion in relation to late sister tone manner of owner of asylum altered withdrew objection probably felt that continued refusal under circumstance must not only be act of discourtesy in must also imply that proceeding in establishment be not of nature to bear investigation by respectable stranger miss halcombe own impression be that owner of asylum have not be received into confidence of sir percival count consenting at to let visit patient seemed to afford one proof of readiness in making admission must scarcely have escaped lip of accomplice certainly appeared to furnish for example in course of introductory conversation took place informed miss halcombe anne catherick have be brought back to with necessary order certificate by count fosco on twenty seventh of july count also producing letter of explanation instruction signed by sir percival glyde on receiving inmate again proprietor of asylum acknowledged that have observed curious personal change in such change doubt be not without precedent in experience of person mentally afflicted insane people be often at one time outwardly a well a inwardly unlike what be at change from better to worse from worse to better in madness having necessary tendency to produce alteration of appearance externally allowed for allowed also for modification in form of anne catherick delusion be reflected doubt in manner expression be still perplexed at time by certain difference between patient before have escaped patient since have be brought back difference be too minute to be described must not say of course that be absolutely altered in height shape complexion in colour of hair eye in general form of face change be something that felt more than something that saw in short case have be puzzle from first one more perplexity be added to now can not be said that conversation led to result of even partially preparing miss halcombe mind for what be to come produced nevertheless very serious effect upon be so completely unnerved by that little time elapsed before must summon composure enough to follow proprietor of asylum to part of house in inmate be confined on inquiry turned out that supposed anne catherick be then taking exercise in ground attached to establishment one of nurse volunteered to conduct miss halcombe to place proprietor of asylum remaining in house for few minute to attend to case required service then engaging to join visitor in ground nurse led miss halcombe to distant part of property be prettily laid out after looking about little turned into turf walk shaded by shrubbery on side about way down walk two woman be slowly approaching nurse pointed to said there be anne catherick ma'be with attendant who wait on attendant will answer question wish to put with word nurse left to return to duty of house miss halcombe advanced on side woman advanced on theirs when be within dozen pace of other one of woman stopped for instant looked eagerly at strange lady shook off nurse grasp on next moment rushed into miss halcombe arm in moment miss halcombe recognised sister recognised dead alive fortunately for success of measure taken subsequently one be present at moment nurse be young woman be so startled that be at first quite incapable of interfering when be able to do so whole service be required by miss halcombe who have for moment sunk altogether in effort to keep own sens under shock of discovery after waiting few minute in fresh air cool shade natural energy courage helped little became sufficiently mistress of herself to feel necessity of recalling presence of mind for unfortunate sister sake obtained permission to speak alone with patient on condition that remained well within nurse view there be time for question there be only time for miss halcombe to impress on unhappy lady necessity of controlling to assure of immediate help rescue if did so prospect of escaping from asylum by obedience to sister direction be sufficient to quiet lady glyde to make understand what be required of miss halcombe next returned to nurse placed gold then have in pocket three sovereign in nurse hand asked when where must speak to alone woman be at first surprised distrustful on miss halcombe declaring that only wanted to put question be too much agitated to ask at moment that have intention of misleading nurse into dereliction of duty woman took money proposed three o'clock on next day a time for interview might then slip out for hour after patient have dined must meet lady in retired place outside high north wall screened ground of house miss halcombe have only time to assent to whisper to sister that must hear from on next day when proprietor of asylum joined noticed visitor agitation miss halcombe accounted for by saying that interview with anne catherick have little startled at first took leave a soon after a possible be to say a soon a must summon courage to force from presence of unfortunate sister very little reflection when capacity to reflect returned convinced that attempt to identify lady glyde to rescue by legal mean must even if successful involve delay might be fatal to sister intellect be shaken already by horror of situation to have be consigned by time miss halcombe have got back to london have determined to effect lady glyde escape privately by mean of nurse went at once to stockbroker sold out of fund little property possessed amounting to rather le than seven hundred pound determined if necessary to pay price of sister liberty with farthing have in world repaired next day having whole sum about in bank note to appointment outside asylum nurse be there miss halcombe approached subject cautiously by many preliminary question discovered among other particular that nurse who have in former time attended on true anne catherick have be held responsible although be not to blame for for patient escape have lost place in consequence same penalty be added must attach to person then speaking to if supposed anne catherick be missing second time moreover nurse in case have especial interest in keeping place be engaged to be married future husband be waiting till must save together between two three hundred pound to start in business nurse wage be good might succeed by strict economy in contributing small share towards sum required in two year time on hint miss halcombe spoke declared that supposed anne catherick be nearly related to that have be placed in asylum under fatal mistake that nurse must be doing good christian action in being mean of restoring to one before there be time to start single objection miss halcombe took four bank note of hundred pound from pocket book offered to woman a compensation for risk be to run for loss of place nurse hesitated through sheer incredulity surprise miss halcombe pressed point on firmly will be doing good action repeated will be helping most injured unhappy woman alive there be marriage portion for reward bring safely to here will put four bank note into hand before claim will give letter saying word can show to sweetheart when asks how got money inquired woman will bring letter with ready written signed answered miss halcombe then will risk said nurse when to morrow be hastily agreed between miss halcombe must return early next morning wait out of sight among tree always however keeping near quiet spot of ground under north nurse must fix time for appearance caution requiring that must wait be guided by circumstance on understanding separated miss halcombe be at place with promised letter promised bank note before ten next morning waited more than hour half at end of time nurse came quickly round corner of wall holding lady glyde by arm moment met miss halcombe put bank note letter into hand sister be united again nurse have dressed lady glyde with excellent forethought in bonnet veil shawl of own miss halcombe only detained to suggest mean of turning pursuit in false direction when escape be discovered at asylum be to go back to house to mention in hearing of other nurse anne catherick have be inquiring latterly about distance from london to hampshire to wait till last moment before discovery be inevitable then to give alarm that anne be missing supposed inquiry about hampshire when communicated to owner of asylum must lead to imagine that patient have returned to blackwater park under influence of delusion made persist in asserting to be lady glyde first pursuit must in probability be turned in direction nurse consented to follow suggestion more readily a offered mean of securing against worse consequence than loss of place by remaining in asylum so maintaining appearance of innocence at least at once returned to house miss halcombe lost time in taking sister back with to london caught afternoon train to carlisle same afternoon arrived at limmeridge without accident difficulty of kind night during latter part of journey be alone in carriage miss halcombe be able to collect such remembrance of past a sister confused weakened memory be able to recall terrible story of conspiracy so obtained be presented in fragment sadly incoherent in widely detached from other imperfect a revelation be must nevertheless be recorded here before explanatory narrative close with event of next day at limmeridge house lady glyde recollection of event followed departure from blackwater park began with arrival at london terminus of south western railway have omitted to make memorandum beforehand of day on took journey hope of fixing important date by evidence of hers of mr michelson must be given up for lost on arrival of train at platform lady glyde found count fosco waiting for be at carriage door a soon a porter must open train be unusually crowded there be great confusion in getting luggage person whom count fosco brought with procured luggage belonged to lady glyde be marked with name drove away alone with count in vehicle did not particularly notice at time first question on leaving terminus referred to miss count informed that miss halcombe have not yet gone to cumberland after consideration having caused to doubt prudence of taking so long journey without day previous rest lady glyde next inquired whether sister be then staying in count house recollection of answer be confused only distinct impression in relation to being that count declared be then taking to see miss halcombe lady glyde experience of london be so limited that must not tell at time through what street be driving never left street never passed garden tree when carriage stopped stopped in small street behind square square in there be shop public building many people from recollection of lady glyde be certain seems quite clear that count fosco did not take to own residence in suburb of st john wood entered house went upstairs to back room either on first second floor luggage be carefully brought in female servant opened door man with dark beard apparently foreigner met in hall with great politeness showed way upstairs in answer to lady glyde inquiry count assured that miss halcombe be in house that must be immediately informed of sister arrival foreigner then went away left by herself in room be poorly furnished a sitting room looked out on back of house place be remarkably quiet footstep went up down stair only heard in room beneath dull rumbling sound of men voice talking before have be long left alone count returned to explain that miss halcombe be then taking rest must not be disturbed for little while be accompanied into room by gentleman englishman whom begged to present a friend of after singular introduction in course of name to best of lady glyde recollection have be mentioned be left alone with stranger be perfectly civil startled confused by odd question about herself by looking at while asked in strange manner after remaining short time went out minute two afterwards second stranger also englishman came in person introduced a friend of count fosco in turn looked at very oddly asked curious question never a well a must remember addressing by name going out again after little while like first man by time be so frightened about so uneasy about sister that have thought of venturing downstairs again claiming protection assistance of only woman have seen in house servant who answered door just a have risen from chair count came back into room moment appeared asked anxiously how long meeting between sister herself be to be still delayed at first returned evasive answer on being pressed acknowledged with great apparent reluctance that miss halcombe be by mean so well a have hitherto represented to be tone manner in making reply so alarmed lady glyde rather so painfully increased uneasiness have felt in company of two stranger that sudden faintness overcame be obliged to ask for glass of water count called from door for water for bottle of smelling salt be brought in by foreign looking man with beard water when lady glyde attempted to drink have so strange taste that increased faintness hastily took bottle of salt from count fosco smelt at head became giddy on instant count caught bottle a dropped out of hand last impression of be conscious be that held to nostril again from point recollection be found to be confused fragmentary difficult to reconcile with reasonable probability own impression be that recovered sens later in evening that then left house that went a have previously arranged to go at blackwater park to mr vesey that drank tea there that passed night under mr vesey roof be totally unable to say how when in what company left house to count fosco have brought persisted in asserting that have be to mr vesey still more extraordinary that have be helped to undress get to bed by mr rubelle must not remember what conversation be at mr vesey whom saw there besides lady why mr rubelle must have be present in house to help recollection of what happened to next morning be still more vague unreliable have dim idea of driving out at what hour must not say with count fosco with mr rubelle again for female attendant when why left mr vesey must not tell neither did know what direction carriage drove in where set down whether count mr rubelle did did not remain with time be out at point in sad story there be total blank have impression of faintest kind to communicate idea whether one day more than one day have passed until came to herself suddenly in strange place surrounded by woman who be unknown to be asylum here first heard called by anne catherick name here a last remarkable circumstance in story of conspiracy own eye informed that have anne catherick clothes on nurse on first night in asylum have shown mark on article of underclothing a be taken off have said not at irritably unkindly look at own name on own clothes worry more about being lady glyde be dead buried be alive hearty do look at clothes now there be in good marking ink there will find on old thing have kept in house anne catherick a plain a print there be when miss halcombe examined linen sister wore on night of arrival at limmeridge house be only recollection of uncertain of contradictory must be extracted from lady glyde by careful questioning on journey to cumberland miss halcombe abstained from pressing with inquiry relating to event in asylum mind being too evidently unfit to bear trial of reverting to be known by voluntary admission of owner of mad house that be received there on twenty seventh of july from date until fifteenth of october day of rescue have be under restraint identity with anne catherick systematically asserted sanity from first to last practically denied faculty le delicately balanced constitution le tenderly organised must have suffered under such ordeal a man must have gone through come out of unchanged arriving at limmeridge late on evening of fifteenth miss halcombe wisely resolved not to attempt assertion of lady glyde identity until next day first thing in morning went to mr fairlie room using possible caution preparation beforehand at last told in so many word what have happened a soon a first astonishment alarm have subsided angrily declared that miss halcombe have allowed to be duped by anne catherick referred to count fosco letter to what have told of personal resemblance between anne deceased niece positively declined to admit to presence even for one minute only madwoman whom be insult outrage to have brought into house at miss halcombe left room waited till first heat of indignation have passed away decided on reflection that mr fairlie must see niece in interest of common humanity before closed door on a stranger thereupon without word of previous warning took lady glyde with to room servant be posted at door to prevent entrance miss halcombe insisted on passing made way into mr fairlie presence leading sister by hand scene followed though only lasted for few minute be too painful to be described miss halcombe shrank from referring to let be enough to say that mr fairlie declared in most positive term that did not recognise woman who have be brought into room that saw nothing in face manner to make doubt for moment that niece lay buried in limmeridge churchyard that must call on law to protect if before day be over be not removed from house taking very worst view of mr fairlie selfishness indolence habitual want of feeling be manifestly impossible to suppose that be capable of such infamy a secretly recognising openly disowning brother child miss halcombe humanely sensibly allowed due force to influence of prejudice alarm in preventing from fairly exercising perception accounted for what have happened in way when next put servant to test found that too be in case uncertain to say least of whether lady presented to be young mistress anne catherick of whose resemblance to have heard sad conclusion be inevitable that change produced in lady glyde face manner by imprisonment in asylum be far more serious than miss halcombe have at first supposed vile deception have asserted death defied exposure even in house where be born among people with whom have lived in le critical situation effort need not have be given up a hopeless even yet for example maid fanny who happened to be then absent from limmeridge be expected back in two day there must be chance of gaining recognition to start with seeing that have be in much more constant communication with mistress have be much more heartily attached to than other servant again lady glyde might have be privately kept in house in village to wait until health be little recovered mind be little steadied again when memory must be once more trusted to serve must naturally refer to person event in past with certainty familiarity impostor must simulate so fact of identity own appearance have failed to establish might subsequently be proved with time to help by surer test of own word circumstance under have regained freedom rendered recourse to such mean a simply impracticable pursuit from asylum diverted to hampshire for time only must infallibly next take direction of cumberland person appointed to seek fugitive might arrive at limmeridge house at few hour notice in mr fairlie present temper of mind might count on immediate exertion of local influence authority to assist commonest consideration for lady glyde safety forced on miss halcombe necessity of resigning struggle to do justice of removing at once from place of others be now most dangerous to neighbourhood of own home immediate return to london be first wisest measure of security suggested in great city trace of might be most speedily most surely effaced there be preparation to make farewell word of kindness to exchange with one on afternoon of memorable day of sixteenth miss halcombe roused sister to last exertion of courage without living soul to wish well at parting two took way into world alone turned back for ever on limmeridge house have passed hill above churchyard when lady glyde insisted on turning back to look last at mother grave miss halcombe tried to shake resolution in one instance tried in vain be immovable dim eye lit with sudden fire flashed through veil hung over wasted finger

danger replied be that sir percival glyde may have be recalled to london by news of laura escape be aware that have watched before left england that probably know by sight although know laid hand on shoulder looked at in anxious silence saw understood serious risk threatened be not likely said that will be seen in london again so soon by sir percival by person in employ be barely possible that accident may happen in case will not be alarmed if fail to return to night will satisfy inquiry of laura with best excuse that can make for if find least reason to suspect that be watched will take

office of messrs gilmore kyrle in chancery lane while card be being taken in to mr kyrle consideration occurred to deeply regretted not having thought of before information derived from marian diary made matter of certainty count fosco have opened first letter from blackwater park to mr kyrle have by mean of wife intercepted second be therefore well aware of address of office must naturally infer that if marian wanted advice assistance after laura escape from asylum must apply once more to experience of mr kyrle in case office in chancery lane be very first place sir percival must cause to be watched if same person be chosen for purpose who have be employed to follow before departure from england fact of return must in probability be ascertained on very day have thought generally of chance of being recognised in street special risk connected with office have never occurred to until present moment be too late now to repair unfortunate error in judgment too late to wish have made

several time before have done persevered however to end a soon a reached boldly asked one important question what be opinion mr kyrle be too cautious to commit to answer without taking time to recover

of delusion that might even have doubted for introduction to by miss halcombe whether be not attempting perpetration of cunningly designed fraud do believe have spoken truth mr kyrle asked when have

resemblance to lady glyde escaped from asylum be known that person received there last july be received a anne catherick brought back be known that gentleman who brought back warned mr fairlie that be part of insanity to be bent on personating dead niece be known that did repeatedly declare in asylum where one believed to be lady glyde be fact what have to set against miss halcombe recognition of woman recognition after event invalidate contradict doe miss halcombe assert supposed sister identity to owner of asylum take legal mean for rescuing secretly bribe nurse to let escape when patient

reasonably appear where be proof be obliged to wait collect before must answer be first time story of laura story of marian have be presented to from stranger point of view first time terrible obstacle lay across path have be made to show in true character there can be doubt said that fact a have stated appear to tell against think fact can be explained away interposed mr kyrle let tell result of experience on point when english jury have to choose between plain fact on surface long explanation under surface always take fact in preference to explanation for example lady glyde call lady represent by name for argument sake declares have slept at certain house be proved that have not slept at house explain circumstance by entering into state of mind deducing from metaphysical conclusion say conclusion be wrong only say that jury will take fact of contradicting in preference to reason for contradiction that can offer be not possible urged by dint of patience exertion to discover additional evidence miss halcombe have few hundred pound looked at with half suppressed pity shook head consider subject mr hartright from own point of view said if be right about sir percival glyde count fosco admit mind imaginable difficulty must be thrown in way of getting fresh evidence obstacle of litigation must be raised point in case must be systematically contested by time

departure from london enabled to reach mr dawson house in forenoon interview so far a object of visit be concerned led to satisfactory result mr dawson book certainly showed when have resumed attendance on miss halcombe at blackwater park be not possible to calculate back from date with exactness without such help from mr michelson a knew be unable to afford must not say from memory who in similar case ever can how many day have elapsed between renewal of doctor attendance on patient previous departure of lady glyde be almost certain of having mentioned circumstance of departure to miss halcombe on day after happened then be more able to fix date of day on disclosure took place than to fix date of day before when lady glyde have left for london neither must calculate with nearer approach to exactness time have passed from departure of mistress to period when undated letter from madame fosco arrived lastly a if to complete series of difficulty doctor having be ill at time have omitted to make usual entry of day of week month when gardener from blackwater park have called on to deliver mr michelson message hopeless of obtaining assistance from mr dawson resolved to try next if must establish date of sir percival arrival at knowlesbury seemed like fatality when reached knowlesbury inn be shut up bill be posted on wall speculation have be bad one a be informed ever since time of railway new hotel at station have gradually absorbed business old inn knew to be inn at sir percival have put up have be closed about two month since proprietor have left town with good chattel where have gone must not positively ascertain from one four people of whom inquired gave four different account of plan project when left knowlesbury there be still hour to spare before last

be at end might return to town dismissed fly mile distant from park getting direction from driver proceeded by to house a turned into lane from high road saw man with carpet bag walking before rapidly on way to lodge be little man dressed in shabby black wearing remarkably large hat set down a well a be possible to judge for lawyer clerk stopped at once to widen distance between have not heard walked on out of sight without looking back when passed through gate little while afterwards be not visible have evidently gone on to house there be two woman in lodge one of be old other knew at once by marian description of to be margaret porcher asked first if sir percival be at park receiving reply in negative inquired next when have left of woman must tell more than that have gone away in summer must extract nothing from margaret porcher vacant smile shaking of head old woman be little more intelligent managed to lead into speaking of manner of sir percival departure of alarm that caused remembered master calling out of bed remembered frightening by swearing date at occurrence happened be a honestly acknowledged quite beyond on leaving lodge saw gardener at work not far off when first addressed looked at rather distrustfully on using mr michelson name with civil reference to entered into conversation readily enough there be need to describe what passed between ended a other attempt to discover date have ended gardener knew that master have driven away at night time in july last fortnight last ten day in month knew more while be speaking together saw man in black with large hat come out from house stand at little distance observing certain suspicion of errand at blackwater park have already crossed mind be now increased by gardener inability unwillingness to tell who man be determined to clear way before if possible by speaking to plainest question must put a stranger must be to inquire if house be allowed to be shown to visitor walked up to man at once accosted in word look manner unmistakably betrayed that knew who be that wanted to irritate into quarrelling with reply be insolent enough to have answered purpose if have be le determined to control a be met with most resolute politeness apologised for involuntary intrusion called trespass left ground be exactly a suspected recognition of when left mr kyrle office have be evidently communicated to sir percival glyde man in black have be sent to park in anticipation of making inquiry at house in neighbourhood if have given least chance of lodging sort of legal complaint against interference of local magistrate must no doubt have be turned to account a clog on proceeding mean of separating from marian laura for day at least be prepared to be watched on way from blackwater park to station exactly a have be watched in day before must not discover at time whether be really followed on occasion not man in black might have have mean of tracking at disposal of be not aware certainly saw nothing of in own person on way to station afterwards on arrival at london terminus in evening reached home on foot taking precaution before approached own door of walking round by loneliest street in neighbourhood there stopping looking back more than once over open space behind have first learnt to use stratagem against suspected treachery in wild of central america now be practising again with same purpose with even greater caution in heart of civilised london nothing have happened to alarm marian during absence asked eagerly what success have met with when told must not conceal surprise at indifference with spoke of failure of investigation thus far truth be that ill success of inquiry have in sense daunted have pursued a matter of duty have expected nothing from in state of mind at time be almost relief to to know that struggle be now narrowed to trial of strength between myself sir percival glyde vindictive motive have mingled all along with other better motif confess be satisfaction to to feel that surest way only way left of serving laura cause be to fasten hold firmly on villain who have married while acknowledge be not strong enough to keep motif above reach of instinct of revenge can honestly say something in own favour on other side base speculation on future relation of laura on private personal concession might force from sir percival if once have at mercy ever entered mind never said to myself if do succeed will be one result of success that put out of husband power to take from again must not look at think of future with such thought a sad sight of change in from former self made one interest of love interest of tenderness compassion father brother might have felt felt god know in inmost heart hope looked farther on now than to day of recovery there till be strong again happy again there till must look at a have once looked speak to a have once spoken future of happiest thought dearest wish ended word be written under prompting of idle self contemplation passage in narrative be soon to come will set mind of others in judgment on conduct be right that best worst of must be fairly balanced before time on morning after return from hampshire took marian upstairs into working room there laid before plan have matured thus far for mastering one assailable point in life of sir percival glyde way to secret lay through mystery hitherto impenetrable to of of woman in white approach to in turn might be gained by obtaining assistance of anne catherick mother only ascertainable mean of prevailing on mr catherick to act to speak in matter depended on chance of discovering local particular family particular first of from mr clements after thinking subject over carefully felt certain that must only begin new inquiry by placing in communication with faithful friend protectress of anne catherick first difficulty then be to find mr clements be indebted to marian quick perception for meeting necessity at once by best simplest mean proposed to write to farm near limmeridge todd corner to inquire whether mr clements have communicated with mr todd during past few month how mr clements have be separated from anne be impossible for to say separation once effected must certainly occur to mr clements to inquire after missing woman in neighbourhood of others to be known to be most attached neighbourhood of limmeridge saw directly that marian proposal offered prospect of success wrote to mr todd accordingly by day post while be waiting for reply made master of information marian must afford on subject of sir percival family of early life must only speak on topic from hearsay be reasonably certain of truth of what little have to tell sir percival be only child father sir felix glyde have suffered from birth under painful incurable deformity have shunned society from earliest year sole happiness be in enjoyment of music have married lady with taste similar to own who be said to be most accomplished musician inherited blackwater property while still young man wife after taking possession made advance of sort towards society of neighbourhood one endeavoured to tempt into abandoning reserve with one disastrous exception of rector of parish rector be worst of innocent mischief maker over zealous man have heard that sir felix have left college with character of being little better than revolutionist in politics infidel in religion arrived conscientiously at conclusion that be bounden duty to summon lord of manor to hear sound view enunciated in parish church sir felix fiercely resented clergyman well meant ill directed interference insulting so grossly so publicly that family in neighbourhood sent letter of indignant remonstrance to park even tenant of blackwater property expressed opinion a strongly a dared baronet who have country taste of kind attachment to estate to one living on declared that society at blackwater must never have second chance of annoying left place from moment after short residence in london wife departed for continent never returned to england again lived part of time in france part in germany always keeping in strict retirement morbid sense of own personal deformity have made necessity to sir felix son percival have be born abroad have be educated there by private tutor mother be first of parent whom lost father have died few year after either in sir percival have be in england a young man once twice before period acquaintance with late mr fairlie did not begin till after time of father death soon became very intimate although sir percival be seldom never at limmeridge house in day mr frederick fairlie might have met once twice in mr philip fairlie company must have known little of at at other time sir percival only intimate friend in fairlie family have be laura father be particular must gain from marian suggested nothing be useful to present purpose noted down carefully in event of proving to be of importance at future period mr todd reply addressed by own wish to post office at distance from have arrived at destination when went to apply for chance have be against hitherto turned from moment in favour mr todd letter contained first item of information of be in search mr clements appeared have a have conjectured written to todd corner asking pardon in first place for abrupt manner in anne have left friend at farm house on morning after have met woman in white in limmeridge churchyard then informing mr todd of anne disappearance entreating that must cause inquiry to be made in neighbourhood on chance that lost woman might have strayed back to limmeridge in making request mr clements have be careful to add to address at might always be heard of that address mr todd now transmitted to marian be in london within hour walk of own lodging in word of proverb be resolved not to let grass grow under foot next morning set forth to seek interview with mr clements be first step forward in investigation story of desperate attempt to now stood committed begin here vi address communicated by mr todd took to lodging house situated in respectable street near gray inn road when knocked door be opened by mr clements did not appear to remember asked what business be recalled to meeting in limmeridge churchyard at close of interview there with woman in white taking special care to remind be person who assisted anne catherick a anne have declared to escape pursuit from asylum be only claim to confidence of mr clements remembered circumstance moment spoke of asked into parlour in greatest anxiety to know if have brought news of anne be impossible for to tell whole truth without at same time entering into particular on subject of conspiracy must have be dangerous to confide to stranger must only abstain most carefully from raising false hope then explain that object of visit be to discover person who be really responsible for anne disappearance even added so a to exonerate from after reproach of own conscience entertained not least hope of being able to trace believed must never see alive again that main interest in affair be to bring to punishment two men whom suspected to be concerned in luring away at whose hand dear friend of mine have suffered grievous wrong with explanation left to mr clements to say whether interest in matter difference there might be in motif actuated be not same whether felt reluctance to forward object by giving such information on subject of inquiry a happened to posse poor woman be at first too much confused agitated to understand thoroughly what said to must only reply be welcome to anything must tell in return for kindness have shown to anne a be not very quick ready at best of time in talking to stranger must beg to put in right way to say where wished to begin knowing by experience that plainest narrative attainable from person who be not accustomed to arrange idea be narrative go far enough back at beginning to avoid impediment of retrospection in course asked mr clements to tell first what have happened after have left limmeridge so by watchful questioning carried on from point to point till reached period of anne disappearance substance of information thus obtained be a follows on leaving farm at todd corner mr clements anne have travelled that day a far a derby have remained there week on anne account have then gone on to london have lived in lodging occupied by mr clements at time for month more when circumstance connected with house landlord have obliged to change quarter anne terror of being discovered in london neighbourhood whenever ventured to walk out have gradually communicated to mr clements have determined on removing to one of most out of way place in england to town of grimsby in lincolnshire where deceased husband have passed early life relative be respectable people settled in town have always treated mr clements with great kindness thought impossible to do better than go there take advice of husband friend anne must not hear of returning to mother at welmingham because have be removed to asylum from place because sir percival must be certain to go back there find again there be serious weight in objection mr clements felt that be not to be easily removed at grimsby first serious symptom of illness have shown in anne appeared soon after news of lady glyde marriage have be made public in newspaper have reached through medium medical man who be sent for to attend sick woman discovered at once that be suffering from serious affection of heart illness lasted long left very weak returned at interval though with mitigated severity again again remained at grimsby in consequence during first half of new year there might probably have stayed much longer for sudden resolution anne took at time to venture back to hampshire for purpose of obtaining private interview with lady glyde mr clements did in power to oppose execution of hazardous unaccountable project explanation of motif be offered by anne except believed day of death be not far off that have something on mind must be communicated to lady glyde at risk in secret resolution to accomplish purpose be so firmly settled that declared intention of going to hampshire by if mr clements felt unwillingness to go with doctor on being consulted be of opinion that serious opposition to wish must in probability produce perhaps fatal fit of illness mr clements under advice yielded to necessity once more with sad foreboding of trouble danger to come allowed anne catherick to have own way on journey from london to hampshire mr clements discovered that one of fellow passenger be well acquainted with neighbourhood of blackwater must give information needed on subject of locality in way found out that only place must go to be not dangerously near to sir percival residence be large village called distance here from blackwater park be between three four mile distance back again anne have walked on occasion when have appeared in neighbourhood of lake for few day during be at sandon without being discovered have lived little away from village in cottage of decent widow woman who have bedroom to let whose discreet silence mr clements have done best to secure for first week at least have also tried hard to induce anne to be content with writing to lady glyde in first instance failure of warning contained in anonymous letter sent to limmeridge have made anne resolute to speak time obstinate in determination to go on errand alone mr clements nevertheless followed privately on occasion when went to lake without however venturing near enough to boat house to be witness of what took place there when anne returned for last time from dangerous neighbourhood fatigue of walking day after day distance be far too great for strength added to exhausting effect of agitation from have suffered produced result mr clements have dreaded all along old pain over heart other symptom of illness at grimsby returned anne be confined to bed in cottage in emergency first necessity a mr clements knew by experience be to endeavour to quiet anne anxiety of mind for purpose good woman went next day to lake to try if must find lady glyde who must be sure a anne said to take daily walk to boat house prevail on to come back privately to cottage near sandon on reaching outskirt of plantation mr clements encountered not lady glyde tall stout elderly gentleman with book in hand in other word count fosco count after looking at very attentively for moment asked if expected to see one in place added before must reply that be waiting there with message from lady glyde that be not quite certain whether person then before answered description of person with whom be desired to communicate upon mr clements at once confided errand to entreated that must help to allay anne anxiety by trusting message to count most readily kindly complied with request message said be very important one lady glyde entreated anne good friend to return immediately to london a felt certain that sir percival must discover if remained longer in neighbourhood of blackwater be going to london in short time if mr clements anne must go there first must let know what address be must hear from see in fortnight le count added that have already attempted to give friendly warning to anne that have be too much startled by seeing that be stranger to let approach speak to to mr clements replied in greatest alarm distress that asked nothing better than to take anne safely to london that there be present hope of removing from dangerous neighbourhood a lay ill in bed at moment count inquired if mr clements have sent for medical advice hearing that have hitherto hesitated to do so from fear of making position publicly known in village informed that be medical man that must go back with if pleased see what must be done for anne mr clements feeling natural confidence in count a person trusted with secret message from lady glyde gratefully accepted offer went back together to cottage anne be asleep when got there count started at sight of evidently from astonishment at resemblance to lady glyde poor mr clements supposed that be only shocked to see how ill be must not allow to be awakened be contented with putting question to mr clements about symptom with looking at with lightly touching pulse sandon be large enough place to have grocer druggist shop in thither count went to write prescription to get medicine made up brought back told mr clements that medicine be powerful stimulant that must certainly give anne strength to get up bear fatigue of journey to london of only few hour remedy be to be administered at stated time on day on day after on third day must be well enough to travel arranged to meet mr clements at blackwater station to see off by midday train if did not appear must assume that anne be worse must proceed at once to cottage a event turned out such emergency a occurred medicine have extraordinary effect on anne good result of be helped by assurance mr clements must now give her that must soon see lady glyde in london at appointed day time when have not be quite so long a week in hampshire altogether arrived at station count be waiting there for be talking to elderly lady who appeared to be going to travel by train to london also most kindly assisted put into carriage begging mr clements not to forget to send address to lady glyde elderly lady did not travel in same compartment did not notice what became of on reaching london terminus mr clements secured respectable lodging in quiet neighbourhood then wrote a have engaged to do to inform lady glyde of address little more than fortnight passed answer came at end of time lady same elderly lady whom have seen at station called in cab said that came from lady glyde who be then at hotel in london who wished to see mr clements for purpose of arranging future interview with anne mr clements expressed willingness anne being present at time entreating to do so to forward object in view especially a be not required to be away from house for more than hour at most elderly lady clearly madame fosco then left in cab lady stopped cab after have driven distance at shop before got to hotel begged mr clements to wait for for few minute while made purchase have be forgotten never appeared again after waiting time mr clements became alarmed ordered cabman to drive back to lodging when got there after absence of rather more than hour anne be gone only information to be obtained from people of house be derived from servant who waited on lodger have opened door to boy from street who have left letter for young woman who lived on second floor part of house mr clements occupied servant have delivered letter have then gone downstairs five minute afterwards have observed anne open front door go out dressed in bonnet shawl have probably taken letter with for be not to be found be therefore impossible to tell what inducement have be offered to make leave house must have be strong one for must never stir out alone in london of own accord if mr clements have not known by experience nothing must have induced to go away in cab even for so short time a hour only a soon a must collect thought first idea naturally occurred to mr clements be to go make inquiry at asylum to dreaded that anne have be taken back went there next day having be informed of locality in house be situated by anne answer received application having in probability be made day two before false anne catherick have really be consigned to safe keeping in asylum be that such person have be brought back there have then written to mr catherick at welmingham to know if have seen heard anything of daughter have received answer in negative after reply have reached be at end of resource perfectly ignorant where else to inquire what else to do from time to have remained in total ignorance of cause of anne disappearance of end of anne story vii thus far information have received from mr clements though established fact of have not previously be aware be of preliminary character only be clear that series of deception have removed anne catherick to london separated from mr clements have be accomplished solely by count fosco countess question whether part of conduct of husband wife have be of kind to place of within reach of law might be well worthy of future consideration purpose have now in view led in direction than immediate object of visit to mr clements be to make approach at least to discovery of sir percival secret have said nothing a yet advanced on way to important end felt necessity of trying to awaken recollection of other time person event than on memory have hitherto be employed when next spoke spoke with object indirectly in view wish must be of help to in sad calamity said can do be to feel heartily for distress if anne have be own child mr clements must have shown truer kindness must have made readier sacrifice for sake there be great merit in sir said mr clements simply poor thing be a good a own child to nursed from baby sir bringing up by hand hard job be to rear must go to heart so to lose if have made first short clothes taught to walk always said be sent to console for never having chick child of own now be lost old

will soon see only two day afterwards did see mr clements waited for moment before went on even in moment began to doubt whether clue thought have found be really leading to central mystery of labyrinth after be common too common story of man treachery woman frailty key to secret have be lifelong terror of sir percival glyde well sir catherick took husband advice waited mr clements continued a told have long to wait on second day found wife sir percival whispering together quite familiar close under vestry of church suppose thought neighbourhood of vestry be last place in world where anybody must think of looking after however may be there be sir percival being seemingly surprised confounded defended in guilty way that poor catherick whose quick temper have told of already fell into kind of frenzy at own disgrace struck sir percival be match be sorry to say for man who have wronged be beaten in cruelest manner before neighbour who have come to place on hearing disturbance must run in to part happened towards evening before nightfall when husband went to catherick house be gone nobody knew where living soul in village ever saw again knew too well by time what wife vile reason have be for marrying felt misery disgrace especially after what have happened to with sir percival too keenly clergyman of parish put advertisement in paper begging to come back saying that must not lose situation friend catherick have too much pride spirit a people said too much feeling a think sir to face neighbour again try to live down memory of disgrace husband heard from when have left england heard second time when be settled doing well in america be alive there now a far a know none of in old country wicked wife least of be ever likely to set eye on again what became of sir percival inquired did stay in neighbourhood not sir place be too hot to hold be heard at high word with mr catherick same night when scandal broke out next morning took off mr catherick surely never remained in village among people who knew of disgrace did sir be hard enough heartless enough to set opinion of neighbour at flat defiance declared to everybody from clergyman downwards that be victim of dreadful mistake that scandal monger in place must not drive out of a if be guilty woman through time lived at old welmingham after time when new town be building respectable neighbour began moving to moved too a if be determined to live among scandalise to very last there be now there will stop in defiance of best of to dying day how have lived through year asked be husband able willing to help able willing sir said mr clements in second letter wrote to good man said have borne name lived in home wicked a be must not starve like beggar in street must afford to make small allowance might draw for quarterly at place in london did accept allowance not farthing of sir said must never be beholden to catherick for bit drop if lived to be hundred have kept word ever since when poor dear husband died left to catherick letter be put in possession with other thing told to let know if be ever in want `` ll let england know be in want said 'before tell catherick friend of catherick take that for answer give to for answer if ever writes again ' do suppose that have money of own very little if sir be said said truly be afraid that mean of living came privately from sir percival glyde after last reply waited little to reconsider what have heard if unreservedly accepted story so far be now plain that approach direct indirect to secret have yet be revealed to that pursuit of object have ended again in leaving face to face with most palpable most disheartening failure there be one point in narrative made doubt propriety of accepting unreservedly suggested idea of something hidden below surface must not account to myself for circumstance of clerk guilty wife voluntarily living out after existence on scene of disgrace woman own reported statement that have taken strange course a practical assertion of innocence did not satisfy seemed to mind more natural more probable to assume that be not so completely free agent in matter a have asserted in case who be likeliest person to posse power of compelling to remain at person unquestionably from whom derived mean of living have refused assistance from husband have adequate resource of own be friendless degraded woman from what source must derive help from source at report pointed sir percival glyde reasoning on assumption always bearing in mind one certain fact to guide that mr catherick be in possession of secret easily understood that be sir percival interest to keep at welmingham because character in place be certain to isolate from communication with female neighbour to allow opportunity of talking incautiously in moment of free intercourse with inquisitive bosom friend what be mystery to be concealed not sir percival infamous connection with mr catherick disgrace for neighbour be very people who knew of not suspicion that be anne father for welmingham be place in suspicion must inevitably exist if accepted guilty appearance described to a unreservedly a others have accepted if drew from same superficial conclusion mr catherick neighbour have drawn where be suggestion in have heard of dangerous secret between sir percival mr catherick have be kept hidden from time to yet in stolen meeting in familiar whispering between clerk wife gentleman in mourning clue to discovery existed beyond doubt be possible that appearance in case have pointed one way while truth lay while unsuspected in direction must mr catherick assertion that be victim of dreadful mistake by possibility be true assuming to be false must conclusion associated sir percival with guilt have be founded in inconceivable error have sir percival by chance courted suspicion be wrong for sake of diverting from other suspicion be right here if must find here be approach to secret hidden deep under surface of apparently unpromising story have just heard next question be now directed to one object of ascertaining whether mr catherick have have not arrived truly at conviction of wife misconduct answer received from mr clements left in doubt whatever on point mr catherick have on clearest evidence compromised reputation while single woman with person unknown have married to save character have be positively ascertained by calculation of time place into need not enter particularly that daughter who bore husband name be not husband child next object of inquiry whether be equally certain that sir percival must have be father of anne be beset by far greater difficulty be in position to try probability on one side on other in instance by better test than test of personal resemblance suppose often saw sir percival when be in village said yes sir very often replied mr clements did ever observe that anne be like be not at like sir be like mother then not like mother sir mr catherick be dark full in face not like mother not like supposed father knew that test by personal resemblance be not to be implicitly trusted on other hand be not to be altogether rejected on account be possible to strengthen evidence by discovering conclusive fact in relation to life of mr catherick sir percival before of appeared at old welmingham when asked next question put with view when sir percival first arrived in neighbourhood said did hear where have come from last sir said from blackwater park said from scotland nobody knew be mr catherick living in service at varneck hall immediately before marriage yes sir have be long in place three four year sir be not quite certain did ever hear name of gentleman to whom varneck hall belonged at time sir name be major donthorne did mr catherick did one else knew ever hear that sir percival be friend of major donthorne ever see sir percival in neighbourhood of varneck hall catherick never did sir that can remember one else that know of noted down major donthorne name address on chance that might still be alive that might be useful at future time to apply to meanwhile impression on mind be now decidedly adverse to opinion that sir percival be anne father decidedly favourable to conclusion that secret of stolen interview with mr catherick be entirely unconnected with disgrace woman have inflicted on husband good name must think of further inquiry might make to strengthen impression must only encourage mr clements to speak next of anne early day watch for chance suggestion might in way offer to have not heard yet said how poor child born in sin misery came to be trusted mr clements to care there be nobody else sir to take little helpless creature in hand replied mr clements wicked mother seemed to hate a if poor baby be in fault from day be born heart be heavy for child made offer to bring up a tenderly a if be own did anne remain entirely under care from time not quite entirely sir mr catherick have whim fancy about at time used now then to lay claim to child a if wanted to spite for bringing up fit of hers never lasted for long poor little anne be always returned to be always glad to get back though led gloomy life in house having playmate like other child to brighten up longest separation be when mother took to limmeridge just at time lost husband felt be a well in miserable affliction that anne must not be in house be between ten eleven year old then slow at lesson poor soul not so cheerful a other child a pretty little girl to look at a must wish to see waited at home till mother brought back then made offer to take with to london truth being sir must not find in heart to stop at old welmingham after husband death place be so changed so dismal to did mr catherick consent to proposal sir came back from north harder bitterer than ever folk did say that have be obliged to ask sir percival leave to go to begin with that only went to nurse dying sister at limmeridge because poor woman be reported to have saved money truth being that hardly left enough to bury thing may have soured mr catherick likely enough however may be must hear of taking child away seemed to like distressing by parting must do be to give anne direction to tell privately if be ever in trouble to come to year passed before be free to come never saw again poor soul till night escaped from mad house know mr clements why sir percival glyde shut up only know what anne told sir poor thing used to ramble wander about sadly said mother have got secret of sir percival to keep have let out to long after left hampshire when sir percival found knew shut up never must say what be when asked must tell be that mother might be ruin destruction of sir percival if chose mr catherick may have let out just a much a more be next to certain must have heard whole truth from anne if have really known a pretended to do a very likely fancied did poor soul idea have more than once occurred to own mind have already told marian doubted whether laura be really on point of making important discovery when anne catherick be disturbed by count fosco at boat house be perfectly in character with anne mental affliction that must assume absolute knowledge of secret on better ground than vague suspicion derived from hint mother have incautiously let drop in presence sir percival guilty distrust must in case infallibly inspire with false idea anne knew from mother just a have afterwards fixed in mind equally false suspicion that wife knew from anne time be passing morning be wearing away be doubtful if stayed longer whether must hear anything more from mr clements must be at useful to purpose have already discovered local family particular in relation to mr catherick of have be in search have arrived at certain conclusion entirely new to might immensely assist in directing course of future proceeding rose to take leave to thank mr clements for friendly readiness have shown in affording information be afraid must have thought very inquisitive said have troubled with more question than many people must have cared to answer be heartily welcome sir to anything can tell answered mr clements stopped looked at wistfully do said poor woman must have told little more about anne sir thought saw something in face when came in looked a if must ca think how hard be not even to know whether be living dead must bear better if be only certain said never expected must see alive again do know sir do know for truth that have pleased god to take be not proof against appeal must have be unspeakably mean cruel of if have resisted be afraid there be doubt of truth answered gently have certainty in own mind that trouble in world be over poor woman dropped into chair hid face from oh sir said how do know who can have told one have told mr clements have reason for feeling sure of reason promise will know a soon a can safely explain be certain be not neglected in last moment be certain heart complaint from suffered so sadly be true cause of death will feel a sure of a do soon will know before long that be buried in quiet country churchyard in pretty peaceful place might have chosen for dead said mr clements dead so young be left to hear made first short frock taught to walk first time ever said mother said to now be left anne be taken did say sir said poor woman removing handkerchief from face looking up at for first time did say that have be nicely buried be sort of funeral might have have if have really be own child assured that be seemed to take inexplicable pride in answer to find comfort in other higher consideration must afford must have broken heart said simply if anne have not be nicely buried how do know sir who told once more entreated to wait until must speak to unreservedly be sure to see again said for have favour to ask when be little more composed perhaps in day two keep waiting sir on account said mr clements never mind cry if can be of use if have anything on mind to say to sir please to say now only wish to ask one last question said only want to know mr catherick address at welmingham request so startled mr clements for moment even tidings of anne death seemed to be driven from mind tear suddenly ceased to flow sat looking at in blank amazement for lord sake sir said what do want with mr catherick want mr clements replied want to know secret of private meeting of hers with sir percival glyde there be something more in what have told of woman past conduct of man past relation with than of neighbour ever suspected there be secret none of know between two be going to mr catherick with resolution to find out think twice about sir said mr clements rising in earnestness laying hand on arm be awful woman know a do think twice about be sure warning be kindly meant mr clements be determined to see woman come of mr clements looked anxiously in face see mind be made up sir said will give address wrote down in pocket book then took hand to say farewell will hear from soon said will know have promised to tell mr clements sighed shook head doubtfully old woman advice be sometimes worth taking sir said think twice before go to welmingham viii when reached home again after interview with mr clements be struck by appearance of change in laura unvarying gentleness patience long misfortune have tried so cruelly have never conquered yet seemed now to have suddenly failed insensible to marian attempt to soothe amuse sat with neglected drawing pushed away on table eye resolutely cast down finger twining untwining restlessly in lap marian rose when came in with silent distress in face waited for moment to see if laura must look up at approach whispered to try if can rouse left room sat down in vacant chair gently unclasped poor worn restless finger took hand in mine what be thinking of laura tell darling try tell what be struggled with raised eye to mine ca feel happy said ca help thinking stopped bent forward little laid head on shoulder with terrible mute helplessness struck to heart try to tell repeated gently try to tell why be not happy be so useless be burden on of answered with weary hopeless

hopeful happier future might now not be far off drawing a finished tried to finish be placed in hand marian took from hid carefully set aside little weekly tribute from earnings to be offered to a price paid by stranger for poor faint valueless sketch of be only purchaser be hard sometimes to maintain innocent deception when proudly brought out purse to contribute share towards expense wondered with serious interest whether have earned most that week have hidden drawing in possession still be treasure beyond price dear remembrance love to keep alive friend in past adversity that heart will never part from tenderness never forget be trifling here with necessity of task be looking forward to happier time narrative have not yet reached yes back again back to day of doubt dread when spirit within struggled hard for life in icy stillness of perpetual suspense have paused rested for while on forward course be not perhaps time wasted if friend who read page have paused rested too took first opportunity must find of speaking to marian in private of communicating to result of inquiry have made that morning seemed to share opinion on subject of proposed journey to welmingham mr clements have already expressed to surely walter said hardly know enough yet to give hope of claiming mr catherick confidence be wise to proceed to extremity before have really exhausted safer simpler mean of attaining object when told that sir percival count be only two people in existence who knew exact date of laura journey forgot forgot that there be third person who must surely know mean mr rubelle must not be far easier far le dangerous to insist on confession from than to force from sir percival might be easier replied be not aware of full extent of mr rubelle connivance interest in conspiracy be therefore not certain that date have be impressed on mind a have be assuredly impressed on mind of sir percival count be too late now to waste time on mr rubelle may be important to discovery of one assailable point in sir percival life be thinking little too seriously marian of risk may run in returning to hampshire be beginning to doubt whether sir percival glyde may not in end be more than match for will not be more than match replied decidedly because will not be helped in resisting by impenetrable wickedness of count what have led to conclusion replied in surprise own

count interference will be time when have sir percival at mercy own interest will then be directly threatened will act walter to terrible purpose in own defence may deprive of weapon beforehand said of particular have heard from mr clements may yet be turned to account against other mean of strengthening case may be at disposal there be passage in mr michelson narrative show that count found necessary to place in communication with mr fairlie there may be circumstance compromise in proceeding while be away marian write to mr fairlie say that want answer describing exactly what passed

grasp seemed now farther from reach than ever what suggestion of mystery unexplained have arisen out of visit to vestry saw suggestion anywhere what progress have made towards discovering suspected stain on reputation of sir percival one fact have ascertained vindicated reputation fresh doubt fresh difficulty fresh delay began to open before in interminable prospect what be to do next one immediate resource left to appeared to be might institute inquiry about miss elster of knowlesbury on chance of advancing towards main object of investigation by first discovering secret of mr catherick contempt for sir percival mother have found what wanted sir said clerk a closed register book yes replied have inquiry still to make suppose clergyman who officiated here in year eighteen

knowlesbury from place long stretch sir said clerk with exaggerated idea of distance vivid perception of difficulty in getting from place to place be peculiar to country people nigh on five mile can tell be still early in forenoon there be plenty of time for walk to knowlesbury back again to welmingham there be person probably in town who be fitter to assist inquiry about character position of sir percival mother before marriage than local solicitor resolving to go at once to knowlesbury on foot led way out of vestry thank kindly sir said clerk a slipped little present into hand be really going to walk way to knowlesbury back well be strong on leg too what blessing be be there be road ca miss be going way be pleasant to meet with gentleman from london in lost corner like one hears news wish good morning sir thank kindly once more parted a left church behind looked back there be two men again on road below with third in company that third person being short man in black whom have traced to railway evening before three stood talking together for little while then separated man in black went away by towards welmingham other two remained together evidently waiting to follow a soon a walked on proceeded on way without letting fellow see that took special notice of caused conscious irritation of feeling at moment on contrary rather revived sinking hope in surprise of discovering evidence of marriage have forgotten inference have drawn on first perceiving men in neighbourhood of vestry reappearance reminded that sir percival have anticipated visit to old welmingham church a next result of interview with mr catherick otherwise must never have placed spy there to wait for smoothly fairly a appearance looked in vestry there be something wrong beneath there be something in register book for aught knew have not discovered yet x once out of sight of church pressed forward briskly on way to knowlesbury road be for most part straight level whenever looked back over saw two spy steadily following for greater part of way kept at safe distance behind once twice quickened pace a if with purpose of overtaking then stopped consulted together fell back again to former position have special object evidently in view seemed to be hesitating differing about best mean of accomplishing must not guess exactly what design might be felt serious doubt of reaching knowlesbury without mischance happening to on way doubt be realised have just entered on lonely part of road with sharp turn at distance ahead have just concluded calculating by time must be getting near to town when suddenly heard step of men close behind before must look round one of man by whom have be followed in london passed rapidly on left side hustled with shoulder have be more irritated by manner in companion have dogged step way from old welmingham than be aware of unfortunately pushed fellow away smartly with open hand instantly shouted for help companion tall man in gamekeeper clothes sprang to right side next moment two scoundrel held pinioned between in middle of road conviction that trap have be laid for vexation of knowing have fallen into fortunately restrained from making position still worse by unavailing struggle with two men one of whom must in probability have be more than match for single handed repressed first natural movement by have attempted to shake off looked about to see if there be person near to whom must appeal labourer be at work in adjoining field who must have witnessed have passed called to to follow to town shook head with stolid obstinacy walked away in direction of cottage stood back from high road at same time men who held between declared intention of charging with assault be cool enough wise enough now to make opposition drop hold of arm said will go with to town man in gamekeeper dress roughly refused shorter man be sharp enough to look to consequence not to let companion commit by unnecessary violence made sign to other walked on between with arm free reached turning in road there close before be suburb of knowlesbury one of local policeman be walking along path by roadside men at once appealed to replied that magistrate be then sitting at town hall recommended that must appear before immediately went on to town clerk made out formal summons charge be preferred against with customary exaggeration customary perversion of truth on such occasion magistrate ill tempered man with sour enjoyment in exercise of own power inquired if one on near road have witnessed assault greatly to surprise complainant admitted presence of labourer in field be enlightened however a to object of admission by magistrate next word remanded at once for production of witness expressing at same time willingness to take bail for reappearance if must produce one responsible surety to offer if have be known in town must have liberated on own recognisance a be total stranger be necessary must find responsible bail whole object of stratagem be now disclosed to have be so managed a to make remand necessary in town where be perfect stranger where must not hope to get liberty on bail remand merely extended over three day until next sitting of magistrate in time while be in confinement sir percival might use mean pleased to embarrass future proceeding perhaps to screen from detection altogether without slightest fear of hindrance on part at end of three day charge must doubt be withdrawn attendance of witness must be perfectly useless indignation may almost say despair at mischievous check to further progress so base trifling in yet so disheartening so serious in probable result quite unfitted at first to reflect on best mean of extricating from dilemma in now stood have folly to call for writing material to think of privately communicating real position to magistrate hopelessness imprudence of proceeding failed to strike before have actually written opening line of letter be not till have pushed paper away not till be ashamed to say have almost allowed vexation of helpless position to conquer that course of action suddenly occurred to mind sir percival have probably not anticipated might set free again in few hour determined to communicate situation in be placed to mr dawson of oak lodge have visited gentleman house may be remembered at time of first inquiry in blackwater park neighbourhood have presented to letter of introduction from miss halcombe in recommended to friendly attention in strongest term now wrote referring to letter to what have previously told mr dawson of delicate dangerous nature of inquiry have not revealed to truth about laura having merely described errand a being of utmost importance to private family interest with miss halcombe be concerned using same caution still now accounted for presence at knowlesbury in same manner put to doctor to say whether trust reposed in by lady whom well knew hospitality have received in house justified not in asking to come to assistance in place where be quite friendless obtained permission to hire messenger to drive away at once with letter in conveyance might be used to bring doctor back immediately oak lodge be on knowlesbury side of blackwater man declared must drive there in forty minute must bring mr dawson back in forty more directed to follow doctor wherever might happen to be if be not at home then sat down to wait for result with patience hope must summon to help be not quite half past one when messenger departed before half past three returned brought doctor with mr dawson kindness delicacy with treated prompt assistance quite a matter of course almost overpowered bail required be offered accepted immediately before four o'clock on afternoon be shaking hand warmly with good old doctor free man again in street of knowlesbury mr dawson hospitably invited to go back with to oak lodge take up quarter there for night must only reply that time be not own must only ask to let pay visit in few day when might repeat thanks offer to explanation felt to be only due be not then in position to make parted with friendly assurance on side turned step at once to mr wansborough office in high street time be now of last importance news of being free on bail must reach sir percival to absolute certainty before night if next few hour did not put in position to justify worst fear to hold helpless at mercy might lose inch of ground have gained never to recover again unscrupulous nature of man local influence possessed desperate peril of exposure with blindfold inquiry threatened warned to press on to positive discovery without useless waste of single minute have found time to think while be waiting for mr dawson arrival have well employed certain portion of conversation of talkative old clerk have wearied at time now recurred to memory with new significance suspicion crossed mind darkly have not occurred to while be in vestry on way to knowlesbury have only proposed to apply to mr wansborough for information on subject of sir percival mother object now be to examine duplicate register of old welmingham church mr wansborough be in office when inquired for be jovial red faced easy looking man more like country squire than lawyer seemed to be surprised amused by application have heard of father copy of register have not even seen have never be inquired after be doubt in strong room among other paper have not be disturbed since father death be pity mr wansborough said that old gentleman be not alive to hear precious copy asked for at last must have ridden favourite hobby harder than ever now how have come to hear of copy be through anybody in town parried question a well a must be impossible at stage of investigation to be too cautious be just a well not to let mr wansborough know prematurely that have already examined original register described therefore a pursuing family inquiry to object of possible saving of time be of great importance be anxious to send certain particular to london by day post one look at duplicate register paying of course necessary fee might supply what required save further journey to old welmingham added that in event of subsequently requiring copy of original register must make application to mr wansborough office to furnish with document after explanation objection be made to producing copy clerk be sent to strong room after delay returned with volume be of exactly same size a volume in vestry only difference being that copy be more smartly bound took with to unoccupied desk hand be trembling head be burning

slowly at first saw nothing under coarse canvas cloth dripping of rain on be audible in dreadful silence looked up along cloth there at end stark grim black in yellow light there be dead face so for first last time saw so visitation of god ruled that must meet xi inquest be hurried for certain local reason weighed with coroner town authority be held on afternoon of next day be necessarily one among witness summoned to assist object of investigation first proceeding in morning be to go to post office inquire for letter expected from marian change of circumstance however extraordinary must affect one great anxiety weighed on mind while be away from london morning letter be only assurance must receive that misfortune have happened in absence be still absorbing interest with day began to relief letter from marian be at office waiting for nothing have happened be a safe a well a when have left laura sent love begged must let know of return day beforehand sister added in explanation of message that have saved nearly sovereign out of own private purse that have claimed privilege of ordering dinner giving dinner be to celebrate day of return read little domestic confidence in bright morning with terrible recollection of what have happened evening before vivid in memory necessity of sparing laura sudden knowledge of truth be first consideration letter suggested to wrote at once to marian to tell have told in page presenting tidings a gradually gently a must warning not to let such thing a newspaper fall in laura way while be absent in case of other woman le courageous le reliable might have hesitated before ventured on unreservedly disclosing whole truth owed to marian to be faithful to past experience of to trust a trusted letter be necessarily long one occupied until time came for proceeding to inquest object of legal inquiry be necessarily beset by peculiar complication difficulty besides investigation into manner in deceased have met death there be serious question to be settled relating to cause of fire to abstraction of key to presence of stranger in vestry at time when flame broke out even identification of dead man have not yet be accomplished helpless condition of servant have made police distrustful of asserted recognition of master have sent to knowlesbury overnight to secure attendance of witness who be well acquainted with personal appearance of sir percival glyde have communicated first thing in morning with blackwater park precaution enabled coroner jury to settle question of identity to confirm correctness of servant assertion evidence offered by competent witness by discovery of certain fact being subsequently strengthened by examination of dead man watch crest name of sir percival glyde be engraved inside next inquiry related to fire servant boy who have heard light struck in vestry be first witness called boy gave evidence clearly enough servant mind have not yet recovered shock inflicted on be plainly incapable of assisting object of inquiry be desired to stand down to own relief examination be not long one have not known deceased have never seen be not aware of presence at old welmingham have not be in vestry at finding of body must prove be that have stopped at clerk cottage to ask way that have heard from of loss of key have accompanied to church to render what help must that have seen fire have heard person unknown inside vestry trying vainly to unlock door have done what must from motif of humanity to save man other witness who have be acquainted with deceased be asked if must explain mystery of presumed abstraction of key presence in burning room coroner seemed to take for granted naturally enough that a total stranger in neighbourhood total stranger to sir percival glyde must not be in position to offer evidence on two point course be bound to take when formal examination have closed seemed clear to did not feel called on to volunteer statement of own private conviction in first place because doing so must serve practical purpose now that proof in support of surmise of mine be burnt with burnt register in second place because must not have intelligibly stated opinion unsupported opinion without disclosing whole story of conspiracy producing beyond doubt same unsatisfactory effect mind of coroner jury have already produced on mind of mr kyrle in page however after time have now elapsed such caution restraint a be here described need fetter free expression of opinion will state briefly before pen occupies with other event how own conviction lead to account for abstraction of key for outbreak of fire for death of man news of being free on bail drove sir percival a believe to last resource attempted attack on road be one of resource suppression of practical proof of crime by destroying page of register on forgery have be committed be other surest of two if must produce extract from original book to compare with certified copy at knowlesbury must produce positive evidence must threaten with fatal exposure be necessary to attainment of end be that must get into vestry unperceived that must tear out page in register that must leave vestry again a privately a have entered on supposition be easy to understand why waited until nightfall before made attempt why took advantage of clerk absence to posse of key necessity must oblige to strike light to find way to right register common caution must suggest locking door on inside in case of intrusion on part of inquisitive stranger on part if happened to be in neighbourhood at time can not believe that be part of intention to make destruction of register appear to be result of accident by purposely setting vestry on fire bare chance that prompt assistance might arrive that book might by remotest possibility be saved must have be enough on moment consideration to dismiss idea of sort from mind remembering quantity of combustible object in vestry straw paper packing case dry wood old worm eaten press probability in estimation point to fire a result of accident with match light first impulse under circumstance be doubtless to try to extinguish flame failing in second impulse ignorant a be of state of lock have be to attempt to escape by door have given entrance when have called to flame must have reached across door leading into church on side of press extended close to other combustible object be placed in probability smoke flame confined a be to room have be too much for when tried to escape by inner door must have dropped in death swoon must have sunk in place where be found just a got on roof to break skylight window even if have be able afterwards to get into church to burst open door from side delay must have be fatal must have be past saving long past saving by time must only have given flame free ingres into church church be now preserved in event must have shared fate of vestry there be doubt in mind there can be doubt in mind of one that be dead man before ever got to empty cottage worked with might main to tear down beam be nearest approach that theory of mine can make towards accounting for result be visible matter of fact a have described so event passed to outside a have related so body be found inquest be adjourned over one day explanation that eye of law must recognise having be discovered thus far to account for mysterious circumstance of case be arranged that more witness must be summoned that london solicitor of deceased must be invited to attend medical man be also charged with duty of reporting on mental condition of servant appeared at present to debar from giving evidence of least importance must only declare in dazed way that have be ordered on night of fire to wait in lane that knew nothing else except that deceased be certainly master own impression be that have be first used without guilty knowledge on own part to ascertain fact of clerk absence from home on previous day that have be afterwards ordered to wait near church out of sight of vestry to assist master in event of escaping attack on road of collision occurring between sir percival be necessary to add that man own testimony be never obtained to confirm view medical report of declared that what little mental faculty possessed be seriously shaken nothing satisfactory be extracted from at adjourned inquest for aught know to contrary may never have recovered to day returned to hotel at welmingham so jaded in body mind so weakened depressed by have gone through a to be quite unfit to endure local gossip about inquest to answer trivial question that talker addressed to in coffee room withdrew from scanty dinner to cheap garret chamber to secure little quiet to think undisturbed of laura marian if have be richer man must have gone back to london must have comforted with sight of two dear face again that night be bound to appear if called on at adjourned inquest doubly bound to answer bail before magistrate at knowlesbury

result must have made discovery marketable commodity even for laura sake after have found out that robbery of right of others be essence of sir percival crime must have offered price of silence for confession of conspiracy when effect of silence must have be to keep right heir from estate right owner from name impossible if sir percival have lived discovery from in ignorance of true nature of

difficulty brought to old welmingham for one consideration might have gone to knowlesbury instead mother have be living there just before met with father living under maiden name truth being that be really married woman married in ireland where husband have ill used have afterwards gone off with other person give fact on good authority sir felix mentioned to son a reason why have not married may wonder why son knowing that parent have met other at knowlesbury did not play first trick with register of church where might have be fairly presumed father mother be married reason be that clergyman who did duty at knowlesbury church in year eighteen hundred three when according to birth certificate father mother ought to have be married be alive still when took possession of property in new year of eighteen hundred twenty seven awkward circumstance forced to extend inquiry to neighbourhood there such danger existed former clergyman at church having be dead for year old welmingham suited

wonder at solitary way when be supposed to be married if have not be hideous creature to look at retired life with lady might have raised suspicion a thing be hiding ugliness deformity in strictest privacy surprised nobody lived in neighbourhood till came in possession of park after three four twenty year have passed who be to say clergyman being dead that marriage have not be a private a rest of life that have not taken place at old welmingham church so a told son found neighbourhood surest place must choose to set thing right secretly in own interest may surprise to hear that what really did to marriage register be done on spur of moment done on second thought first notion be only to tear leaf out in right year month to destroy privately to go back to london to tell lawyer to get necessary certificate of father marriage innocently referring of course to date on leaf be gone nobody must say father mother have not be married after whether under circumstance must stretch point not about lending money thought must have answer ready at event if question be ever raised about right to name estate when came to look privately at register for found at bottom of one of page for year eighteen hundred three blank space left seemingly through there being room to make long entry there be made instead at top of next page sight of chance altered plan be opportunity have never hoped for thought of took know how blank space to have exactly tallied with birth certificate ought to have occurred in july part of register occurred in september part instead however in case if suspicious question be asked answer be not hard to find have only to describe a seven month child be fool enough when told story to feel interest pity for be just what calculated on a will see thought

have composed myself again sensation be not pleasant can tell when came to reflect on own folly anne have be more than usually crazy queer that year when thought of chance there might be of repeating word in town mentioning name in connection with if inquisitive people got hold of be finely terrified at possible consequence worst fear for worst dread of what might do led farther than be quite unprepared for what really did happen only next day on next day without warning to to expect came to house first word tone in spoke surly a be showed plainly enough that have repented already of

leave subject there be have more pressing claim on attention have kept laura mercifully kept in ignorance of husband death oh walter surely must be long yet before tell of marian better that must reveal to now than accident one can guard against must reveal to at future time spare detail break to very tenderly tell that be dead have reason walter for wishing to know of husband death besides reason have just mentioned have reason connected with subject must not be mentioned between yet may never be mentioned to laura at dwelt on last word meaningly when answered in affirmative dwelt on

other subject by consent mine be not to be mentioned between yet be not le present in mind be rather kept alive in by restraint have imposed on watched laura more anxiously than ever sometimes waiting

that interval of rest seclusion of be now writing entirely suspended on part pursuit of one absorbing purpose with thought action be associated in page purpose be for month month yet never to relax claim on slow ripening of still left measure of precaution to take obligation of gratitude to perform doubtful question to solve measure of precaution related necessarily to count be of last importance to ascertain if possible whether plan committed to remaining in england in other word to remaining within reach contrived to set doubt at rest by very simple mean address in st john wood being known to inquired in neighbourhood having found out agent who have disposal of furnished house in lived asked if number five forest road be likely to be let within reasonable time reply be in negative be informed that foreign gentleman then residing in house have renewed term of occupation for six month must remain in possession until end of june in following year be then at beginning of december only left agent with mind relieved from present fear of count escaping obligation have to perform took once more into presence of mr clements have promised to return to confide to particular relating to death burial of anne catherick have be obliged to withhold at first interview changed a circumstance now be there be hindrance to trusting good woman with a much of story of conspiracy a be necessary to tell have reason that sympathy friendly feeling must suggest to urge on speedy performance of promise did conscientiously carefully perform there be need to burden page with statement of what passed at interview will be more to purpose to say that interview necessarily brought to mind one doubtful question still remaining to be solved question of anne catherick parentage on father side multitude of small consideration in connection with subject trifling enough in strikingly important when massed together have latterly led mind to conclusion resolved to verify obtained marian permission to write to major donthorne of varneck hall where mr catherick have lived in service for year previous to marriage to ask certain question made inquiry in marian name described a relating to matter of personal history in family might explain excuse application when wrote letter have certain knowledge that major donthorne be still alive despatched on chance that might be living able willing to reply after lapse of two day proof came in shape of letter that major be living that be ready to help idea in mind when wrote to nature of inquiry will be easily inferred from reply letter answered question by communicating important fact in first place late sir percival glyde of blackwater park have never set foot in varneck deceased gentleman be total stranger to major donthorne to family in second place late mr philip fairlie of limmeridge house have be in younger day intimate friend constant guest of major donthorne having refreshed memory by looking back to old letter other paper major be in position to say positively that mr philip fairlie be staying at varneck hall in month of august eighteen hundred twenty six that remained there for shooting during month of september part of october following then left to best of major belief for scotland did not return to varneck hall till after lapse of time when reappeared in character of newly married man taken by statement be perhaps of little positive value taken in connection with certain fact one of marian knew to be true suggested one plain conclusion be to mind irresistible knowing now that mr philip fairlie have be at varneck hall in autumn of eighteen hundred twenty six mr catherick have be living there in service at same time knew also first that anne have be born in june eighteen hundred twenty seven secondly that have always presented extraordinary personal resemblance to laura thirdly that laura be strikingly like father mr philip fairlie have be one of notoriously handsome men of time in disposition entirely unlike brother frederick be spoilt darling of society especially of woman easy light hearted impulsive affectionate man generous to fault constitutionally lax in principle notoriously thoughtless of moral obligation where woman be concerned such be fact knew such be character of man surely plain inference follows need pointing out read by new light have now broken upon even mr catherick letter in despite of herself rendered mite of assistance towards strengthening conclusion at have arrived have described mr fairlie in writing to a plain looking a having entrapped handsomest man in england into marrying assertion be gratuitously made be false jealous dislike in woman a mr catherick must express in petty malice rather than not express at appeared to to be only assignable cause for peculiar insolence of reference to mr fairlie under circumstance did not necessitate reference at mention here of mr fairlie name naturally suggests one other question did ever suspect whose child little girl brought to at limmeridge might be marian testimony be positive on point mr fairlie letter to husband have be read to in former day letter describing anne resemblance to laura acknowledging affectionate interest in little stranger have be written beyond question in perfect innocence of heart even seemed doubtful on consideration whether mr philip fairlie have be nearer than wife to suspicion of truth disgracefully deceitful circumstance under mr catherick have married purpose of concealment marriage be intended to answer might well keep silent for caution sake perhaps for own pride sake also even assuming that have mean in absence of communicating with father of unborn child a surmise floated through mind there rose on memory remembrance of scripture denunciation have thought of in time with wonder with sin of father will be visited on child for fatal resemblance between two daughter of one father conspiracy of anne have be innocent instrument laura innocent victim must never have be planned with what unerring terrible directness long chain of circumstance led down from thoughtless wrong committed by father to heartless injury inflicted on child thought came to others with drew mind away to little cumberland churchyard where anne catherick now lay buried thought of bygone day when have met by mr fairlie grave met for last time thought of poor helpless hand beating on tombstone weary yearning word murmured to dead remains of protectress friend oh if must die be hidden at rest with little more than year have passed since breathed that wish how inscrutably how awfully have be fulfilled word have spoken to laura by shore of lake very word have now come true oh if must only be buried with mother if must only wake at side when
