genial whiskey mr idle mr goodchild never asked how came to pas that men in field be never heard of more how stalwart landlord replaced without explanation how dog cart came to be waiting at door how everything be arranged without least arrangement for climbing to old carrocks shoulder standing on head without word of inquiry therefore two idle apprentice drifted out resignedly into fine soft

difficult to get up dog cart be left at lonely farm house landlord borrowed large umbrella assuming in instant character of most cheerful adventurous of guide led way to ascent mr goodchild looked eagerly at top of mountain feeling apparently that be now going to be very lazy indeed shone over wonderfully to eye under influence of contentment within moisture without only in bosom of mr thomas

in mist rain be falling faster faster knee of mr idlealways weak on walking excursionsshivered shook with fear damp wet be already penetrating through young man outer coat to brand new shooting jacket for have reluctantly paid large sum of two guinea on leaving town have stimulating refreshment about small packet of clammy gingerbread nut have nobody to give arm nobody to push gently behind nobody to pull up tenderly in front nobody to speak to who really felt difficulty of ascent dampness of rain denseness of mist unutterable folly of climbing undriven up steep place in world when there be level ground within reach to walk on instead be for thomas have left london london where there be nice short walk in level public garden with bench of repose set up at convenient distance for weary travellerslondon where rugged stone be humanely pounded into little lump for road intelligently shaped into smooth slab for pavement no be not for laborious ascent of crag of carrock idle have left native city travelled to cumberland never did feel more disastrously convinced that have committed very grave error in judgment than when found standing in rain at bottom of steep mountain knew that responsibility rested on weak shoulder of actually getting to top of honest landlord went first beaming goodchild followed mournful idle brought up rear from time to time two foremost member of expedition changed place in order of march rearguard never altered position up mountain down mountain in water out of over rock through bog skirting heather mr thomas idle be always last be always man who have to be looked after waited for at first ascent be delusively easy side of mountain sloped gradually material of be composed be soft spongy turf very tender pleasant to walk upon after hundred yard so however verdant scene easy slope disappeared rock began not noble massive rock standing upright keeping certain regularity in position possessing now then flat top to sit upon little irritating comfortless rock littered about anyhow by nature treacherous disheartening rock of sort of small shape small size bruiser of tender toe tripper up of wavering foot when impediment be passed heather slough followed here steepness of ascent be slightly mitigated here exploring party of three turned round to look at view below scene of moorland field be like feeble water colour drawing half sponged out mist be darkening rain be thickening tree be dotted about like spot of faint shadow division line mapped out field be getting blurred together lonely farm house where dog cart have be left loomed spectral in grey light like last human dwelling at end of habitable world be sight worth climbing to see surelysurely not up againfor top of carrock be not reached yet land lord just a good tempered obliging a be at bottom of mountain mr goodchild brighter in eye rosier in face than ever full of cheerful remark apt quotation walking with springiness of step wonderful to behold mr idle farther farther in rear with water squeaking in toe of boot with two guinea shooting jacket clinging damply to aching side with overcoat so full of rain standing out so pyramidically stiff in consequence from shoulder downwards that felt a if be walking in gigantic extinguisherthe despairing spirit within representing too aptly candle have just be put out up up up again till ridge be reached outer edge of mist on summit of carrock be darkly drizzingly near be top nothing like top be aggravating peculiarity of mountain although have only one top when be seen a ought always to be seen from below turn out to have perfect eruption of false top whenever traveller be sufficiently ill advised to go out of way for purpose of ascending carrock be trumpery little mountain of fifteen hundred foot presumes to have false top even precipice a if be mont blanc matter goodchild enjoys will go on idle who be afraid of being left behind by must follow on entering edge of mist landlord stop say hope that will not get thicker be twenty year since last ascended carrock be barely possible if mist increase that party may be lost on mountain goodchild hears dreadful intimation be not in least impressed by march for top be never to be found a if be wandering jew bound to go on for ever in defiance of everything landlord faithfully accompanies two to dim eye of idle far below look in exaggerative mist like pair of friendly giant mounting step of invisible castle together up up then down little then up then along strip of level ground then up again wind wind unknown in happy valley blow keen strong rain mist get impenetrable dreary little cairn of stone appears landlord add one to heap first walking round cairn a if be about to perform incantation then dropping stone on to top of heap with gesture of magician adding ingredient to cauldron in full bubble goodchild sits down by cairn a if be study table at home idle drenched panting stand up with back to wind ascertains distinctly that be top at last look round with little curiosity be left in get in return magnificent view ofnothing effect of sublime spectacle on mind of exploring party be little injured by nature of direct conclusion to sight of pointsthe said conclusion being that mountain mist have actually gathered round a landlord feared must now becomes imperatively necessary to settle exact situation of farm house in valley at dog cart have be left before traveller attempt to descend while landlord be endeavouring to make discovery in own way mr goodchild plunge hand under wet coat draw out little red morocco case open display to view of companion neat pocket compass north be found point at farm house be situated be settled descent begin after little downward walking idle behind a usual see fellow traveller turn aside sharplytries to follow themloses in mistis shouted after waited for recoveredand then find that halt have be ordered partly on account partly for purpose of again consulting compass point in debate be settled a before between goodchild landlord expedition move on not down mountain marching straight forward round slope of difficulty of following new route be acutely felt by thomas idle find hardship of walking at greatly increased by fatigue of moving foot straight forward along side of slope when natural tendency at step be to turn off at right angle go straight down declivity let reader imagine to be walking along roof of barn instead of up down will have exact idea of pedestrian difficulty in traveller have now involved in ten minute more idle be lost in distance again be shouted for waited for recovered a before found goodchild repeating observation of compass remonstrated warmly against sideway route that companion persisted in following appeared to uninstructed mind of thomas that when three men want to get to bottom of mountain business be to walk down put view of case not only with emphasis even with irritability be answered from scientific eminence of compass on companion be mounted that there be frightful chasm somewhere near foot of carrock called black arch into traveller be sure to march in mist if risked continuing descent from place where have now halted idle received answer with silent respect be due to commander of expedition followed along roof of barn rather side of mountain reflecting upon assurance received on starting again that object of party be only to gain certain point haven attained to continue descent afterwards until foot of carrock be reached though quite unexceptionable a abstract form of expression phrase certain point have disadvantage of sounding rather vaguely when be pronounced on unknown ground under canopy of mist much thicker than london fog nevertheless after compass phrase be clue party have to hold by idle clung to extreme end of a hopefully a must more sideway walking thicker thicker mist sort of point reached except certain point third loss of idle third shout for third recovery of third consultation of compass mr goodchild draw tenderly from pocket prepares to adjust on stone something fall on turfit be glass something else drop immediately afterit be needle compass be broken exploring party be lost be practice of english portion of human race to receive great disaster in dead silence mr goodchild restored useless compass to pocket without saying word mr idle looked at landlord landlord looked at mr idle there be nothing for now to go on blindfold trust to chapter of chance accordingly lost traveller moved forward still walking round slope of mountain still desperately resolved to avoid black arch to succeed in reaching certain point quarter of hour brought to brink of ravine at bottom of there flowed muddy little stream here halt be called consultation took place landlord still clinging pertinaciously to idea of reaching point voted for crossing ravine going on round slope of mountain mr goodchild to great relief of fellow traveller took view of case backed mr idle proposal to descend carrock at once at hazardthe rather a running stream be sure guide to follow from mountain to valley accordingly party descended to rugged stony bank of stream here again thomas lost ground sadly fell far behind travelling companion not much more than six week have elapsed since have sprained one of ankle began to feel same ankle getting rather weak when found among stone be strewn about running water goodchild landlord be getting farther farther ahead of saw cross stream disappear round projection on bank heard shout moment after a signal that have halted be waiting for answering shout mended pace crossed stream where have crossed be within one step of opposite bank when foot slipped on wet stone weak ankle gave twist outwards hot rending tearing pain ran through at same moment down fell idlest of two idle apprentice crippled in instant situation be now in plain term one of absolute danger there lay mr idle writhing with pain there be mist a thick a ever there be landlord a completely lost a stranger whom be conducting there be compass broken in goodchilds pocket to leave wretched thomas on unknown ground be plainly impossible to get to walk with badly sprained ankle seemed equally out of question however goodchild brought back by cry for help bandaged ankle with pocket handkerchief assisted by landlord raised crippled apprentice to leg offered shoulder to lean on exhorted for sake of whole party to try if must walk thomas assisted by shoulder on one side stick on other did try with what pain difficulty only can imagine who have sprained ankle have have to tread on afterwards at pace adapted to feeble hobbling of newly lamed man lost party moved on perfectly ignorant whether be on right side of mountain wrong equally uncertain how long idle must be able to contend with pain in ankle before gave in altogether fell down again unable to stir step slowly more slowly a clog of crippled thomas weighed heavily more heavily on march of expedition lost traveller followed winding of stream till came to faintly marked cart track branching off nearly at right angle to left after little consultation be resolved to follow dim vestige of road in hope that might lead to farm cottage at idle must be left in safety be now getting on towards afternoon be fast becoming more than doubtful whether party delayed in progress a now be might not be overtaken by darkness before right route be found be condemned to pas night on mountain without bit drop to comfort in wet clothes cart track grew fainter fainter until be washed out altogether by little stream dark turbulent rapid landlord suggested judging by colour of water that must be flowing from one of lead mine in neighbourhood of carrock traveller accordingly kept by stream for little while in hope of possibly wandering towards help in way after walking forward about two hundred yard came upon mine indeed mine exhausted abandoned dismal ruinous place with nothing wreck of work building left to speak for here there be few sheep feeding landlord looked at earnestly thought recognised mark on themthen thought did notfinally gave up sheep in despairand walked on just a ignorant of whereabouts of party a ever march in dark literally a well a metaphorically in dark have now be continued for three quarter of hour from time when crippled apprentice have met with accident mr idle with will to conquer pain in ankle to hobble on power rapidly failing felt that ten minute at most must find at end of last physical resource have just made up mind on point be about to communicate dismal result of reflection to companion when mist suddenly brightened begun to lift straight ahead in minute landlord who be in advance proclaimed that saw tree before long other tree appearedthen cottagethen house beyond cottage familiar line of road rising behind last of carrock loomed darkly into view far away to right hand party have not only got down mountain without knowing how have wandered away from in mist without knowing whyaway far down on very moor by have approached base of carrock morning happy lifting of mist still happier discovery that traveller have groped way though by very roundabout direction to within mile so of part of valley in farm house be situated restored mr idle sinking spirit reanimated failing strength while landlord ran off to get dog cart thomas be assisted by goodchild to cottage have be first building seen when darkness brightened be propped up against garden wall like artist lay figure waiting to be forwarded until dog cart must arrive from farm house below in due timeand very long time seemed to mr idlethe rattle of wheel be heard crippled apprentice be lifted into seat a dog cart be driven back to inn landlord related anecdote have just heard at farm house of unhappy man who have be lost like two guest on carrock who have passed night there alone who have be found next morning scared starved who never went out afterwards except on way to grave mr idle heard sad story derived at least one useful impression from bad a pain in ankle be contrived to bear patiently

othera space of about six foot intervening between be of same medium size have same plain white curtain made to draw if necessary round occupied bed be bed nearest window curtain be drawn round except half curtain at bottom on side of bed farthest from window arthur saw foot of sleeping man raising scanty clothes into sharp little eminence a if be lying flat on back took candle advanced softly to draw curtainstopped half way listened for momentthen turned to landlord he very quiet sleeper said arthur yes said landlord very quiet young holliday advanced with candle looked in at man cautiously how pale be said arthur yes returned landlord pale enough isnt arthur looked closer at man bedclothes be drawn up to chin lay perfectly still over region of chest surprised vaguely startled a noticed arthur stooped down closer over stranger looked at ashy parted lip listened breathlessly for instant looked again at strangely still face motionless lip chest turned round suddenly on landlord with

inquest coming a soon a can thats a much a know about arthur held candle close to man lip flame still burnt straight up a steadily a before there be moment of silence rain pattered drearily through against pane of window if havent got nothing more to say to continued landlord suppose may go dont expect five shilling back do there bed promised clean comfortable there man warranted not to disturb quiet in world for ever if youre frightened to stop alone with thats not look out ive kept part of bargain mean to keep money im not yorkshire young gentleman ive lived long enough in part to have wit sharpened shouldnt wonder if found out way to brighten up yours next time come amongst with word landlord turned towards door laughed to softly in high satisfaction at own sharpness startled shocked a be arthur have by time sufficiently recovered to feel indignant at trick have be played on at insolent manner in landlord exulted in dont laugh said sharply till be quite sure have got laugh against shant have five shilling for nothing man ill keep bed will said landlord then wish goodnights rest with brief farewell went out shut door after good night rest word have hardly be spoken door have hardly be closed before arthur half repented hasty word have just escaped though not naturally over sensitive not wanting in courage of moral a well a physical sort presence of dead man have instantaneously chilling effect on mind when found alone in roomalone bound by own rash word to stay there till next morning older man must have thought nothing of word must have acted without reference to a calmer sense suggested arthur be too young to treat ridicule even of inferior with contempttoo young not to fear momentary humiliation of falsifying own foolish boast more than feared trial of watching out long night in same chamber with dead be few hour thought to can get away first thing in morning be looking towards occupied bed a idea passed through mind sharp angular eminence made in clothes by dead man upturned foot again caught eye advanced drew curtain purposely abstaining a did so from looking at face of corpse lest might unnerve at outset by fastening ghastly impression of on mind drew curtain very gently sighed involuntarily a closed poor fellow said almost a sadly a if have known man ah poor fellow went next to window night be black must see nothing from rain still pattered heavily against glass inferred from hearing that window be at back of house remembering that front be sheltered from weather by court building over while be still standing at windowfor even dreary rain be relief because of sound made relief also because moved have faint suggestion in consequence of life companionship in itwhile be standing at window looking vacantly into black darkness outside heard distant church clock strike ten only ten how be to pas time till house be astir next morning under other circumstance must have gone down to public house parlour must have called for grog must have laughed talked with company assembled a familiarly a if have known life very thought of whiling away time in manner be distasteful to new situation in be placed seemed to have altered to already thus far life have be common trifling prosaic surface life of prosperous young man with trouble to conquer trial to face have lost relation whom loved friend whom treasured till night what share have of immortal inheritance be divided amongst have laid dormant within till night death have not once met even in thought took few turn up down roomthen stopped noise made by boot on poorly carpeted floor jarred on ear hesitated little ended by taking boot off walking backwards forward noiselessly desire to sleep to rest have left bare thought of lying down on unoccupied bed instantly drew picture on mind of dreadful mimicry of position of dead man who be what be story of past life poor must have be must not have stopped at place a two robin innand weakened probably by long illness must hardly have died in manner in landlord have described poor ill lonelydead in strange place dead with nobody stranger to pity sad story truly on mere face of very sad story while thought be passing through mind have stopped insensibly at window close to stood foot of bed with closed curtain at first looked at absently then became conscious that eye be fixed on then perverse desire took possession of to do very thing have resolved not to do up to timeto look at dead man stretched out hand towards curtain checked in very act of undrawing turned back sharply on bed walked towards chimney piece to see what thing be placed on to try if must keep dead man out of mind in way there be pewter inkstand on chimney piece with mildewed remains of ink in bottle there be two coarse china ornament of commonest kind there be square of embossed card dirty fly blown with collection of wretched riddle printed on in sort of zig zag direction in variously coloured ink took card went away to read to table on candle be placed sitting down with back resolutely turned to curtained bed read first riddle second third in one corner of cardthen turned round impatiently to look at before must begin reading riddle printed here sound of church clock stopped eleven have got through hour of time in room with dead man once more looked at card be not easy to make out letter printed on in consequence of dimness of light landlord have left hima common tallow candle furnished with pair of heavy old fashioned steel snuffer up to time mind have be too much occupied to think of light have left wick of candle unsnuffed till have risen higher than flame have burnt into odd pent house shape at top from morsel of charred cotton fell off from time to time in little flake took up snuffer now trimmed wick light brightened directly room became le dismal again turned to riddle reading doggedly resolutely now in one corner of card now in effort however must not fix attention on pursued occupation mechanically deriving sort of impression from what be reading be a if shadow from curtained bed have got between mind gaily printed lettersa shadow that nothing must dispel at last gave up struggle threw card from impatiently took to walking softly up down room again dead man dead man hidden dead man on bed there be one persistent idea still haunting hidden be only body being there be body being there concealed be preying on mind stopped at window with doubt in once more listening to pattering rain once more looking out into black darkness still dead man darkness forced mind back upon set memory at work reviving with painfully vivid distinctness momentary impression have received from first sight of corpse before long face seemed to be hovering out in middle of darkness confronting through window with paleness whiter with dreadful dull line of light between imperfectly closed eyelid broader than have seen itwith parted lip slowly dropping farther farther away from otherwith feature growing larger moving closer till seemed to fill window to silence rain to shut out night sound of voice shouting below stair woke suddenly from dream of own distempered fancy recognised a voice of landlord shut up at twelve ben heard say im off to bed wiped away damp have gathered on forehead reasoned with for little while resolved to shake mind free of ghastly counterfeit still clung to by forcing to confront if be only for moment solemn reality without allowing instant to hesitate parted curtain at foot of bed looked through there be sad peaceful white face with awful mystery of stillness on laid back upon pillow stir change there only looked at for moment before closed curtain againbut that moment steadied calmed restored himmind bodyto returned to old occupation of walking up down room persevering in time till clock struck again twelve a sound of clock bell died away be succeeded by confused noise down stair of drinker in tap room leaving house next sound after interval of silence be caused by barring of door closing of shutter at back of inn then silence followed again be disturbed no more be alone nowabsolutely utterly alone with dead man till next morning wick of candle wanted trimming again took up snuffersbut paused suddenly on very point of using looked attentively at candlethen back over shoulder at curtained bedthen again at candle have be lighted for first time to show way up stair three part of at least be already consumed in hour must be burnt out in hourunless called at once to man who have shut up inn for fresh candlehe must be left in dark strongly a mind have be affected since have entered room unreasonable dread of encountering ridicule of exposing courage to suspicion have not altogether lost influence over even yet lingered irresolutely by table waiting till must prevail on to open door call from landing to man who have shut up inn in present hesitating frame of mind be kind of relief to gain few moment only by engaging in trifling occupation of snuffing candle hand trembled little snuffer be heavy awkward to use when closed on wick closed hair breadth too low in instant candle be out room be plunged in pitch darkness one impression absence of light immediately produced on mind be distrust of curtained beddistrust shaped into distinct idea be powerful enough in very vagueness to bind down to chair to make heart beat fast to set listening intently sound stirred in room familiar sound of rain against window louder sharper now than have heard yet still vague distrust inexpressible dread possessed kept to chair have put carpet bag on table when first entered room now took key from pocket reached out hand softly opened bag groped in for travelling writing case in knew that there be small store of match when have got one of match waited before struck on coarse wooden table listened intently again without knowing why still there be sound in room steady ceaseless rattling sound of rain lighted candle again without moment of delay on instant of burning up first object in room that eye sought for be curtained bed just before light have be put out have looked in direction have seen change disarrangement of sort in fold of closely drawn curtain when looked at bed now saw hanging over side of long white hand lay perfectly motionless midway on side of bed where curtain at head curtain at foot met nothing more be visible clinging curtain hid everything long white hand stood looking at unable to stir unable to call out feeling nothing knowing nothing faculty possessed gathered up lost in one seeing faculty how long that first panic held never must tell afterwards might have be only for moment might have be for many minute together how got to bedwhether ran to headlong whether approached slowlyhow wrought up to unclose curtain look in never have remembered never will remember to dying day be enough that did go to bed that did look inside curtain man have moved one of arm be outside clothes face be turned little on pillow eyelid be wide open changed a to position a to one of feature face be otherwise fearfully wonderfully unaltered dead paleness dead quiet be on still one glance showed arthur thisone glance before flew breathlessly to door alarmed house man whom landlord called ben be first to appear on stair in three word arthur told what have happened sent for nearest doctor who tell story be then staying with medical friend of mine in practice at doncaster taking care of patient for during absence in london for time being be nearest doctor have sent for from inn when stranger be taken ill in afternoon be not at home medical assistance be sought for elsewhere when man from two robin rang night bell be just thinking of going to bed naturally enough did not believe word of story about dead man who have come to life again however put on hat armed with one two bottle of restorative medicine ran to inn expecting to find nothing more remarkable when got there than patient in fit surprise at finding that man have spoken literal truth be almost if not quite equalled by astonishment at finding face to face with arthur holliday a soon a entered bedroom be time then for giving seeking explanation just shook hand amazedly then ordered everybody arthur out of room hurried to man on bed kitchen fire have not be long out there be plenty of hot water in boiler plenty of flannel to be have with with medicine with such help a arthur must render under direction dragged man literally out of jaw of death in le than hour from time when have be called in be alive talking in bed on have be laid out to wait for coroner inquest will naturally ask have be matter with might treat in reply to long theory plentifully sprinkled with what child call hard word prefer telling that in case cause effect must not be satisfactorily joined together by theory there be mystery in life condition of human science have not fathomed yet candidly confess to that in bringing man back to existence be morally speaking groping haphazard in dark know from testimony of doctor who attended in afternoon that vital machinery so far a action be appreciable by sens have in case unquestionably stopped be equally certain seeing that recovered that vital principle be not extinct when add that have suffered from long complicated illness that whole nervous system be utterly deranged have told really know of physical condition of dead alive patient at two robin inn when came to a phrase go be startling object to look at with colourless face sunken cheek wild black eye long black hair first question asked about when must speak made suspect have be called in to man in own profession mentioned to surmise told that be right said have come last from paris where have be attached to hospital that have lately returned to england on way to edinburgh to continue study that have be taken ill on journey that have stopped to rest recover at doncaster did not add word about name who be of course did not question on subject inquired when ceased speaking be what branch of profession intended to follow branch said bitterly will put bread into mouth of poor man at arthur who have be hitherto watching in silent curiosity burst out impetuously in usual good humoured way dear fellow everybody be dear fellow with arthur now have come to life again dont begin by being down hearted about prospect ill answer for can help to capital thing in medical lineor if cant know father can medical student looked at steadily thank said coldly then added may ask who father be he well enough known about part of country replied arthur be great manufacturer name be holliday hand be on man wrist during brief conversation instant name of holliday be pronounced felt pulse under finger flutter stop go on suddenly with bound beat afterwards for minute two at fever rate how did come here asked stranger quickly excitably passionately almost arthur related briefly what have happened from time of first taking bed at inn be indebted to mr hollidays son then for help have saved life said medical student speaking to with singular sarcasm in voice come here held out a spoke long white bony right hand with heart said arthur taking hand cordially may confess now continued laughing upon honour almost frightened out of wit stranger did not seem to listen wild black eye be fixed with look of eager interest on arthur face long bony finger kept tight hold of arthur hand young holliday on side returned gaze amazed puzzled by medical student odd language manner two face be close together looked at to amazement be suddenly impressed by sense of likeness between themnot in feature complexion solely in expression must have be strong likeness must certainly not have found out for be naturally slow at detecting resemblance between face have saved life said strange man still looking hard in arthur face still holding tightly by hand if have be own brother must not have done more for than that laid singularly strong emphasis on three word own brother change passed over face a pronounced thema change that language of mine be competent to describe hope have not done being of service to yet said arthur ill speak to father a soon a get home seem to be fond proud of father said medical student suppose in return be fond proud of of course be answered arthur laughing be there anything wonderful in isnt father fond stranger suddenly dropped young hollidays hand turned face away beg pardon said arthur hope have not unintentionally pained hope have not lost father cant well lose what have never have retorted medical student with harsh mocking laugh what have never have strange man suddenly caught arthur hand again suddenly looked once more hard in face

name father merciful law of society tell be nobody son ask father if will be father too help on in life with family name arthur looked at more puzzled than ever signed to to say nothing then laid finger again on man wrist in spite of extraordinary speech that have just made be not a have be disposed to suspect beginning to get light headed pulse by time have fallen back to quiet slow beat skin be moist cool not symptom of fever agitation about finding that neither of answered turned to began talking of extraordinary nature of case asking advice about future course of medical treatment to ought to subject said matter required careful thinking over suggested must submit certain prescription to next morning told to write at once a must most likely be leaving doncaster in morning before be up be quite useless to represent to folly danger of such proceeding a heard politely patiently held to resolution without offering reason explanation repeated to that if wished to give chance of seeing prescription must write at once hearing arthur volunteered loan of travelling writing case said have with bringing to bed shook note paper out of pocket of case forthwith in usual careless way with paper there fell out on counterpane of bed small packet of sticking plaster little water colour drawing of landscape medical student took up drawing looked at eye fell on initial neatly written in cypher in one corner started trembled pale face grew whiter than ever wild black eye turned on arthur looked through through pretty drawing said in remarkably quiet tone of voice ah done by pretty girl said arthur oh such pretty girl wish be not landscapei wish be portrait of admire very much arthur half in jest half in earnest kissed hand for answer love at first sight said putting drawing away again course of doesnt run old story shes monopolised a usual trammelled by rash engagement to poor man who be never likely to get money enough to marry be lucky heard of in time must certainly have risked declaration when gave that drawing here doctor here be pen ink paper ready for when gave that drawing gave gave repeated word slowly to suddenly closed eye momentary distortion passed across face saw one of hand clutch up bedclothes squeeze hard thought be going to be ill again begged that there might be no more talking opened eye when spoke fixed once more searchingly on arthur said slowly distinctly like like poor man may die out of way who can tell that may not give a well a drawing after before young holliday must answer turned to said in whisper now for prescription from time though spoke to arthur again never looked at more when have written prescription examined approved of then astonished by abruptly wishing good night offered to sit up with shook head arthur offered to sit up with said shortly with face turned away no insisted on having somebody left to watch gave way when found be determined said must accept service of waiter at inn thank said a rose to go have one last favour to asknot of doctor for leave to exercise professional discretionbut of mr holliday eye while spoke still rested steadily on never once turned towards arthur beg mr holliday will not mention to oneleast of to fatherthe event have occurred word have passed in room entreat to bury in memory a for might have be buried in grave can not give reason for making strange request can only implore to grant voice faltered for first time hid face on pillow arthur completely bewildered gave required pledge took young holliday away with immediately afterwards to house of friend determining to go back to inn to see medical student again before have left in morning returned to inn at eight oclock purposely abstaining from waking arthur who be sleeping off past night excitement

double bedded room of inn at doncaster what have next to add be matter for inference surmise be not strictly speaking matter of fact have to tell first that medical student turned out to be strangely unaccountably right in assuming a more than probable that arthur holliday must marry young lady who have given water colour drawing of landscape marriage took place little more than year after event occurred have just be relating young couple came to live in neighbourhood in be then established in practice be present at wedding be rather surprised to find that arthur be singularly reserved with

wandering hither thither storing mind with perpetual observation of men thing sincerely believing to be laziest creature in existence timehow did thomas idle crippled confined to house contrive to get through hour of day prone on sofa thomas made attempt to get through hour passively allowed hour to get through where other men in situation must have read book improved mind thomas slept rested body where other men must have pondered anxiously over future prospect thomas dreamed lazily of past life one solitary thing did most other people must have done in place be to resolve on making certain alteration improvement in mode of existence a soon a effect of misfortune have overtaken have passed away remembering that current of life have hitherto oozed along in one smooth stream of laziness occasionally troubled on surface by slight passing ripple of industry present idea on subject of self reform inclined himnot a reader may be disposed to imagine to project scheme for new existence of enterprise exertionbut on contrary to resolve that must never if must possibly help be active industrious again throughout whole of future career be due to mr idle to relate that mind sauntered towards peculiar conclusion on distinct logically producible ground after reviewing quite at ease with many needful interval of repose generally placid spectacle of past existence arrived at discovery that great disaster have tried patience equanimity in early life have be caused by having allowed to be deluded into imitating pernicious example of activity industry have be set by others trial to here alludes be three in number may be thus reckoned up first disaster of being unpopular thrashed boy at school secondly disaster of falling seriously ill thirdly disaster of becoming acquainted with great bore first disaster occurred after thomas have be idle popular boy at school for happy year one christmas time be stimulated by evil example of companion whom have always trusted liked to be untrue to to try for prize at ensuing half yearly examination did try got prizehow did not distinctly know at moment can not remember now sooner however have bookmoral hint to young on value of timebeen placed in hand than first trouble of life began idle boy deserted a traitor to cause industrious boy avoided a dangerous interloper one of number who have always won prize on previous occasion expressing just resentment at invasion of privilege by calling thomas into play ground then there administering to first sound genuine thrashing that have ever received in life unpopular from moment a beaten boy who belonged to side be rejected by party young idle soon lost caste with master a have previously lost caste with schoolfellow have forfeited comfortable reputation of being one lazy member of youthful community whom be quite hopeless to punish never again did hear headmaster say reproachfully to industrious boy who have committed fault might have expected in thomas idle be inexcusable sir in who know better never more after winning that fatal prize did escape retributive imposition avenging birch from time master made work boy must not let play from time social position steadily declined life at school became perpetual burden to so again with second disaster while thomas be lazy be model of health first attempt at active exertion first suffering from severe illness be connected together by intimate relation of cause effect shortly after leaving school accompanied party of friend to cricket field in natural appropriate character of spectator only on ground be discovered that player fell short of required number facile thomas be persuaded to assist in making up complement at certain appointed time be roused from peaceful slumber in dry ditch placed before three wicket with bat in hand opposite to behind three more wicket stood one of bosom friend filling situation a be informed of bowler word can describe mr idle horror amazement when saw young manon ordinary occasion meekest mildest of human beingssuddenly contract eye brow compress lip assume aspect of infuriated savage run back few step then run forward without slightest previous provocation hurl detestably hard ball with might straight at thomas leg stimulated to preternatural activity of body sharpness of eye by instinct of self preservation mr idle contrived by jumping deftly aside at right moment by using bat ridiculously narrow a be for purpose a shield to preserve life limb from dastardly attack have be made on to leave full force of deadly missile to strike wicket instead of leg to end inning so far a side be concerned by being immediately bowled out grateful for escape be about to return to dry ditch when be peremptorily stopped told that other side be going in that be expected to field conception of whole art mystery of fielding may be summed up in three word of serious advice privately administered to on that trying occasionavoid ball fortified by sound salutary principle took own course impervious alike to ridicule abuse whenever ball came near thought of shin got out of way immediately catch stop pitch up be cry passed by like idle wind that regarded not ducked under jumped over whisked away from on side never once through whole inning did ball come together on anything approaching to intimate term unnatural activity of body be necessarily called forth for accomplishment of result threw thomas idle for first time in life into perspiration perspiration in consequence of want of practice in management of particular result of bodily activity be suddenly checked inevitable chill succeeded that in turn be followed by fever for first time since birth mr idle found confined to bed for many week together wasted worn by long illness of own disastrous muscular exertion have be sole first cause third occasion on thomas found reason to reproach bitterly for mistake of having attempted to be industrious be connected with choice of calling in life having interest in church appropriately selected next best profession for lazy man in englandthe bar although benchers of inn of court have lately abandoned good old principle oblige student to make show of studying in mr idle time such innovation a existed young men who aspired to honourable title of barrister be very properly not asked to learn anything of law be merely required to eat certain number of dinner at table of hall to pay certain sum of money be called to bar a soon a must prove that have sufficiently complied with extremely sensible regulation never did thomas move more harmoniously in concert with elder better than when be qualifying for admission among barrister of native country never did feel more deeply what real laziness be in serene majesty of nature than on memorable day when be called to bar after having carefully abstained from opening law book during period of probation except to fall asleep over how must ever again have become industrious even for shortest period after great reward conferred upon idleness quite pass comprehension kind benchers did everything must to show folly of exerting wrote out probationary exercise for never expected even to take trouble of reading through when be written invited with seven other choice spirit a lazy a to come be called to bar while be sitting over wine fruit after dinner put oath of allegiance dreadful official denunciation of pope pretender so gently into mouth that hardly knew how word got there wheeled chair softly round from table sat surveying young barrister with back to bottle rather than stand up adjourn to hear exercise read when mr idle seven unlabouring neophyte ranged in order a class with back considerately placed against screen have begun in rotation to read exercise have not written even then bencher true to great lazy principle of whole proceeding stopped neophyte before have stammered through first line bowed to told politely that be barrister from moment be ceremony be followed by social supper by presentation in accordance with ancient custom of pound of sweetmeat bottle of madeira offered in way of needful refreshment by grateful neophyte to beneficent bencher may seem inconceivable that thomas must ever have forgotten great hing principle instilled by such ceremony a be nevertheless true that certain designing student of industrious habit found out took advantage of easy humour persuaded that be discreditable to be barrister to know nothing about law lured by force of own evil example into conveyancer chamber to make up for lost time to qualify for practice at bar after fortnight of self delusion curtain fell from eye resumed natural character shut up book retribution have hitherto always followed little casual error of industry followed still must get away from conveyancer chamber must not get away from one of pupil who have taken fancy to hima tall serious raw boned hard working disputatious pupil with idea of own about reforming law of real property who have be scourge of mr idle existence ever since fatal day when fell into mistake of attempting to study law before time friend be sociable idler like since time burden of bearing with hard working young man have become part of lot in life go where will now can never feel certain that raw boned pupil be not affectionately waiting for round corner to tell little more about law of real property suffer a may under infliction can never complain for must always remember with unavailing regret that have own thoughtless industry to thank for first exposing to great social calamity of knowing bore event of past life with significant result that brought about pas drowsily through thomas idle memory while lie alone on sofa at allonby elsewhere dreaming away time fellow apprentice get through so actively out of door remembering lesson of laziness past disaster teach bearing in mind also fact that be crippled in one leg because exerted to go up mountain when ought to have known that proper course of conduct be to stop at bottom of hold now will for future firmly continue to hold by new resolution never to be industrious again on pretence for rest of life physical result of accident have be related in previous chapter moral result now stand on record with enumeration of that part of present narrative be occupied by episode of sprained ankle may now perhaps be considered in aspect a finished complete how do propose that get through present afternoon evening demanded thomas idle after two three hour of foregoing reflection at allonby mr goodchild
