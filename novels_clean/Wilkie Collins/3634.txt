now remember voice once so musical in ear that be able to repeat easy unaffected talk once interested that see again in thought perfect charm of manner delighted everybody not forgetting unworthy self might say for be only young man honored by introduction to lady lena who stopped at admiration never made use of opportunity to approach love on other hand distinctly recollect what stepmother said to other when guest have wished good night if be asked to account for can only reply that conspiracy to lead into proposing marriage to lady lena first showed on occasion to have referred in eagerness to
