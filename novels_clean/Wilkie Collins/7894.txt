amelius obeyed window have be opened for few inch at top doubt to ventilate room dull view of courtyard be varied by stable at farther end by kitchen skylight rising in middle of open space a amelius looked out observed that person at moment in kitchen required apparently large supply of fresh air swinging window on side of skylight be nearest to be invisibly noiselessly pulled open from below similar window on other side being already wide open also judging by appearance inhabitant of kitchen possessed merit be exceedingly rare among domestic servant understood law of ventilation appreciated blessing of fresh air will do said mr farnaby can turn round now amelius turned mr farnaby boot stocking be on hearthrug one of mr farnaby foot be placed ready for inspection on chair have just left look at right foot first said speaking gravely composedly in ordinary tone be well worth looking at foot equally beautiful in form in colour instep arched high ankle at once delicate strong

may not be in future stopped a if to give opportunity of speaking man willow flippant by nature might have seen disclosure in grotesque aspect amelius be sad silent like better better went on be not like common run of men nine out of ten of must have turned what have just told into joke nine out of ten must have said 'be to ask girl meet to show left foot be above that understand have mean of recognizing own child now smiled took foot off chair then after moment thought pointed to again keep a strictly secret a keep everything else said in past day when used to employ people privately to help to find be only defence against being imposed upon rogue vagabond thought of other mark sign not one of must guess at mark a have got pocket book amelius in case be separated at later time want

never have day illness in life suppose be dead killed perhaps by accident perhaps by own hand lawyer have written instruction in case of child being found then again be such unaccountable woman may go away somewhere by never mind lawyer will have address positive order though keep secret from world besides to tell to ask pardon amelius for troubling chance be so terribly against be impossible that will ever see a saw in dream coming into room leading girl by hand odd be be how veer about between hope despair well may amuse to remember one of day year hence when be at rest in earth when be middle aged married man may tell wife how strangely once became forlorn hope of most wretched woman that ever lived may say to other a sit by snug fireside 'perhaps that poor lost daughter be still living somewhere wondering who mother be ' wo let see tear in eye again will let go at last led way to door creature to be pitied if ever there be pitiable creature yet woman whose whole nature be

cap found out in spite of go tell niece be right be stupid enough to fall in love with girl who have love to give in return pushed amelius into hall here be regina called out have done with before amelius must speak have shut into room advanced along hall met regina at door of dining room chapter young lady spoke first mr goldenheart said with coldest possible politeness perhaps will be good enough to explain what mean turned back into dining room amelius followed in silence here be in scrape with woman thought to be men in general a unlucky a be wonder need close door said regina maliciously everybody in house be welcome to hear what have to say to amelius made mistake at outset tried what little humility must do to help there be probably instance on record in humility on part of man have ever really found way to indulgence of irritated woman best worst of alike have at least one virtue in common secretly despise man who be not bold enough to defend when be angry with hope have not offended amelius ventured to say tossed head contemptuously oh dear be not offended only little surprised at being so very ready to oblige aunt in short experience of have fallen to lot of amelius have never looked so charmingly a looked now nervous irritability under be suffering brightened face with animation be wanting in at ordinary time soft brown eye sparkled smooth dusky cheek glowed with warm red flush tall supple figure asserted full dignity robed in superb dress of silken purple black lace set off personal attraction to utmost advantage not only roused admiration of amelius unconsciously gave back self possession have for moment completely lost be man enough to feel humiliation of being despised by one woman in world whose love longed to win answered with sudden firmness of tone look startled have better speak more plainly still miss regina said may a well blame at once for misfortune of being man drew back step understand answered do owe forbearance to woman who asks favour of amelius went on if man have asked to steal into house on tiptoe must have said well must have said something have better not repeat if man have stood between door when came back must have taken by collar pulled out of way must do that if please with mr farnaby regina saw weak point of defence with woman quickness of perception ca offer opinion said especially when lay blame on aunt amelius opened lip to protest thought better of wisely went straight on with what have still to say if will let finish resumed will understand little better than blame there may be miss regina be quite ready to take on merely wanted to remind be put in awkward position must civilly find way out of a for aunt will only say know of hardly sacrifice must not submit to if must be of smallest service to after what heard while be in room regina interrupted at point suppose be secret between said yes be secret amelius proceeded a say one thing may tell without breaking promise mr farnaby have well have filled with kindly feeling towards have claim poor soul to truest sympathy will remember claim will be faithful to what feel towards a long a live be not very elegantly expressed tone be tone of true feeling in voice trembled colour rose stood before speaking with perfect simplicity straight from heart woman heart felt instantly be man whose ridicule have dreaded if aunt rash confidence struck in absurd light sat down in silence with grave sad face reproaching for wrong too ready distrust have inflicted on longing to ask pardon yet hesitating to say simple word approached chair placing hand on back of said gently do think little better of now have taken off glove silently folded refolded in lap good opinion be very precious to amelius pleaded bending little nearer to ca tell how sorry must be stopped put more strongly will never have courage enough to enter house again if have made think meanly of woman who cared nothing for must have easily answered calm heart of regina began to flutter something warned not to trust to speak little a suspected amelius have troubled tranquil temperament of woman have found way to secret reserve of tenderness placid deep of be hardly conscious until influence have enlightened be afraid to look up at eye must have told truth lifted long finely shaped dusky hand offered to a best answer that must make amelius took looked at ventured on first familiarity with kissed only said very faintly queen must let kiss hand if went to court amelius reminded with pleasant inner conviction of wonderful readiness at finding excuse smiled in spite of must queen let hold asked gently releasing hand looking at a drew away peace be made without word of explanation amelius took chair at side be quite happy now have forgiven said know how admire how anxious be to please if only knew how drew chair little nearer eye told plainly that language must soon become warmer still if gave smallest encouragement be one reason for changing subject there be reason more cogent still first painful sense of having treated unjustly have ceased to make keenly felt lower emotion have opportunity of asserting curiosity irresistible curiosity took possession of mind urged to penetrate mystery of interview between amelius aunt will think very indiscreet began slyly if made little confession to amelius be only too eager to hear confession must pave way for something of same sort on part understand aunt making heat in concert room pretence for taking away with regina proceeded what astonishes be that must have admitted to confidence after so short acquaintance be still what will say be still new friend of ours how long will be before old friend amelius asked added with artful emphasis old friend of yours confused by question regina passed over without notice be mr farnaby adopted daughter resumed have be with since be little girl yet have never told of secret pray suppose that be tempting to break faith with aunt be quite incapable of such conduct a amelius saw way to thoroughly commonplace compliment possessed charm of complete novelty so far a experience be concerned must actually have told that be incapable of doing anything be not perfectly becoming to charming person if have only given time be too eager in pursuit of own object to give time must like to know went on whether aunt have be influenced in way by dream that have about amelius started have told of dream asked with appearance of alarm regina blushed hesitated room be next to aunt explained keep door between open be often in out when be disturbed in sleep be talking in sleep heard name nothing more perhaps ought not to have mentioned perhaps ought not to expect to answer there be harm in answering said amelius dream really have something to do with trusting may not think quite so unfavourably of conduct now know that doe matter what think regina replied constrainedly if aunt secret have interested what right have to object be sure will say nothing though be not in aunt confidence in confidence will find can keep secret folded up glove for twentieth time at least gave amelius opportunity of retiring by rising from chair made last effort to recover ground that have lost without betraying mr farnaby trust in be sure can keep secret said must like to give one of secret to keep only must take liberty suppose just yet new perfectly well what wanted to say heart began to quicken beat be at loss how to answer after awkward silence made attempt to dismiss let detain said if have engagement amelius silently looked round for hat on table behind monthly magazine lay open exhibiting one of melancholy modern illustration present english art of day in laziest lowest state of degradation vacuous young giant in flowing trouser stood in garden stared at plump young giantess with enormous eye rotund hip vacantly boring hole in grass with point of parasol perfectly incapable of explaining imbecile production put trust in printer whose charitable type helped at bottom of page with title of love at first sight on remarkable word amelius seized with desperation of drowning man catching at proverbial straw offered chance of pleading cause time with happy indirectness of allusion at not even young lady susceptibility must take offence do believe in said pointing to illustration regina declined to understand in what asked in love at first sight must be speaking with inexcusable rudeness to say plainly that told lie let milder form of expression be that modestly concealed truth know anything about said do amelius remarked smartly persisted in looking at illustration be there infection of imbecility in fatal work be too simple to understand even yet do what inquired innocently know what love at first sight be amelius burst out regina turned over leaf of magazine ah said have read story have read story amelius answered know what felt on being introduced to young lady looked up at with sly smile young lady in america asked in england miss regina tried to take hand kept out of reach in london went on drifting back into customary plainness of speech in very street resumed seizing hand before be aware of too much bewildered to know what else to do regina took refuge desperately in shaking hand with goodbye mr goldenheart said gave dismissal for second time amelius submitted to fate there be something in eye warned that have ventured far enough for day may call again soon asked piteously no answered voice at door recognized voice of mr farnaby yes regina whispered to a aunt entered room

heard in mr farnaby room amelius must not doubt that motive of pacifying wife be motive have first led farnaby to receive regina into house be unreasonable unjust to infer that orphan child must have be mainly indebted to mr farnaby sense of duty to memory of sister for parental protection afforded to from time forth must have be useless worse than useless to place before regina such consideration

in london to watch new experiment have made careful inquiry into frenchman character have found that complaint of temper really amounted to that gave air of gentleman did understand joke on question of honesty sobriety testimony of proprietor of hotel left rufus nothing to desire greatly to surprise amelius showed disposition to grow weary of quiet life to take refuge in perilous amusement from sober society of book be regular in inquiry at mr farnaby house took long walk by never mentioned sally name lost interest in going to theatre never appeared in smoking room of club men observing

tact in spite of popular delusion to contrary be so much more common in woman than in men uncle be so particular about packing linen said nobody can please must ask to let run upstairs again amelius went out into street with head down lip fast closed be not far from mr payson house why must call thought to conscience added hear news of sally there be good news girl be brightening mentally physically be in fair way if only remained in home to be simple sally no longer amelius asked if have got photograph of cottage mr payson laughed sleep with under pillow poor child said look at fifty time day thirty year since with infinitely le experience to guide worthy matron must have followed instinct must have hesitated to tell amelius quite so much about photograph of woman finer sensibility do get blunted with advance of age accumulation of wisdom instead of pursuing subject of sally progress amelius to mr payson surprise made clumsy excuse abruptly took leave felt need of being alone be conscious of vague distrust of degraded in own estimation be like character have read of in book victim of fatality slightest circumstance conspired to heighten interest in sally just at time when regina have once more disappointed be a firmly convinced a if have be strictest moralist living that be insult to regina insult to own self respect to set lost creature whom have rescued in light of comparison with young lady who be one day to be wife yet try a might to drive out sally kept place in thought there be apparently innate depravity in if looking glass have be handed to at

messenger with instruction to wait for answer be not without doubt even pain that have opened communication with man whose harsh treatment of father be impossible for to forget what must son expect there be one hope time might have inclined younger brother to make atonement to memory of elder by favourable reception of nephew request father last word of caution own boyish promise not to claim kindred with relation in england be vividly present to mind of amelius while waited for return of messenger one justification be in motif animated circumstance father have never anticipated rendered act of duty towards to make trial at least of what family interest must do for there must be sort of doubt that man of mr farnaby character must yield if amelius must announce that have promise of appointment under government with powerful influence of near relation to accelerate promotion sat idly drawing line on blotting paper at one moment regretting that have sent letter at comforting in belief that if father have be living to advise father must have approved of course that have taken messenger returned with line of reply under ordinary circumstance must have used influence to help on

of police few frail black ash scattered thinly on kitchen floor be only relic left of ill gotten money after inquiry patiently pursued in more than one direction failed to throw light on mystery of jervy death morcross report to amelius towards close of investigation be little more than ingenious guess work seems pretty clear sir in first place that mother sowler must have overtaken wall eye after have left letter at mr farnaby lodging in second place be justified a will show directly in assuming that told of money in jervy possession that two succeeded in discovering jervy doubt through wall eye superior knowledge of master movement evidence concerning bank note prof know by examination of people at dairy that wall eye took from pocket handful of note when refused to send for liquor without having money first be also informed that breaking out of drink madness in mother sowler showed in snatching note out of hand trying to strangle before ran down into kitchen bolted in lastly mr farnaby banker have identified note saved from burning a one of forty five pound note paid to cheque so much for tracing of money wish must give equally satisfactory account of tracing of crime can make nothing of wall eye declares that did even know jervy be dead till told swears found money dropped in street be needle to say that last assertion be lie opinion be divided among a to whether be answerable for murder a well a robbery whether there be third person concerned in own belief be that jervy be drugged by old woman with young woman very likely used a decoy in house by riverside then murdered by wall eye in cold blood have done best to clear matter up have not succeeded doctor give hope of assistance from mother sowler if get over attack be doubtful say will die to certainty of liver disease in short own fear be that will prove to be one more of murder be mystery to police a well a public report of case excited interest published in newspaper in conspicuous type meddlesome reader wrote letter offering complacently stupid suggestion to police after while crime attracted general attention murder of jervy disappeared from public memory among other forgotten murder of

absolutely realizing by mysterious process of association be unable to follow saying of wise elder brother at tadmor revived in memory while be trying to see way through difficulty beset will meet with many temptation amelius when leave community old man have said at parting most of will come to through woman be especially on guard son if meet with woman who make feel truly sorry for be on high road to passion through open door of sympathy more certainly if be not aware of amelius felt truth expressed in word a have never felt yet there have be sign of changing nature in sally for little time past have expressed too delicately to attract attention of man unprepared to be on watch only on morning have be marked enough to force on notice only on morning have looked at spoken to a have never looked spoken before began dimly to see danger for of to have shut eye thus far where be remedy what ought to do question came naturally into mind yet mind shrank from pursuing got up impatiently busied in putting away lesson book small duty hitherto always left to toff be useless mind dwelt persistently on sally while moved about room still saw look in eye still heard tone of voice when spoke of young lady in park word of good physician whom have consulted about recurred to memory now natural growth of sens have be stunted like natural growth of body by starvation terror exposure to cold other influence inherent in life that have led then doctor have spoken of nourishing food pure air careful treatment of life in short have led at cottage have predicted that must develop into intelligent healthy young woman again asked what ought to do turned aside to window looked out idea occurred to how must be if summoned courage enough to tell that be engaged to be married setting aside natural dread of shock that might inflict on poor grateful girl who have only known happiness under care detestable obstacle of mr farnaby stood immovably in way sally must be sure to ask question about engagement must never rest until be answered have be necessarily impossible to conceal mother name from discovery of father if heard of regina regina uncle must be simply question of time what might such man be not capable of doing what new act of treachery might not commit if found claimed by daughter whom have deserted even if expression of mr farnaby last wish have not be sacred to amelius consideration alone must have kept silent for sally sake now doubted for first time if have calculated wisely in planning to trust sally sad story after marriage to sympathy of wife jealousy that might naturally feel of young girl who be object of interest to husband did not present worst difficulty to contend with believed in uncle integrity a believed in religion what must say what must do if innocent witness to farnaby infamy be presented to if amelius asked protection for sally own father have refused to in infancy if said a must say uncle be man yet what prospect must see prospect of making disclosure when looked to own interest next thought of wedding day again sinister figure of farnaby confronted how must receive wretch whom regina must innocently welcome to house there must be no longer choice left must be duty to to tell wife terrible truth what must be result recalled whole course of courtship saw farnaby always on level with in regina estimation in spite of natural cheerfulness in spite of inbred courage heart failed when thought of time to come a turned away from window sally door opened joined ready for walk spirit have rallied assisted by cheering influence of dressing to go out charming smile brightened face in sheer desperation reckless of what did said amelius held out hand to welcome be right sally cried look pleased pretty dear let be happy while can let future take care of chapter capricious influence combine to make happy be never so certain to be absent influence a when be foolish enough to talk about amelius

tailor hosier can do for rich old man who wish to present juvenile appearance while be buying young wife le than three clergyman be present conducting sale demeanour of rich congregation be worthy of glorious bygone day of golden calf so far a must be judged by appearance one old lady in pew close to place at amelius sally be standing seemed to be only person present who be not favourably impressed by ceremony call disgraceful old lady remarked to charming young person seated next to charming young person being legitimate product of present time have more sympathy with question of sentiment than hottentot how can talk so grandmamma rejoined have twenty thousand year that lucky girl will be mistress of most splendid house in care old lady persisted be not le disgrace to everybody concerned in there be many poor friendless creature driven by hunger to street who have better claim to sympathy than shameless girl selling in house of god will wait for in carriage wo see
