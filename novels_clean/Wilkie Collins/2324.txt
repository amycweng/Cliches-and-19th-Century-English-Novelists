worthy creature merely ask if be satisfied now how can be anything else said answering for trottle who sat obstinately silent time jarber have not only read delightfully amusing story have also answered question about house of course stand empty now who must think of taking after have be turned into caravan looked at trottle a said last word jarber waved hand indulgently in same direction let excellent person speak said jarber be about to say good man only wished to ask sir said trottle doggedly if must kindly oblige with date two in connection with last story date repeated jarber doe man want with date must be glad to know with great respect persisted trottle if person named magsman be last tenant who lived in house opinionif may be excused for giving itthat most decidedly be not with word trottle made low bow quietly left room there be denying that jarber when be left together looked sadly discomposed have evidently forgotten to inquire about date in spite of magnificent talk about series of discovery be quite a plain that two story have just read have really truly exhausted present stock thought bound in common gratitude to help out of embarrassment by timely suggestion so proposed that must come to tea again on next monday evening thirteenth must make such inquiry in meantime a might enable to dispose triumphantly of trottles objection gallantly kissed hand made neat little speech of acknowledgment took leave for rest of week must not encourage trottle by allowing to refer to house at suspected be making own inquiry about date put question to on monday evening thirteenth that dear unfortunate jarber came punctual to appointed time looked so terribly harassed that be really quite spectacle of feebleness fatigue saw at glance that question of date have gone against that mr magsman have not be last tenant of house that reason of emptiness be still to seek what have gone through said jarber word be not eloquent enough to tell o sophonisba have begun series of discovery accept last two a story laid on shrine wait to blame for leaving curiosity unappeased until have heard number three number three looked like very short manuscript said a much jarber explained to that be to have poetry time in course of investigation have stepped into circulating library to seek for information on one important subject library people knew about house be that female relative of last tenant a believed have just after tenant left sent little manuscript poem to described a referring to event have actually passed in house wanted proprietor of library to publish have written no address on letter proprietor have kept manuscript ready to be given back to publishing of poem not being in line when might call for have never called for poem have be lent to jarber at express request to read to before began rang bell for trottle being determined to have present at new reading a wholesome check on obstinacy to surprise peggy answered bell told that trottle

wait for bertha earnest noble part meanwhile god be with god own true heart must warmly sincerely praise little poem when jarber have done reading must not say that tended in degree towards clearing up mystery of empty house whether be absence of irritating influence of trottle whether be simply fatigue can not say jarber did not strike evening a being in usual spirit though declared that be not in least daunted by want of success thus far that be resolutely determined to make more discovery spoke in languid absent manner shortly afterwards took leave at rather early hour when trottle came back when indignantly taxed with philandering not only denied imputation asserted that have be employed on service in consideration of boldly asked for leave of absence for two day for morning to afterwards to complete business in solemnly declared be interested in remembrance of long faithful service to did violence to myself granted request on side engaged to explain to satisfaction in week time on monday evening twentieth day two before sent to jarbers lodging to ask to drop in to tea landlady sent back apology for that made hair stand on end foot be in hot water head be in flannel petticoat green shade be over eye rheumatism be in leg mustard poultice be on chest be also little feverish rather distracted in mind about manchester marriage dwarf three evening evening partieshis landlady be not sure whichin empty house with water rate unpaid under distressing circumstance be necessarily left alone with trottle promised explanation began like jarbers discovery with reading of written paper only difference be that trottle introduced manuscript under name of report trottles report curious event related in page must many of most likely never have happened if person named trottle have not presumed contrary to usual custom to think for subject on person in question have ventured for first time in life to form opinion purely entirely own be one have already excited interest of respected mistress in very extraordinary degree to put in plainer term still subject be other than mystery of empty house feeling sort of objection to set success of own if possible side by side with failure of mr jarbers trottle made up mind one monday evening to try what must do on own account towards clearing up mystery of empty house carefully dismissing from mind nonsensical notion of former tenant history keeping one point in view steadily before started to reach in shortest way by walking straight up to house bringing face to face with first person in who opened door to be getting towards dark on monday evening thirteenth of month when trottle first set foot on step of house when knocked at door knew nothing of matter be about to investigate except that landlord be elderly widower of good fortune that name be forley small beginning enough for man to start from certainly on dropping knocker first proceeding be to look down cautiously out of corner of right eye for result might show at kitchen window there appeared at immediately figure of woman who looked up inquisitively at stranger on step left window in hurry came back to with open letter in hand held up to fading light after looking over letter hastily for moment so woman disappeared once more trottle next heard footstep shuffling scraping along bare hall of house on sudden ceased sound of two voicesa shrill persuading voice gruff resisting voiceconfusedly reached ear after while voice left off speakinga chain be undone bolt drawn backthe door openedand trottle stood face to face with two person woman in advance man behind leaning back flat against wall wish good evening sir say woman in such sudden way in such cracked voice that be quite startling to hear chilly aint sir please to walk in come from good mr forley dont sir dont sir chime in man hoarsely making sort of gruff echo of chuckling after a if thought have made joke if trottle have said no door must have be probably

be carefully chained up bolted behind on entrance there be not least chance of being able to open to effect escape without betraying by making noise not being of jarber sort luckily for took situation quietly a found turned time while alone to account by summing up in own mind few particular have discovered thus far have found out first that mr forley be in habit of visiting house regularly second mr forley being prevented by illness from seeing people put in charge a usual have appointed friend to represent have written to say so third that friend have choice of two monday at particular time in evening for doing errand trottle have accidentally hit on time on first of monday for beginning own investigation fourth that similarity between trottles black dress a servant out of livery dress of messenger whoever might be have helped error by trottle be profiting so far so good be messenger errand what chance be there that might not come up knock at door from minute to minute on very evening while trottle be turning over last consideration in mind heard shuffling footstep come up stair again with flash of candle light going before waited for woman coming in with little anxiety for twilight have be too dim on getting into house to allow to see either face man face at clearly woman came in first with man called benjamin at heel set candle on mantel piece trottle take leave to describe a offensively cheerful old woman awfully lean wiry sharp over at eye nose chindevilishly brisk smiling restless with dirty false front dirty black cap short fidgetty arm long hooked finger nailsan unnaturally lusty old woman who walked with spring in wicked old foot spoke with smirk on wicked old facethe sort of old woman a trottle think who ought to have lived in dark age be ducked in horse pond instead of flourishing in nineteenth century taking charge of christian house youll please to excuse son benjamin wont sir say witch without broomstick pointing to man behind propped against bare wall of dining room exactly a have be propped against bare wall of passage he got inside dreadful bad again have son benjamin wont go to bed will follow about house up stair downstairs in lady chamber a song say know indisgestion poor dear that sour temper make so agravatingand indisgestion be wearing thing to best of aint sir aint sir chime in agravating benjamin winking at candle light like owl at sunshine trottle examined man curiously while horrid old mother be speaking of found son benjamin to be little lean buttoned up slovenly in frowsy old great coat fell down to ragged carpet slipper eye be very watery cheek very pale lip very red breathing be so uncommonly loud that sounded almost like snore head rolled helplessly in monstrous big collar of great coat limp lazy hand pottered about wall on side of a if be groping for imaginary bottle in plain english complaint of son benjamin be drunkenness of stupid pig headed sottish kind drawing conclusion easily enough after moment observation of man trottle found nevertheless keeping eye fixed much longer than be necessary on ugly drunken face rolling about in monstrous big coat collar looking at with curiosity that must hardly account for at first be there something familiar to in man feature turned away from for instant then turned back to again after second look notion forced into mind that have certainly seen face somewhere of sot face appeared like kind of slovenly copy where think to where did last see man whom agravating benjamin here so very strongly reminds of be time just thenwith cheerful old woman eye searching over cheerful old woman tongue talking at nineteen to dozenfor trottle to be ransacking memory for small matter have got into wrong corner of put by in mind very curious circumstance respecting benjamin face to be taken up again when fit opportunity offered kept wit about in prime order for present necessity wouldnt like to go down into kitchen must say witch without broomstick a familiar a if have be trottles mother instead of benjamin there bit of fire in grate sink in back kitchen dont smell to matter much to day uncommon chilly up here when person flesh dont hardly cover person bone dont look cold sir do then why lord bless soul little bit of business be so very very little hardly worth while to go downstairs about after quite game at business aint sir give take thats what call itgive take with wicked old eye settled hungrily on region round about trottles waistcoat pocket began to chuckle like son holding out one of skinny hand tapping cheerfully in palm with knuckle of other agravating benjamin seeing what be about roused up little chuckled tapped in imitation of got idea of own into muddled head of sudden bolted out charitably for benefit of trottle say say benjamin settling against wall nodding head viciously at cheerful old mother say look out shell skin assisted by sign warning trottle found difficulty in understanding that business referred to be giving taking of money that be expected to be giver be at stage of proceeding that first felt decidedly uncomfortable more than half inclined to wish be on street side of house door again be still cudgelling brain for excuse to save pocket when silence be suddenly interrupted by sound in upper part of house be not at loudit be quiet still scraping soundso faint that must hardly have reached quickest ear except in empty house do hear that benjamin say old woman he at again even in dark aint praps like to see sir say turning on trottle poking grinning face close to only name only say if youd like to see before do little bit of businessand ill show good forleys friend up stair just a if be good mr forley leg be right benjamin may be get younger younger stronger stronger jollier jollier daythats what do dont mind stair on account sir if youd like to see trottle wondered whether meant man boy domestic animal of male specie meant here be chance of putting off uncomfortable give take business better still chance perhaps of finding out one of secret of mysterious house trottles spirit began to rise again said yes directly with confidence of man who knew about benjamin took candle at once lighted trottle briskly to stair benjamin tried to follow a usual getting up several flight of stair even helped by bannister be more with particular complaint than seemed to feel inclined to venture on sat down obstinately on lowest step with head against wall tail of big great coat spreading out magnificently on stair behind above like dirty imitation of court lady train dont sit there dear say affectionate mother stopping to snuff candle on first landing will sit here say benjamin agravating to last till milk come in morning cheerful old woman went on nimbly up stair to first floor trottle followed with eye ear wide open have seen nothing out of common in front parlour up staircase so far house be dirty dreary close smellingbut there be nothing about to excite least curiosity except faint scraping sound be now beginning to get little clearerthough still not at loudas trottle followed leader up stair to second floor nothing on second floor landing cobweb above bit of broken plaster below cracked off from ceiling benjamin mother be not bit out of breath looked ready to go to top of monument if necessary faint scraping sound have got little clearer still trottle be nearer to guessing what might be than when first heard in parlour downstairs on third last floor there be two door one be shut leading into front garret one be ajar leading into back garret there be loft in ceiling above landing cobweb over vouched sufficiently for not having be opened for little time scraping noise plainer than ever here sounded on other side of back garret door to trottles great relief be precisely door cheerful old woman now pushed open trottle followed in for once in life at rate be struck dumb with amazement at sight inside of room revealed to garret be absolutely empty of everything in shape of furniture must have be used at one time other by somebody engaged in profession trade required for practice of great deal of light for one window in room looked out on wide open space at back of house be three four time a large way a garret window usually be close under window kneeling on bare board with face to door there appeared of creature in world to see alone at place at time mere mite of childa little lonely wizen strangely clad boy who must not at most have be more than five year old have greasy old blue shawl crossed over breast rolled up to keep end from ground into great big lump on back strip of something looked like remains of woman flannel petticoat showed under shawl below again pair of rusty black stocking world too large for covered leg shoeless foot pair of old clumsy muffetees have worked up on little frail red arm to elbow big cotton nightcap have dropped down to very eyebrow finished off strange dress poor little man seemed not half big enough to fill out not near strong enough to walk about in there be something to see even more extraordinary than clothes child be swaddled up in be game be playing at by moreover explained in most unexpected manner faint scraping noise have found way down stair through half opened door in silence of empty house have be mentioned that child be on knee in garret when trottle first saw be not saying prayer not crouching down in terror at being alone in dark be odd unaccountable a may appear doing nothing more le than playing at charwoman housemaid business of scouring floor little hand have tight hold of mangy old blacking brush with hardly bristle left in be rubbing backwards forward on board a gravely steadily a if have be at scouring work for year have got large family to keep by coming in of trottle old woman did not startle disturb in least just looked up for minute at candle with pair of very bright sharp eye then went on with work again a if nothing have happened on one side of be battered pint saucepan without handle be make believe pail on other morsel of slate coloured cotton rag stood for flannel to wipe up with after scrubbing bravely for minute two took bit of rag mopped up then squeezed make believe water out into make believe pail a grave a judge that ever sat on bench by time thought have got floor pretty dry raised upright on knee blew out good long breath set little red arm akimbo nodded at trottle there say child knitting little downy eyebrow into frown drat dirt ive cleaned up wheres beer benjamin mother chuckled till trottle thought must have choked lord have mercy on say just hear imp must never think be only five year old must sir please to tell good mr forley saw going on a nicely a ever playing at being scouring parlour floor calling for beer afterwards thats regular game morning noon nighthes never tired of only look how snug weve be dressed thats shawl keepin precious little body warm benjamin nightcap keepin precious little head warm benjamin stocking drawed over trowsers keepin precious little leg warm he snug happy if ever imp be yet wheres beersay again little dear say again if trottle have seen boy with light fire in room clothed like other child playing naturally with top box of soldier bouncing big india rubber ball might have be a cheerful under circumstance a benjamin mother seeing child reduced a must not help suspecting for want of proper toy proper child company to take up with mocking of old woman at scouring work for something to stand in place of game trottle though not family man nevertheless felt sight before to be in way one of saddest most pitiable that have ever witnessed why man say youre boldest little chap in england dont seem bit afraid of being up here by in dark big winder say child pointing up to see in dark see with big winder stop bit get up on leg look hard at benjamin mother im good un say aint save candle trottle wondered what else forlorn little creature have be brought up to do without besides candle light risked putting question a to whether ever got run in open air to cheer up bit o yes have run now then out of door to say nothing of run about house lively little cricketa run according to good mr forleys instruction be followed out carefully a good mr forleys friend must be glad to hear to very letter a trottle must only have made one reply to namely that good mr forleys instruction be in opinion instruction of infernal scamp a felt that answer must naturally prove death blow to further discovery on part gulped down feeling before got too many for held tongue looked round towards window again to see what forlorn little boy be going to amuse with next child have gathered up blacking brush bit of rag have put into old tin saucepan be now working way a well a clothes must let with make believe pail hugged up in arm towards door of communication led from back to front garret say say looking round sharply over shoulder what be two stopping here for im going to bed nowand so tell with opened door walked into front room seeing trottle take step two to follow benjamin mother opened wicked old eye in state of great astonishment mercy on say havent seen enough of yet say trottle must like to see go to bed benjamin burst into fit of chuckling that loose extinguisher in candlestick clattered again with shaking of hand to think of good mr forleys friend taking ten time more trouble about imp than good mr forley joke a benjamin have not often met with in course of life begged to be excused if took liberty of having laugh at leaving to laugh a much a pleased coming to pretty positive conclusion after what have just heard that mr forleys interest in child be not of fondest possible kind trottle walked into front room benjamin mother enjoying immensely followed with candle there be two piece of furniture in front garret one old stool of sort be used to stand cask of beer on other great big ricketty straddling old truckle bedstead in middle of bedstead surrounded by dim brown waste of sacking be kind of little island of poor beddingan old bolster with nearly feather out of doubled in three for pillow mere shred of patchwork counter pane blanket under peeping out little on side beyond loose clothes two faded chair cushion of horsehair laid along together for sort of makeshift mattress when trottle got into room lonely little boy have scrambled up on bedstead with help of beer stool be kneeling on outer rim of sacking with shred of counterpane in hand just making ready to tuck in for under chair cushion ill tuck up man say trottle jump into bed let try mean to tuck up say poor forlorn child dont mean to jump mean to crawl doand so tell with set to work tucking in clothes tight down side of cushion leaving open at foot then getting up on knee looking hard at trottle a much a to say what do mean by offering to help handy little chap a began to untie big shawl for did too in le than minute then doubling shawl up loose over foot of bed say say look here duck under clothes head first worming way up up softly under blanket counterpane till trottle saw top of large nightcap slowly peep out on bolster over sized head gear of child have so shoved down in course of journey to pillow under clothes when got face fairly out on bolster be nightcap down to mouth soon freed however from slight encumbrance by turning end of cap up gravely to old place over eyebrowslooked at trottlesaid snug aint good byepopped face under clothes againand left nothing to be seen of empty peak of big nightcap standing up sturdily on end in middle of bolster what young limb be aint say benjamin mother giving trottle cheerful dig with elbow come on wont see more of to night so tell sings out shrill little voice under bedclothes chiming in with playful finish to old woman last word if trottle have not be by time positively resolved to follow wicked secret accident have mixed up with through turning winding right on to end must have probably snatched boy up then there carried off from garret prison bed clothes a be put strong check on kept eye on future possibility allowed benjamin to lead down stair again mind top bannister say a trottle laid hand on be a rotten a medlar one of em when people come to see premise say trottle trying to feel way little farther into mystery of house dont bring many of up here do bless heart alive say nobody ever come now outside of house be quite enough to warn off more pity a say used to keep in spirit staggering em one after with frightful high rentspecially woman drat em whats rent of househundred twenty pound yearhundred twenty why there aint house in street a let for more than eightylikely enough maam other
