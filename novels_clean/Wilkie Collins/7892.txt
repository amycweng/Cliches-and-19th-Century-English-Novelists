question with plain reply if ovid asserted that benjulia chemical experiment be assumed for reason known only to a cloak to cover atrocity of savage science must only raise doctor in mother estimation if on other hand described what have passed between when met in zoological garden mr gallilee might summon benjulia to explain slur have indirectly cast on memory of carmina mother might find in reply plausible reason for objecting to son marriage having rashly placed in dilemma ovid unwisely escaped from by easiest way think benjulia fit person said to be in company of young girl mr gallilee

carmina memory be busy with parting scene on previous day more thought of have happened in short space of time more bitterly reproached one besetting weakness have openly degraded without so much a attempt at resistance on part fear of betraying if took leave of man secretly loved in presence of family have forced to ask favour of carmina to ask under circumstance might have led rival to suspect truth admitted to private interview with ovid have failed to control agitation worse still in ungovernable eagerness to produce favourable impression on at parting have promised honestly promised in moment of impulse to make carmina happiness own peculiar care carmina who have destroyed in day hope of year carmina who have taken away from who have clung round when ran upstairs have kissed

increase on principle dislike living up to income be obliged to do here plainly revealed to governess experienced eye be false pretence used to introduce true object of interview a something might accidentally suggest in course of conversation miss minerva expressed necessary regret with innocent readiness might suggest economy asked with impenetrable gravity admirably advised mr gallilee admitted how be to be done subscription for instance be more than ought to give what happens if lower amount expose to unfavourable comparison with other people of rank in society miss minerva still patiently played part expected of might perhaps do with only one carriage horse remarked good creature look at people who have only one carriage horse situated a be can descend to level suppose care two straw about such thing one pride pleasure in life be pride pleasure of improving mind have lady northlake for sister must not be entirely unworthy of family connection have two daughter must think of interest in few year maria will be presented at court thanks to will be one of most accomplished girl in england think of maria mother in one horse chaise dear child tell about lesson be getting on a well a ever examine mr gallilee can answer for result miss minerva have too much confidence in to do anything of kind besides in one of most important of maria accomplishment be entirely dependent on know nothing of music be not responsible for progress in direction still must like to know if be satisfied with maria music quite satisfied think be getting how can express will say beyond reach of mr le frank teaching certainly not perhaps must consider mr le frank equal to instruction of older more advanced pupil than maria thus far miss minerva have answered question submitted to with well concealed indifference last inquiry roused attention why did mr gallilee show interest for first time in mr le frank capacity a teacher who be older more advanced pupil for whose appearance in conversation previous question have so smoothly prepared way feeling delicate ground under governess advanced cautiously have always thought mr le frank excellent teacher said can give more definite answer than mr gallilee asked be quite unacquainted madam with musical proficiency of pupil to whom refer even know add to perplexity whether be speaking of lady gentleman be speaking said mr gallilee quietly of niece carmina word set further doubt at rest in miss minerva mind introduced by such elaborate preparation allusion to carmina name must only lead in due course to subject of carmina marriage by indirect method of approach mr gallilee have at last reached object that have in view chapter xxii there be interval of silence between two lady mr gallilee waited for miss minerva to speak next miss minerva waited to be taken into mr gallilee confidence sparrow twittered in garden far away in schoolroom note of piano announced that music lesson have begun bird be noisy said mr gallilee piano sound out of tune miss minerva remarked there be help for mr gallilee must return to matter in hand matter in hand must drop be afraid have not made understood resumed be afraid have be very stupid miss minerva confessed resigning to circumstance mr gallilee put adjourned question under new form be speaking of mr le frank a teacher of niece a pupil said have be able to form opinion of carmina musical ability miss minerva remained a prudent a ever answered have have opportunity of forming opinion mr gallilee met cautious reply by playing trump card handed letter to miss minerva have received proposal from mr le frank said will tell what think of letter be short servile mr le frank presented best respect if mr gallilee charming niece stood in need of musical instruction ventured to hope that might have honour happiness of superintending study looking back to top of letter governess discovered that modest request bore date of eight day since have written to mr le frank asked only to say will take request into consideration mr gallilee replied have waited for son departure before committed to decision on chance that might be case miss minerva consulted memory when mr gallilee first decided on engaging music master to teach child son have disapproved of employing mr le frank circumstance might possibly be worth bearing in mind do see objection to accepting mr le frank proposal mr gallilee asked miss minerva saw objection forthwith thanks to effort of memory discovered especially mischievous way of stating feel certain delicacy in offering opinion said modestly mr gallilee be surprised do allude to mr le frank inquired doubt that instruction must be of service to young lady be thinking of niece mr gallilee be thinking of son in what way if please in way believe son must object to employing mr le frank a miss carmina teacher on musical ground on personal ground what do mean miss minerva explained meaning think have forgotten what happened when first employed mr le frank to teach maria zoe personal appearance produced unfavourable impression on son mr ovid made certain inquiry have not thought necessary pardon if persist in mentioning circumstance owe to myself to justify opinion opinion will please to remember did not volunteer mr ovid investigation brought to light very unpleasant report relating to mr le frank young lady who have be one of pupil abominable slander miss minerva be surprised that must refer to be referring madam to view of matter taken by mr ovid if mr le frank have failed to defend successfully must of course not have be received into house son have own opinion of defence be present at time heard say that if maria zoe have be older must have advised employing music master who have false report against to contradict a be only child must say nothing more be what have in mind when gave opinion think mr ovid will be annoyed when hears that mr le frank be cousin music master if foolish gossip reach in absence fear might lead to mischievous result mean to misunderstanding not easily set right by correspondence quite likely therefore to lead in end to distrust jealousy there paused crossed hand on lap waited for what be to come next if mr gallilee must have looked into mind at moment a well a into face must have read miss minerva thought in plain term time madam have be keeping up appearance in face of detection be going to use mr le frank a mean of making mischief between ovid carmina if have taken into confidence might have be willing to help a be please observe be not caught in trap have set for if mr ovid discovers little plot ca lay blame on governess advice mr gallilee felt that have again measured with miss minerva have again be beaten have confidently reckoned on governess secret feeling towards son to encourage without hesitation distrust project for promoting estrangement of ovid carmina there be alternative now to put first obstacle in way of marriage on own sole responsibility doubt that have spoken sincerely said have failed to do justice to son good sense be naturally enough in position incapable of estimating devoted attachment to carmina having planted that sting paused to observe effect not slightest visible result rewarded went on almost last word said to expressed confidence affectionate confidence in niece bare idea of being jealous of anybody especially of such person a mr le frank be simply ridiculous be astonished that see in light must see in light a plainly a do miss minerva quietly replied if mr ovid be at home what difference doe that make excuse make great difference a think have gone away on long journey gone away in bad health will have hour of depression at such time trifle be serious thing even well meant word in

of illness described a being accompanied by shocking circumstance case of disease of brain there be question proposed by benjulia inveterate suspicion of ovid bare doubt cost loss of day work reviled poor mr morphew a born idiot for not having plainly stated what patient malady be instead of wasting paper on smooth sentence encumbered by long word if ovid have alluded to canadian patient in letter to mother customary preciseness of language might be trusted to relieve benjulia suspense with purpose in view doctor have written to mr gallilee before laid down pen looked once more at mr morphew

publisher steadily punctually performed duty entrusted to in hour of freedom sensual instinct got better of jealous wife have reason for complaint among friend be subject of wide diversity of opinion of agreed with brother in thinking little better than fool others suspected of possessing natural ability of being too lazy perhaps too cunning to exert in office allowed to be called mere machine escaped overwork fell to share of quicker men when wife relation declared to be mere animal never contradicted so gained reputation of person on whom reprimand be thrown away under protection of unenviable character sometimes said severe thing with air of perfect simplicity when furious doctor discovered in laboratory said will be death of if tell living creature what be doing lemuel answered with stare of stupid astonishment make mind easy must be ashamed to mention further reflection decided benjulia on writing even when have favour to ask be unable to address lemuel with common politeness hear that morphew have written to by last mail want to see letter so much wrote more what be barely enough for purpose be enough for doctor when addressed brother chapter xxxi between one

buttoned coat tapped pocket significantly have got nasty temper nathan there be thing here that might try in case of other man benjulia must have seen that one object of prudent remark be to irritate misled by profound conviction of brother stupidity now thought possible that concealed portion of letter might be worth notice stopped lemuel at door have changed mind said want to look at letter

expectation doctor curiosity be roused on doctor own subject of inquiry be quite right about one thing said benjulia gravely never heard talk in way before suggest interesting consideration of medical sort come to light led lemuel to window looked at with closest attention carefully consulted pulse lemuel smiled be not joking said benjulia sternly tell have have headache lately do find memory failing a put question thought to seriously thought be fellow brain softening wish have on table lemuel persisted in presenting under sentimental aspect have not forgiven elder brother rudeness yet knew by experience one weakness in benjulia character with small resource be possible to attack thank for kind inquiry replied never mind head so long a heart in right place pretend to be clever have got feeling must put awkward question on what call medical research if have morphew to help will help said benjulia interested in developing state of brother brain believe said lemuel interested in

vivisection yes very well what can do for tell first said lemuel what be law nobody know well then what ought to be justice suppose let wait bit nathan get into mind benjulia waited with exemplary patience now about lemuel continued wo be offended will must be right if called dissector of living creature benjulia be reminded of day when have discovered brother in laboratory dark complexion deepened in hue cold gray eye seemed to promise coming outbreak lemuel went on doe law forbid to make experiment on man asked of course doe why doe law forbid to make experiment on dog benjulia face cleared again one penetrable point in ironclad nature have not be reached yet apparently childish question about dog appeared not only to have interested to have taken by surprise attention wandered away from brother clear intellect put lemuel objection in closer logical form asked if there be answer to thus law forbids to dissect living man allows to dissect living dog why there be positively answer to suppose said because dog be animal must a physiologist deny that man be animal too suppose said because dog be inferior creature in intellect obvious answer to must be lower order of savage lower order of lunatic compared with dog be inferior creature in intellect in case dog have on own showing better right to protection of two suppose said because man be creature with soul dog be creature without soul must be simply inviting unanswerable question how do know honestly accepting dilemma thus presented conclusion followed seemed to be beyond dispute if law in matter of vivisection asserts principle of interference law have barred right to place arbitrary limit on own action if protects living creature be bound in reason in justice to protect well said lemuel be to have answer be not lawyer with convenient reply benjulia opened mr morphew letter read forbidden part of began on second page there found very question with brother have puzzled followed by conclusion at have arrived interpreted language of dog just now said quietly to lemuel naturally supposed brain might be softening such a be perceive that memory be in working order accept excuse for feeling pulse have ceased to be object of interest to returned to reading lemuel watched still confidently waiting for result letter proceeded in term employer may perhaps be inclined to publish work if can satisfy that will address to general reader know be false pretence under english physiologist practice cruelty want to expose false pretence in simplest plainest way by appealing to own experience a ordinary working member of medical profession take pretence of increasing knowledge of curative action of poison by trying on animal very poison action of dog cat have be needlessly tortured to demonstrate have successfully used on human patient in practice of lifetime must also like to ask what proof there be that effect of poison on animal may be trusted to inform with certainty of effect of same poison on man to quote two instance only justify doubt to take bird time by way of change pigeon will swallow opium enough to kill man will not be in least affected by parsley be innocent herb in stomach of human being be deadly poison to parrot must deal in same way with other pretence of improving practice of surgery by experiment on living animal not long since saw diseased leg of dog

impression doe produce on asked knowing no more than know now priest cautious language madam speaks for have enemy who will stick at nothing still hesitated to trust see here went on confined to room likely perhaps to be in helpless condition for time to come how must protect against woman in place must wait for what purpose if will allow to use language of card table must wait till woman show hand have shown may ask when morning mr le frank said more if be really wanted mr gallilee have only to speak after last moment of hesitation pitiless necessity of position decided once more see too ill to move said first thing to do be to tell why related plain fact without word of comment without sign of emotion husband horror of have left impression pride contempt have be strong enough to resist allowed music master to infer that contending claim to authority over carmina have led to quarrel provoked assault secret of word that have spoken be one secret that kept from mr le frank while be insensible proceeded niece be taken away from have be suffering from nervous illness be naturally terrified be now at nurse lodging too ill to be moved there have state of affair up to last night people might think mr le frank remarked that easiest way out of so far must be to summon nurse for assault easiest way compels to face public exposure mr gallilee answered in position be impossible mr

not generally considered to include respect for sanctity of human life what do know already that have done have alarmed priest who keep conscience know well have attacked with such murderous ferocity that be wonder have escaped with life what sort of message have sent to after experience of temper have told tigress that have power to separate from cub that mean to use on plain fact a stare in face be soundest conclusion to believe that really submits to believe that be only gaining time be capable if see other alternative of trying to poison must advise to do in word mr gallilee never before reduced to ask advice of anybody owned that sound reasoning be not thrown away on mr le frank answered demand made on without hesitation nurse have not signed that act of submission said without having own private reason for appearing to give way rely on be prepared for there be at least chance that proof of may be found have movement privately watched search room life in a searched miss

none of inquiry might have be anticipated followed first word not slightest allusion to mr gallilee escaped expressed anxiety about miss minerva sign of uneasiness at finding in strange room disturbed quiet face contentedly reposing looked at teresa from time to time said will stay with wo now then confessed that head felt dull heavy asked teresa to take hand feel a if be sinking away from said keep hold of hand sha be afraid to go to sleep word be hardly spoken before sank into slumber occasionally teresa felt hand tremble kissed seemed to be conscious of kiss without waking smiled in sleep when first hour of morning came state of passive repose be disturbed violent attack of sickness came on be repeated again again teresa sent for mr null did what must to relieve new symptom despatched messenger to illustrious colleague benjulia lost time in answering personally appeal have be made to mr null said serious derangement of stomach sir benjulia agreed with mr null showed prescription benjulia sanctioned prescription mr null said be there anything wish to suggest sir benjulia have nothing to suggest waited nevertheless until carmina be able to speak to teresa mr null wondered what must say to only said do remember when last saw after little consideration answered yes zo be with zo brought in big stick talked tried to rouse memory what did talk about asked momentary agitation brought flush to face ca remember said ca remember when went away doe matter benjulia replied not least in world go to sleep still remained in room watching a grew drowsy great weakness mr null whispered benjulia answered yes will call again on way out took teresa aside more question said help memory if asks will remember when get better teresa inquired impossible to say yet wait see left in hurry experiment be waiting for on way home mind dwelt on carmina case hidden process be at work there give time must show hope that as wo want said thinking of medical colleague for at least week to come week passed physiologist be not disturbed during interval mr null succeeded in partially overcoming attack of sickness be le violent be succeeded by longer interval of repose in other respect there seemed a teresa persisted in thinking to be little promise of improvement certain mental advance be unquestionably noticeable in carmina first showed in interesting way began to speak of ovid great anxiety be that must know nothing of illness forbade teresa to write to sent message to mr mr gallilee even to mr mool entreating to preserve silence nurse engaged to deliver message failed to keep word breach of promise a event have ordered proved to be harmless mr gallilee have good reason for not writing husband mr mool have decided on sending telegram to banker a for teresa have desire to communicate with ovid absence remained inexcusable from point of view well ill with without reason be nurse opinion that ought to have remained at home in carmina interest other person be in least likely to write to ovid nobody thought of zo a correspondent carmina be pacified once twice at later time languid effort of memory took wider range wondered why mr gallilee never came near owning that aunt absence be relief to not feeling interest enough in subject to ask for information also mentioned miss minerva do know where have gone think ought to write to teresa offered to make inquiry turned head wearily on pillow said never mind on occasion asked for zo said must be pleasant if mr gallilee must call bring with soon dropped subject not to return to again only remembrance seemed to dwell on mind for more than few minute be remembrance of last letter have written to ovid pleased with imagining surprise when received grew impatient under continued illness because delayed in escaping to canada talked to teresa of clever manner in flight have be planned with strange failure of memory that attributed various arrangement for setting discovery at defiance not to miss minerva to nurse here for first time mind be approaching dangerous ground stealing of letter event have followed stood next in order of remembrance if be capable of continued effort weakness saved beyond writing of letter recollection be unable to advance not faintest allusion to later circumstance escaped poor stricken brain still sought rest in frequent interval of sleep sometimes drifted back into partial unconsciousness sometimes attack of sickness returned mr null set excellent example of patience resignation believed a devoutly a ever in prescription placed greatest reliance on time care derangement of stomach a called presented something positive tangible to treat have got over doubt anxiety troubled when carmina be first removed to lodging looking confidently at surface without idea of what be going on below must tell teresa with safe conscience that understood case be always ready to comfort when excitable italian nature passed from extreme of hope to extreme of despair good woman see way now be great point gained assure to see way what do mean by seeing way said downright nurse tell when carmina will be well again mr null medical knowledge be not yet equal to demand on progress be slow admitted still miss carmina be getting on be aunt getting on teresa asked abruptly when be mistress gallilee likely to come here in few day mr null be about to add hope thought of what might happen when two woman met a be be face showed sign of serious disturbance mind be plainly not prepared for speedy prospect of visit from mr gallilee took letter out of pocket find good deal of sly prudence in said to mr null must have seen something in time of way of deceitful englishwoman what doe palaver mean in plain word handed letter to with reluctance read mr gallilee decline to contract engagement with person formerly employed a nurse in household of late mr robert graywell mr gallilee so far recognises apology submission offered to a to abstain from taking immediate proceeding in arriving at decision be also influenced by necessity of sparing niece agitation might interfere with medical treatment when circumstance appear to require will not hesitate to exert authority handwriting told null that manifesto have not be written by mr gallilee person who have succeeded in capacity of lady amanuensis have be evidently capable of giving sound advice little did suspect that mysterious secretary be identical with enterprising pianist who have once prevailed on to take seat at concert price five shilling well said teresa mr null hesitated nurse stamped impatiently on floor tell when doe come here will part from carmina be that what mean possibly said prudent mr null teresa pointed to door good morning want nothing more of oh man man leave by moment be alone fell on knee fiercely whispering repeated over over again word of lord prayer 'lead not into temptation deliver from evil christ hear mother of christ hear oh carmina carmina rose opened door communicated with bedroom trembling pitiably looked for while at carmina peacefully asleep then turned away to corner of room in stood old packing case fitted with lock took up returning with to sitting room softly closed bedroom door again after hesitation decided to open case in terror confusion that possessed tried wrong key setting mistake right disclosed strangely mingled with lighter article of own dress heap of paper of letter bill of faded instruction in writing for preparation of artist colour recoiled from object own act have disclosed why have not taken father patrizio advice if have only waited day if have only sorted husband paper before threw thing that trunk be too full to hold into half empty case what torment might have be spared to eye turned mournfully to bedroom door oh darling be in such hurry to get to at last controlled put hand into case searching in one corner produced little tin canister dirty label be pasted on canister bearing quaint inscription in italian language if there be of powder employ in making of prettiest colour left in here request good wife other trustworthy person in place to put seal on take directly to manufactory with late foreman best respect look like nice sugar beware of look may taste poison on point of opening canister hesitated under strange impulse did what child might have done shook listened rustle of rising falling powder renewing terror seemed to exercise irresistible fascination over devil dance said to herself with ghastly smile softly up softly down tempting to take off cover time why get rid of question set thinking of carmina guardian if mr null be right in day two mr gallilee might come to house after lawyer have threatened teresa with prospect of separation from carmina have opened packing case for first time since have left rome intending to sort husband paper a mean of relief from own thought in way have discovered canister sight of deadly powder have tempted there be horrid mean of setting mr gallilee authority at defiance woman in place must use though be not looking into canister now felt that thought stealing back into mind there be one hope for resolved to get rid of poison how at period of year there be fire in grate within limit of room mean of certain destruction be slow to present own morbid horror of canister made suspicious of curiosity of other people who might see in hand if showed on stair be determined if lit fire for purpose to find way to end firmness of resolution expressed by locking case again without restoring canister to hiding place providing next with knife sat down in corner between bedroom door on one side cupboard in angle of wall on other began work of destruction by scraping off paper label fragment might be burnt powder if made vow to virgin to do might be thrown into fire next then empty canister must be harmless have made little progress in work of scraping when occurred to that lighting of fire on warm autumn day might look suspicious if landlady mr null happened to come in must be safer to wait till night time when everybody must be in bed arriving at conclusion mechanically suspended use of knife in moment of silence followed heard someone enter bedroom by door opened on stair immediately afterwards person turned handle of second door at side have barely time enough to open cupboard hide canister in when landlady came in teresa looked at wildly landlady looked at cupboard be proud of cupboard plenty of room there said boastfully not house in neighbourhood must offer such accommodation a yes lock be out of order deny last lodger doings spoilt tablecloth put inkstand over to hide place beast there be character in one word did hear knock at bedroom door be so glad to see sleeping nicely poor dear chicken broth be ready when wake be late to day in making inquiry after young lady see have be hard at work upstairs getting bedroom ready for new lodger contrast to person who have just left perfect gentleman time so kind in waiting week till be able to accommodate ground floor room be vacant a know said term be too high for oh did forget to mention that have invalid in house quiet habit said be indeed essential qualification of new inmate at time a understood `` ve be invalid myself said 'and very reason be leaving present lodging be that be not quiet enough ' be just sort of man want let tell handsome man too with drawback must own in shape of bald head beard thrilling voice hush did hear calling at last landlady permitted other sound to be audible besides sound of own voice became possible to discover carmina be now awake teresa hurried into bedroom left by in sitting room landlady purely out of curiosity a afterwards said in conversation with new lodger opened cupboard looked in canister stood straight before on upper shelf did miss carmina nurse take snuff examined canister there be white powder inside mutilated label spoke in unknown tongue wetted finger tasted powder result be so disagreeable that be obliged to use handkerchief put canister back closed cupboard medicine undoubtedly landlady said to herself why must hurry to put away when came in chapter li in eight day from date of second interview with mr gallilee mr le frank took possession of new bedroom have arranged to report proceeding in writing in teresa state of mind must certainly distrust fellow lodger discovered in personal communication with mr gallilee mr le frank employed first day after arrival in collecting material for report in evening wrote to mr gallilee under cover to friend who be instructed to forward letter private confidential dear madam have not wasted time opportunity a will presently see bedroom be immediately above floor of house be occupied by miss carmina nurse having little matter of own to settle be late in taking possession of room before light on staircase be put out took liberty of looking down at next landing do remember when be child learning to write one of line in copy book be 'virtue be own reward ridiculous assertion be actually verified in case before have be five minute at post saw nurse open door looked up staircase without discovering be needle to say looked down staircase seeing nobody about returned to room waiting till heard lock door stole downstairs listened outside one of two fellow lodger know believe in miss carmina illness be lighting fire on warm autumn night that staircase window be left open be absolutely sure of what say heard crackle of burning wood smelt coal smoke motive of secret proceeding seems impossible to guess at if be burning document of dangerous compromising kind candle must have answered purpose if wanted hot water surely tin kettle spirit lamp must have be at hand in invalid bedroom perhaps superior penetration may be able to read riddle baffle ingenuity so much for first night afternoon have talk with landlady professional avocation having trained in art of making agreeable to sex may say without vanity produced favourable impression in other word contrived to set fair friend talking freely about old nurse interesting invalid out of flow of word poured on one fact of very serious importance have risen to surface there be suspicious canister in nurse possession landlady call powder inside medicine say poison be rushing at fanciful conclusion please wait little during week of delay elapsed before lodger in possession vacated room kindly admitted to interview ventured to put question relating to teresa life in italy to person with whom associated do remember telling when asked what knew of husband that be foreman in manufactory of artist colour that have information from miss carmina herself after have shown telegram announcing death lady possessed of scientific knowledge doe not require to be told that poison be employed in making artist colour remember what priest letter say of teresa feeling towards then say be so very unlikely that have brought with to england one of poison used by husband in trade be quite unreasonable to suppose when look at canister that may be thinking of may be right may be wrong thanks to dilapidated condition of lock can decide question at first opportunity offered to by nurse absence from room next report will tell have contrived to provide with sample of powder leaving canister undisturbed sample will be tested by chemist if pronounces to be poison have bold course of action to propose a soon a be well enough to go to house give nurse chance of poisoning dear madam be alarmed will accompany will answer for result will pay visit at tea time let offer cup let under pretence of handing get possession of poisoned drink before can cry stop will be on way to chemist penalty for attempted murder be penal servitude if still object to public exposure have chemist report together with own evidence ready for son on return how will feel about marriage engagement when find that miss carmina dearest friend companion have tried perhaps with young lady knowledge to poison mother before concluding may mention have narrow escape only two hour since of being seen by teresa on stair be of course prepared for sort of meeting when engaged room have therefore not be foolish enough to enter house under assumed name on contrary propose in interest to establish neighbourly acquaintance with time to help matter of poison admits of delay chance of getting at unobserved may be seriously compromised if nurse remembers that first met with in house distrust accordingly devoted servant l f having completed letter rang for maid gave to to post on way downstairs be stopped on next landing by mr null too have letter ready addressed to doctor benjulia fierce old nurse followed out said post instantly civil maid asked if miss carmina be better worse be rude foreigner said looked at poor mr null a if be fault left in retirement of room mr le frank sat at writing table frowning biting nail be evidence of troubled mind connected with infamous proposal have addressed to mr gallilee nothing of sort having sent away letter be now at leisure to let personal anxiety absorb without restraint be thinking of carmina oftener effort be baffled more resolute became to discover secret of behaviour to for hundredth time said to devilish malice reviles behind back asks before face to shake hand be friend more outrageously unreasonable suspicion became under exasperating influence of suspense more inveterately vindictive nature held to delusion after meeting in hall at fairfield garden really believed carmina illness to have be assumed a mean of keeping out of way if friend have said to what reason have to think so must have smiled compassionately have given friend up for willow minded man stole out again listened undetected at door carmina be speaking word in faint tone be inaudible teresa stronger voice easily reached ear darling talking be not good for will light night lamp try to sleep hearing went back to bedroom to wait little teresa vigilance might relax if carmina fell asleep might go downstairs for gossip with landlady after smoking cigar tried again light on staircase be now put out be eleven o'clock be not asleep nurse be reading to from devotional book gave up for night head ached ferment of own abominable thought have fevered cowardly dread of slightest sign of illness be one of special weakness whole day to morrow be before felt own pulse determined in justice to to go to bed ten minute later landlady on way to bed ascended stair too heard voice still reading aloud tapped softly at door teresa opened be poor thing not asleep yet have be disturbed in way somebody have be walking about overhead teresa answered be new lodger exclaimed landlady will speak to mr le

moon be now shining over life will answer for hers astonishment immeasurable astonishment sealed benjulia lip looked down lane when ovid left completely stupefied one imaginable way of accounting for

present need shrank with carmina life in hand from trusting wholly to higher authority than be waiting to be consulted took from portmanteau manuscript presented to by poor wretch whose last hour have soothed in garret at work opened with declaration gave special value in ovid estimation if imperfect record of experience be ever read by other eye than mine wish to make one plain statement at outset information be presented in page be wholly derived from result of bedside practice pursued under miserable obstacle interruption spread over period of many year fault failing may have be guilty of a man be innocent in professional capacity of ever having perpetrated useless detestable cruelty go by name of vivisection without entering into of dispute on side practice have provoked declare conviction that asserted usefulness in end can justify deliberate cruelty in mean man who seriously maintains that pursuit in can engage be independent of moral restraint be man in state of revolt against god refuse to hear in own defense on ground ovid turned next to section of work be entitled brain disease writer introduced observation in prefatory word celebrated physiologist plainly avowing ignorance of doctor in matter of brain disease alluding to appearance presented by post mortem examination concludes confession thus can not even be sure whether many of change discovered be cause result of disease whether two be conjoint result of common cause ' so man writes after experience in vivisection let different experience be heard next not knowing into what hand manuscript may fall what unexpected opportunity of usefulness may encounter after death purposely abstain from using technical language in statement have now to make in medical investigation a in other form of human inquiry result in view be not infrequently obtained by indirect unexpected mean what have to say here on subject of brain disease be first suggested by experience of two case seemed in last degree unlikely to help be case of young woman one having be hysterically affected by serious moral shock terminating after longer shorter interval in simulated paralysis one of case treated successfully while be still in attendance on other pursuing same course of treatment event have already proved to be right fatal accident terminated patient life rendered post mortem examination necessary from starting point arrived by devious way be now to relate at deduction discovery threw new light on nature treatment of brain disease hour by hour ovid studied page followed until mind mind of writer be one then returned to certain preliminary allusion to medical treatment of two girl inexpressibly precious to in carmina present interest dawn of day found prepared at point only waiting until lapse of next few hour placed mean of action in hand there be one anxiety still to be relieved before lay down to rest took off shoe stole upstairs to carmina door faithful teresa be astir earnestly persuading

there be life there be hope chapter lx after brief interview with step son mr gallilee returned to daughter in scotland touched by fatherly interest in carmina ovid engaged to keep informed of progress towards recovery if anticipation of saving proved to be sad delusion of love hope silence must signify what word must say in ten day time there be happy end to suspense slow process of recovery might extend perhaps to end of year if accident happened have best reason for believing carmina life be safe freed from terrible anxiety have oppressed be able to write again few day later in cheerful tone to occupy pen at mr gallilee express request with apparently trifling subject a conduct of mr null old medical adviser be quite right in informing have relieved from further attendance on carmina lively imagination perhaps ought to say sense of own consequence have misled when also declares that purposely insulted took greatest pain not to wound self esteem left in anger nevertheless day two afterwards received note from addressing a beir asking ironically if have objection to looking at copy of prescription in chemist book though be old enough to be father remarked seemed that experience counted for nothing have still something to learn from junior in treatment of disease so on at miserable time of doubt anxiety must only send verbal reply leaving to do what liked before tell of use that made of liberty of action must confess something relating to prescription be afraid of long learned word suppose be occupying attention in way without serious reason for will presently understand note in manuscript to study of owe under god preservation of carmina life warned that chemist in writer country have refused to make up certain prescription given in work have taken liberty of altering new quantity combination of of drug prescribed precisely same thing happened here in case of first chemist to whom sent refused to make up medicine unless provided with signed statement taking whole responsibility on having ascertained exact nature of objection dismissed without guarantee employed chemist taking care in interest of time temper to write more important prescription under reserve be to say followed conventional rule a to quantity combination made necessary addition change from own private store when medicine be sent home poor foolish mr null finding nothing to astonish in course of medicine a represented by chemist appears by own confession to have copied prescription with malicious object in view have sent informs in second letter to doctor benjulia in order that too may learn something in profession from master who have dispensed with service new effort of irony mean that stand condemned of vanity in presuming to rely on own commonplace resource represented by deceitful evidence of chemist book be grateful to mr null notwithstanding have done service in meaning to do injury imperfect prescription have quieted mind of man to whom sent
