woman have ever before inspired with sensation now felt in trying to realise position there be one question to consider be still strong enough to resist temptation accident have thrown in way have one incentive to resistance conviction that if succumbed a far a family prospect be concerned must be ruined man knew father character well knew how far affection sympathy might prevail over prejudice

fireside hour have resolution enough to wear heart out by hard serious slaving study if left london on morrow must feel secure in own conscience must not return day after while throughout hour of night be thus vainly striving to hold calm counsel with base thought never occurred to might have occurred to other men in position why marry girl because love why with money station opportunity obstinately connect love marriage a one idea make dilemma danger where need exist have thought a in faintest most shadowy form crossed mind must have shrunk from have shrunk from self with horror fresh degradation may be yet in store for one consoling sanctifying remembrance must still be mine love for margaret sherwin be worthy to be offered to purest perfectest woman that ever god created night advanced noise faintly reaching from street sank ceased lamp flickered went out carriage return with clara from ball first cold cloud of day rose hid waning orb of moon air be cooled with morning freshness earth be purified with morning dew still sat by open window striving with burning love thought of margaret striving to think collectedly usefully abandoned to struggle ever renewing yet never changing always hour after hour struggle in vain at last began to think le le distinctly few moment more sank into restless feverish slumber then began more perilous ordeal for ordeal of dream thought sensation have be more more weakly restrained with succeeding hour of wakefulness now rioted within in perfect liberation from control be what dreamed stood on wide plain on one side be bounded by thick wood whose dark secret depth looked unfathomable to eye on other by hill ever rising higher higher yet until be lost in bright beautifully white cloud gleaming in refulgent sunlight on side above wood sky be dark vaporous seemed a if thick exhalation have arisen from beneath tree overspread clear firmament throughout portion of scene a still stood on plain looked around saw woman coming towards from wood stature be tall black hair flowed about unconfined robe be of dun hue of vapour mist hung above tree fell to foot in dark thick fold came on towards swiftly softly passing over ground like cloud shadow over ripe corn field calm water looked to other side towards hill there be woman descending from bright summit robe be white pure glistening face be illumined with light like light of harvest moon footstep a descended hill left long track of brightness sparkled far behind like track of star when winter night be clear cold came to place where hill plain be joined together then stopped knew that be watching from afar off meanwhile woman from dark wood still approached never pausing on path like woman from fair hill now must see face plainly eye be lustrous fascinating a eye of serpent large dark soft a eye of wild doe lip be parted with languid smile drew back long hair lay over cheek neck bosom while be gazing on then felt a if light be shining on from other side turned to look there be woman from hill beckoning away to ascend with towards bright cloud above arm a held forth shone fair even against fair hill from outstretched hand came long thin ray of trembling light penetrated to where stood cooling calming wherever touched woman from wood still came nearer nearer until must feel hot breath on face eye looked into mine fascinated a held out arm to embrace touched hand in instant touch ran through like fire from head to foot then still looking intently on with wild bright eye clasped supple arm round neck drew few pace away with towards wood felt ray of light have touched from beckoning hand depart yet once more looked towards woman from hill be ascending again towards bright cloud ever anon stopped turned round wringing hand letting head droop a if in bitter grief last time saw look towards be near cloud covered face with robe knelt down where stood after discerned more of for now woman from wood clasped more closely than before pressing warm lip on mine be a if long hair fell round spreading over eye like veil to hide from fair hill top woman who be walking onward to bright cloud above be drawn along in arm of dark woman with blood burning breath failing until entered secret recess that lay amid unfathomable depth of tree there encircled in fold of dusky robe laid cheek close to mine murmured mysterious music in ear amid midnight silence darkness of around have thought of returning to plain again for have forgotten woman from fair hill have given up heart soul body to woman from dark wood here dream ended awoke be broad daylight sun shone brilliantly sky be cloudless looked at watch have stopped shortly afterwards heard hall clock strike six dream be vividly impressed on memory especially latter part of be warning of coming event foreshadowed in wild vision of sleep to what purpose must dream indeed dream tend why have remained incomplete failing to show visionary consequence of visionary action what superstition to ask what waste of attention to bestow on trifle a dream still trifle have produced one abiding result knew not then know now a looked out on reviving re assuring sunlight be easy enough for to dismiss a ridiculous from mind rather from conscience tendency to see in two shadowy form of dream type of two real living being whose name almost trembled into utterance on lip must not also dismiss from heart love image dream have set up there for worship of sens result of night still remained within growing strengthening with minute if have be told beforehand how mere sight of morning must reanimate embolden must have scouted prediction a too outrageous for consideration yet so be moody boding reflection fear struggle of hour of darkness be gone with daylight love thought of margaret alone remained now remained unquestioned unopposed be conviction of few hour since like night mist fade before returning sunshine knew not be young new morning be a much new life of youth a new life of nature so left study went out consequence might come how must when must thought of more seemed a if have cast off melancholy thought in leaving room a if heart have sprung up more

recovered hastened to overtake before arrived at more frequented part of neighbourhood a approached side margaret turned suddenly looked at with expression of anger astonishment in eye next instant lovely face became tinged over with deep burning blush head drooped little hesitated for moment then abruptly quickened pace did remember mere chance that did gave confidence can not write down word said to recollecting end to fatal interview led recoil at very thought of exposing to others of preserving in permanent form word in first confessed love may be pride miserable useless pride animates with feeling can not overcome remembering what do be ashamed to write ashamed to recall what said at first interview with margaret sherwin can give good reason for sensation now influence can not analyse must not if must let be enough to say that risked everything spoke to word confused a be came hotly eagerly eloquently from heart in space of few minute confessed to more than have here painfully related in many page made use of name rank in life even now cheek burn while think of to dazzle girl pride to make listen to for sake of station if must not for sake of suit however honourably urged never before have committed meanness of trusting to social advantage what feared to trust to myself be true that love soar higher than other passion can stoop lower a well answer to urged be confused commonplace chilling enough have surprised frightened be impossible must listen to such address from total stranger be very wrong of to speak of to stop hear must remember what became a gentleman must not make such advance to again knew nothing of be impossible must really care about in so short time must beg must allow to proceed unhindered thus spoke sometimes standing still sometimes moving hurriedly few step forward might have expressed severely even angrily nothing must have said must have counteracted fascination that presence exercised over saw face lovelier

that persuasion of love must urge to win consent to meeting again only answered with repetition of what have said before walking onward rapidly while spoke servant who have hitherto lingered few pace behind now advanced to young mistress side with significant look a if to remind of promise saying few parting word let proceed at first interview to have delayed longer must have be risking too much a walked away servant turned round nodding head smiling a if to assure that have lost nothing by forbearance have exercised margaret lingered looked back last proof of modesty reserve so far from discouraging attracted to more powerfully than ever after first interview be most becoming virtue must have shown love for before seemed a nothing compared with love for now that have left left without parting look what course must next pursue must expect that margaret after what have said must go out again at same hour on morrow must not so soon abandon modesty restraint that have shown at first interview how communicate with how manage most skilfully to make good first favourable impression vanity whispered have already produced determined to write to how different be writing of letter to writing of once treasured page of romance have now abandoned for ever how slowly worked how cautiously diffidently built up sentence after sentence doubtingly set stop here laboriously rounded off paragraph there when toiled in service of ambition now when have given up to service of love how rapidly pen ran over paper how much more freely smoothly desire of heart flowed into word than thought of mind composition be instinct now art no longer must write eloquently yet write without pausing for expression blotting word be slow progress up hill in service of ambition be swift too swift career down in service of love there be need to describe content of letter to margaret comprised mere recapitulation of what have already said to insisted often strongly on honourable purpose of suit ended by entreating to write answer consent to allow interview letter be delivered by servant present little more timely persuasion above regard have shown to promise won girl with heart to interest be ready to help in way a long a interference must be kept secret from master waited day for reply to letter none came servant must give explanation of silence young mistress have not said one word to about since morning when have met still not discouraged wrote again letter contained lover threat time a well a lover entreaty produced effect answer came be very short rather hurriedly tremblingly

conventional respectability of life great believer in own infallibility be be father be determined to be pleased with made low rather cringing bow then looked to window seeing carriage waiting for at door made bow insisted on relieving of hat with own hand done coughed begged to know what must do for felt difficulty in opening business to be necessary to speak however at once began with apology be afraid mr sherwin that intrusion on part of perfect stranger not entirely stranger sir if may be allowed to say so indeed have great pleasure sir profit indeed advantage of being shown over town residence last year when family be absent from london very beautiful house happen to be acquainted with steward of respected father be kind enough to allow to walk through room treat quite intellectual treat furniture hanging so on arranged in such chaste style picture of finest piece ever saw be delighted quite delighted indeed spoke in under tone laying great stress upon particular word be evidently favourite with such a indeed not only eye whole face seemed to be nervously blinking winking time be addressing in embarrassment anxiety then felt peculiarity fidgetted bewildered more than can describe must have given world to have have back turned before spoke to again be delighted to hear that family name be not unknown to mr sherwin resumed under circumstance will feel le hesitation difficulty in making acquainted with object of visit just so may offer anything glass of sherry nothing thank in first place mr sherwin have reason for wishing that interview result may lead to may be considered strictly confidential be sure can depend on favouring thus far certainly most certainly strictest secrecy of course pray go on drew chair little nearer to through blinking winking must see latent expression of cunning curiosity in eye card be in hand be nervously rolling unrolling without moment cessation in anxiety to hear what have to say must also beg to suspend judgment until have heard to end may be disposed to view to view say unfavourably at first in short mr sherwin without further preface object of visit be connected with daughter with miss margaret sherwin daughter bless soul god bless soul really ca imagine stopped half breathless bending forward towards crumpling card between finger into smallest possible dimension rather more than week ago continued accidentally met miss sherwin in omnibus accompanied by lady older than wife mr sherwin said impatiently motioning with hand a if mr sherwin be insignificant obstacle to conversation wished to clear out of way a fast a possible will not probably be surprised to hear be struck by miss sherwin extreme beauty impression made on be something more however than mere momentary feeling of admiration to speak candidly felt have heard of such thing a love at first sight mr sherwin in book sir tapped one of morocco bound volume on table smiled curious smile partly deferential partly sarcastic must be inclined to laugh dare say if asked to believe that there be such thing a love at first sight out of book without dwelling further on that be duty to confess to in candour honesty that impression miss sherwin produced on be such a to make desire privilege of becoming acquainted with in plain word discovered place of residence by following to house upon soul be most extraordinary proceeding pray hear out mr sherwin will not condemn conduct think if hear have to say muttered something unintelligible complexion turned yellower dropped card have by time crushed into fragment ran hand rapidly through hair until have stretched out like penthouse over forehead blinking time regarding with lowering sinister expression of countenance saw that be useless to treat a must have treated gentleman have evidently put meanest foulest construction upon delicacy hesitation in speaking to so altered plan came to point abruptly came to business a must have called ought to have be plainer mr sherwin ought perhaps to have told at outset in so many word came to be about to say to ask daughter hand in marriage thought of father moved darkly over mind at moment word must not pas lip well sir to what tone in said be harsh enough to rouse gave back self possession immediately to ask permission to pay address to miss sherwin to be plainer still if like to ask of hand in marriage word be spoken even if must have done so must not have recalled what have just said still trembled in spite of a expressed in plain blunt word what have only rapturously thought over delicately hinted at to margaret up to time god bless cried mr sherwin suddenly sitting back bolt upright in chair staring at in such surprise that restless feature be actually struck with immobility for moment god bless be quite story most gratifying most astonishing highly flattered be sure highly indeed dear sir suppose for one moment ever doubted honourable feeling young gentleman in station of life do sometimes fail in respect towards wife daughter of in short of who be not in rank exactly be not question quite misunderstanding extremely stupid of to be sure pray let offer glass of wine wine thank mr sherwin must beg attention little longer while state to in confidence how be situated with regard to proposal have made there be certain circumstance yes yes bent forward again eagerly towards a spoke looking more inquisitive more cunning than ever have acknowledged to mr sherwin have found mean to speak to daughter to speak to twice made advance honourably received with modesty reluctance worthy of worthy of lady highest lady in land mr sherwin looked round reverentially to print of queen then looked back at bowed solemnly now although in so many word directly discouraged be due must say still think may without vanity venture to hope that did so a matter of duty more than a matter of inclination ah yes yes understand must hing without authority of course doubt be one reason why received a did have communicated to in plainest term difference in rank of life ah said that did exactly so saw difficulty there yes yes high principle sir high principle thank god need hardly tell mr sherwin how deeply feel delicate sense of honour objection show on daughter part will easily imagine that be objection to personally happiness of whole life depends on miss sherwin desire higher honour a can conceive greater happiness than to be daughter husband told also told must explain on subject to made objection be therefore think justified in considering that if authorised removal of scruple do honour at present must not feel delicacy doe now at sanctioning address very proper very proper way of putting practical if may be allowed to say so now dear sir next point be how about own honoured family eh be exactly there that difficulty lie father on whom be dependent a younger son have very strong prejudice conviction ought perhaps to call on subject of social inequality quite so most natural most becoming indeed on part of respected father honour conviction sir such estate such house family a connected believe with nobility especially on late lamented mother side dear sir emphatically repeat father conviction do honour respect a much a respect do indeed be glad can view father idea on social subject in so favourable light mr sherwin will be le surprised to hear how be likely to affect in step be now taking disapproves of of course strongly perhaps well though dear girl be worthy of station man like devoted to mercantile interest may hold head up anywhere a one of prop of commercial country ran finger rapidly through hair tried to look independent still be prepared to admit under circumstance say under circumstance that disapproval be very natural be very much to be expected very much indeed have expressed disapproval mr sherwin say so have not given opportunity meeting with daughter have be kept profound secret from from member of family secret must remain speak from intimate knowledge of father when say that hardly know of mean that must not be capable of employing to frustrate purpose of visit if have mentioned to have be kindest best of father to firmly believe that if waited for consent entreaty of mine of one belonging to must induce to give sanction to marriage have come to to propose bless soul be carrying thing rather far though dependent a be on why what on earth can do must keep courtship marriage secret secret good gracious at see way yes secret profound secret among ourselves until can divulge marriage to father with best chance of tell ca see way through at chance what chance must there be after what have told there might be many chance for instance when marriage be solemnised might introduce daughter to father notice without disclosing who be leave gradually unsuspectedly to win affection respect a with beauty elegance amiability must not fail to do while waited until occasion be ripe for confessing everything then if said to 'this young lady who have so interested delighted be wife ' do think with powerful argument in favour must fail to give pardon if on other hand must only say 'this young lady be about to become wife ' prejudice must assuredly induce to recall most favourable impression refuse consent in short mr sherwin before marriage must be impossible to move after marriage when opposition must no longer be of avail must be quite different thing might be sure of producing sooner later most favourable result be why must be absolutely necessary to keep union secret at first wondered then have since wondered more how be that contrived to speak thus so smoothly so unhesitatingly when conscience be giving lie while to word uttered yes yes see oh yes see said mr sherwin rattling bunch of key in pocket with expression of considerable perplexity be ticklish business know very queer ticklish business indeed to have gentleman of birth breeding for son in law be of course then there be money question suppose failed with father after money be out in speculation can hing upon word have placed in position that never be placed in before have influential friend mr sherwin in many direction there be appointment good appointment must be open to if pushed interest might provide in way against chance of failure ah well yes there be something in certainly can only assure that attachment to miss sherwin be not of nature to be overcome by pecuniary consideration speak in interest when say that private marriage give chance for future a opportunity arise of gradually disclosing offer to may be made under disadvantage difficulty perhaps for with exception of very small independence left by mother have certain prospect really think proposal have compensating advantage to recommend certainly most decidedly so be not insensible dear sir to great advantage honour so forth there be something so unusual about whole affair what must be feeling if father must not come round dear girl be disowned by family well well must hardly happen think with accomplishment education manner too so distinguished though perhaps ought not to say so schooling alone be hundred year sir without including extra be sure mr sherwin school sir where be rule to take in thing lower than daughter of professional man only waived rule in case most genteel school perhaps in london drawing room deportment day once week girl taught how to enter room leave room with dignity ease model of carriage door step in back drawing room to practise girl with footman of establishment in attendance in getting into carriage getting out again in lady like manner duchess have have better education than margaret permit to assure mr sherwin then knowledge of language french italian german not discontinued in holiday after left school have only just left kept up improved evening by kind attention of mr mannion may ask who mannion be tone in put question cooled

in fact see assure be most flattered most honoured most anxious hope will consider anxiety mr sherwin let know result of deliberation a soon a possible without fail depend upon let see will say second day from at same time if can favour with visit certainly between time will engage not to hold communication with daughter promise not mr sherwin because believe that answer will be favourable ah well well lover say must never despair little consideration little talk with dear girl really now wo change mind have glass of sherry again very well then day after tomorrow at five o'clock with louder crack than ever brand new drawing room door be opened to let out noise be instantly succeeded by rustling of silk dress banging of door at opposite end of passage have anybody be listening where be margaret mr sherwin stood at garden gate to watch departure to make farewell bow thick a be atmosphere of illusion in now lived shuddered involuntarily a returned parting salute thought of a father in law xi nearer approached to own door more reluctance felt to pas short interval between first second interview with mr sherwin at home when entered house reluctance increased to something almost like dread felt unwilling unfit to meet eye of nearest dearest relative be relief to to hear that father be not at home sister be in house servant said have just gone into library inquired whether must tell have come in desired not to disturb a be intention to go out again immediately went into study wrote short note there to clara merely telling must be absent in country for two day have sealed laid on table for servant to deliver be about to leave room when library door open instantly drew back half closed own door again clara have got book wanted be taking up to own sitting room waited till be out of sight then left house be first time have ever avoided sister sister who have never in life asked question uttered word must annoy sister who have confided own little secret to keeping ever since have be child a thought on what have done felt sense of humiliation be almost punishment enough for meanness of have be guilty went round to stable have horse saddled immediately idea of proceeding in particular direction occurred to simply felt resolved to pas two day ordeal of suspense away from home far enough away to keep faithful to promise not to see margaret soon after started left horse to own guidance gave up to thought recollection a one by one rose within animal took direction have be oftenest used to take during residence in northern road be not until have ridden mile beyond suburb looked round discovered towards what part of country be proceeding drew rein directly turned horse head back again towards south to follow favourite road have so often followed with clara to stop perhaps at place where have often stopped with be more than have courage insensibility to do at moment rode a far a ewell stopped there darkness have overtaken be useless to tire horse by going on greater distance next morning be up almost with sunrise passed greater part of day in walking about among village lane field just a chance led during night many thought have banished for last week have returned thought of evil omen under mind seems to ache just a body ache under dull heavy pain to can assign particular place cause absent from margaret have resource against oppression now overcame must only endeavour to alleviate by keeping incessantly in action by walking riding hour after hour in vain attempt to quiet mind by wearying out body apprehension of failure of application to mr sherwin have nothing to do with vague gloom now darkened thought kept too near home for besides what have observed of margaret father especially during latter part of interview with showed plainly enough that be trying to conceal under exaggerated surprise assumed hesitation secret desire to profit at once by offer condition might clog be infinitely more advantageous in social point of view than must have hoped for be not delay in accepting proposal burden of deceit fetter of concealment forced on by proposal now hung heavy on heart that evening left ewell rode towards home again a far a richmond where remained for night forepart of next day reached london in afternoon got to north villa without going home first about five o'clock oppression be still on spirit even sight of house where margaret lived failed to invigorate arouse on occasion when be shown into drawing room mr mr sherwin be awaiting there on table be sherry have be so perseveringly pressed on at last interview by new pound cake mr sherwin be cutting cake a came in while husband watched process with critical eye poor woman weak white finger trembled a moved knife under conjugal inspection most happy to see again most happy indeed dear sir said mr sherwin advancing with hospitable smile outstretched hand allow to introduce better half mr s wife rose in hurry curtseyed leaving knife sticking in cake upon mr sherwin with stern look at ostentatiously pulled out set down rather violently on dish poor mr sherwin have hardly noticed on day when got into omnibus with daughter be a if now saw for first time there be natural communicativeness about woman emotion happy woman imperceptibly diffuses happiness around have influence be something akin to influence of sunshiny day so again melancholy of melancholy woman be invariably though silently infectious mr sherwin be one of latter order pale sickly moist looking skin large mild watery light blue eye restless timidity of expression mixture of useless hesitation involuntary rapidity in one of action furnished same significant betrayal of life of incessant fear restraint of disposition full of modest generosity meek sympathy have be crushed down past rousing to self assertion past ever seeing light there in mild wan face of hers in painful starting hurrying when moved in tremulous faint utterance when spoke there must see one of ghastly heart tragedy laid open before be acted re acted scene by scene year by year in secret theatre of home tragedy be ever shadowed by slow falling of black curtain that drop lower lower day drop to hide at last from hand of death have have very beautiful weather lately sir said mr sherwin almost inaudibly looking a spoke with anxious eye towards husband to see if be justified in uttering even piteously common place word very beautiful weather to be sure continued poor woman a timidly a if have become little child again have be ordered to say first lesson in stranger presence delightful weather mr sherwin have be enjoying for last two day in country in part of surrey neighbourhood of ewell have not seen before there be pause mr sherwin coughed be evidently warning matrimonial peal that have often rung before for mr sherwin started looked up at directly a lady of house mr s strike that might offer visitor like gentleman cake wine without making particular hole in manner oh dear beg pardon be very sorry be sure poured out glass of wine with trembling hand that decanter tinkled while against glass though wanted nothing ate drank something immediately in common consideration for mr sherwin embarrassment mr sherwin filled glass held up admiringly to light said good health sir very good health drank wine with air of connoisseur most expressive smacking of lip wife to whom offered nothing looked at time with most reverential attention be taking nothing mr sherwin said mr sherwin sir interposed husband never drink wine ca digest cake bad stomach very bad stomach have glass wo indeed sherry stand in six shilling bottle ought to be first rate wine at price so be well if wo have more will proceed to business have have business a call pleasure hope will be to mr sherwin coughed very weak small cough half stifled in birth there be again said turning fiercely towards coughing again six month of doctor six month bill to come out of pocket good done good mr s oh be much better thank be only little well sir evening after left have what may call explanation with dear girl be naturally little confused embarrassed indeed very serious thing of course to decide at age at so short notice on point involving happiness of whole life to come here mr sherwin put handkerchief to eye quite noiselessly for have doubtless acquired by long practice habit of weeping in silence husband quick glance turned on however immediately with anything expression of sympathy good god mr s what be use of going on in way said indignantly what be there to cry about margaret be ill be unhappy what on earth matter now upon soul be most annoying circumstance before visitor too have better leave to discus matter alone always be in way of business be opinion always will be mr sherwin prepared without word of remonstrance to leave room sincerely felt for must say nothing in impulse of moment rose to open door for immediately repented having done so action added so much to embarrassment that kicked foot against chair uttered suppressed exclamation of pain a went out mr sherwin helped to second glass of wine without taking smallest notice of hope mr sherwin have not hurt said oh dear not worth moment thought awkwardness nervousness nothing else always be nervous doctor humbug can hing with be very sad very sad indeed there be help for by time in spite of effort to preserve respect for a margaret father have sunk to proper place in estimation well dear sir resumed to go back to where be interrupted by mr s let see be saying that dear girl be little confused so forth a matter of course put before advantage connection a yours promised at same time mentioned of little embarrassing circumstance private marriage know besides telling of certain restriction in reference to marriage if came off must feel duty a father to impose will proceed in short to explain to a man of world dear sir know a well a do that young lady give very straightforward answer on subject of prepossession in favour of young gentleman got enough out of to show that have made pretty good use of time occasion to despond know leave to make speak plain be more in line than mine more good deal now let come to business part of transaction have to say be if agree to proposal then agree to yours think be fair enough eh quite fair mr sherwin just so now in first place daughter be too young to be married yet be only seventeen last birthday astonish must have imagined three year older at least everybody think older than be everybody dear sir certainly look be more formed more developed may say than most girl at age however be not point plain fact be be too young to be married now too young in moral point of view too young in educational point of view too young altogether well upshot of be must not give consent to margaret marrying until year be out say year from time one year courtship for finishing off of education formation of constitution understand for formation of constitution year to wait at first seemed long trial to endure trial ought not to be imposed on next moment delay appeared in different light must not be dearest of privilege to be able to see margaret perhaps day perhaps for hour at time must not be happiness enough to observe development of character to watch first maiden love for advancing nearer nearer towards confidence maturity oftener met a thought on answered mr sherwin without further hesitation will be trial said to patience though none to constancy none to strength of affection will wait year exactly so rejoined mr sherwin such candour such reasonableness be to be expected from one who be quite gentleman now come grand difficulty in business in fact little stipulation have to make stopped ran finger through hair in direction feature fidgetting distorting ominously while looked at pray explain mr sherwin silence give uneasiness at particular moment assure quite so understand now must promise not to be huffed offended must say at what be going to propose certainly not well then may seem odd under circumstance be to say a far a case concern personally want dear girl to be married at once yet not to be married exactly for year know whether understand must confess coughed rather uneasily turned to table poured out glass of sherry hand trembling little a did so drank off wine at draught cleared throat three four time after then spoke again well to be still plainer be how matter stand if be party in rank of life coming to court margaret with father full approval permission when once have consented to year engagement everything must be done settled bargain must have be struck on side there must be end of situated a be ca stop here safely mean ca end agreement exactly in way evidently felt that got fluent on wine helped at juncture to glass will see what be driving at dear sir directly continued suppose now came courting daughter for year a settled suppose father found out must keep profound secret of course still secret be sometimes found out nobody know how suppose say father got scent of thing match be broken off where do think reputation must be if happened with somebody in own station might explain be believed happening with somebody in yours must world say must world believe have ever intended to marry be point be point precisely case must not happen be astonished can imagine possible have told already be of age properly urged very properly indeed also told if remember when first have pleasure of seeing that father if knew of match must stick at nothing to oppose at nothing recollect said so now knowing dear sir though have most perfect confidence in honour resolution to fulfil engagement ca have confidence in being prepared beforehand to oppose father might do if found out because ca tell what might be up to what influence might set to work over sort of mess be not very probable will say if be at possible there be year for to be possible in by george sir must guard against accident for daughter sake must indeed in heaven name mr sherwin pas over impossible difficulty of yours let hear what have finally to propose gently dear sir gently gently gently propose to begin with must marry daughter privately marry in week time now pray compose be looking at in speechless astonishment take easy pray take easy supposing then marry in way make one stipulation require to give word of honour to leave at church door for space of one year never to attempt to see except in presence of third party at end of time will engage to give to a wife in fact a well a in name there what do say to eh be too astounded too overwhelmed to say anything at moment mr sherwin went on plan of mine see reconciles everything if accident doe happen be discovered why father can hing to stop match because match will have be already made at same time secure year delay for formation of constitution finishing of accomplishment so forth besides what opportunity give of sailing a near wind a choose in breaking thing bit by bit to father without fear of consequence in case must run rough after upon honour dear sir think deserve credit for hitting on plan make everything so right straight suit of course wish of party need hardly say that will have facility for seeing margaret under restriction under restriction understand people may talk about visit having got certificate knowing be safe settled sha care for well what do say take time to think if wish only remember have most perfect confidence in honour that act from fatherly feeling for interest of dear girl stopped out of breath from extraordinary volubility of long harangue men more experienced in world mastered by love than be must in position have recognised proposal unfair trial of self restraint perhaps something like unfair humiliation a well others have detected selfish motif suggested mean distrust of honour integrity firmness of purpose implied equally mean anxiety on sherwin part to clench profitable bargain at once for fear might be repented of discerned nothing of a soon a have recovered from natural astonishment of first few moment only saw in strange plan proposed to certainty of assuring matter with what sacrifice what hazard what delay ultimate triumph of love when mr sherwin have ceased speaking replied at once accept condition accept with heart be hardly prepared for so complete so sudden acquiescence in proposal looked absolutely startled by at first soon resuming self possession wily business like self possession started up shook vehemently by hand delighted most delighted dear sir to find how soon understand other that pull together so well must have glass hang really must toast know toast ca help drinking wife have have have there dear dear margaret god bless may consider difficulty finally settled then said anxious to close interview with mr sherwin a speedily a possible decidedly so done double done may say there will be little insurance on life that will ask to effect for dear margaret sake perhaps memorandum of agreement engaging to settle certain proportion of property may become possessed of on child see be looking forward to grandfather day already can wait for future occasion say in day two then presume there will be objection to seeing miss sherwin now none whatever at once if like way dear sir way led across passage into dining room apartment be furnished with le luxury with more bad taste if possible than room have just left near window sat margaret be same window at have seen on evening when wandered into square after meeting in omnibus cage with canary bird hung in same place just noticed with momentary surprise mr sherwin be sitting far away from daughter at other end of room then placed by margaret side be dressed in pale yellow colour gave new splendour to dark complexion magnificently dark hair once more doubt self upbraiding vanished gave place to exquisite sense of happiness glow of joy hope love seemed to rush over heart moment looked at after staying in room about five minute mr sherwin whispered to wife left mr sherwin still kept place said nothing hardly turned to look round at more than once twice perhaps be occupied by own thought perhaps from motive of delicacy abstained even from appearance of watching daughter watching feeling influenced cared not to speculate on be enough that have privilege of speaking to margaret uninterruptedly of declaring love at last without hesitation without reserve how much have to say to how short time seemed to be left that evening to say in how short time to tell thought of past have created in self sacrifice to have cheerfully consented for sake anticipation of future happiness be concentrated in drew very breath of life only from prospect of rewarding love spoke little yet even little be new delight to hear smiled now let take hand made attempt to withdraw evening have closed in darkness be stealing fast upon still dead still figure of mr sherwin always in same place same attitude grew fainter fainter to eye across distance of room thought of time thought of home ever once crossed mind must have sat at window with long night through without idea of numbering hour a passed ere long however mr sherwin entered room again effectually roused by approaching speaking to saw have stayed long enough that be not to be left together again that night so rose took leave having first fixed time for seeing margaret on morrow mr sherwin accompanied with great ceremony to outer door just a be leaving touched on arm said in most confidential tone come hour earlier to morrow will go get licence together objection to eh marriage will say day week just a like know let seem to dictate ah objection to see objection on margaret side will warrant with respect to consent in marrying part of business there be complete mutuality be there good night god bless xii that night went home with none of reluctance apprehension have felt on last occasion when approached own door assurance of success contained in event of afternoon gave trust in own self possession confidence in own capacity to parry dangerous question have not experienced before cared not how soon for how long time might find in company with clara father be well for preservation of secret be in frame of mind for on opening study door be astonished to see of in room clara be measuring one of over crowded book shelf with piece of string be apparently just about to compare length of with vacant space on wall close by when came in seeing stopped looked round significantly at father who be standing near with file of paper in hand may well feel surprised basil at invasion of territory said with peculiar kindness of manner must however apply there to prime minister of household pointing to clara for explanation be only instrument of domestic conspiracy on sister part clara seemed doubtful whether must speak be first time have ever seen expression in face when looked into mine be discovered papa said after momentary silence must explain know always leave a many explanation a can to very well said father smiling task in instance will be easy one be intercepted basil on way to own room by sister taken in here to advise about new set of bookcase for when ought to have be attending to own money matter clara idea be to have have new bookcase made in secret put up a surprise day when be not at home however a have caught in act of measuring space with skill of experienced carpenter impetuosity of arbitrary young lady who rule supreme over everybody further concealment be out of question must make virtue of necessity confess everything poor clara be only return for ten day utter neglect have be half afraid to tell of approached thanked not very gratefully be afraid for felt too confused to speak freely seemed like fatality more evil be doing in secret evil to family tie family principle more good be unconsciously returned to by family through sister hand made objection of course to bookcase plan continued father more room be really wanted for volume on volume that have collected about certainly suggested little delay in execution of project bookcase will at event not be required here for five month to come day week return to country must not repress start of astonishment dismay here be difficulty ought to have provided for have most unaccountably never once thought of although be now period of year at on former occasion have be accustomed to leave london day week too very day fixed by mr sherwin for marriage be afraid sir will not be able to go with clara so soon a propose be wish to remain in time longer said in low voice without venturing to look at sister must not help hearing exclamation a spoke tone in uttered father moved nearer to step two looked in face intently with firm penetrating expression peculiarly characterized seems extraordinary resolution said tone manner altering ominously while spoke thought sudden absence for last two day rather odd plan of remaining in london by be really incomprehensible what can have to do excuse no not excuse let call

on cheek began to appear there for first time stop if must make excuse basil must ask question have secret wish to keep from beg will keep have never be accustomed to treat son a must not treat other

more restless than usual first word a met informed of event in appeared to take deepest interest news dear sir said mr mannion have come back at least two day before expected at first felt inclined to ask who mr mannion be what consequence must possibly be to that have come back immediately afterwards remembered that mr mannion name have be mentioned during first conversation with mr sherwin then recalled to mind description have heard of a confidential clerk a forty year of age a educated man who have made information of use to margaret in keeping up knowledge have acquired at school knew more than about felt curiosity to discover more from mr sherwin margaret sat down a usual with book about there have be something little hurried abrupt in manner of receiving when came in when began to read attention wandered incessantly looked round several time towards door mr sherwin walked about room without intermission except when once paused on restless course to tell that mr mannion be coming that evening that hoped must have objection to be introduced to person who be quite like one of family well enough read to be sure to please great reader like asked rather impatiently who be mr mannion that arrival at employer house must make sensation when whispered something of to margaret smiled rather uneasily said nothing at last bell be rung margaret started little at sound mr sherwin sat down composing into rather elaborate attitude door opened mr mannion came in mr sherwin received clerk with assumed superiority of master in word tone manner flatly contradicted margaret rose hastily then a hastily sat down again while visitor very respectfully took hand made usual inquiry after be introduced to then margaret be sent away to summon mother down stair while be out of room

on particular word without hesitation in choosing term when mr sherwin came down watched conduct towards must not repress slight nervous shrinking when approached placed chair for in answering inquiry after health never once looked at fixed eye time on margaret with sad anxious expression wholly indescribable often recurred to memory after day always looked more le frightened poor thing in husband

man character of element might be composed be character ruled must not see in face detect in word must discover in look manner of employer employer family a now sat at same table with margaret eye avoided countenance much le frequently than eye of parent then rarely looked at in return rarely looked at at except when common courtesy obliged to do so if one have told beforehand must suspend ordinary evening occupation with young wife for sake of observing very man who have interrupted that man only mr sherwin clerk must have laughed at idea yet so be book lay neglected on table neglected by perhaps by margaret too for mr mannion conversation on occasion at least baffled curiosity a completely a face tried to lead to talk just answered be speaking with great respect of manner phrase

ludicrous ignorance of country people mr mannion just set right did more there be not smallest inflection of sarcasm in voice not slightest look of sarcasm in eye while spoke when talked among did not

employer desired bowed again a said then went out followed by mr sherwin who held short colloquy with in hall what have said to only few civil word spoken in very respectful manner there have be nothing in tone nothing in look to give peculiar significance to what uttered still moment back be turned found speculating whether word contained hidden meaning trying to recall something in voice manner might guide in discovering real sense attached to what said seemed a if most powerful whet to curiosity be supplied by own experience of impossibility of penetrating beneath unassailable surface man presented to questioned margaret about must not tell more than knew already have always be very kind useful be clever man must talk great deal sometimes when chose have taught more of foreign language foreign literature in month than have learned at school in year while be telling hardly noticed that spoke in very hurried manner busied in arranging book work lay on table attention be more closely directed to mr sherwin to surprise saw eagerly lean forward while margaret be speaking fix eye on daughter with look of penetrating scrutiny of must never have supposed person usually so feeble unenergetic to be capable thought of transferring to questioning on subject of mr mannion at moment husband entered room addressed for further enlightenment to aha cried mr sherwin rubbing

far more earnestness attention than have ever seen display before even languid faculty seemed susceptible of active curiosity on subject of mr mannion more so perhaps from very dislike of margaret have moved chair into background while father be talking be apparently little interested in topic under discussion in first interval of silence complained of headache asked leave to retire to room after left took departure for mr sherwin evidently have nothing more to tell about clerk be worth hearing on way home mr mannion occupied small share of thought idea of trying to penetrate mystery connected with be idea pleased there be promise of future excitement in of ordinary kind determined to have little private conversation with margaret about to make ally in new project if there really have be romance connected with mr mannion early life if strange striking face of be indeed sealed book contained secret story what triumph pleasure if margaret must succeed in discovering together when woke next morning must hardly believe that tradesman clerk have so interested curiosity that have actually shared thought with young wife during evening before yet when next saw produced exactly same impression on again iii week passed away margaret resumed usual employment amusement life at north villa ran on a smoothly obscurely a usual still remained ignorant of mr mannion history mr mannion character came frequently to house in evening be generally closeted with mr sherwin seldom accepted employer constant invitation to to join party in drawing room at rare interval when did see appearance behaviour be exactly same a on night when have met for first time spoke just a seldom resisted just a resolutely respectfully many attempt made on part to lead into conversation familiarity if have really be trying to excite interest must not have succeeded more effectually felt towards much a man feel in labyrinth when fresh failure in gaining centre only produce fresh obstinacy in renewing effort to arrive at from margaret gained sympathy for newly aroused curiosity appeared much to surprise to care little about mr mannion always changed conversation if related to whenever depended upon to continue topic not mr sherwin conduct be far from resembling daughter when spoke to on same subject always listened intently to what said answer be invariably brief confused sometimes absolutely incomprehensible be only after great difficulty induced to confess dislike of mr mannion whence proceeded must never tell did suspect anything in answering question always stammered trembled looked away from how must suspect anything if did suspect must be very wrong without good reason ought not to suspect did not of course never obtained reply from more intelligible than attributing confusion to nervous agitation more le affected when spoke on subject soon ceased making effort to induce to explain determined to search for clue to mr mannion character without seeking assistance from one accident at length gave opportunity of knowing something of habit opinion so far therefore of knowing something about man one night met in hall at north villa about to leave house

examining apartment more in detail to study appearance of man dwelling room be very often nearly equivalent to studying own character personal contrast between mr sherwin clerk be remarkable enough contrast between dimension furnishing of room lived in be to full a extraordinary apartment now surveyed be le than size of sitting room at north villa paper on wall be of dark red curtain be of same

be of plainest neatest order even white china tea pot tea cup on table have pattern colouring of kind what contrast be room to drawing room at north villa on return mr mannion found looking at tea equipage be afraid sir must confess epicure prodigal in two thing said epicure in tea prodigal at least for person in situation in book however receive liberal salary can satisfy taste such a be save money too what can offer sir seeing preparation on table asked for tea while be speaking to there be one peculiarity about observed almost men when stand on own hearth in own home instinctively alter

dreg into basin of fresh water on leaf middle aged female servant neat quiet came up took away tray bringing to again with tea pot tea cup clean empty to receive fresh infusion from fresh leaf be trifle to notice thought of other tradesman clerk who be drinking gin water jovially at home at tavern found mr mannion more exasperating mystery to than ever conversation between turned at first on trivial subject be ill sustained on part there be peculiarity in present position made thoughtful once talk ceased altogether just at moment storm began to rise to height hail mingled with rain rattled heavily against window thunder bursting louder louder with successive peal seemed to shake house to foundation a listened to fearful crashing roaring seemed to fill whole measureless void of upper air then looked round on calm dead calm face of man beside without one human emotion of kind even faintly pictured on felt strange unutterable sensation creeping over silence grew oppressive sinister began to wish hardly knew why for third person in room for somebody else to look at to speak to be first to resume conversation must have imagined impossible for man in midst of such thunder a now raged above head to think talk of anything storm yet when spoke be merely on subject connected with introduction to at north villa attention seemed a far from being attracted impressed by mighty elemental tumult without a if tranquillity of night be uninvaded by slightest murmur of sound may inquire sir began whether be right in apprehending that conduct towards since first met at mr sherwin house may have appeared strange even discourteous in eye in what respect mr mannion asked little startled by abruptness of question be perfectly sensible sir that have kindly set example on many occasion in trying to better acquaintance when such advance be made by one in station to one in mine ought to be immediately gratefully responded to why did pause be about to tell have discovered that advance sprang from curiosity to know more about than be willing to reveal waited for to proceed have only failed continued in courtesy gratitude have right to expect from because knowing how be situated with mr sherwin daughter thought intrusion on part while be with young lady might not be so acceptable a sir in kindness be willing to lead to believe let assure answered relieved to find unsuspected really impressed by delicacy let assure that fully appreciate consideration have shown just a last word passed lip thunder pealed awfully over house said more sound silenced a explanation have satisfied sir went on clear deliberate utterance rising discordantly audible above long retiring roll of last burst of thunder may feel justified in speaking on subject of present position in employer house with freedom mean if may say so without offence with freedom of friend begged must use freedom wished feeling really desirous that must do so apart from purpose of leading to talk unreservedly on chance of hearing talk of profound respect of manner phrase have hitherto testified observed by man of age to man of mine made feel ill at ease be most probably equal in acquirement have manner taste of gentleman might have birth too for aught knew to contrary difference between be only in worldly position have not enough of father pride of caste to think that difference alone made right that man whose year nearly doubled mine whose knowledge perhaps surpassed mine must speak to a mr mannion have spoken up to time may tell then resumed that while be anxious to commit untimely intrusion on hour at north villa be at same time desirous of being something more than merely inoffensive towards must wish to be positively useful a far a can in opinion mr sherwin have held to rather hard engagement be trying discretion little too severely think at year in situation feeling thus be sincere wish to render what connection influence have with family useful in making probation have still to pas through a easy a possible have more mean of doing sir than might at first imagine offer took little by surprise felt with sort of shame that candour warmth of feeling be what have not expected from attention insensibly wandered away from storm to attach more more closely to a went on be perfectly sensible resumed that proposition a now make to proceeding from one little better than stranger may cause surprise even suspicion at first can only explain by asking to remember have known young lady since childhood that having assisted in forming mind developing character feel towards almost a second father be therefore naturally interested in gentleman who have chosen for wife be there tremor at last in changeless voice a spoke thought so looked anxiously to catch answering gleam of expression might now for first time be softening iron feature animating blank stillness of countenance if such expression have be visible be too late to detect just a looked at stooped down to poke fire when turned towards again face be same impenetrable face eye same hard steady inexpressive eye a before besides continued man must have object in life for sympathy to be employed on have wife child near relation to think of have nothing routine of business in day book here by lonely fireside at night life be not much be made for little more than former pupil at north villa be pupil no longer ca help feeling that must be object in existence for to occupy with happiness yours to have two young people in heyday of youth first love looking towards occasionally for promotion of of pleasure matter how trifling will seem odd incomprehensible to if be of age sir in position must understand be possible that must speak thus without voice faltering eye softening in slightest degree yes looked at listened to intently here be not faintest change in face tone there be nothing to show outwardly whether felt what said whether did not word have painted picture of forlornness on mind have mechanically half raised hand to take while be addressing sight of when ceased checked impulse almost a soon a be formed did not appear to have noticed involuntary gesture immediate repression went on speaking have said perhaps more than ought resumed if have not succeeded in making understand explanation a must wish will change subject not return to again until have known for much longer time on account change subject mr mannion said unwilling to let be implied must not put trust in be deeply sensible of kindness of offer interest take in margaret will be sure accept good office stopped storm have decreased little in violence attention be now struck by wind have risen a thunder rain have partially lulled how drearily be moaning down street seemed at moment to be wailing over to be wailing over to be wailing over mortal thing strange sensation then felt moved to listen in silence checked spoke again if have not answered a must continued must attribute partly to storm confess rather discomposes idea partly to little surprise very foolish surprise own that must still be able to feel so strong sympathy with interest be generally only considered of importance to young be only in sympathy that men of year can do live youth over again said may be surprised to hear tradesman clerk talk in manner be not always what be now have gathered knowledge suffered in gathering have grown old before time forty year be like fifty of other men heart beat quicker be unasked about to disclose mystery evidently hung over early life no dropped subject at once when continued longed to ask to resume must not feared same repulse mr sherwin have received remained silent what be proceeded matter little question be what can do for aid can give may be poor enough may be of use notwithstanding for instance other day if mistake not be little hurt at mr sherwin taking daughter to party to family have be invited be very natural must not be there to watch over in real character without disclosing secret must be kept safe must not know what young men might meet who must imagine to be miss sherwin still must regulate conduct accordingly now think might be of use here have influence perhaps in strict truth ought to say great influence with employer if wished must use influence to back yours in inducing to forego for future intention of taking daughter into society except when desire again think be not wrong in assuming that infinitely prefer company of mr sherwin to of mr sherwin during interview with young lady how have found that out at rate be right told so candidly preference be on many account very natural one said if suffered to appear to mr sherwin might for obvious reason produce most unfavourable effect might interfere in matter however without suspicion must have many opportunity of keeping away from room in evening must use if wished more than that if wanted longer more frequent communication with north villa than now enjoy might be able to effect also mention what must do in in other matter in disparagement sir of influence have with mr sherwin in own right because know in what concern intercourse with daughter employer have asked will ask advice from habit of doing so in other thing have hitherto declined giving advice in affair will give in favour young lady if choose thanked not in such warm term a must have employed if have seen even faintest smile on face have heard change in steady deliberate tone a spoke while word attracted immovable look repelled in spite of must again beg proceeded to remember what have already said in estimate of motif of offer if still appear to be interfering officiously in affair have only to think have presumed impertinently on freedom have allowed to treat no longer on term of to night will not complain of conduct will try hard not to consider unjust to if do appeal a be not to be resisted answered at once unreservedly what right have to draw bad inference from man face voice manner merely because impressed a out of common did know how much share influence of natural infirmity outward trace of unknown sorrow suffering might have have in producing external peculiarity have struck must have right to upbraid a unjust that in strongest term unless spoke out fairly in reply be quite incapable mr mannion said of viewing offer with other than grateful feeling will find will prove by employing good office for margaret in perfect faith sooner perhaps than may imagine bowed said few cordial word heard imperfectly for a addressed blast of wind fiercer than usual rushed down street shaking window shutter violently a passed dying away in low melancholy dirging swell like spirit cry of lamentation despair when spoke again after momentary silence be to make change in conversation talked of margaret dwelling in term of high praise rather on moral than on personal quality spoke of mr sherwin referring to solid attractive point in character have not detected what said of mr sherwin appeared to be equally dictated by compassion respect even hinted at coolness towards considerately attributing to involuntary caprice of settled nervousness ill health language in touching on subject be just a unaffected just a devoid of peculiarity a have hitherto found when occupied by other topic be growing late thunder still rumbled at long interval with dull distant sound wind showed symptom of subsiding pattering of rain against window ceased to be audible there be little excuse for staying longer wished to find none have acquired quite knowledge enough of mr mannion to assure that attempt on part at extracting from in spite of reserve secret might be connected with early life must prove perfectly fruitless if must judge at must judge by experience of present not by history of past have heard good good only of from shrewd master who knew best have tried longest have shown greatest delicacy towards feeling strongest desire to do service must be mean return for act of courtesy to let curiosity tempt to pry into private affair rose to go made effort to detain after unbarring shutter looking out of window simply remarked that rain have almost entirely ceased that umbrella must be quite sufficient protection against remained followed into passage to light out a turned round upon door step to thank for hospitality to bid good night thought came across that manner must have appeared cold repelling to especially when be offering service to acceptance if have really produced impression be inferior in station must be cruel to leave tried to set right at parting let assure again said that will not be fault if margaret thankfully employ good office a good office of well wisher friend lightning be still in sky though only appeared at long interval strangely enough at moment when addressed flash came seemed to pas right over face gave hideously livid hue spectral look of ghastliness distortion to feature that absolutely seemed to be glaring grinning on like fiend in one instant of duration for moment required knowledge of settled calmness of countenance to convince that eye must have be only dazzled by optical illusion produced by lightning when darkness have come again bade good night first mechanically repeating what have just said almost in same word walked home thoughtful night have given much matter to think of iv about time of introduction to mr mannion to speak more correctly before after period certain peculiarity in margaret character conduct came to knowledge by pure accident gave little uneasiness even little displeasure of feeling lasted very long be true for incident gave rise to be of trifling nature in while now write however domestic occurrence be vividly present to recollection will mention two of a instance subsequent event yet to be related will show that be not out of place at part of narrative one lovely autumn morning called rather before appointed time at north villa a servant opened front garden gate idea occurred to of giving margaret surprise by entering drawing room unexpectedly with nosegay gathered for from own flower bed telling servant not to announce went round to back garden by gate opened into at side of house progress of flower gathering led on to lawn under one of drawing room window be left little open voice of wife mother reached from room be part of conversation unintentionally overheard tell mamma must will have dress whether papa chooses not be spoken loudly resolutely in such tone a have never heard from margaret before pray pray dear talk so answered weak faltering voice of mr sherwin know have have more than year allowance of dress already wo be allowanced sister be allowanced why must be dear love surely there be difference be sure there be now be wife will ride day in carriage just a sister doe give way in everything so ought be margaret if must do anything be sure must really must ask papa for new dress after having given so many year already be way always be with mamma ca do ca do that be so excessively tiresome will have dress be determined say sister wear light blue crape of evening will have light blue crape too see if will get somehow from shop papa never take notice be sure what have on need find out anything about what be gone out of shop until 'take stock ' whatever be call then if fly into one of passion dear dear really ought not to talk so of papa be very wrong margaret indeed what must mr basil say if heard determined to go in at once tell margaret have heard resolving at same time to exert firmness remonstrate with for own good on much of what have said have really surprised displeased on unexpected entrance mr sherwin started looked more timid than ever margaret however came forward to meet with wonted smile held out hand with wonted grace said nothing until have got into accustomed corner be talking together in whisper a usual then began remonstrance very tenderly in lowest possible tone took precisely right way to stop in full career in spite of resolution beautiful eye filled with tear directly first have ever seen in caused too by what have said murmured few plaintive word about cruelty of being angry with for only wanting to please by being dressed a sister be upset intention have formed moment before involuntarily devoted to soothing for rest of morning need say how matter ended never mentioned subject more made present of new dress week after little home breeze have just related have died away into perfect calm be accidentally witness of domestic dilemma in margaret bore principal share on occasion a walked up to house in morning again found front door open pail be on step servant have evidently be washing have be interrupted in work have forgotten to close door when left nature of interruption soon discovered a entered hall for god sake miss cried housemaid voice from dining room for god sake put down poker missus will be here directly be cat will kill vile brute will kill hateful cat care whose be poor dear dear dear bird voice be margaret at first tone be tone of fury be afterwards broken by hysterical sob poor thing continued servant soothingly be sorry for for too miss oh do please to remember be left cage on table in cat reach hold tongue wretch how dare hold let go oh must must indeed be missus cat recollect poor missus who be always ill have got nothing else to amuse care cat have killed bird cat will be killed for doing will will will will call in first boy from street to catch hang let go will go will let cat go first miss a sure a name next instant door be suddenly opened pus sprang past out of harm way closely followed by servant who stared breathless aghast at seeing in hall went into dining room immediately on floor lay bird cage with poor canary dead inside be same canary have seen wife playing with on evening of day when first met bird head have be nearly dragged through bent wire of cage by murderous claw of cat near fire place with poker have just dropped on floor by side stood margaret never have seen look so beautiful a now appeared in fury of passion possessed large black eye be flashing grandly through tear blood be glowing crimson in cheek lip be parted a gasped for breath one of hand be clenched rested on mantel piece other be pressed tight over bosom with finger convulsively clasping dress grieved a be at paroxysm of passion into have allowed to be betrayed must not repress involuntary feeling of admiration when eye first rested on even anger looked lovely in lovely face never moved when saw a approached dropped down on knee by cage sobbing with frightful violence pouring forth perfect torrent of ejaculation of vengeance against cat mr sherwin came down by total want of tact presence of mind made matter worse in brief scene ended by fit of hysteric to speak to margaret on day a wished to speak to be impossible to approach subject of canary death afterwards be useless if only hinted in gentlest way with strongest sympathy for loss of bird at distress astonishment have caused by extremity to have allowed passion to hurry burst of tear be sure to be only reply just reply of others be best calculated to silence if have be husband in fact a well a in name if have be father brother friend must have let first emotion have way then have expostulated with afterwards be lover still to eye margaret tear made virtue even of margaret fault such occurrence a happening at rare interval formed only interruption to generally even happy tenour of intercourse week week glided away not hasty hard word passed between after one preliminary difference have be adjusted did subsequent disagreement take place between mr sherwin last element in domestic tranquillity of north villa be however le attributable to forbearance to mine than to private interference of mr mannion for day after interview with managing clerk at own house have abstained from calling offered service into requisition be not conscious of reason for course of conduct have be said have happened during night of storm have produced powerful though vague impression on strange a may appear must not determine whether brief extraordinary experience of new friend have attracted towards repelled from felt unwillingness to lay under obligation to be not result of pride false delicacy sullenness suspicion be inexplicable unwillingness sprang from fear of encountering heavy responsibility of what nature must not imagine delayed held back by instinct on side mr mannion made further advance maintained same manner continued same habit during intercourse with family at north villa have observed a characterising before took shelter from storm in house never referred again to conversation of evening when now met margaret behaviour when mentioned to mr mannion willingness to be useful to rather increased than diminished vague uncertainty perplexed on subject of accepting rejecting overture must not induce to show smallest interest about house personal appearance peculiar habit secrecy in relation to early life nothing in short connected with appeared to excite attention curiosity in slightest degree on evening of return from continent have certainly shown symptom of interest in arrival at north villa appearance of attention to when joined party now seemed completely incomprehensibly changed on point manner became almost petulant if persisted long in making mr mannion topic of conversation be a if resented sharing thought with in slightest degree a to difficult question whether must engage in interest not be matter always seemed to think too trifling to be discussed between at ere long however circumstance decided a to course must take with mr mannion ball be given by one of mr sherwin rich commercial friend to announced intention of taking margaret besides jealousy felt naturally enough in peculiar situation at idea of wife going out a miss sherwin dancing in character of young unmarried lady with young gentleman who be introduced to have also strongest possible desire to keep margaret out of society of own class until year probation be over must hope to instal permanently in society of class have privately mentioned to idea on subject found that fully agreed with be not wanting in ambition to ascend to highest degree in social scale have already begun to look with indifference on society be offered to by in own rank to mr sherwin must confide nothing of must only object generally to taking out when desired declared that liked party that girl did that only pretended to dislike to please that have made engagement to keep moping at home whole year on account in case of particular ball now under discussion be determined to have own way bluntly told a much irritated by obstinacy gross want of consideration for defenceless position forgot doubt scruple privately applied to mr mannion to exert influence have promised to use if wished in behalf result be a immediate a be conclusive very next evening mr sherwin came to with note have just written informed that be excuse for margaret non appearance at ball never mentioned mr mannion name sulkily shortly said that have reconsidered matter have altered first decision for reason of own having once taken first step in new direction soon followed up without hesitation by taking many others whenever wished to call oftener than once day at north villa have to tell mr mannion next morning found permission immediately accorded to by ruling power same secret machinery enabled to regulate mr sherwin incoming outgoings just a chose when margaret be together in evening must feel almost certain now of never having one with mr sherwin unless desired a may be easily imagined be seldom enough new ally ready interference for advantage be exerted quietly easily a matter of course never knew how when influenced employer mr sherwin on part never breathed word of influence to accorded extra privilege might demand a if acted entirely under own will little suspecting how well knew what be real motive power directed be more easily reconciled to employing service of mr mannion by great delicacy with performed did not allow to think did not appear to think that be obliging in smallest degree affected sudden intimacy with manner never altered still persisted in not joining in evening at express invitation if referred in way to advantage derived from devotion to interest always replied in brief undemonstrative way that considered favoured person in being permitted to make service of use to

passed away in spite of kind word look there be something in face depressed seemed thinner constitutional paleness be more marked than usual care anxiety have evidently oppressed her be cause of dinner that evening proceeded very heavily gloomily father only talked on general commonplace topic a if mere acquaintance have be present when sister left too quitted room to see one who have arrived on business have heart for company of wine bottle so followed clara at first only spoke of occupation since have be in country be unwilling forbore to touch on long stay in london on father evident displeasure at protracted absence there be little restraint between have courage to break through before long however accident trifling enough in obliged to be more candid enabled to speak unreservedly on subject nearest to heart be seated opposite to clara at fire place be playing with favourite dog have followed into room while be stooping towards animal locket containing of margaret hair fell out of place in waistcoat swung towards sister by string attached round neck instantly hid again not before clara with woman quickness have detected trinket a something new drawn right

be keeping from how glad be when see new locket drop out of brother waistcoat continued observing be too confused to speak when find colouring very deeply hiding again in great hurry must be true woman if did not make own discovery begin to talk about directly made effort very poor one to laugh thing off expression grew serious thoughtful while still fixed eye on took hand gently whispered in ear be going to be married basil will love new sister almost a much a love at moment servant came in with tea interruption gave minute for consideration must tell impulse answered yes reflection if disclosed real situation knew that must introduce clara to margaret must necessitate taking privately to mr sherwin house exposing to humiliating term of dependence prohibition on lived with own wife strange medley of feeling in pride be uppermost forbade to do then again to involve sister in secret must be to involve with in consequence might be produced by disclosure to father mere idea of making partaker in responsibility alone ought to bear be not to be entertained for moment a soon a be left together again said to will not think worse of clara if leave to draw own conclusion from what have seen only asking to keep strict silence on subject to one ca speak yet love a wish to speak will know why day say that reserve be right in meantime can be satisfied with assurance when time come for making secret known will be first to know first put trust in a have not starved curiosity altogether said clara smiling have given little hope to feed on for present think woman though be can promise wish seriously basil continued that telltale locket of yours have so pleasantly brightened very gloomy thought of mine about can now live happily on expectation without once mentioning secret again till give leave to do so here father entered room said more manner towards have not altered since dinner remained same during week of stay at hall one morning when be alone took courage determined to try dangerous ground little with view towards guidance for future have sooner begun by reference to stay in london apology for than stopped at once told said gravely coldly month ago

suffered at instant under base necessity of concealment might have confessed everything must have pitied though might not have forgiven be first last attempt at venturing towards revelation of secret to father by hint half admission a to boldly confessing persuaded into sophistical conviction that course must do good might do much harm when wedded happiness have already waited for be to wait for still through so many month came at last be not best to enjoy married life in convenient secrecy a long a must best to abstain from disclosing secret to father until necessity absolutely obliged circumstance absolutely invited to do so inclination conveniently decided question in affirmative decision of kind right wrong be enough to tranquillise at time so far a father be concerned journey to country did good might have returned to london day after arrival at hall without altering opinion of stayed whole week nevertheless for clara sake in spite of pleasure afforded by sister society visit be painful one selfish longing to be back with margaret must not wholly repress father coldness winter gloom rain confined almost incessantly within door tended in different degree to prevent living at ease in hall besides cause of embarrassment have additional mortification of feeling for first time a stranger in own home nothing in house looked to what used to look in former year room old servant walk view domestic animal appeared to have altered to have lost something since have seen last particular room have once be fond of occupying be favourite no longer particular habit have hitherto always practised in country must only succeed in resuming by effort vexed fretted be a if life have run into new channel since last autumn winter at hall now refused to flow back at bidding into old course home seemed home no longer except in name a soon a week be over father parted exactly a have met when took leave of clara refrained from making allusion to shortness of stay merely said that must soon meet again in london evidently saw that visit have weighed little on spirit be determined to give to short farewell a happy hopeful character a possible now thoroughly understood other be consolation on leaving immediately on return to london repaired to north villa nothing be told have happened in absence remarked change in margaret looked pale nervous be more silent than have ever known to be before when met accounted for in answer to inquiry by saying confinement to house in consequence of raw wintry weather have little affected then changed subject in other

mannion well returned found ill surely be something have taken place in absence though said that nothing have happened trifling illness seemed to be little regarded at north villa perhaps because serious illness be perpetually present there in person of mr sherwin vi about six week after have left hall father clara returned to london for season be not intention to delay over life at home at north villa during spring summer must be merely to repeat much of what have be already related be better to proceed at once to closing period of probation to period tax resolution severely to write of at few week more of toil at narrative penance of poor task work will be over imagine then that final day of long year of expectation have arrived that on morrow margaret for whose sake have sacrificed suffered so much be at last really to be mine on eve of great change in life be now to take place relative position in different person with whom be associated stood towards other may be sketched thus

principle of honour ruled with stern influence of fanaticism thought on pride of caste so unobtrusive so rarely hinted at in word yet so firmly rooted in nature so intricately entwined with one of emotion aspiration simplest feeling idea thought on almost feminine delicacy in shrinking from barest mention of impurity other men must carelessly discus must laugh over a good material for after dinner jest thought over when remembered that be to man must confess infamous marriage have contracted in secret hope from fatherly affection deserted idea of appealing to chivalrous generosity became

escaped question about name reference by paying week rent in advance then found left in possession of one little room must be resigned to look on for future perhaps for long future a home home dear mournful remembrance be revived in reflection suggested by simple word through darkness thickened over mind there now passed one faint ray of light gave promise of morning light of calm face have last looked on when be resting on father breast clara parting word to when have unclasped from neck kind arm must fain have held to home for ever have expressed promise be yet unfulfilled trembled a now

of weakness strength of passive of active nature saw how little have changed since time knew a never knew before how miserably be altered shame grief of banishment from home came back on at sight of friendly familiar face struggled hard to keep self possession tried to bid welcome cheerfully effort be too much for turned away head a took hand for old school boy feeling of not letting ralph see be

cigar settle more comfortably on bed then proceeded have be ill luck to see father pretty seriously offended on more than one occasion never saw so very quiet so very dangerous a last night when be telling about remember well enough how spoke looked when caught putting away trout fly in page of family history of be nothing to see hear then to what be now can tell basil if believed in what poetical people call broken heart must be almost afraid that be broken hearted saw be use to say word for just yet so sat quiet listened to till got dismissal for evening next proceeding be to go up

there look shocked let have done with marriage get on well made girl wife then innocently consented to very queer condition of waiting year for virtuous behaviour again suppose at end of time turn away head basil may be scamp be not blackguard enough to make joke in presence out of of part of story will pas over altogether if like only ask question two see father must not must not speak plainly of worst part of business know well enough to know why somebody must be little explicit can hing about man found scoundrel out did get within arm length of told brother of struggle with mannion in square heard almost with former schoolboy delight when have succeeded to satisfaction in feat of strength activity jumped off bed seized hand in strong grasp face radiant eye sparkling shake hand

have to offer made offer to then circumstance happened rendered incapable of thinking of intended to go there again to day if money must bribe to silence save family from sharing dishonour have fallen on to abandon to only money have of own little income left by mother do mean to say that only resource be in wretched trifle that ever really intend to let go start in world without rap do mean to say that father gave up without making smallest provision for in mess a hang do justice have be hard enough on know ca have coolly turned over to ruin in way offered money at parting with such word of contempt insult must have died rather than take told that unaided by purse must preserve preserve family from infamous consequence of calamity though sacrificed own happiness own honour for ever in doing go to day to make sacrifice loss of little have to depend on be least part of may not see injustice in doubting till too late will see beg pardon basil be almost a great insanity a insanity of marriage honour independence of principle dear fellow while be to fore will take good care that ruin gratuitously for sake of principle just listen to now in first place remember that what father said to said in moment of violent exasperation have be trampling pride of life in mud man like that father least of a for offer of poor little morsel of income to stop people greedy mouth be quarter enough

might be dying dead for aught knew when reached house ran to window to call back be too late ralph be gone even if be admitted at north villa must succeed be little capable of estimating chance unexpectedness of visit strange mixture of sympathy levity in manner of worldly wisdom boyish folly in conversation appeared to be still confusing in absence just a have confused in presence thought imperceptibly wandered away from ralph mission have undertaken on behalf to subject seemed destined for future to steal on attention irresistibly darkly in lonely hour already fatality denounced against in mannion letter have begun to act already terrible confession of past misery crime monstrous declaration of enmity be to last with lasting of life began to exercise numbing influence on faculty to cast blighting shadow over heart opened letter again re read threat against at conclusion one by one question now arose in mind how can resist how escape vengeance of evil spirit how shun dread deformity of face be to appear before in secret how silence that fiend tongue make harmless poison will pour drop by drop into life when must first look for avenging presence now not till month hence where must first see in house in street at what time must steal to side by night by day must show letter to ralph must be useless what must avail advice assistance reckless courage must give against enemy who combined ferocious vigilance of savage with far sighted iniquity of civilised man a last thought crossed mind hastily closed letter determining ala how vainly never to open again almost at same instant heard knock at house door must ralph have returned already impossible besides knock be very different from be only just loud enough to be audible where now sat mannion must come thus openly fairly in broad daylight through populous street light quick step ascended stair heart bounded started to foot be same step used to listen for love to hear in illness ran to door opened instinct have not deceived be sister basil exclaimed before must speak have ralph be here yes love yes where have gone what have done for promised have kept promise nobly clara be away helping now thank god thank god sank breathless into chair a spoke pang of looking at at moment seeing how be changed seeing dimness weariness of gentle eye fear sorrow have already overshadowed bright young face will be better directly said guessing from expression what then felt seeing in strange place after what happened yesterday having come here so secretly in terror of father finding out ca help feeling altered position mine little painfully at first wo complain a long a can get here sometimes to see will only think of future now what mercy what happiness be that ralph have come back have always done injustice be far kinder far better than ever thought basil how worn ill be looking have not told ralph everything be in danger none clara none indeed grieve too deeply about yesterday try forget horrible parting brought about have not spoken of since except to tell must never know more of fault misfortune than little very little know already have resolved not to think about a well a not to ask about for future have hope already basil very very far off fulfilment still hope can not think what be hope be far off fulfilment indeed clara if be hope from father hush say so know better something occurred even so soon a last night very trifling event enough to show that think of already in grief far more than in anger wish must believe love remembrance of yesterday trust remembrance recall will tell occurred time after have gone after have recovered little in own room went downstairs again to see father for be too terrified too miserable at what have happened to be alone be not in room when got there a looked round for moment saw piece of page in book about family scattered on floor miniature likeness of when be child be lying among other fragment have be torn out of setting in paper not injured picked up basil put on table at place where always sits laid own little locket with hair in by side so that might know that miniature have not be accidentally taken up put there by servant then gathered together piece of page took away with thinking better that must not see again just a have got through door lead into library be about to close heard other door by enter study from hall opening came in went directly to table back be towards so must look at unperceived observed miniature directly stood quite still with in hand then sighed sighed so bitterly then took portrait of dear mother from one of drawer of table opened case in be kept put miniature inside very gently tenderly must not trust to see more so went up to room again shortly afterwards came in with locket gave back only saying left on table clara if have seen face then must have hoped thing from in time to come a hope now a will hope clara though be from stronger motive than gratitude to before left home proceeded after moment silence thought of loneliness in strange place knowing must seldom come to see then only by stealth by committing fault if father found out wo speak of thought of lonely hour here have brought with old forgotten companion of yours to bear company to keep from thinking too constantly on what have suffered look basil wo welcome old friend again gave small roll of manuscript with effort to resume kind smile of former day even while tear stood thick in eye untied leaf glanced at handwriting saw before once more first few chapter of unfinished romance again looked on patiently laboured page familiar relic of earliest best ambition have abandoned for love too faithful record of tranquil ennobling pleasure have lost for ever oh for one thought flower now from dream garden of happy past took more care of leaf of writing after have thrown aside than of anything else have said clara always thought time must come when must return again to occupation be once greatest pleasure to pursue greatest pleasure to watch surely that time have arrived be certain basil book will help to wait patiently for happier time a nothing else can place must seem very strange lonely sight of page sight of sometimes when can come may make look almost like home to room be not not very stopped suddenly saw lip tremble eye grow dim again a looked round when tried to speak gratitude felt turned away quickly began to busy in re arranging wretched furniture in setting in order glaring ornament on chimney piece in hiding hole in ragged window curtain in changing a far a must all tawdry discomfort of one miserable little room be still absorbed in occupation when church clock of neighbourhood struck hour hour warned to stay no longer must go said be later than thought be afraid about getting home old martha came here with be waiting downstairs to go back know can trust write to a often a can will hear about day from ralph must like letter sometimes a well be a hopeful a patient dear under misfortune a wish to be will despair of nothing tell ralph have be here might be angry will come again first opportunity good bye basil let try part happily in hope of better day good bye dear good bye only for present self possession nearly failed a kissed then turned to door just signed to not to follow down stair without looking round again hurried from room be well for preservation of secret that have so resolutely refrained from delaying departure have be gone for few minute lovely consoling influence of presence be still fresh in heart be still looking sadly over once precious page of manuscript have restored to when ralph returned from north villa heard leaping rather than running up ricketty wooden stair burst into room more impetuously than ever right said jumping back to former place on bed can buy mr shopkeeper for anything like for nothing at if choose to be stingy innocent daughter have made best of confession just at right time basil boy have left father house what do mean have eloped to hospital mannion yes mannion have got letter to be criminated by even past father contradiction doe stick at trifle will begin at beginning tell everything hang basil look a if 'd brought bad news instead of good never mind how look ralph pray go on well first thing heard on getting to house be that sherwin wife be dying servant took in name thought of course must be admitted such thing be let in at once first word fellow sherwin said to be that wife be only ill that servant be exaggerating that be quite ready to hear what mr basil 'highly respected ' brother fancy calling 'highly respected ' have to say to fool however a see be cunning enough to try civility to begin with more ill looking human mongrel never set eye on took measure of man directly in two minute told exactly what came for without softening single word how did answer a anticipated by beginning to bluster immediately took down just a swore second oath beir said very politely 'if mean to make cursing swearing conference of think only fair to inform before hand that be likely to get worst of when whole collection of british oath be exhausted can swear fluently in five foreign language have always made principle to pay back abuse at compound interest exaggerate in saying that be quite capable of swearing out of sens if persist in setting example now if like to go on pray do be ready to hear ' while be speaking stared at in state of helpless astonishment when have done began to bluster again be pompous dignified parliamentary sort of bluster now

man whose fever have turned to typhus be same bed near bed rest of sentence be lost to a walked away after talking together in whisper for few moment rejoined mr bernard be explaining different theory of infection to ralph notion said be infection be taken through lung one breath inhaled from infected atmosphere hanging immediately around diseased person generally extending about foot from being enough to communicate malady to breather provided there exists at time in individual exposed to catch malady constitutional predisposition to infection predisposition know to be greatly increased by mental agitation bodily weakness in case have be talking of looked at chance of infection non infection may be equally balanced at rate can predict nothing about at stage of discovery will write moment hear anything said ralph shaking hand with very moment have brother address safe in pocket separated ralph be unusually silent serious on way back took leave of at door of lodging very abruptly without referring again to visit to hospital week passed away heard nothing from mr bernard during interval saw little of brother be occupied in moving into new house towards latter part of week came to inform that be about to leave london for few day father have asked to go to family house in country on business connected with local management of estate ralph still retained old dislike of steward account lawyer consultation felt bound out of gratitude for father special kindness to since return to england to put constraint on own inclination go to country a be desired did not expect to be absent more than two three day earnestly charged to write to if have news from hospital while be away during week clara came twice to see escaping from home by stealth a before on occasion showed same affectionate anxiety to set example of cheerfulness to sustain in hope saw with sorrow apprehension must not altogether conceal from that weary look in face have never changed never diminished since have first observed ralph have from motif of delicacy avoided increasing hidden anxiety be too evidently preying upon health by keeping in perfect ignorance of visit to hospital indeed of particular of proceeding since return took care to preserve same secrecy during short interview with bade farewell after third visit with sadness vainly endeavoured to hide little thought then that tone of sweet clear voice have fallen on ear for last time before wandered to far west of england where now write at end of week be on saturday remember left lodging early in morning to go into country with intention of returning before evening have felt sense of oppression on rising be almost unendurable perspiration stood thick on forehead though day be not unusually hot air of london grew harder harder to breathe with minute heart felt tightened to bursting temple throbbed with fever fury very life seemed to depend on escaping into pure air into place where there be shade from tree water ran cool refreshing to look on so set forth careless in what direction went remained in country day evening be changing into night a got back to london inquired of servant at lodging when let in whether letter have arrived for answered that one have come just after have gone out in morning that be lying on table first glance at showed mr bernard name written in corner of envelope eagerly opened letter read word private friday dear sir on enclosed slip of paper will find address of young woman of whom brother spoke to when met at hospital regret to say that circumstance under have obtained information of residence be of most melancholy nature plan arranged for discovering abode in accordance with brother suggestion proved useless young woman never came to hospital second time address be given to morning by turner who begged must visit professionally a have confidence in medical man who be then in attendance on many circumstance combined to make compliance with request anything easy desirable knowing that brother ought perhaps rather to say be interested in young woman determined to take very earliest opportunity of seeing consulting with medical attendant must not get to till late in afternoon when arrived found suffering from one of worst attack of typhus ever remember to have seen think duty to state candidly that believe life to be in imminent danger at same time be right to inform that gentleman in attendance on doe not share opinion still think there be good chance of saving there can be doubt whatever that be infected with typhus at hospital may remember telling how agitation appeared to have deprived of self possession when entered ward how ran to wrong bed before nurse must stop man whom thus mistook for turner be suffering from fever have not then specifically declared did so declare a typhus fever on morning when brother came to hospital man disorder must have be infectious when young woman stooped down close over under impression that be person have come to see although started back at once on discovering mistake have breathed infection into system mental agitation at time accompanied a have since understood by physical weakness rendering specially liable to danger to have accidentally exposed since first symptom of disease appeared on saturday last can not find that error have be committed in medical treatment a reported to remained time by bedside to day observing delirium be more le invariable result of typhus be particularly marked in case manifest by speech gesture have be found impossible to quiet by mean hitherto tried while be watching by never ceased calling on name entreating to see be informed by medical attendant that wandering have almost invariably taken direction for last four twenty hour occasionally mix other name with yours mention in term of abhorrence persistency in calling for presence be so remarkable that be tempted merely from what have heard to suggest that really must go to on bare chance that might exercise tranquillising influence at same time if fear infection for private reason into have right wish to inquire feel unwilling to take course have pointed out by mean consider duty to accede to proposal can conscientiously assure that duty be not involved in have however suggestion to make be of positive nature be sure will meet with approval be that parent of other relation if parent be not alive must be informed of situation possibly may know something of connection can therefore do good office be dying in strange place among people who avoid a must avoid pestilence even though be only to bury relation ought to be immediately summoned to bed side will visit twice to morrow in morning at night if be not willing to risk seeing repeat that be in sense

sight started looked round candle have placed at opposite end of room have burnt down without noticing be now expiring in socket ran to light fresh candle lay on table by side be too late wick flickered last room be left in darkness while felt among different object under hand for box of match margaret voice strengthened again innocent innocent heard cry mournfully through darkness will

stopped of must not tell why be there change in room be there more air in a if door have be opened be there something moving over floor have margaret left bed no mournful voice be speaking unintermittingly speaking from same distance moved to search for match on chest of drawer stood near window though morning be at darkest house stood midway between two gas lamp there be glimmering of light in place looked back into room from window thought saw something shadowy moving near bed take away heard margaret scream in wildest tone hand be on be feeling face to feel if be dead ran to striking against piece of furniture in darkness something passed swiftly between bed a got near thought heard door close then there be silence for moment then a stretched out hand right hand encountered little table placed by margaret side next moment felt match box have be left on a struck light voice repeated close at ear hand be on be feeling face to feel if be dead match flared up a carried to candle looked round noticed for first time that there be second door at further corner of room lighted inner apartment through glass pane at top when tried door be locked on inside room beyond be dark dark silent be one there hidden in darkness silence be there doubt now that stealthy foot have approached margaret that stealthy hand have touched while room be in obscurity doubt there be none on point none on other suspicion shaped into conviction in instant identified stranger who have passed in darkness between bedside with man whose presence have dreaded a presence of evil spirit in chamber of death be waiting secretly in house waiting for last moment listening for last word watching opportunity perhaps to enter room again openly profane by presence placed by door resolved if approached to thrust back at hazard from bedside how long remained absorbed in watching before darkness of inner room know not time must have elapsed before silence around forced suddenly on attention turned towards margaret in instant previous thought be suspended in mind by sight now met eye have altered completely hand so restless hitherto lay quite still over coverlid lip never moved whole expression of face have changed fever trace remained on feature yet fever look be gone eye be almost closed quick breathing have grown calm slow touched pulse be beating with wayward fluttering gentleness what did striking alteration indicate recovery be possible a idea crossed mind one of faculty became absorbed in sole occupation of watching face must not have stirred instant from bed for world earliest dawn of day be glimmering faintly at window before change appeared before drew long sighing breath slowly opened eye on mine first look be very strange startling to behold for be look be natural to calm look of consciousness restored to what have always be in past time lasted only for moment recognised instantly expression of anguish shame flew over first terror surprise of face struggled vainly to lift hand so busy through night so idle now faint moan of supplication breathed from lip slowly turned head on pillow so a to hide face from sight oh god god murmured in low wailing tone have broken heart still come here to be kind to be worse than death be too bad to be forgiven leave leave oh basil leave to die spoke to desisted almost immediately desisted even from uttering name at mere sound of voice suffering rose to agony wild despair of soul wrestling awfully with writhing weakness of body uttered in word cry horrible beyond imagination to hear sank down on knee by bedside strength have sustained for hour gave way in instant burst into passion of tear a spirit poured from lip in supplication for hers tear did not humiliate for knew while shed have forgiven dawn brightened gradually a fair light of new day flowed in lovely upon bed a fresh morning breeze lifted tenderly playfully scattered lock of hair that lay over pillow so calmness began to come back to voice stillness of repose to limb never turned face to again never when wild word of despair grew fewer fainter never when last faint supplication to to leave to die forsaken a deserved ended mournfully in long moaning gasp for breath waited after waited long time then spoke to softly then waited once more hearing still breathe slowly more slowly with minute then spoke to for second time louder than before never answered never moved be sleeping must not tell influence seemed to hold back from going to other side of bed to look at face a lay away from almost hidden in pillow light strengthened faster grew mellow with clear beauty of morning sunshine heard sound of rapid footstep advancing along street stopped under window voice recognized called by name looked out mr bernard have returned at last must not get back sooner said case be desperate be afraid to leave will find key on chimney piece throw out to can let in told not to bolt door before went out obeyed direction when entered room thought margaret moved little signed to with hand to make noise looked towards bed without appearance of surprise asked in whisper when change have come over how

sitting to speak to to risk misery to of of saying farewell be more than dared trust to do must only stand silent look at might be for last time until tear gathered in eye so must see nothing more resisted temptation to dash away while still hid from while must not see again if must turned from garden view left square amid thought thronged on a walked farther farther away from neighbourhood of what be once home amid remembrance of past event from first day when met margaret sherwin to day when stood by grave be recalled by mere act of leaving london there now arose in mind for first time doubt from day to have never left doubt whether mannion might not be tracking in secret along step of way stopped instinctively looked behind many figure be moving in distance figure have seen in churchyard be nowhere visible among little further on looked back again still with same result after let longer interval elapse before stopped then for third time turned round scanned busy street scene behind with eager suspicious eye little distance back on opposite side of way caught sight of man who be standing still a be standing amid moving throng height be like mannion height wore cloak like cloak have seen on mannion when approached at margaret grave more than must not detect without crossing over passing vehicle foot passenger constantly intercepted view from position in stood be figure thus visible only by interval figure of mannion be really tracking step a suspicion strengthened in mind that be so remembrance of threat in churchyard may shield behind family friend will strike at through dearest bravest of suddenly recurred to brought with thought urged instantly to proceed on way never looked behind again a now walked on for said within if be following must not will not avoid will be best result of departure that will draw after that destroying presence thus at least remove far safely away from family home so neither turned aside from straight direction hurried

perplexed afresh waited day after day when be first installed in cottage to see letter sent to letter arrived to see friend join friend came deepened mystery to eye began to recall to memory old cornish legend of solitary secret people who have lived year year ago in certain part of county coming none knew whence existing none knew by what mean dying disappearing none knew when felt half inclined to identify with mysterious visitor to consider a being stranger to whole human family who have come to waste away under curse die ominously secretly among even person to whom first paid

ceaseless roaring of sea on right hand be purpose to get to penzance by night beyond have project thought of what refuge must seek next hope might have formerly felt of escaping from mannion have now deserted for ever must not discover by outward indication that be still following footstep mist obscured object behind from view ceaseless crashing of shore wave overwhelmed landward sound never doubted for moment that be watching a proceeded along onward way walked slowly keeping from edge of precipice only by keeping sound of sea always at same distance from ear knowing be advancing in proper direction though very circuitously a long a heard wave on right hand to have ventured on shorter way by moor cross road beyond must have be only to have lost past chance of extrication in mist in tedious manner have gone on for time before struck that noise of sea be altering completely to sense of hearing seemed to be sounding very strangely on side of on right hand on left stopped strained eye to look through mist be useless crag only few yard off seemed like shadow in thick white vapour again went on little ere long heard rolling towards a be under own foot under roaring of sea howling hollow intermittent sound like thunder at distance stopped again rested against rock after time mist began to part to seaward remained still a thick a ever on side of went on towards lighter sky in front thunder sound booming louder louder in very heart a seemed of great cliff mist brightened yet little more showed landmark to ship standing on highest point of surrounding rock climbed to recognised glaring red white pattern in be painted knew that have wandered in mist away from regular line of coast out on one of great granite promontory project into sea a natural breakwater on southern shore of cornwall have twice penetrated a far a place at earlier period of sojourn in fishing hamlet while now listened to thunder sound knew from what cause proceeded beyond spot where stood rock descended suddenly almost perpendicularly to range below in one of highest part of wall side of granite thus formed there opened black yawning hole slanted nearly straight downwards like tunnel to unknown unfathomable depth below into wave found entrance through subterranean channel even at calm time sea be never silent in frightful abyss on stormy day fury be terrific wild wave boiled thundered in imprisonment till seemed to convulse solid cliff about like earthquake high a leapt up in rocky wall of chasm never leapt into sight from above nothing cloud of spray indicated to eye what must be horrible tumult of raging water below with recognition of place to have now wandered came remembrance of danger have left behind on rock track led from mainland to promontory danger of narrow ledge treacherous precipice have passed safely while unconscious of in mist shrank from tempting again now that recollected until sky have cleared must see way well before atmosphere be still brightening slowly over tossing distant wave determined to wait until have lost obscurity before ventured to retrace step moved down towards lower range of rock to seek le exposed position than now occupied a neared chasm terrific howling of wave inside be violent enough to drown not only crashing sound of surf on outward crag of promontory even shrill cry of hundred on hundred of sea bird whirled around except when flight be immediately over head at side of abyss rock though very precipitous afforded firm hold for hand foot a descended morbid longing to look on danger have led many man to very brink of precipice even while dreaded led to advance a near a durst to side of great hole to gaze down into must see little of black shining interior wall of fragment of rock here there jutted out from crowned with patch of long lank sea weed waving slowly to fro in empty space must see little of thing for spray from bellowing water in invisible depth below steamed up almost incessantly like smoke shot hissing in cloud out of mouth of chasm on to huge flat rock covered with sea weed that lay beneath in front of very sight of smooth slippery plane of granite shelving steeply downward right into gaping depth of hole made head swim thundering of water bewildered deafened moved away while have power away thirty forty yard in lateral direction towards edge of promontory looked down on sea here rock rose again in wild shape forming natural cavern penthouse towards one of now advanced to shelter till sky have cleared have just entered place close to edge of cliff when hand be laid suddenly firmly on arm through crashing of wave below thundering of water in abyss behind shrieking of seabird overhead heard word spoken close to ear take care of life be not to throw away be mine turned saw mannion standing by shade concealed hideous distortion of face eye be on a pointed significantly down to surf foaming two hundred foot beneath suicide said slowly suspected time followed close followed to fight with death must have a moved back from edge of precipice shook from marked vacancy glared even through glaring triumph of eye remembered how have be warned against at hospital mist be thickening again thickening now in cloud parted changed minute by minute under influence of light behind have noticed sudden transition before knew to be sign preceded speedy clearing of atmosphere when looked up at sky mannion stepped back few pace pointed in direction of fishing hamlet from have departed even in remote place said among ignorant people deformed face have borne witness against margaret death have be avenged a said must have be expelled a pest curse by community of poor fisherman have begun to live life of excommunication a lived mine

go have limb endurance to go too tell again be linked together for life can not leave if must horrible joy of hunting through world leap in blood like fire look look out on tossing wave there be rest for there will be rest for sight of standing close by in wild solitude hoarse sound of voice a raised almost to raving in exultation over helplessness incessant crashing of sea on outer rock roaring of tortured water imprisoned in depth of abyss behind obscurity of mist strange wild shape began to take a now rolled almost over head saw that heard seemed suddenly to madden a mannion uttered last word brain felt turned to fire heart to ice horrible temptation to rid for ever of wretch before by hurling over precipice at foot seized on felt hand stretching out towards without willing if have waited instant must have dashed to destruction turned back in time reckless of danger fled from sight of over rugged perilous surface of cliff shock of fall among rock before have advanced more than few yard partly restored self possession still dared not look back to see if mannion be following so long a precipice behind be within view began to climb to higher range of rock almost at same spot by have descended from judging by close thunder of water in chasm halfway up stopped at broad resting place found that must proceed little to right to left in horizontal direction before must easily get higher at moment mist be slowly brightening again looked first to left to see where must get good foothold then to right towards outer side of riven rock close at hand at same instant caught sight dimly of figure of mannion moving shadow like below beyond skirting farther edge of slippery plane of granite shelved into gaping mouth of hole brightening atmosphere showed that have risked in mist too near to dangerous place stopped looked up saw watching raised hand shook threateningly in air ill calculated violence of action in making that menacing gesture destroyed equilibrium staggered tried to recover swayed half round where stood then fell heavily backward right on to steep shelving rock wet sea weed slipped through finger a madly clutched at struggled frantically to throw towards side of declivity slipping further further down at effort close to mouth of abyss sprang up a if have be shot tremendous jet of spray hissed out upon at same moment heard scream so shrill so horribly unlike human cry that seemed to silence very thundering of water spray fell for one instant saw two livid bloody hand tossed up against black wall of hole a dropped into then wave roared again fiercely in hidden depth spray flew out once more when cleared off nothing be to be seen at yawning mouth of chasm nothing moved over shelving granite torn particle of sea weed sliding slowly downwards in running ooze shock of sight must have paralysed within power of remembering what followed for can recall nothing after looking on emptiness of rock below except crouched on ledge under foot to save from falling off that there be interval of oblivion seemed to awaken again a be to thundering of water in abyss when rose looked around seaward sky be lovely in clearness foam of leaping
